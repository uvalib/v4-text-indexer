      <field name="fulltext">To David Hunter1 Oct. 24, 1861 Washington, Oct. 24, 1861 Sir: The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you, I propose to offer you a few suggestions, knowing how hazzardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities &amp; passing events. It is intended therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment &amp; discretion. The main rebel army (Prices)2 west of the Mississippi, is believed to have passed Dade county, in full retreat upon North-Western Arkansas, leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the South-East of the State. Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desireable, as you are not likely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements, that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia, and the other Rolla, the present termini of Railroads; then recruit the condition of both corps, by re-establishing, and improving, their discipline and instruction; perfecting their clothing and equipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters. Of course both Railroads must be guarded, and kept open, judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this. From these two points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in judicious co-operation with Lane on the Kansas border, it would be so easy to concentrate, and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri from the South-West, that it is not probable any such attempt to return will be made before, or during, the approaching cold weather. Before spring the people of Missouri will be in no favorable mood to renew, for next year, the troubles which have so much afflicted, and impoverished them during this. If you adopt this line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus of force, which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others, as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means of re-inforcing these main points, if occasion requires. Doubtless local uprisings, for a time, will continue to occur; but these can be met by detachments, and local forces of our own, and will, ere long, tire out of themselves. While, as stated at the beginning of this letter, a large discretion must be, and is, left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price, or an attempt, by this long and circuitous route, to reach Memphis, will be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it. Your Obt. Servt. A. LINCOLN. To the Commander of the Department of the West. Footnotes 1 ALS, CSmH; ADf (fragment), DLC-RTL. The fragment in the Lincoln Papers is a portion of Lincoln's first draft beginning "on the Kansas border"and ending with the last words ("tire out of themselves") in the next to last paragraph. Although Lincoln's letter to Curtis (supra) indicates that this letter to Hunter, as well as General Orders No. 18, was to be enclosed, it seems evident that Lincoln decided to withhold it a few days, and in fact enclosed it in another letter to Curtis on October 28 (q.v. infra). Lincoln's suggestions to Hunter originated in the War Department. A preliminary draft (DNA WR RG 94, Adjutant General, Letters Received, P 943) bearing Winfield Scott's endorsement ("It is hoped the President will modify freely the within. W.S.") is as follows: "To Major Genl. Hunter, U.S. Volunteers. Washington, Oct. 24, 1861. "Sir: The command of the Department of the West, having, for a time, devolved upon you, I propose to offer you a few suggestions, knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines &amp; operations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities &amp; of passing events. It is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgement &amp; discretion. "The main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi, is believed to have passed Cedar county, in full retreat upon Southern Kansas &amp; the Indian country, leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the South-East of the State. Assuming this basis, it seems desirable, as you are not likely to overtake Price, that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army; divide it into two corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia &amp; the other Rolla, the termini of rail roads; then recruit both corps, &amp; re-establish their discipline &amp; instruction. As you will probably, have a surplus of force after guarding those important points, that surplus would be disposable for other points---say the South Eastern part of the State &amp;c. &amp;c. "It is particularly expected of you to look into the many reported extravagancies &amp; abuses, in public money &amp; property, in your Department, to arrest any officer on evidence of probable guilt, &amp; to dismiss other faulty agents." 2 Major General Sterling Price, ex-governor of Missouri (1853-1857).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Caleb B. Smith1 October 24, 1861 October 24, 1861 The within letter of the Secretary of the Navy, is written concerning the proposed contract with my indorsement thereon which is herewith inclosed. After it was written a promise was obtained from me that I would submit it to the Secretary of the Interior, asking him, if he could spare the time, to form a definite opinion whether such a contract can legally, and ought to be made. Oct. 24, 1861. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 AES, DNA FI RG 56, General Records, Treasury Department, Series AB, 1861, Letters from Executive Officers, II, 5a. Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back of a letter from Gideon Welles, August 29, 1861, in which the secretary states he has not "the time necessary to investigate the subject of the proposed Chiriqui contract. . . . if any contract is to be made, it should be by some other officer than myself. . . ."The presence of this letter among the records of the Treasury Department arises from the fact of its later referral there. Chase wrote Lincoln on November 12, "I have given the Chiriqui business all the consideration I could today; and am much impressed by the prospects it offers. . . . At present I am not prepared for a conclusion; but as soon as I return from New York I will give it special attention. . . ."(DLC-RTL). Francis P. Blair, Sr., seems also to have been called upon for an opinion, for in a lengthy and favorable report Blair recommended that Henry T. Blow, U.S. minister to Venezuela, be sent to Chiriqui to examine the premises for the government (F. P. Blair, Sr., to Lincoln, November 16, 1861, ibid.). Although the Blairs went so far as to prepare an order assigning Captain Ambrose Thompson (son of Ambrose W. Thompson, who headed the Chiriqui Improvement Company) as military escort for Henry T. Blow and an order detaching a vessel from the fleet for the purpose of conveying him (Francis P. Blair, Jr., to Montgomery Blair [December, 1861?] ibid.), Lincoln seems not to have followed their recommendations. The Chiriqui project was held in abeyance until April, 1862.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Simon Cameron1 October 25, 1861 October 25, 1861 I have no doubt that the gentlemen named within, are true and faithful; and that their mission of charity is most worthy, and praiseworthy. A. LINCOLN Oct. 25. 1861. Footnotes 1 AES, IHi. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter from General John E. Wool, October 23, 1861, introducing Reverend Marble N. Taylor and Chaplain T. W. Conway "on an errand of charity and humanity."Below Lincoln's endorsement Cameron wrote "I heartily approve the mission of these gentlemen. SIMON CAMERON."There is no further record of the mission, but Chaplain Conway and Reverend Taylor (a Methodist minister and Virginian by birth, who was declared provisional governor of North Carolina by the Hatteras Convention on November 18, 1861) were active in organizing Unionists in North Carolina. See Lincoln to George Bancroft, November 18, infra.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Memorandum: Letter of Samuel T. Glover2 I have not had time to read this. Please read &amp; return it. Oct. 25. 1861 A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 AES, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back of an eight-page letter from Samuel T. Glover, October 19, 1861, giving advice on problems confronting the government. To whom Lincoln referred the letter is not known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recommendation for a Pass1 October 25, 1861 October 25, 1861 The loyalty of Mr. Larrabee, as seen within, is vouched by Gov. Hicks.

      <field name="fulltext">Order Retiring Winfield Scott from Command2 November 1, 1861. Executive Mansion, Washington, November 1, 1861. On the 1st day of November, A.D. 1861, upon his own application to the President of the United States, Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott is ordered to be placed, and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired officers of the Army of the United States, without reduction in his current pay, subsistence, or allowances. The American people will hear with sadness and deep emotion that General Scott has withdrawn from the active control of the army, while the President and a unanimous Cabinet express their own and the nation's sympathy in his personal affliction and their profound sense of the important public services rendered by him to his country during his long and brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully distinguished his faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union, and the Flag, when assailed by parricidal rebellion.3 ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Footnotes 2 AGO General Orders No. 94, November 1, 1861. General Scott's retirement had been delayed since August 9, by the president's request. Although Scott's physical infirmity was the reason given the public for his retirement, McClellan had long been in disagreement with his superior, and on August 8 wrote him a letter which Scott deemed an insult. Scott's letter to Cameron of August 9, indicated the nub of dissension as follows: "McClellan has propagated, in high quarters, the idea expressed in the letter before me, that Washington was not only `insecure,' but in `imminent danger' . . . . I am confident in the opposite opinion. . . . Accordingly I must beg the President. . . to allow me to be placed on the officers' retired list. . . ."(DLC-RTL). On August 10, Lincoln asked McClellan to withdraw his critical letter and requested Scott to withdraw his resignation. Scott wrote to Cameron, August 12, that he still wished to resign because of his conviction that McClellan intended to maintain an attitude of insubordination: "The original offence given to me by. . . McClellan. . . seems to have been the result of deliberation between him &amp; some of the members of the cabinet, by whom all the greater war questions are to be settled---without report to, or consultation with, me. . . ."(DLC-RTL). 3 A preliminary draft of this paragraph, in the handwriting of Salmon P. Chase, is as follows: "The President avails himself of this occasion to express to Lieutenant General Scott his profound sense of the important services rendered by him to his country during his long and brilliant career; among which a grateful people will ever especially distinguish his faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union &amp; the Flag, when assailed by parricidal rebellion."(DLC-RTL).</field>

Gamble, under direction of resolutions passed by a Missouri convention on October 31, 1861, went to Washington to present his plan of co-operation between state and federal authority in Missouri. Although dated at the Executive Mansion, November 5, presumably the draft of Gamble's plan had been previously prepared. The text of the plan approved is as follows: "Executive Mansion, Washington, November 5, 1861. "The Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the Convention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States that he will raise a military force, to serve within the State as State militia during the war there, to co-operate with the troops in the service of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and suppressing rebellion therein; the said State Militia to be embodied and to be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and governed according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles of War; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except for the immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to co-operate with the troops in the service of the United States in military operations within the State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of the State Militia act with officers in the service of the United States of the same grade, the officers of the United States service shall command the combined force; the State Militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall be actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance with Regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued from time to time. "In order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with the pay of unnecessary officers, the Governor proposes that, although the State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a quarter-master-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the Government of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the quarter-master general, and inspector-general, their services being necessary in the relations which would exist between the State Militia and the United States. The Governor further proposes that, while he is allowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-camp to the Governor at his discretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to the United States for payment. He also proposes that the State Militia shall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of brigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four regiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed for regimental, brigade, and division duties than is provided for in the act of Congress of the 22d July, 1861, and that whatever be the rank of such officers as fixed by the law of the State the compensation that they shall receive from the United States shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by said act of Congress to officers in the United States service performing the same duties. "The field officers of a regiment in the State militia are 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, and 1 major, and the company officers are a captain, a first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant. "The Governor proposes that, as the money to be disbursed is the money of the United States, such staff officers in the service of the United States as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the State Militia shall be assigned by the War Department for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present duty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the State Militia as the President of the United States may designate. Such regulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to insure regularity of returns and to protect the United States from any fraudulent practices, shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the State Militia. "The above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and the Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the Ordnance, Quartermaster, Commissary, Pay, and Medical Departments to carry this agreement into effect. He will cause the necessary staff officers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in connection with the Missouri State Militia, and will order them to make the necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this agreement. All requisitions upon the different officers of the United States under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for the Missouri State Militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in the service of the United States, and the Secretary of War will cause any additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity and economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and communicated to the Governor of Missouri for the government of the Missouri State Militia."(Ibid., pp. 454-56).</field>

That pleasure was enhanced by the information which preceded your arrival here, that his Majesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission upon the grounds of your derivation from an ancestral stock, identified with the most glorious era in your country's noble history, and your own eminent social and political standing in Sweden. This country, Sir, maintains, and means to maintain, the rights of human nature and the capacity of man for self-government. The history of Sweden proves that this is the faith of the people of Sweden, as we know that it is the faith and practice of their respected Sovereign.

You have had a battle, and without being able to judge as to the precise measure of its value, I think it is safe to say that you, and all with you have done honor to yourselves and the flag and service to the country. Most gratefully do I thank you and them. In my present position, I must care for the whole nation; but I hope it will be no injustice to any other state, for me to indulge a little home pride, that Illinois does not disappoint us. I have just closed a long interview with Mr. Washburne in which he has detailed the many difficulties you, and those with you labor under. Be assured, we do not forget or neglect you. Much, very much, goes undone: but it is because we have not the power to do it faster than we do. Some of your forces are without arms, but the same is true here, and at every other place where we have considerable bodies of troops. The plain matter-of-fact is, our good people have rushed to the rescue of the Government, faster than the government can find arms to put into their hands. It would be agreeable to each division of the army to know its own precise destination: but the Government cannot immediately, nor inflexibly at any time, determine as to all; nor if determined, can it tell its friends without at the same time telling its enemies. We know you do all as wisely and well as you can; and you will not be deceived if you conclude the same is true of us. Please give my respects and thanks to all Yours very truly A LINCOLN.

      <field name="fulltext">Reply to Delegation of Baltimore Citizens1 November 15, 1861 November 15, 1861 GENTLEMEN: I thank you for the address you have presented to me in behalf of the people of Baltimore. I have deplored the calamities which the sympathies of some misguided citizens of Maryland had brought down upon that patriotic and heretofore flourishing State. The prosperity of Baltimore up to the 19th of April last, was one of the wonders produced by the American Union. He who strangles himself, for whatever motive, is not more unreasonable than were those citizens of Baltimore who, in a single night, destroyed the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad, and the railroad from Baltimore to Philadelphia. From the day when that mad transaction occurred, the Government of the United States has been diligently engaged in endeavoring to restore those great avenues to their former usefulness, and, at the same time, to save Baltimore and Maryland from the danger of complete ruin through an unnecessary and unnatural rebellion. I congratulate you upon the declaration which the people of Baltimore and Maryland have made in the recent election, of their recent approbation of the Federal Government, and of their enduring loyalty to the Union. I regard the results of these elections as auspicious of returning loyalty throughout all the insurrectionary States. Your wishes for a fair participation by the mechanics and laboring men of Baltimore in the benefits of supplying the Government with materials and provisions are reasonable and just. They have deserved that participation. Loyalty has involved them in some danger, and has demanded of them some sacrifices. Their wishes, as you have communicated them, shall be referred to the proper Departments, and I am sure that every member of the Administration will cheerfully lend his aid to carry them out so far as it can be done consistently with the prudence and economy which ought always to regulate the public service. Footnotes 1 New York Tribune, November 16, 1861. A delegation of prominent citizens of Baltimore presented an address lamenting the suspension of trade and manufacture and the resulting unemployment and suffering which "has brought famine to their doors, and aroused the most gloomy forebodings of the approaching Winter; but amid all their sufferings the patriotism of the industrial classes has been proof against the insidious arguments of those who sought to involve them in hostility to the Government. . . ."</field>

The closing paragraph of Bancroft's letter is as follows: "Your administration has fallen upon times, which will be remembered as long as human events find a record.

And provided also that said State may make provision of apprenticeship, not to extend beyond the age of twenty-one years for males, nor eighteen for females, for all minors whose mothers were not free, at the respective births of such minors. [No. 2] Be it enacted by the State of Delaware that on condition the United States of America will, at the present session of Congress, engage by law to pay, and thereafter faithfully pay to the said State of Delaware, in the six per cent bonds of said United States, the sum of seven hundred and nineteen thousand, and two hundred dollars, in thirty one1 equal annual instalments, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, at any time after the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety three,2 within the said State of Delaware, except in the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted; nor, except in the punishment of crime as aforesaid, shall any person who shall be born after the passage of this act, nor any person above the age of thirty five years, be held in slavery, or to involuntary servitude, within said State of Delaware, at any time after the passage of this act. And be it further enacted that said State shall, in good faith prevent, so far as possible, the carrying of any person out of said state, into involuntary servitude, beyond the limits of said State, at any time after the passage of this act. And be it further enacted that said State may make provision of apprenticeship, not to extend beyond the age of twentyone years for males, nor eighteen for females, for all minors whose mothers were not free at the respective births of such minors. On reflection, I like No. 2 the better. By it the Nation would pay the State $ 23,200 per annum for thirtyone years--- and All born after the passage of the act would be born free--- and All slaves above the age of 35 years would become free on the passage of the act--- and All others would become free on arriving at the age of 35 years, until January 1893--- when All remaining of all ages would become free, subject to apprenticeship for minors born of slave mothers, up to the respective ages of 21 and 18. If the State would desire to have the money sooner, let the bill be altered only in fixing the time of final emancipation earlier, and making the annual instalments correspondingly fewer in number, by which they would also be correspondingly larger in amount. For instance, strike out "1893,"and insert "1872"; and strike out "thirtyone"annual instalments, and insert "ten"annual instalments. The instalments would then be $ 71,920 instead of $ 23,200 as now. In all other particulars let the bill stand precisely as it is. Footnotes 1 AD, CSmH.

December 1, 1861] If it were determined to make a forward movement of the Army of the Potomac, without awaiting further increase of numbers, or better drill &amp; discipline, how long would it require to actually get in motion?2 After leaving all that would be necessary, how many troops could join the movement from South-West of the river?3 How many from North-East of it?4 Suppose, then, that of those South-West of the river 50,0005 move forward and menace the enemy at Centerville. The remainder of the moveable force on that side move rapidly to the crossing of the Ocoquan by the road from Alexandria towards Richmond; there to be joined by the whole moveable force from North-East of the river, having landed from the Potomac just below the mouth of the Ocoquan, moved by land up the South side of that stream to the crossing point named; then the whole move together, by the road thence to Brentsville, and beyond, to the railroad just South of it's crossing of Broad Run, a strong detachment of cavalry having gone rapidly ahead to destroy the railroad bridges South and North of the point. If the crossing of the Ocoquan by those from above be resisted, those landing from the Potomac below to take the resisting force of the enemy in rear; or, if the landing from the Potomac be resisted, those c[r]ossing the Ocoquan from above to take that resisting force in rear.

      <field name="fulltext">Annual Message to Congress2 December 3, 1861 December 3, 1861 Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health, and most abundant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious domestic division, is exposed to disrespect abroad; and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations, thus tempted to interfere, are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency, and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country, in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely, and selfishly, for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including, especially, the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear, as yet, not to have seen their way to their object more directly, or clearly, through the destruction, than through the preservation, of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily, and easily, by aiding to crush this rebellion, than by giving encouragement to it. The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably, saw from the first, that it was the Union which made as well our foreign, as our domestic, commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty; and that one strong nation promises more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce, than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states, because whatever might be their wishes, or dispositions, the integrity of our country, and the stability of our government, mainly depend, not upon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted1 . I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence, and liberality towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation; and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defences on every side. While, under this general recommendation, provision for defending our sea-coast line readily occurs to the mind, I also, in the same connexion, ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at well selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defence and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report, 1 upon the same general subject. I deem it of Importance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee and western North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky, and other faithful parts of the Union, by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such road, as speedily as possible. Kentucky, no doubt, will co-operate, and, through her legislature, make the most judicious selection of a line. The northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad; and whether the route shall be from Lexington, or Nicholasville, to the Cumberland Gap; or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville; or on some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the general government co-operating, the work can be completed in a very short time; and when done, it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future. Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration. Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed all obstructions from the way of this humane reform, except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic Majesty's minister accredited to this government, and the Secretary of State, relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June last, by the United States steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade.1 As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right, as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention. I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3rd of March, 1859. 2 If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal, over the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that Empire. By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance only.3 For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Charge d'affaires near each of those new states. It is [sic] does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable commercial treaties with them.1 The operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in their country's faith, and zeal for their country's deliverance from present peril, have induced them to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action. The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year ending on the 30th June, 1861, was eighty six million, eight hundred and thirty five thousand, nine hundred dollars, and twenty seven cents, ($86,835,900.27,) and the expenditures for the same period, including payments on account of the public debt, were eighty four million, five hundred and seventy eight thousand, eight hundred and thirty four dollars and forty seven cents, ($84,578,834.47;) leaving a balance in the treasury, on the 1st July, of two million, two hundred and fifty seven thousand, sixty five dollars and eighty cents, ($2,257,065.80.) For the first quarter of the financial year, ending on the 30th September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance of first of July, were2 $102,532,509.27, and the expenses $98,239,733.09; leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of $4,292,776.18. Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year, and for the financial year 1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to sustain it till Peace and Union shall again bless the land. I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the service intrusted to his care.1 It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion, and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army. The recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis, is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress. The large addition to the regular army, in connexion with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy. By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the dates respectively named and stated, in a schedule, containing also the form of the letter, marked A, and herewith transmitted.2 These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated, at the times respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals, as well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Navy3 presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy which have characterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions, by construction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced. Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown. I would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional grades in the service. The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the efficiency of the navy. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court---two by the decease of Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt; so that if successors were appointed in the same localities, they could not now serve upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men there, probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the south on the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer to the north one which has heretofore been in the south, would not, with reference to territory and population, be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his circuit grew into an empire---altogether too large for any one judge to give the courts therein more than a nominal attendance---rising in population from one million four hundred and seventy-thousand and eighteen, in 1830, to six million one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and five, in 1860. Besides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was1 at all intended, the system requires that all the States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by supreme judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon, have never had any such courts. Nor can this well be remedied without a change of the system; because the adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country, with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it be one, will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful, or they are not useful. If useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State should have them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished as to all. Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event. Then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest. Or, secondly, let the supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties, and circuit judges provided for all the circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent Supreme Court. 1 I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the organization of the government, Congress has enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is. It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity of its language. This, well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them, in a more accessible and intelligible form, the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be revised and re-written, so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most, two volumes) of ordinary and convenient size. And I respectfully recommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and, if my suggestion be approved, to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed.1 One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression, in many places, of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those States, the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts nor officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States; and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims. Some have estimated it as high as two hundred million dollars, due, in large part, from insurgents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are, even now, making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government. Under these circumstances, I have been urgently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed---the collection of the debts---was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress I suppose are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under the control of this government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms. This, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same, between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims, in their nature belong to the judicial1 department; besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress, will be more than usually engaged, for some time to come, with great national questions. It was intended, by the organization of the court of claims, mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress; but while the court has proved to be an effective, and valuable means of investigation, it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation, for want of power to make its judgments final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final, may not properly be given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary.2 I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General, the following being a summary statement of the condition of the department: The3 revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30. 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000) for the transportation of "free mail matter,"was nine million, forty nine thousand, two hundred and nin[e]ty six dollars and forty cents ($9,049,296.40) being about two per cent. less than the revenue for 1860. The expenditures were thirteen million, six hundred and six thousand, seven hundred and fifty nine dollars and eleven cents. ($13,606,759.11) showing a decrease of more than eight per cent. as compared with those of the previous year, and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of four million, five hundred and fifty seven thousand, four hundred and sixty two dollars and seventy one cents ($4,557,462.71.) The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase of four per cent. on that of 1861, making eight million, six hundred and eighty three thousand dollars ($8,683,000) to which should be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter, viz: seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000.) making nine million, three hundred and eighty three thousand dollars, ($9,383,000.) The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,145,000, to be supplied from the treasury, in addition to the permanent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac river, at the time of establishing the capital here, was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the District, and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof, through negotiations with the State of Virginia.1 The report of the Secretary of the Interior,2 with the accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that department. The depressing influences of the insurrection have been especially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country, and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service, have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the northwest. The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about $100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self sustaining. The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the government, are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls. The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the United States appointed since the 4th. of March for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as a military force, and are attached to the army of the insurgents. Although the government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing a wish for the presence of federal troops to protect them. It is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the federal forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations, and resume their former relations to the government. Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has, not a department, nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from the government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage.1 Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized. The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade, has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic, have been recently attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned.1 Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade, and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver, have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offence under our laws, the punishment of which is death.2 The Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the federal officers arrived there. The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the legislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I commend their interests and defence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress. I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress, that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government. At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject,---a subject at once so interesting in itself, and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan, or system, has been devised, and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.3 Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled "An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,"approved August, 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited; and numbers of the latter, thus liberated, are already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the general government, be at once deemed free; and that, in any event, steps be taken for colonizing both classes, (or the one first mentioned, if the other shall not be brought into existence,) at some place, or places, in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too,---whether the free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.1 To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object; for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population. On this whole proposition,---including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity---that, without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated? The war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the late session, for closing those ports.1 So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending, I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence, all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable. The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration, and the message to Congress at the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract, to or from, the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more distinct now; and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line; and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point. This, however, was soon settled definitely and on the right side. South of the line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up, within her limits; and we were many days, at one time, without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now, her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union, by a larger majority, and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate, or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly, and, I think, unchangeably, ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet; and I believe cannot again be overrun by the insurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field, for the Union; while, of their citizens, certainly not more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful whereabouts, and doubtful existence, are in arms against it. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country. An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating the narrow peninsular region, constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as eastern shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms; and the people there have renewed their allegiance to, and accepted the protection of, the old flag. This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac, or east of the Chesapeake. Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points, on the southern coast, of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island, near Savannah, and Ship Island; and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements, in behalf of the Union, in North Carolina and Tennessee. These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily and certainly southward. Since your last adjournment, Lieutenant General Scott has retired from the head of the army. During his long life, the nation has not been unmindful of his merit; yet, on calling to mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in our history, when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I cannot but think we are still his debtors. I submit, therefore, for your consideration, what further mark of recognition is due to him, and to ourselves, as a grateful people. With the retirement of General Scott came the executive duty of appointing, in his stead, a general-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country was there, so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General McClellan for the position; and in this the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of General McClellan is therefore in considerable degree, the selection of the Country as well as of the Executive; and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him, the confidence, and cordial support thus, by fair implication, promised, and without which, he cannot, with so full efficiency, serve the country. It has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones; and the saying is true, if taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones, at variance, and cross-purposes with each other. And the same is true, in all joint operations wherein those engaged, can have none but a common end in view, and can differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea, no one on board can wish the ship to sink; and yet, not unfrequently, all go down together, because too many will direct, and no single mind can be allowed to control. It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government---the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgement of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of the people in government, is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people. In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connexions, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is available only in connexion with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call slaves. And further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life. Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed; nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless. Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class---neither work for others, nor have others working for them. In most of the southern States, a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters; while in the northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families--- wives, sons, and daughters---work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital---that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Again: as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just, and generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way to all---gives hope to all, and consequent energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty---none less inclined to take, or touch, aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost. From the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy years; and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view, what the popular principle applied to government, through the machinery of the States and the Union, has produced in a given time; and also what, if firmly maintained, it promises for the future. There are already among us those, who, if the Union be preserved, will live to see it contain two hundred and fifty millions. The struggle of today, is not altogether for today---it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us.

Further changes were brought about by the act approved March 3, 1863, which fixed the number of justices of the Supreme Court at nine plus the chief justice, and created the Tenth Circuit consisting of California and Oregon. 1 Senator Charles Sumner introduced a resolution on December 12, asking that the Committee on the Judiciary consider establishing by law a commission to revise, correct, arrange, and simplify the public statutes, and on January 28, 1862, introduced a bill (S. 174) to effect the object. The bill was sent to the Committee on the Judiciary whence it was reported on May 31 by Senator Lyman Trumbull without amendment for consideration by the Committee of the Whole. Further consideration was postponed "until 1st Monday in December next,"and the bill was not revived. Not until June 27, 1866, was a law approved giving the president authority to appoint three commissioners to accomplish the revision. 1 Page twenty-seven of the manuscript is missing at this point.

      <field name="fulltext">Draft of a Dispatchin Reply to Lord John Russell [December 10? 1861] Concerning the Trent Affair3 [December 10? 1861] The despatch of Her Majesty's Secretary for Foreign Affairs, dated the 30th. of November 1861, and, of which your Lordship kindly furnished me a copy, has been carefully considered by the President; and he directs me to say that if there existed no fact, or facts pe[r]tinent to the case, beyond those stated in said despatch, the reparation sought by Great Brittain from the United States, would be justly due, and should be promptly made. The President is unwilling to believe that Her Majesty's Government will press for a categorical answer upon what appears to him to be only a partial record, in the making up of which, he has been allowed no part. He is reluctant to volunteer his view of the case, with no assurance that Her Majesty's Government will consent to hear him; yet this much he directs me to say, that this government has intended no affront to the British flag, or to the British nation; nor has it intended to force into discussion, an embarrassing question, all which is evident by the fact, hereby asserted, that the act complained of was done by the officer, without orders from, or expectation of, the government. But being done, it was no longer left to us to consider whether we might not, to avoid a controversy, waive an unimportant, though a strict right; because we too, as well as Great Brittain, have a people justly jealous of their rights, and in whose presence our government could undo the act complained of, only upon a fair showing that it was wrong, or, at least, very questionable. The United States government and people, are still willing to make reparation upon such showing. Accordingly I am instructed by the President to inquire whether Her Majesty's government will hear the United States upon the matter in question. The President desires, among other things, to bring into view, and have considered, the existing rebellion in the United States-the position Great Brittain has assumed, including Her Majesty's proclamation, in relation thereto-the relation the persons, whose seizure is the subject of complaint, bore to the United States, and the object of their voyage at the time they were seized-the knowledge which the master of the Trent had of their relation to the United States, and of the object of their voyage, at the time he received them on board for the voyage-the place of the seizure-and the precedents, and respective positions assumed, in analagous cases, between Great Brittain and the United States. Upon a Submission, containing the foregoing facts, with those set forth in the before mentioned despatch to your Lordship, together with all other facts which either party may deem material, I am instructed to say the government of the United States will, if agreed to by Her Majesty's government, go to such friendly arbitration as is usual among nations, and will abide the award. Or, in the alternative, Her Majesty's government may, upon the same record, determine whether any, and if any, what reparation is due from the United States; provided, no such reparation shall be different in character from, nor transcend, that proposed by your Lordship, as instructed in and by the despatch aforesaid; and, provided further, that the determination thus made shall be the law for all future analagous cases, between Great Brittain and the United States.

Dec. 13. 1861 It having been represented to me that Jno.5 Pope, a citizen of the United States, engaged in the present rebellion against the government thereof, is desirous of returning to his proper allegiance, this may be his full pardon for all political offences committed by him against said government, prior to the first day of January one thousand, eight hundred and sixty two, provided he shall, on or before said day, leave the ranks of said rebellion, and not thereafter do, aid, or encourage anything against the said government of the United States. ABRAHAM LINCOLN President of the United States of America. Footnotes 4 ADS, owned by Mrs. R. F. Mattingly, Louisville, Kentucky. As of December 5, 1861, Major John Pope was chief quartermaster under General William J. Hardee of the Confederate Army at Bowling Green, Kentucky (OR, I, VII, 737). The circumstances under which Lincoln issued this document are obscure. There seems to be no record of Pope's capture or parole. According to information furnished by the present owner of the document, Pope was born (1830) John Pope Cocke, the grandson of John Pope (1770-1845), U.S. senator and representative from Kentucky and governor of Arkansas Territory, but changed his name to John Pope in compliance with stipulations in his grandfather's will. 5 Lincoln left a blank for the first name which is filled in by another hand.</field>

My dear Sir: I find that there are several particulars in which the present law in regard to Chaplains is supposed to be deficient, all of which I now design presenting to the appropriate Committee of Congress. I shall try to have a new law broad enough to cover what is desired by you in behalf of the Israelites. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 Isaac Markens, Abraham Lincoln and the Jews (1909), p. 9.

LINCOLN Footnotes 2 AES, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter from Assistant Adjutant General Alfred B. Ely, counsel for Brigadier General Henry W. Benham, December 13, 1861, setting forth that some twenty days had elapsed since Benham's arrest, November 24, on orders of General William S. Rosecrans, and that since no charges had been preferred, law required General Benham's release. Judge Advocate General Lee replied, December 19, in an endorsement immediately following Lincoln's, that there was just cause for delaying the trial, but recommending Benham's release and return to duty. Below Lee's endorsement, General McClellan wrote "Since the charges preferred. . . involve the question of his fitness to command troops in presence of the enemy I beg to reserve my opinion in the matter until I see the specifications. The charges are so serious that Genl Benham should cause an investigation."Rosecrans to Lorenzo Thomas, November 29, 1861, reported as follows: "On the 26th [sic] instant I found it necessary to arrest Brig. Gen. H. W. Benham for unofficer- like neglect of duty. He applied for a leave of absence on a medical certificate, with permission to visit a city, and has gone to New York. . . ."(OR, I, V, 66g). The arrest had been ordered because Benham failed to cut off the retreat of General John B. Floyd in West Virginia. The case dragged out (see New York Herald, March 22, 1862), but Benham was finally ordered to report for duty on March 17 and was later assigned to Major General David Hunter's command at Port Royal, South Carolina.

Footnotes 1 AD, CSmH. Lamon wrote the letter (dated December 16, 1861), following Lincoln's draft, but added two polite closing sentences (DNA RG 46, Senate Communications on District of Columbia, Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session). The Senate resolution of December 9 had directed Marshall Lamon "to inform the Senate by what authority he receives slaves into the jail of the District at the request of their masters and holds them in confinement until discharged by their masters."Bills introduced in the Senate to appoint a warden of the District jail (February 12, 1862) and to abolish the office of marshal and create the office of sheriff (May 8, 1862) were obviously aimed at Lamon. The first of these contained an amendment (February 14) as follows: "That whenever the marshal or other officer. . . shall commit any person to said jail, he shall leave with said warden a certified copy of the precept by which said person was committed; and no person shall be committed. . . unless by virtue of some process or order from some magistrate. . . ."(Senate Journal, p. 210).

      <field name="fulltext">To David Hunter2 Dec. 31, 1861. Executive Mansion, Washington, Major General Hunter. Dec. 31, 1861. Dear Sir: Yours of the 23rd. is received; and I am constrained to say it is difficult to answer so ugly a letter in good temper. I am, as you intimate, losing much of the great confidence I placed in you, not from any act or omission of yours touching the public service, up to the time you were sent to Leavenworth, but from the flood of grumbling despatches and letters I have seen from you since. I knew you were being ordered to Leavenworth at the time it was done; and I aver that with as tender a regard for your honor and your sensibilities as I had for my own, it never occurred to me that you were being "humiliated, insulted and disgraced"; nor have I, up to this day, heard an intimation that you have been wronged, coming from any one but yourself. No one has blamed you for the retrograde movement from Springfield, nor for the information you gave Gen. Cameron; and this you could readily understand, if it were not for your unwarranted assumption that the ordering you to Leavenworth must necessarily have been done as a punishment for some fault. I thought then, and think yet, the position assigned to you is as respo[n]sible, and as honorable, as that assigned to Buell. I know that Gen. McClellan expected more important results from it. My impression is that at the time you were assigned to the new Western Department, it had not been determined to re-place Gen. Sherman in Kentucky; but of this I am not certain, because the idea that a command in Kentucky was very desireable, and one in the farther West, very undesireable, had never occurred to me. You constantly speak of being placed in command of only 3000. Now tell me, is not this mere impatience? Have you not known all the while that you are to command four or five times that many? I have been, and am sincerely your friend; and if, as such, I dare to make a suggestion, I would say you are adopting the best possible way to ruin yourself. "Act well your part, there all the honor lies."He who does something at the head of one Regiment, will eclipse him who does nothing at the head of a hundred. Your friend as ever, A.

Major General Hunter's endorsement on the envelope containing Lincoln's letter is as follows: "The President in reply to my `ugly letter.'--- This letter was kept on his table for more than a month, and then sent by a private conveyance, with directions to hand it to me only when I was in a good humor!!!!.---" Hunter's letter of December 23, 1861, is in part as follows: "I am very deeply mortified, humiliated, insulted and disgraced. . . . I am sent here [Fort Leavenworth] into banishment, with not three thousand effective men under my command, while one of the Brigadiers, General Buell, is in command of near one hundred thousand men in Kentucky. The only sin I have committed is my carrying out your views in relation to the retrograde movement from Springfield. . . . So it appears that I have been deprived of a command, suitable to my rank, for presuming to answer. . . official questions put to me by the Secretary of War. . . for in no other way was I connected with the Fremont troubles. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</field>

My dear Sir Your despatch of yesterday has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to Gen. McClellan, who says he will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticise your views; and therefore what I offer is merely in justification of myself. Of the two, I would rather have a point on the Railroad south of Cumberland Gap, than Nashville, first, because it cuts a great artery of the enemies' communication, which Nashville does not, and secondly because it is in the midst of loyal people, who would rally around it, while Nashville is not. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor, rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement towards Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They would despair---possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them.

      <field name="fulltext">To Simon Cameron3 Jan. 11, 1862. Private Executive Mansion, Dear Sir Washington, Jan. 11, 1862. Though I have said nothing hitherto in response to your wish, expressed long since, to resign your seat in the cabinet, I have not been unmindful of it. I have been only unwilling to consent to a change at a time, and under circumstances which might give occasion to misconstruction, and unable, till now to see how such misconstruction could be avoided. But the desire of Mr. Clay to return home and to offer his services to his country in the field enables me now to gratify your wish, and at the same time evince my personal regard for you, and my confidence in your ability, patriotism, and fidelity to public trust. I therefore tender to your acceptance, if you still desire to resign your present position, the post of Minister to Russia. Should you accept it, you will bear with you the assurance1 of my undiminished confidence, of my affectionate esteem, and of my sure expectation that, near the great sovreign whose personal and hereditary friendship for the United States, so much endears him to Americans, you will be able to render services to your country, not less important than those you could render at home. Very sincerely Your friend A. LINCOLN Footnotes 3 ALS, DLC-Cameron Papers. Cameron's letter of the same date accepting Lincoln's offer reads in part as follows: "I have devoted myself, without intermission, to my official duties; I have given to them all my energies; I have done my best. It was impossible, in the direction of operations so extensive, but that some mistakes happen, and some complications and complaints arise. In view of these recollections, I thank you from a full heart, for the expression of your `confidence in my ability, patriotism, and fidelity to public trust.' Thus my own conscientious sense of doing my duty by the Executive and by my Country, is approved by the acknowledged head of the Government himself. "When I became a member of your administration, I avowed my purpose to retire from the Cabinet, as soon as my duty to my country would allow me to do so. In your letter of this day's date, so illustrative of your just and upright character, you revive the fact that I sometime ago, expressed the same purpose to you, and in reminding me of this you proffer for my acceptance one of the highest diplomatic positions in your gift, as an additional mark of your confidence and esteem. "In retiring from the War Department, I feel that the mighty Army of the United States, is ready to do battle for the Constitution---that it is marshalled by gallant and experienced leaders---that it is fired with the greatest enthusiasm for the good cause; and also, that my successor, in this department, is my personal friend, who unites to wonderful intellect and vigor, the grand essential of being in earnest in the present struggle, and of being resolved upon a speedy and over-whelming triumph of our arms. I therefore gratefully accept the new distinction you have conferred upon me, and as soon as important and long neglected private business has been arranged, I will enter upon the important duties of the mission to which you have called me."(DLC-RTL). 1 Lincoln deleted "evidence"and inserted "assurance."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Don C. Buell1 Jan. 13, 1862. COPY --- one also sent to Gen. Halleck. Brig. Genl. Buell. Executive Mansion, My dear Sir: Washington, Jan. 13, 1862. Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say "I have received your letter and Gen. McClellan's; and will, at once devote all my efforts to your views, and his."In the midst of my many cares, I have not seen, or asked to see, Gen. McClellan's letter to you. For my own views, I have not offered, and do not now offer them as orders; and while I am glad to have them respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow them contrary to your own clear judgment--- unless I should put them in the form of orders. As to Gen. McClellan's views, you understand your duty in regard to them better than I do. With this preliminary, I state my general idea of this war to be that we have the greater numbers, and the enemy has the greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail, unless we can find some way of making our advantage an over-match for his; and that this can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different points, at the same time; so that we can safely attack, one, or both, if he makes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the strengthened one, but seize, and hold the weakened one, gaining so much. To illustrate, suppose last summer, when Winchester ran away to re-inforce Mannassas, we had forborne to attack Mannassas, but had seized and held Winchester. I mention this to illustrate, and not to criticise. I did not lose confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than some others seem to. In application of the general rule I am suggesting, every particular case will have its modifying circumstances, among which the most constantly present, and most difficult to meet, will be the want of perfect knowledge of the enemies' movements. This had it's part in the Bull-Run case; but worse, in that case, was the expiration of the terms of the three months men. Applying the principle to your case, my idea is that Halleck shall menace Columbus, and "down river" generally; while you menace Bowling-Green, and East Tennessee. If the enemy shall concentrate at Bowling-Green, do not retire from his front; yet do not fight him there, either, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or both, left exposed by the concentration at Bowling Green. It is matter of no small anxiety to me and one which I am sure you will not over-look, that the East Tennessee line, is so long, and over so bad a road. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN.

Please open the sealed letter he will hand you before he leaves you and confer with him as to its contents. Yours, very truly, A. LINCOLN. [Inclosure.] Executive Mansion, Major-General Halleck: Washington, January 15, 1862. My dear Sir: The Germans are true and patriotic, and so far as they have got cross in Missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding. Without a knowledge of its contents Governor Koerner, of Illinois, will hand you this letter. He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a man as lives. With his assistance you can set everything right with the Germans. I write this without his knowledge, asking him at the same time, by letter, to deliver it. My clear judgment is that, with reference to the German element in your command, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and if agreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that he can afford to so give his time. He does not wish to command in the field, though he has more military knowledge than many who do. If he goes into the place he will simply be an efficient, zealous, and unselfish assistant to you. I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with Governor Koerner. Yours, very truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 3 OR, I, VIII, 826.

      <field name="fulltext">To Queen Victoria2 February 1, 1862 February 1, 1862 Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America. To Her Majesty Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., Sendeth Greeting! Great and Good Friend: By a letter from your son, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, which has just been received, I am informed of the overwhelming affliction which has fallen upon Your Majesty, by the untimely death of His Royal Highness the late Prince Consort, Prince Albert, of Saxe Coburg. The offer of condolence in such cases is a customary ceremony, which has its good uses, though it is conventional, and may sometimes be even insincere. But I would fain have Your Majesty apprehend, on this occasion, that real sympathy can exist, as real truthfulness can be practised, in the intercourse of Nations. The People of the United States are kindred of the People of Great Britain. With all our distinct national interests, objects, and aspirations, we are conscious that our moral strength is largely derived from that relationship, and we think we do not deceive ourselves when we suppose that, by constantly cherishing cordial friendship and sympathy with the other branches of the family to which we belong, we impart to them not less strength than we derive from the same connection. Accidents, however, incidental to all States, and passions, common to all nations, often tend to disturb the harmony so necessary and so proper between the two countries, and to convert them into enemies. It was reserved for Your Majesty in sending your son, the Heir Apparent of the British Throne, on a visit among us, to inaugurate a policy destined to counteract these injurious tendencies, as it has been Your Majesty's manifest endeavor, through a reign already of considerable length and of distinguished success, to cultivate the friendship on our part so earnestly desired. It is for this reason that you are honored on this side of the Atlantic as a friend of the American People. The late Prince Consort was with sufficient evidence regarded as your counsellor in the same friendly relation. The American People, therefore, deplore his death and sympathize in Your Majesty's irreparable bereavement with an unaffected sorrow. This condolence may not be altogether ineffectual, since we are sure it emanates from only virtuous motives and natural affection. I do not dwell upon it, however, because I know that the Divine hand that has wounded, is the only one that can heal: And so, commending Your Majesty and the Prince Royal, the Heir Apparent, and all your afflicted family to the tender mercies of God, I remain Your Good Friend, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan2 Feb. 3, 1862. Executive Mansion, Major General McClellan Washington, Feb. 3, 1862. My dear Sir: You and I have distinct, and different plans for a movement of the Army of the Potomac---yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the Railroad on the York River---, mine to move directly to a point on the Railroad South West of Manassas. If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours. 1st. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time, and money than mine? 2nd. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine? 3rd. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine? 4th. In fact, would it not be less valuable, in this, that it would break no great line of the enemie's communications, while mine would? 5th. In case of disaster, would not a safe retreat be more difficult by your plan than by mine? Yours truly A. LINCOLN [Memorandum accompanying Letter of President to General McClellan, dated February 3, 1862]1 1. Suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the Ocoquan, what? In view of the possibility of this, might it not be safest to have our entire force to move together from above the Ocoquan. 2. Suppose the enemy, in force, shall dispute the crossing of the Ocoquan, what? In view of this, might it not be safest for us to cross the Ocoquan at Colchester rather than at the village of Ocoquan? This would cost the enemy two miles more of travel to meet us, but would, on the contrary, leave us two miles further from our ultimate destination. 3. Suppose we reach Maple valley without an attack, will we not be attacked there, in force, by the enemy marching by the several roads from Manassas? and if so, what? Footnotes 2 ALS and AD (enclosure?), DLC-Stanton Papers. The supposition that the memorandum was enclosed with this letter is based upon the fact that the memorandum is so described in the Official Records. The undated memorandum is not, however, with the letter in the Stanton Papers, and the particular references in it to crossing the Occoquan suggest that it may have antedated the letter, as a memo of questions which Lincoln intended to put to McClellan verbally during a conference later than the memorandum of c. December 1, 1861 (supra), but prior to the issuing of his Special War Order of January 31, 1862 (supra). The memorandum may have been jotted down as early as January 13, on which day Lincoln held a council of war with McClellan and several other generals, as well as cabinet members, but could scarcely have been written on February 3, since by that date Lincoln was already aware that McClellan would not favor his plan. Upon receipt of Lincoln's Special War Order, McClellan wrote Stanton a twenty-two page letter under the same date, January 31. Although there is no mistaking the date as McClellan wrote it on the letter, the containing envelope is endorsed by Lincoln "From Gen. McClellan Jan. 30. 1862."Lincoln's endorsement is certainly dated one day too soon, unless both the Special Order and McClellan's letter were prepared in advance of the dates which they bear. Beyond reasonable doubt, however, the date under which McClellan incorporated his letter in his official "report of the operations of Army of the Potomac while under my charge,"is wrong. McClellan's report, dated at New York, August 4, 1863, prints the letter with numerous details at variance with the original letter in the Lincoln Papers, and in dating his letter February 3, instead of January 31, McClellan either deliberately falsified the record in an effort to support his own case or inadvertently committed an error which had the same effect. McClellan's report (OR, I, V, 41 ff.) stated that, after receiving Lincoln's Special Order, "I asked his excellency whether this order was to be regarded as final, or whether I could be permitted to submit in writing my objections to his plan and my reasons for preferring my own. Permission was accorded, and I therefore prepared the letter to the Secretary of War which is given below [under date of February 3 in McClellan's report, but dated January 31 in the original in the Lincoln Papers]. "Before this had been submitted to the President he addressed me the following note: [Lincoln's letter of February 3, but without the enclosure, is here given by McClellan.] "These questions were substantially answered by the following letter of the same date to the Secretary of War:" Immediately following, under date of February 3, is the letter of January 31, altered somewhat in minor details in the early paragraphs and marked by the significant omission of important passages toward the end. The letter is too long for reproduction here in its entirety, but because the original contains important passages not in the Official Records, and because of the strange circumstances surrounding the question of date, the heart of McClellan's statement is reproduced below. Portions in italic type are the passages which McClellan omitted in his official report: "Two bases of operations seem to present themselves for the advance of the Army of the Potomac.--- I. That of Washington---its present position---involving a direct attack upon the enemy's entrenched positions at Centreville, Manassas etc, or else a movement to turn one or both flanks of those positions, or a combination of the two plans. "The relative force of the two armies will not justify an attack on both flanks. "An attack on his left flank alone involves a long line of wagon communication &amp; cannot prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his extreme right &amp; left. "Should we attack his right by the line of the Occoquan &amp; a crossing of the Potomac below the Occoquan &amp; near his batteries, we could perhaps prevent the junction of the enemy's extreme right with his centre (we might destroy the former), we would remove the obstructions to the navigation of the Potomac, reduce the length of wagon transportation by establishing new depots at the nearest points of the Potomac, &amp; strike more directly his main railway communication. "The fords of the Occoquan below the mouth of Bull Run are watched by the rebels, batteries are said to be placed on the heights in rear (concealed by the woods), &amp; the arrangement of his troops is such that he can oppose some considerable resistance to a passage of the stream. Information has just been received to the effect that the enemy are entrenching a line of heights extending from the vicinity of Sangster's (Union Mills?) towards Evansport. Early in Jany. Sprigg's ford was occupied by Genl Rhodes with 3600 men &amp; 8 guns; there are strong reasons for believing that Davis' Ford is occupied. "These circumstances indicate, or prove, that the enemy anticipate the movement in question &amp; are prepared to resist it. Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon, it may be well to examine briefly its probable progress. "In the present state of affairs our columns (for the movement of so large a force must be made in several columns, at least 5 or 6) can reach the Accotinck without danger; during the march thence to the Occoquan our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from Fairfax Station, Sangster's &amp; Union Mills;---this danger must be met by occupying in some force either the two first named places, or, better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence to the village of Occoquan---this occupation must be continued so long as we continue to draw supplies by the roads from this city, or until a battle is won. "The crossing of the Occoquan should be made at all the fords from Wolf's Run to the mouth, the points of crossing not being necessarily confined to the fords themselves. Should the enemy occupy this line in force we must, with what assistance the flotilla can afford, endeavor to force the passage near the mouth, thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line or be taken in flank himself. "Having gained the line of the Occoquan, it would be necessary to throw a column by the shortest route to Dumfries, partly to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the Potomac, partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction of Acquia, &amp; lastly to establish our communication with the river by the best roads, &amp; thus give us new depots. "The enemy would by this time have occupied the line of the Occoquan above Bulls Run, holding Brentsville in force &amp; perhaps extending his lines somewhat farther to the S.W. "Our next step would be to prevent the enemy from crossing the Occoquan between Bull Run &amp; Broad Run, to fall upon our right flank while moving on Brentsville; this might be effected by occupying Bacon [?] Church &amp; the cross roads near the mouth of Bull Run, or still more effectually by moving to the fords themselves &amp; preventing him from debouching on our side. These operations would probably be resisted, &amp; would require some time to effect them. As nearly at the same time as possible we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above Broad Run. "Having secured our right flank it would become necessary to carry Brentsville at any cost, for we could not leave it between our right flank &amp; main body. The final movement on the Railroad must be determined by circumstances existing at the time. "This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advantage possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, &amp; a strong line of defence enabling him to remain on the defensive with a small force on one flank, while he concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action. "Should we place a portion of our force in front of Centreville while the rest crosses the Occoquan we commit the error of dividing our Army by a very difficult obstacle &amp; by a distance too great to enable the two portions to support each other, should either be attacked by the masses of the enemy while the other is held in check. "I should perhaps have dwelled more decidedly on the fact that the force left near Sangster's must be allowed to remain somewhere on that side of the Occoquan, until the decisive battle is over, to cover our retreat in the event of disaster, unless it should be decided to select &amp; entrench a new base somewhere near Dumfries---a proceeding involving much time. "After the passage of the Occoquan by the main army, this covering force could be drawn in to a more central &amp; less exposed position, say Brimstone Hill or nearer the Occoquan. In this latitude the weather will for a considerable period be very uncertain, &amp; a movement commenced in force on roads in tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much delayed by rains &amp; snow. It will therefore be next to impossible to surprise the enemy, or take him at a disadvantage by rapid manoeuvres;---our slow progress will enable him to divine our purposes &amp; take his measures accordingly. The probability is, from the best information we possess, that he has improved the roads leading to his lines of defense, while we must work as we advance. "Bearing in mind what has been said, &amp; the present unprecedented, &amp; impassable condition of the roads, it will be evident that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on this line, nor can its duration be closely calculated; it seems certain that many weeks may elapse it is possible to commence the march. "Assuming the success of this operation &amp; the defeat of the enemy as certain, the question at once arises as to the importance of the results gained. "I think these results would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, &amp; the moral effect of the victory-- -important results it is true, but not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the enemy's main army; for he could fall back upon other positions, &amp; fight us again &amp; again, should the condition of his troops permit. "If he is in no condition to fight us again out of range of the entrenchments at Richmond we would find it a very difficult &amp; tedious matter to follow him up there---for he would destroy the railroad bridges &amp; otherwise impede our progress through a region where the roads are as bad as they well can be; &amp; we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change the entire theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to Richmond with a smaller available force &amp; at an expenditure of much more time than were we to adopt the short line at once. "We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces &amp; perfect his defensive measures at the very points where it is desirable to strike him where least prepared. "II. The second base of operations available for the Army of the Potomac is that of the lower Chesapeake Bay, which affords the shortest possible land routes to Richmond, &amp; strikes directly at the heart of the enemy's power in the East. "The roads in that region are passable at all seasons of the year. "The country now alluded to is much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of Washington (which is very unfavorable)---much more level---more cleared land--- the woods less dense---soil more sandy---the spring some two or three weeks earlier. "A movement in force on that line obliges the enemy to abandon his entrenched position at Manassas, in order to hasten to cover Richmond &amp; Norfolk. "He must do this, for should he permit us to occupy Richmond his destruction can be averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle in which he must be the assailant. "This movement if successful gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies of the rebels; Norfolk would fall; all the waters of the Chesapeake would be ours; all Virginia would be in our power; &amp; the enemy forced to abandon Tennessee &amp; North Carolina "The alternatives presented to the enemy would be to beat us in a position selected by ourselves; disperse; or pass beneath the Caudine Forks. [McClellan referred to a well-known episode in military history when the Samnites hemmed in the Romans at the "Caudine Forks"in southern Italy, in 321 B.C.] Should we be beaten in a battle, we have a perfectly secure retreat down the Peninsula upon Fort Monroe, with our flanks perfectly secured by the fleet. During the whole movement our left flank is covered by the water, our right is secure for the reason that the enemy is too distant to reach us in time---he can only oppose us in front; we bring our fleet into full play. "After a successful battle our position would be---Burnside forming our left, Norfolk held securely, our centre connecting Burnside with Buell, both by Raleigh &amp; Lynchburg, Buell in Eastern Tennessee &amp; Northern Alabama, Halleck at Nashville &amp; Memphis. The next movement would be to connect with Sherman on the left, by reducing Wilmington &amp; Charleston; to advance our centre into South Carolina &amp; Georgia; to push Buell either towards Montgomery, or to unite with the main army in Georgia; to throw Halleck southward to meet the Naval Expedition from New Orleans. "We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all the southern seaports; to occupy all the avenues of communication; to use the great outlet of the Mississip[p]i; to reestablish our Govt &amp; arms in Arkansas, Louisiana &amp; Texas; to force the slaves to labor for our subsistence instead of that of the rebels;---to bid defiance to all foreign interference. Such is the object I have ever had in view: this is the general plan which I have hoped to accomplish. For many long months I have labored to prepare the Army of the Potomac to play its part in the programme; from the day when I was placed in command of all our armies, I have exerted myself to place all the other armies in such a condition that they too could perform their allotted duties. Should it be determined to operate from the lower Chesapeake, the point of landing which promises the most brilliant results is Urbana on the lower Rappahanock. This point is easily reached by vessels of heavy draught, it is neither occupied nor observed by the enemy; it is but one long march from West Point, the Key of that region, &amp; thence but two marches to Richmond. "A rapid movement from Urbana would probably cut off Magruder in the Peninsula, &amp; enable us to occupy Richmond before it could be strongly reinforced. Should we fail in that we could, with the cooperation of the Navy, cross the James &amp; throw ourselves in rear of Richmond, thus forcing the enemy to come out &amp; attack us---for his position would be untenable, with us on the southern bank of the river. "Should circumstances render it not advisable to land at Urbana we can use Mob Jack Bay,--- or---the worst coming to the worst---we can take Fort Monroe as a base, &amp; operate with complete security, altho' with less celerity &amp; brilliancy of results, up the Peninsula. To reach whatever point may be selected as the base, a large amount of cheap water transportation must be collected---consisting mainly of canal boats, barges, wood boats, schooners etc towed by small steamers---all of a very different character from those required for all previous expeditions. This can certainly be accomplished within 30 days from the time the order is given. "I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judgment, be adopted, to select Urbana as the landing place of the first detachments. To transport by water four (4) Divisions of Infantry, with their batteries, the Regular Infty, a few wagons, one bridge train &amp; a few squadrons of cavalry---making the vicinity of Hooker's position the place of embarkation for as many as possible. To move the Regular Cavalry, &amp; Reserve Artillery, the remaining bridge trains, &amp; wagons to a point somewhere near Cape Lookout, then ferry them over the river by means of North River ferry boats, march them over to the Rappahannock (covering the movement by an Infantry force placed near Heathsville), cross the Rappahannock in a similar way. The expense &amp; difficulty of the movement will thus be much diminished (a saving of transportation of about 10,000 horses!), &amp; the result none the less certain. "The concentration of the cavalry etc in the lower counties of Maryland can be effected without exciting suspicion, &amp; the movement made without delay from that cause. This movement, if adopted, will not at all expose the city of Washington to danger. The total force to be thrown upon the new line would be (according to circumstances) from 110,000 to 140,000. I hope to use the latter number, by bringing fresh troops into Washington, &amp; still leaving it quite safe. "I fully realize that, in all projects offered, time is probably the most valuable consideration---it is my decided opinion that in that point of view the 2nd plan should be adopted. It is possible, nay highly probable, that the weather &amp; state of the roads may be such as to delay the direct movement from Washington, with its unsatisfactory results &amp; great risks, far beyond the time required to complete the second plan. "IN THE FIRST CASE, we can fix no definite time for an advance---the roads have gone from bad to worse---nothing like their present condition has ever been known here before---they are impassable at present, we are entirely at the mercy of the weather. In the second plan, we can calculate almost to a day, &amp; with but little regard to the season. "If at the expense of 30 days delay we can gain a decisive victory which will probably end the war, it is far cheaper than to gain a battle tomorrow that produces no final results, &amp; may require years of warfare &amp; expenditure to follow up. "Such, I think, is precisely the difference between the two plans discussed in this long letter. A battle gained at Manassas will result merely in the possession of the field of combat-- -at best we can follow it up but slowly, unless we do what I now propose, viz:---change the line of operations. "On the Mannassas line the rebels can, if well enough disciplined (&amp; we have every reason to suppose that to be the case) dispute our advance, over bad roads, from position to position. "When we have gained the battle, if we do gain it, the question will at once arise---`What are we to do next?'--- "It is by no means certain that we can beat them at Manassas. "On the other line I regard success as certain by all the chances of war. "We demoralize the enemy, by forcing him to abandon his prepared position for one which we have chosen, in which all is in our favor, &amp; where success must produce immense results. My judgement as a General is clearly in favor of this project. "Nothing is CERTAIN in war---but all the chances are in favor of this movement. "So much am I in favor of the southern line of operations, that I would prefer the move from Fort Monroe as a base, as a certain, tho' less brilliant movement than that from Urbana, to an attack upon Manassas. "I know that his Excellency the President, you &amp; I all agree in our wishes---&amp; that our desire is to bring this war to as prompt a close as the means in our possession will permit. I believe that the mass of the people have entire confidence in us---I am sure of it---let us then look only to the great result to be accomplished, &amp; disregard everything else. "In conclusion I would respectfully, but firmly, advise that I may be authorized to undertake at once the movement by Urbana "I believe that it can be carried into execution so nearly simultaneously with the final advance of Buell &amp; Halleck that the columns will support each other "I will stake my life, my reputation on the result---more than that, I will stake upon it the success of our cause. "I hope but little from the attack on Manassas;---my judgment is against it. Foreign complications may entirely change the state of affairs, &amp; render very different plans necessary. In that event I will be ready to submit them." (DLC-RTL). McClellan's report (loc. cit., p. 45) continued as follows: "This letter must have produced some effect upon the mind of the President, since the execution of his order was not required, although it was not revoked as formally as it had been issued. . . ." As a possible solution to the apparent contradictions in dates, it may be concluded that McClellan composed his letter of January 31 following a prior conference with Lincoln at which the two plans were discussed, that Stanton failed to forward McClellan's letter to the president until after Lincoln had written McClellan on February 3, and that McClellan changed the date of his letter from January 31 to February 3 when he drew up his report in 1863, in order to avoid the apparent contradiction in dates. If this conclusion is correct, the error of one day appearing in Lincoln's endorsement on the envelope containing McClellan's letter becomes more understandable, in that Lincoln probably so endorsed it upon receiving it from Stanton sometime after February 3. In this event McClellan never did specifically reply to Lincoln's questions of February 3, but on January 31 had anticipated them in some degree and in part answered them before Lincoln put them in writing. In conclusion it may be noted that the questions posed in Lincoln's undated memorandum, which the Official Records describe as an enclosure with Lincoln's letter, are more adequately disposed of by McClellan than are the questions posed by Lincoln in the letter itself. This fact tends to confirm the supposition that the memorandum was written prior to both Lincoln's letter of February 3 and McClellan's letter of January 31. 1 The bracketed title is not on the autograph document but is given to the memorandum as printed in the Official Records (I, V, 713). It is worth noting also that McClellan's report does not include this memorandum along with the letter of February 3, the two items being related by means of a footnote.</field>

I have also received in good condition the royal gifts which accompanied those letters,--- namely, a sword of costly materials and exquisite workmanship; a photographic likeness of Your Majesty and of Your Majesty's beloved daughter; and also two elephants' tusks of length and magnitude such as indicate that they could have belonged only to an animal which was a native of Siam. Your Majesty's letters show an understanding that our laws forbid the President from receiving these rich presents as personal treasures. They are therefore accepted in accordance with Your Majesty's desire as tokens of your good will and friendship for the American People. Congress being now in session at this capital, I have had great pleasure in making known to them this manifestation of Your Majesty's munificence and kind consideration. Under their directions the gifts will be placed among the archives of the Government, where they will remain perpetually as tokens of mutual esteem and pacific dispositions more honorable to both nations than any trophies of conquest could be. I appreciate most highly Your Majesty's tender of good offices in forwarding to this Government a stock from which a supply of elephants might be raised on our own soil. This Government would not hesitate to avail itself of so generous an offer if the object were one which could be made practically useful in the present condition of the United States. Our political jurisdiction, however, does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant, and steam on land, as well as on water, has been our best and most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce. I shall have occasion at no distant day to transmit to Your Majesty some token of indication of the high sense which this Government entertains of Your Majesty's friendship. Meantime, wishing for Your Majesty a long and happy life, and for the generous and emulous People of Siam the highest possible prosperity, I commend both to the blessing of Almighty God.

      <field name="fulltext">Stay of Execution for Nathaniel Gordon1 February 4, 1862 February 4, 1862 Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, To all to whom these Presents shall come Greeting: Whereas, it appears that at a Term of the Circuit Court of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York held in the month of November A.D. 1861, Nathaniel Gordon was indicted and convicted for being engaged in the Slave Trade, and was by the said Court sentenced to be put to death by hanging by the neck, on Friday the 7th. day of February, A.D. 1862; And whereas, a large number of respectable citizens have earnestly besought me to commute the said sentence of the said Nathaniel Gordon to a term of imprisonment for life, which application I have felt it to be my duty to refuse; And whereas, it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful application made for the commutation of his sentence may have prevented the said Nathaniel Gordon from making the necessary preparation for the awful change which awaits him: Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, have granted and do hereby grant unto him, the said Nathaniel Gordon, a respite of the above recited sentence, until Friday the twenty-first day of February, A.D. 1862, between the hours of twelve o'clock at noon and three o'clock in the afternoon of the said day, when the said sentence shall be executed. In granting this respite, it becomes my painful duty to admonish the prisoner that, relinquishing all expectation of pardon by Human Authority, he refer himself alone to the mercy of the common God and Father of all men. In testimony whereof, I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed. [L.S.] Done at the City of Washington, this Fourth day of February A.D. 1862, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-sixth. By the President: ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WILLIAM H. SEWARD Secretary of State. Footnotes 1 DS, ORB. Attorney General Bates replied on February 4, 1862, to a note, presumably not extant, from Lincoln on the same date requesting an opinion as to whether the executive could lawfully grant to a convict a "respite of his sentence, without relieving him altogether of the death penalty."Bates gave his opinion that "I have no doubt that you can. . . . A reprieve does not annul the sentence. . . . It only prolongs the time."(DLC-RTL). Although many previous seizures of slave ships had been made, Captain Nathaniel Gordon of Maine was the only slave-trader ever convicted and hanged in accordance with federal law. So numerous were the failures of juries to convict, that many believed Gordon entitled to executive clemency as a victim of unprecedented juridical rigor. The language of Lincoln's reprieve leaves no doubt of his concurrence in the justice of the sentence, but indicates his awareness that public sympathy had encouraged Gordon to believe a pardon would be granted.</field>

Washington, February 7, 1862. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session, Senate Executive Document No. 19. William L. Dayton's letter of January 14, 1862, recounted the refusal of the French Court to admit Americans for presentation on the night of the court ball unless "the social quality"of each person was specified. This Dayton refused to do, on the ground that "The French minister at Washington presents. . . to his excellency [the president] any or as many of his countrymen as he may choose. . . without question to their quality, social position, or profession."Seward's reply of February 3 advised Dayton, "Let the Emperor and Empress receive whom they will. . . and let all others, as well as those who are admitted, turn their attention to. . . how they can serve their country abroad; and if they find no better way to do it than by making their attendance in the saloons of the Tuileries, let them return home. . . ."(Ibid.).</field>

My wish has been,---and is, to avail the government of the services of both Gen. Hunter and Gen. Lane; &amp;, so far as possible, to personally oblige both. Gen. Hunter is the senior officer, and must command when they serve together; though, in so far as he can, consistently with the public service, and his own honor, oblige Gen.

LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS (copy?), DLC---RTL. Although the autograph letter in the Lincoln Papers is addressed only to Hunter, the Official Records (I, VIII, 551) has this letter addressed to both generals. General Hunter wrote Stanton on February 1, 1862, that Lane had not accepted the appointment as brigadier general and that "on his arrival. . . he stated. . . that he was `my visitor as a Senator of the United States and a member of the Senate Military Committee' . . . . I find myself compelled. . . to request that some definite character shall be given to Senator Lane. . . . I am satisfied that Senator Lane feels aggrieved and disappointed. . . at the position to which his acceptance of his commission would assign him."(DLC---RTL). Hunter also wrote Lincoln on February 4, asking that Lane be "called upon either to accept his position as Brigadier General and report for duty, or have his appointment to that position withdrawn, or be transferred to some other Department. . . ."

In conformity with this law Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, of the Navy, was nominated to the Senate for continuance as the Flag Officer in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which recently rendered such important service to the Union in the expedition to the Coast of North Carolina. Believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry displayed in the combined attack of the Forces commanded by him and Brigadier General Burnside in the capture of Roanoke Island and the destruction of Rebel Gun Boats, on the 7th., 8th. and 10th.

Columbus will not get at Grant, but the the [sic] force from Bowling---Green will. They hold the Railroad from Bowling---Green to within a few miles of Donelson, with the Bridge at Clarksburg [Clarksville] undisturbed. It is unsafe to rely that they will not dare to expose Nashville to Buell. A small part of their force can retire slowly towards Nashville, breaking up the Railroad as they go, and keep Buell out of that city twenty days. Mean time Nashville will be abundantly defended by forces from all South &amp; perhaps from here at Manassas. Could not a cavalry force from Gen. Thomas on the upper Cumberland, dash across, almost unresisted, and cut the Railroad at or near Knoxville, Tenn.? In the midst of a bombardment at Donnelson, why could not a Gunboat run up and destroy the Bridge at Clarksburg [Clarksville]?

LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, owned by John S. Adams, Sr., Wayne, Pennsylvania. There is no reply from Green Adams in the Lincoln Papers, but a letter from Thomas E. Bramlette, Louisville, Kentucky, March 21, 1862, which Adams forwarded to Lincoln, indicated Bramlette's willingness "to take any position"and named General James M. Shackelford as willing to raise troops. Colonel W. T. Scott of Lexington was also recommended for provost marshal "for this district."(DLC-RTL). On February 21, 1863, Lincoln nominated Bramlette district attorney for Kentucky, and on January 2, 1863, nominated Shackelford for brigadier general of Volunteers. Bramlette's appointment was confirmed February 27, and Shackelford's on March 11, 1863. Presumably these were among the appointments to which Lincoln refers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reply to Federico Barreda3 March 4, 1862 March 4, 1862 The United States have no enmities, animosities, or rivalries, and no interests which conflict with the welfare, safety and rights or interests of any other nation. Their own prosperity, happiness and aggrandizement are sought most safely and advantageously through the preservation, not only of peace on their own part, but peace among all other nations. But while the United States are thus a friend to all other nations, they do not seek to conceal the fact that they cherish especial sentiments of friendship for, and sympathies with, those who, like themselves, have founded their institutions on the principle of the equal rights of men; and such nations, being more prominently neighbors of the United States, the latter are co-operating with them in establishing civilization and culture on the American continent. Such being the general principles which govern the United States in their foreign relations, you may be assured, sir, that in all things this government will deal justly, frankly, and, if it be possible, even liberally, with Peru, whose liberal sentiments towards us you have so kindly expressed.

Yours truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, owned by Perc S. Brown, Newark, New Jersey. Although the diaries of Gideon Welles and Edward Bates have nothing on this meeting, Lincoln probably presented for discussion his message recommending compensated emancipation, which he sent to congress March 6 (infra).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Message to Congress3 March 6, 1862 March 6, 1862 Fellow-citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives, I recommend the adoption of a Joint Resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be substantially as follows: "Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in it's discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences1 public and private, produced by such change of system" If the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does command such approval, I deem it of importance that the states and people immediately interested, should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The federal government would find it's highest interest in such a measure, as one of the most efficient means of self- preservation.2 The leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that this government will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected region, and that all the slave states North of such part will then say "the Union, for which we have struggled, being already gone, we now choose to go with the Southern section."To deprive them of this hope, substantially ends the rebellion; and the initiation of emancipation completely deprives them of it, as to all the states initiating it. The point is not that all the states tolerating slavery would very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that, while the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such initiation, make it certain3 to the more Southern, that in no event, will the former ever join the latter, in their proposed confederacy. I say "initiation" because, in my judgment, gradual, and not sudden emancipation, is better for all. In the mere financial, or pecuniary view, any member of Congress,4 with the census-tables and Treasury-reports before him, can readily see for himself how very soon the current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in any named State. Such a proposition, on the part of the general government, sets up no claim of a right, by federal authority, to interfere with slavery within state limits, referring, as it does, the absolute5 control of the subject, in each case, to the state and it's people, immediately interested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.6 In the annual message last December, I thought fit to say "The Union must be preserved; and hence all indispensable means must be employed."I said this, not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made, and continues to be, an indispensable means to this end. A practical re- acknowledgement of the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once cease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents, which may attend7 and all the ruin which may follow1 it. Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle, must and will come. The proposition now made, though an offer only, I hope it may be esteemed no offence to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned,2 than are the institution, and property in it, in the present aspect of affairs.3 While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results. In full view of my great responsibility to my God, and to my4 country, I earnestly5 beg the attention of Congress and the people to the subject. ABRAHAM LINCOLN March 6. 1862.

I am obliged to take groups as I find them and to move them by divisions. I respectfully ask a suspension of the order directing it till the present movement be over."(OR, I, V, 739). To this Stanton replied on the same day, "I think it is the duty of every officer to obey the President's orders, nor can I see any reason why you should not obey them in present instance. I must therefore decline to suspend them."(Ibid.). At 1 A.M. on March 10, McClellan replied, "You have entirely misunderstood me, and the idea I intended to convey was simply that I could not, under the pressure of the new aspect of affairs, immediately carry out the President's orders as to the formation of army corps. . . . I regard it as a military necessity that the divisions should move to the front at once, without waiting for the formation of army corps. . . . If the leave to suspend the order be granted, there will be no unreasonable delay in the formation of army corps. I await your reply. . . ."(Ibid., p. 740).

(Ibid., p. 741). McClellan replied at 2:50 A.M., "Your reply received. The troops are in motion. I thank you for your dispatch. It relieves me much, and you will be convinced that I have not asked too much of you."(Ibid.). The corps assignments were issued in McClellan's General Orders No. 151, March 13, 1862. McClellan's General Report, August 4, 1863, made the following comment on Lincoln's General War Order No2: ". . .

Ordered also, that the country West of the Department of the Potomac, and East of the Department of the Mississippi be a Military department to be called the Mountain Department; and that the same be commanded by Major General Fremont. That all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by them respectively, report severally and directly to the Secretary of War, and that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and each of them. ABRAHAM LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ADS, IHi. A preliminary draft of this order prepared by Stanton is as follows: "In view of active operations by the Army of the Potomac which will demand the presence &amp; supervision of its Commanding General in the field and that he should be relieved from all other duties is ordered by the President "1st. That Major General George B McClellan be and he is hereby relieved from &amp; after this date from duty as General Commanding and directed to devote his attention exclusively to the operations of the Army of the Potomac "2. The Adjutant General is directed to give immediate notice of this order to all Generals commanding Armies expeditions or Departments and instruct them from and after the receipt of this order to make their reports to &amp; receive their instruction from the President through the War Department."(DLC-Stanton Papers). The issuing of War Order No. 3 was also recommended by Bates in the cabinet meeting of March 11 (see Diary of Edward Bates, p. 239). On March 12 McClellan sent a letter by Governor Dennison of Ohio which he marked "Unofficial,"reading in part as follows: "I have just seen Gov. Dennison who has detailed to me the conversations he held with you yesterday and today. "I beg to say. . . that I cordially endorse all that he said to you in my behalf, and. . . I thank you. . . for the official confidence &amp; kind personal feelings you entertain for me. I believe I said to you some weeks since. . . that no feeling of self interest or ambition should ever prevent me from devoting myself to your service.

I thank you, Mr. TRAIN, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly elegant and highly creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics of your State of Massachusetts, and I beg of you to express my hearty thanks to the donors. It displays a perfection of workmanship which I really wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might then follow your idea that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected that a good deal of whipping is to be done. But, as we meet here socially, let us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes, but of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes, but of those pleasant days which it is to be hoped are in store for us, when, seated behind a good pair of horses, we can crack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy and prosperous land. With this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties. Footnotes 2 New York Times, March 22, 1862. Lincoln replied to a short speech by Representative Charles R.

      <field name="fulltext">To James A. McDougal1 March 14, 1862 Hon. James A. McDougal Executive Mansion U.S. Senate Washington, March 14, 1862 My dear Sir: As to the expensiveness of the plan of gradual emancipation with compensation, proposed in the late Message, please allow me one or two brief suggestions. Less than one half-day's cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware at four hundred dollars per head: Thus, all the slaves in Delaware, by the Census of 1860, are 1798 400 --------- Cost of the slaves, $ 719,200. One day's cost of the war "2,000,000. Again, less than eighty seven days cost of this war would, at the same price, pay for all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri. Thus, slaves in Delaware 1798 ""Maryland 87,188 ""Dis. of Col. 3,181 ""Kentucky 225,490 ""Missouri 114,965 ----------- 432,622 400 ----------- Cost of the slaves $173,048,800 Eightyseven days' cost of the war "174,000,000. Do you doubt that taking the initiatory steps on the part of those states and this District, would shorten the war more than eighty-seven days, and thus be an actual saving of expense? A word as to the time and manner of incurring the expence. Suppose, for instance, a State devises and adopts a system by which the institution absolutely ceases therein by a named day---say January 1st. 1882. Then, let the sum to be paid to such state by the United States, be ascertained by taking from the Census of 1860, the number of slaves within the state, and multiplying that number by four hundred---the United States to pay such sum to the state in twenty equal annual instalments, in six per cent. bonds of the United States. The sum thus given, as to time and manner, I think would not be half as onerous, as would be an equal sum, raised now, for the indefinite prossecution of the war; but of this you can judge as well as I. I inclose a Census-table for your convenience. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, owned by Mrs. Ben Sperry, Bushnell, Illinois; LS copy, DLC-RTL. On March 14, Joseph C. G.

The presence of this document, which is probably a memorandum even though written on a telegraph blank, in General Ethan A. Hitchcock's papers may be accounted for by reason of the fact that on April 2 Stanton submitted to Adjutant General Thomas and General Hitchcock the papers concerned with McClellan's operations in order that an examination and report might be made on the question of whether McClellan had followed Lincoln's orders, particularly with reference to the defenses of Washington (OR, I, XI, III, 57). On March 18, McClellan wrote Stanton, "In order to carry out the object of this army it has now become necessary that its commander should have the entire control of affairs around Fort Monroe. I would. . . suggest that the. . . method. . . would be to merge the Dept of Virginia into that of the Potomac. . . . I. . . request. . . the present Comdr of the Dept Virginia be assigned to some other command. . . ."(DLC-RTL). This suggestion was not followed, but on March 26 McClellan was given command over Fort Monroe and all Wool's forces, Wool agreeing to co-operate to the full. On April 3, however, when it became apparent that McClellan was unable to command all that he was taking over, and perhaps because of growing uneasiness on the part of both Lincoln and Stanton at McClellan's overweening dispatches, Wool was ordered to "continue in command of Fort Monroe and the troops heretofore assigned to the Department of Virginia, and General McClellan will command the troops constituting the Army of the Potomac."(OR, I, XI, III, 65). Wool was promoted to major general for gallant conduct in taking the city of Norfolk on May 10, rather than for the reason indicated in Lincoln's memorandum to Stanton on March 18.</field>

In conformity with this law Captain Samuel F.

Tompkins, of New-York, be appointed a Brigadier General of volunteers. Yours truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, IHi. Stanton replied on March 28, enclosing papers in relation to the promotion of Colonel George W. B. Tompkins of the Eighty- second New York Infantry. Under date of March 17, George T. Brown, sergeant-at-arms to the Committee on the Conduct of the War, reported that Colonel Tompkins had been useful in testifying when Brown was gathering evidence against General Charles P. Stone, and that Tompkins should be protected against reprisals from Stone (DLC-RTL). A letter from General McClellan to Stanton dated March 24 in relation to Brown's report, stated that Stone's charges against Tompkins were misbehavior before the enemy at Bull Run and a set of charges involving a false muster, and that since the papers were with General Nathaniel P. Banks and Stone no longer in command, Tompkins need fear no injustice (ibid.). Tompkins was not made a brigadier and left the service May 26, 1862.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Horace Greeley1 March 24, 1862. Private Hon. Horace Greeley--- Executive Mansion, My dear Sir: Washington, March 24, 1862. Your very kind letter of the 16th. to Mr. Colfax, has been shown me by him. I am grateful for the generous sentiments and purposes expressed towards the administration. Of course I am anxious to see the policy proposed in the late special message, go forward; but you have advocated it from the first, so that I need to say little to you on the subject. If I were to suggest anything it would be that as the North are already for the measure, we should urge it persuasively, and not menacingly, upon the South. I am a little uneasy about the abolishment of slavery in this District, not but I would be glad to see it abolished, but as to the time and manner of doing it. If some one or more of the border-states would move fast, I should greatly prefer it; but if this can not be in a reasonable time, I would like the bill to have the three main features---gradual---compensation---and vote of the people---I do not talk to members of congress on the subject, except when they ask me. I am not prepared to make any suggestion about confiscation. I may drop you a line hereafter. Yours truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, NNP. Greeley's letter to Colfax has not been located, but his reply to Lincoln, presumably incorrectly dated by Greeley "Mar. 24," and certainly incorrectly cataloged in the Lincoln Papers as "Nov. 24, 1862,"reads as follows: "I thank you for your kind letter of yesterday. "I am sure you will find great patience in the country as well as in Congress with regard to all action respecting slavery if it can only be felt that things are going ahead. The stagnation of the grand Army has given life to all manner of projects which would be quiet if the War had been going vigorously on. If you think it best that the bill for Emancipation in the district shall embody a clause of submission to the people of the district, it can easily be so amended. I will advocate it in the Tribune if you desire it. If such vote be deemed requisite, I hope it may be taken on the 4th of July next. "I hear with regret that there is danger of difference between the Secretary of War and Gen. Fremont. I pray you to see that this be obviated. I do not know that F. is a great general; but I do know that our loyal people, with scarcely an exception, are anxious that he should be permitted to show what he is. Now if he is left without a decent force---Army corps---or not allowed to select his own staff, it will be generally thought that he has been crippled, and the government will be blamed for whatever ill [?] fortune [?] may befall. Pray look to this."(DLC-RTL).</field>

I think I can prove. . . he is innocent."On February 20, 1862, a military commission had sentenced Ebenezer Magoffin to death on a charge of violation of parole, after finding him not guilty on a charge of murder. Lincoln ordered the sentence suspended, and in April Lee recommended dismissal of the sentence and release on parole.

      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 April 9. 1862 Major General McClellan. Washington, My dear Sir. April 9. 1862 Your despatches complaining that you are not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much. Blencker's Division was withdrawn from you before you left here; and you knew the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in it---certainly not without reluctance. After you left, I ascertained that less than twenty thousand unorganized men, without a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the defence of Washington, and Manassas Junction; and part of this even, was to go to Gen. Hooker's old position. Gen. Banks' corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was diverted, and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strausburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented, (or would present, when McDowell and Sumner should be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahanock, and sack Washington. My explicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of all the commanders of Army corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell. I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Mannassas Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up, and nothing was substituted for it, of course I was not satisfied. I was constrained to substitute something for it myself. And now allow me to ask "Do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond, via Mannassas Junction, to this city to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented by less than twenty thousand unorganized troops?"This is a question which the country will not allow me to evade. There is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you. When I telegraphed you on the 6th. saying you had over a hundred thousand with you, I had just obtained from the Secretary of War, a statement, taken as he said, from your own returns, making 108,000 then with you, and en route to you. You now say you will have but 85,000, when all en route to you shall have reached you. How can the discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for? As to Gen. Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do, if that command was away. I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for you, is with you by this time; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you---that is, he will gain faster, by fortifications and re-inforcements, than you can by re-inforcements alone. And, once more let me tell you, it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow. I am powerless to help this. You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted, that going down the Bay in search of a field, instead of fighting at or near Mannassas, was only shifting, and not surmounting, a difficulty---that we would find the same enemy, and the same, or equal, intrenchments, at either place. The country will not fail to note---is now noting---that the present hesitation to move upon an intrenched enemy, is but the story of Manassas repeated. I beg to assure you that I have never written you, or spoken to you, in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as in my most anxious judgment, I consistently can. But you must act. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, DLC. See Lincoln to McClellan, April 6, supra, for excerpts from McClellan's dispatches.</field>

Altho' the amendments of the Senate were immediately transmitted to our Minister in Nicaragua for submission to the Government of that Republic, he failed, notwithstanding earnest efforts, to induce that government to call an extra session of Congress, to take into consideration the amendments of the Senate of the United States, within the supplementary time named in the Resolution of 27th. June, 1860, for the exchange of ratifications. It was not until the 25th. March, 1861---nearly three months after the expiration of the six months extended by the Senate Resolution, that the Congress of Nicaragua acted favorably upon the amendments of the Senate of the United States. A translation of the decree of the Nicaraguan Government approving the Treaty as amended, with an additional amendment is herewith enclosed. It will be perceived that while the ratification of Nicaragua recites literally the second amendment of the Senate, and accepts it with an additional clause, it does not, in explicit terms, accept the first amendment of the Senate, striking out the last clause of the 16th. Article. That amendment is of so much importance, that the adoption or rejection of it by the Government of Nicaragua should not be left to construction or inference. The final amendment of that government properly extended the time of exchanging ratifications for an additional twelve months. That time has expired. For obvious reasons connected with our internal affairs, the subject has not sooner been submitted to the Senate, but the Treaty is now laid before that Body, with this brief historical sketch and the decree of the Nicaraguan Government, for such further advice as may be deemed necessary and proper in regard to the acceptance or rejection of the amendments of Nicaragua.

      <field name="fulltext">Message to Congress1 April 16, 1862. April 16, 1862. Fellow citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives. The Act entitled "An Act for the release of certain persons held to service, or labor in the District of Columbia"has this day been approved, and signed. I have never doubted the constitutional authority of congress to abolish slavery in this District; and I have ever desired to see the national capital freed from the institution in some satisfactory way. Hence there has never been, in my mind, any question upon the subject, except the one of expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be matters within and about this act, which might have taken a course or shape, more satisfactory to my jud[g]ment, I do not attempt to specify them. I am gratified that the two principles of compensation, and colonization, are both recognized, and practically applied in the act. In the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be presented within ninety days from the passage of the act "but not thereafter"; and there is no saving for minors, femes- covert, insane, or absent persons. I presume this is an omission by mere over-sight, and I recommened that it be supplied by an amendatory or supplemental act. ABRAHAM LINCOLN April 16, 1862. Footnotes 1 ADS, ORB. Lincoln's suggestion concerning supplemental legislation was carried out by Senate Bill 351, approved July 12, 1862.</field>

Pierce Butler of Philadelphia, a South Carolinian by birth and a secession sympathizer who was accused of accepting a Confederate commission, was arrested August 15, 1861, on Secretary Cameron's order, and imprisoned at Fort Lafayette from August 20 to September 24, 1861, when he was released on pledge that he would do no act hostile to the U.S. and would not visit South Carolina without a passport from the Department of State. Butler brought suit against Cameron as a "result of consultation among the Breckinridge leaders, who intend to divide and conquer your administration, and thus bring themselves into power. The Governor of Penna. has directed his law adviser to examine our constitution and laws, with the determination avert the proceedings, if he can do so---but I apprehend Congress only can apply the proper remedy. . . ."(Cameron to Lincoln, April 17, 1862, DLC-RTL).

It is impossible for me to devote sufficient time to the consideration of this case to determine as to its merits. I can only refer the case of Mr. Meyer to the attention of the Secretary of War. A.

The date in indistinct but appears to be April 18. The petition and documents attached show that the case had already gone to Stanton, and that no action had been taken. Meyer, an architect and civil engineer, was a member of the Engineer Corps of the Fifth New York Militia, who at the end of a three months' enlistment in the spring of 1861, had been briefly employed by the Coastal Survey and had then returned to New York City to organize as captain a company in a new regiment. Being attacked and seriously wounded one night by unidentified assailants in Central Park, Meyer was confined to a hospital for a long time. Upon his release, he found himself mustered out of service. His petition was for back pay and expenses for recruiting his company.</field>

My dear Sir: With some reluctance and in accordance with the request made in your letter of the 17th, I have withdrawn the nomination of yourself to the Senate to be one of the commissioners under the act of congress abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. In so far as your letter assumes that the tendering you the office without your solicitation or knowledge, attests my confidence in your loyalty to the United States, now and heretofore, you are entirely right. So far, however, as it assumes that, in my judgment, your imprisonment mentioned, was wholly undeserved, an explanatory word from me is due. I think you made a mistake which justified men having less evidence to the contrary than I had, to suspect your loyalty, and to act accordingly. The arrest, though made by my general authority, was in fact made without my knowledge at the time; but being done, the question of undoing it was a little different from that of the original making; and required a little time to solve it satisfactorily.

      <field name="fulltext">To James W. Ripley3 April 23, 1862. Executive Mansion, Washington, April 23, 1862. It is said that in the case of the contract of S. Dingee &amp; Co. in relation to arms a dispute has arisen as to the proper construction of a clause in an order signed by me, which clause is in these words: "and that all not conforming thereto"(the contract) "be appraised by the ordnance officer at New York, and received at such price as he may determine." This order was prepared with reference to a definite number of arms expected to be delivered within a definite time, and not in reference to an indefinite number to be delivered in an indefinite time. I certainly did not expect that under the clause in question a lot of guns would be appraised at one price at one time, and another lot of precisely the same quality appraised at different prices at another time. I expected that when under the clause the price of a particular quality of gun was fixed it would stand throughout the transaction, neither going down or up. I still think this is the just construction. A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 3 Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session, Senate Executive Document No. 72, p. 116. Solomon Dingee and Company of New York had a contract to deliver 53,500 Austrian-made Enfield rifles at $19 each. On January 10, 1862, Cameron wrote Ripley that "After a careful examination. . . it has been determined that you shall receive the guns offered in accordance with terms of contract . . . . The guns that may not conform to terms. . . you will purchase at their value, of which such ordnance officer as you may designate shall be the judge. . . ."(Ibid., p. 106). Major Peter V. Hagner, ordnance officer at New York, had set valuations on certain arms offered but not conforming to terms of contract. Captain Silas Crispin (see Lincoln to Ripley, April 15, supra), who replaced Hagner, refused to allow the valuations placed on the arms, interpreting Cameron's letter of January 10 to mean that the ordnance officer in charge should evaluate in accordance with the market value at the time of offering. The case was finally settled by Dingee's offer, accepted by Stanton, June 25, 1862, to substitute English Enfield rifles at $19 in sufficient numbers to complete the contract within ninety days.</field>

Elsewhere on the American continent it is struggling against the inroads of anarchy, which invites foreign intervention. Let the American States, therefore, draw closer together and animate and reassure each other, and thus prove to the world that, although we have inherited some of the errors of ancient systems, we are nevertheless capable of completing and establishing the new one which we have now chosen.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate1 May 1--- 1862 Executive Mansion, Washington, To the Senate of the United States: May 1--- 1862 In answer to the Resolution of the Senate in relation to Brigadier General Stone, I have the honor to state that he was arrested, and imprisoned under my general authority, and upon evidence which, whether he be guilty or innocent, required, as appears to me, such proceedings to be had against him for the public safety. I deem it incompatable with the public interest, as also perhaps, unjust to General Stone, to make a more particular statement of the evidence. He has not been tried because in the state of military operations, at the time of his arrest and since, the officers to constitute a court-martial, and for witnesses, could not be withdrawn from duty without serious injury to the service. He will be allowed a trial without any unnecessary delay; the charges and specifications will be furnished him in due season; and every facility for his defence will be afforded him by the War Department.

      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 May 9, 1862. Major General McClellan. Fort Monroe, Va. My dear Sir: May 9, 1862. I have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing the part of a despatch to you, relating to Army Corps, which despatch of course will have reached you long before this will. I wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject. I ordered the Army Corps organization not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve Generals whom you had selected and assigned as Generals of Division, but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man I could get an opinion from, and every modern military book, yourself only expected. Of course, I did not, on my own judgment, pretend to understand the subject. I now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard. It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets, and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I have had no word from Sumner, Heintzelman, or Keyes.2 The commanders of these Corps are of course the three highest officers with you, but I am constantly told that you consult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz John Porter, and perhaps General Franklin.3 I do not say these complaints are true or just; but at all events it is proper you should know of their existence. Do the Commanders of Corps disobey your orders in any thing? When you relieved General Hamilton4 of his command the other day, you thereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in the Senate. And here let me say, not as applicable to you personally, that Senators and Representatives speak of me in their places as they please, without question; and that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to them for taking no greater liberty with them. But, to return, are you strong enough-are you strong enough, even with my help-to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes all at once? This is a practical and very serious question for you. The success of your army and the cause of the country are the same; and of course I only desire the good of the cause. Yours truly. A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 Copy, DLC-RTL; copy, DLC-Stanton Papers. The copy in the Stanton Papers is in Stanton's handwriting. McClellan's dispatch to Stanton, received May 9, 12:19 A.M., reads in part as follows: "I respectfully ask permission to reorganize the army corps. I am not willing to be held responsible for the present arrangement, experience having proved it to be very bad, and it having very nearly resulted in a most disastrous defeat. I wish either to return to the organization by division or else be authorized to relieve incompetent commanders of army corps. Had I been one-half hour later on the field on the 5th we would have been routed. . . . Notwithstanding my positive orders I was informed of nothing that had occurred. . . . At least a thousand lives were really sacrificed by the organization into corps. "I have too much regard for the lives of my comrades and too deep an interest in the success of our cause to hesitate for a moment. I learn that you are equally in earnest, and I therefore again request full and complete authority to relieve from duty with this army commanders of corps or divisions who prove themselves incompetent."(OR,I,XI,III,153-54). No reply from McClellan has been located. The Army Corps organization was retained, but on May 18 General Orders No.125 established the Fifth and Sixth Provisional Corps under Generals Fitz-John Porter and William B. Franklin. 2 Brigadier General Edwin V. Sumner commanded the Second Corps, Brigadier General Samuel P. Heintzelman the Third Corps, and Brigadier General Erasmus D.

You well know, gentlemen, and the world knows, how reluctantly I accepted this issue of battle forced upon me, on my advent to this place, by the internal enemies of our country. You all know, the world knows the forces and resources the public agents have brought into employment to sustain a Government against which there has been brought not one complaint of real injury committed against society, at home or abroad. You all may recollect that in taking up the sword thus forced into our hands this Government appealed to the prayers of the pious and the good, and declared that it placed its whole dependence upon the favor of God. I now humbly and reverently, in your presence, reiterate the acknowledgment of that dependence, not doubting that, if it shall please the Divine Being who determines the destinies of nations that this shall remain a united people, they will, humbly seeking the Divine guidance, make their prolonged national existence a source of new benefits to themselves and their successors, and to all classes and conditions of mankind.

Footnotes 2 AD, IHi. At the top of the page preceding Lincoln's instructions, Montgomery C. Meigs wrote: "Prepared in addition to the instructions of Gen McDowell of 17, May '62."On the bottom and verso Meigs continued: "17, May 62 "The President having shown this to me I suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case &amp; that to give instructions to Gen McClellan to this same end &amp; furnish Gen McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the President. He desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to Gen McClellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary. Respy. MCM. "To the Secretary of War" The order prepared by Meigs "on consultation of the President, Generals Totten, Meigs and Ripley, and Colonel [Joseph P.?] Taylor"and issued to McDowell on May 17, by Secretary Stanton is as follows: "General: Upon being joined by General Shields' division, you will move upon Richmond by the general route of the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, cooperating with forces under General McClellan now threatening Richmond from the line of the Pamunkey and York Rivers. "While seeking to establish as soon as possible a communication between your left wing and the right wing of General McClellan, you will hold yourself always in such position as to cover the capital of the nation against a sudden dash of any large body of the rebel forces. "General McClellan will be furnished with a copy of these instructions, and will be directed to hold himself in readiness to establish communication with your left wing and to prevent the main body of the enemy's army from leaving Richmond and throwing itself upon your column before a junction of the two armies is effected. "A copy of his instructions in regard to the employment of your force is annexed."(OR, I, XI, I, 28). The order which Stanton issued to McClellan, as indicated by Meigs' note accompanying Lincoln's autograph addition to the instructions to McDowell, was prepared at the same consolation, but may have been issued a day later. In the Official Records it is dated as follows: "Washington, May 18 [17]---2 P.M. "General: Your dispatch to the President asking re-enforcements has been received and carefully considered. "The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely, and it is believed that even if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route. He is ordered---keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack---so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate, so as to establish this communication as soon as possible, by extending your right wing to the north of Richmond. It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the Pamunkey River. In any event you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will move with between 35,000 and 40,000 men. "A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation. "At your earnest call for re-enforcements he is sent forward to co-operated in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover this city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient co-operation. When General McDowell is in position on your right his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff officers to be prepared to supply him by that route. "The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward."(Ibid., p. 27).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Proclamation Revoking General Hunter's Order of Military Emancipation of May 9, 18621 May 19, 1862 May 19, 1862 By the President of The United States of America. A Proclamation. Whereas there appears in the public prints, what purports to be a proclamation, of Major General Hunter, in the words and figures following, towit:2 Headquarters Department of the South,} Hilton Head, S.C., May 9, 1862.} General Orders No. 11.---The three States of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, comprising the military department of the south, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it becomes a military necessity to declare them under martial law. This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible; the persons in these three States---Georgia, Florida and South Carolina--- heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared forever free. DAVID HUNTER, (Official) Major General Commanding. ED. W. SMITH, Acting Assistant Adjutant General. And whereas the same is producing some excitement, and misunderstanding: therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, president of the United States, proclaim and declare, that the government of the United States, had no knowledge, information, or belief, of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet, any authentic information that the document is genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter, nor any other commander, or person, has been3 authorized by the Government of the United States, to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation, now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void, so far as respects such declaration. I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, to declare the Slaves of any state or states, free, and whether at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintainance of the government, to exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I can not feel justified in leaving to the decision of4 commanders in the field. These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps. On the sixth day of March last, by a special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution to be substantially as follows:1 Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system. The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people most immediately interested in the subject matter. To the people of those states I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue. I beseech you to make the arguments for yourselves. You2 can not if you would, be blind to the signs of the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partizan politics. This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any. It acts3 not the pharisee. The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it is now your high previlege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.4 In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. [L.S.] Done at the City of Washington this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty- sixth.

In a highly uninformed editorial entitled "President Lincoln and His Happy Cabinet,"the New York Herald of May 18, 1862, speculated on the possibility that divisions in the cabinet over Hunter's proclamation might necessitate some changes in its personnel. Seward and Chase were dismissed as possibilities because they "have given up the nigger business,"Welles also, because he wanted only to be allowed "to doze in peace,"but Stanton seemed a likely prospect: "Who, then, remains? Only Secretary Stanton, to whom both Seward and Chase have thrown their dirty linen---the newspapers and the niggers---and who has since been kept at the wash-tub, splashing and scolding in a style more ridiculous than imposing. We do not think Stanton will go. Much as he may admire Hunter's proclamation, he will not risk his office by opposing the President's wishes. . . ."Bennett replied to Lincoln's letter on June 6, 1862, that he had availed himself "at the earliest moment of the hints you gave me relative to the Secretary of war a gentleman and a patriot of whom I have a high opinion. . . .

McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats if the boats were ready at Frederick'sburg,--- unless his march shall be resisted, in which case, the force resisting him, will certainly not be confronting you at Richmond.

I have communicated. . . with Goldsborough. . . The vessels can do nothing without cooperation on land which I will not be in position to afford for several days.

Banks was at Strausburg with about six-thousand men, Shields having been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various places. On the 23rd. a rebel force of seven to ten thousand fell upon one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at Front-Royal, destroying it entirely, crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th. (yesterday) pushed to get North of Banks on the Road to Winchester. Banks ran a race with them, beating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle ensued between the two forces in which Banks was beaten back into full retreat towards Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total route. Geary, on the Manassas Gap R.R. just now reports that Jackson is now near Front-Royal with ten thousand following up &amp; supporting as I understand, the force now pursuing Banks. Also that another force of ten thousand is near Orleans following on in the same direction. Stripped bare, as we are here, it will be all we can do to prevent them crossing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, or above. We have about twenty thousand of McDowell's force moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal; and Gen. Fremont, who was at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg, both these movements intended to get in the enemies near. One more of McDowells Brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry. The rest of his force remains, for the present, at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore, as we can spare, to Harper's Ferry, supplying their places, in some sort, by calling in Militia from the adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the road to Harper's Ferry of which arm, there is not a single one yet at that point. This is now our situation. If McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we should be utterly helpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowells force from you.

McDowell replied that he thought the available forces sufficient and added, "I have not thought my presence needed elsewhere as much as here, but since there is a sufficient doubt to cause you to ask the question I will immediately leave here to go to Washington and will arrive early to- morrow morning, but will not move my headquarters till I have seen you. . . ."(OR, I, XII, III, 243). 2 This sentence was revised by Stanton from Lincoln's, "I send you a despatch from Geary, just received."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate and House of Representatives3 May 26, 1862 May 26, 1862 To the Senate and House of Representatives: The insurrection which is yet existing in the United States, and aims at the overthrow of the federal Constitution and the Union, was clandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open organization in the form of a treasonable provisional government at Montgomery, in Alabama, on the 18th day of February, 1861. On the 12th day of April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of civil war by the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter, which cut off the hope of immediate conciliation. Immediately afterwards all the roads and avenues to this city were obstructed, and the capital was put into the condition of a siege. The mails in every direction were stopped, and the lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces, which had been called out by the government for the defence of Washington, were prevented from reaching the city by organized and combined treasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate and effective organization for the public defence. Congress had indefinitely adjourned. There was no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose whether, using only the existing means, agencies, and processes which Congress had provided, I should let the government fall at once into ruin, or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the Constitution in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it with all its blessings for the present age and for posterity. I thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the departments, to meet on Sunday, the 20th [21st] day of April, 1861, at the office of the Navy Department, and then and there, with their unanimous concurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed to sea, to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the California treasure ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy yard at Boston to purchase or charter, and arm as quickly as possible, five steamships, for purposes of public defence. I directed the commandant of the navy yard at Philadelphia to purchase, or charter and arm, an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to purchase, or charter and arm, an equal number. I directed Commander Gillis1 to purchase, or charter and arm, and put to sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to Commodore DuPont,2 with a view to the opening of passages by water to and from the capital. I directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and efficient services in the matter of his excellency Edwin D. Morgan, the governor of New York, or, in his absence, George D. Morgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who were, by my directions, especially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his department in that crisis, in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the public defence. On the same occasion I directed that Governor Morgan and Alexander Cummings, of the city of New York, should be authorized by the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, to make all necessary arrangements for the transportation of troops and munitions of war, in aid and assistance of the officers of the army of the United States, until communication by mails and telegraph should be completely re-established between the cities of Washington and New York. No security was required to be given by them, and either of them was authorized to act in case of inability to consult with the other. On the same occasion I authorized and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to advance, without requiring security, two millions of dollars of public money to John A. Dix, George Opdyke, and Richard M. Blatchford, of New York, to be used by them in meeting such requisitions as should be directly consequent upon the military and naval measures necessary for the defence and support of the government, requiring them only to act without compensation, and to report their transactions when duly called upon. The several departments of the government at that time contained so large a number of disloyal persons that it would have been impossible to provide safely, through official agents only, for the performance of the duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability, loyalty, and patriotism. The several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by private messengers, who pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities, inland, across the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio and the northern lakes. I believe that by these and other similar measures taken in that crisis, some of which were without any authority of law, the government was saved from overthrow. I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided without authority of law to unofficial persons was either lost or wasted, although apprehensions of such misdirection occurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily overruled. I recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to a resolution which was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th day of last month, which is in these words: "Resolved, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, by investing Alexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money, and authority to purchase military supplies without restriction, without requiring from him any guarantee for the faithful performance of his duties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and by involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged in the business pertaining to the subject-matter of such contracts, especially in the purchase of arms for future delivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and deserves the censure of the House." Congress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in justice if I should leave the censure expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The same sentiment is unanimously entertained by the heads of departments, who participated in the proceedings which the House of Representatives has censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron to say that, although he fully approved the proceedings, they were not moved nor suggested by himself, and that not only the President but all the other heads of departments were at least equally responsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Washington, May 26, 1862. Footnotes 3 Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session, Senate Executive Document No. 50. Cameron wrote Lincoln from St. Petersburg, June 26, 1862, "I must begin this my first letter from Russia, by thanking you for your Message to Congress, in relation to the N. York agencies. It was a good act, bravely done. Right, in itself, as it was, very many men, in your situation, would have permitted an innocent man to suffer rather than incur responsibility. I am glad to see that the leading papers of Europe speak of it, in high terms, as an act of `nobleness'. . . ."(DLC-RTL). 1 John P. Gillis. 2 Samuel F. Du Pont.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To John C. Fremont1 May 27 1862. Major General Fremont. Washington City, D.C. Moorefield May 27 1862. [9.58 P.M.] I see you are at Moorefield. You were expressly ordered to march to Harrisonburg What does this mean? A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 LS, RPB. This telegram is in Stanton's handwriting signed by Lincoln. Fremont replied May 28, 6 A.M., "My troops were not in condition to execute your order---otherwise than has been done. They have marched day &amp; night to do it. The men had had so little to eat that many were weak for want of food &amp; so reported by the Chief Surgeon Having for main object as stated in your telegram, the relief of Genl Banks the line of march followed was a necessity. In executing any order rec'd I take it for granted that I am to exercise discretion concerning it's literal execution according to circumstances if I am to understand that literal obedience to orders is required please say so. I have no desire to exercise any power which you do not think belongs of necessity to my position in the field." (DLC-RTL). On Lincoln's direction Stanton telegraphed Fremont three separate times on May 28 to "move against the enemy."An undated message from Fremont to Stanton in reply to one of these telegrams reads as follows: "Your telegram conveying information from General Hamilton was received at seven this evening. The President's order will be obeyed accordingly."(DLC- RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 May 28. 1862. Major Gen. McClellan Washington, May 28. 1862. What of F. J. Porter's expedition? Please answer. A LINCOLN (Send in Cypher) Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Apparently this message was not received at McClellan's head-quarters until after McClellan had telegraphed a report of General Fitz-John Porter's action of the previous day. McClellan's report dated May 28, 2 P.M., is as follows: "Porter's action of yesterday was truly a glorious victory. Too much credit cannot be given to his magnificent division and its accomplished leader. The route of rebels was complete-- -not a defeat, but a complete rout. Prisoners are constantly coming in; two companies have this moment arrived, with excellent arms. "There is no doubt that the enemy are concentrating everything on Richmond. I will do my best to cut off Jackson, but am doubtful whether I can. "It is the policy and duty of the Government to send me by water all the well-drilled troops available. I am confident that Washington is in no danger. Engines and cars in large numbers have been sent up to bring down Jackson's command. I may not be able to cut them off, but will try. We have cut all but the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad. The real issue is in the battle about to be fought in front of Richmond. All our available troops should be collected here---not raw regiments, but the well-drilled troops. It cannot be ignored that a desperate battle is before us. If any regiments of good troops remain unemployed it will be an irreparable fault committed."(OR, I, XI, I, 35). Randolph B. Marcy replied to Lincoln's prior query at 11 P.M., as follows: "Your despatch to Gen McClellan this moment received and despatched by special messenger to him. In his absence directing operations in front I have the honor to state. . . that the troops under Gen F J Porter marched more than twenty (20) miles yesterday through rain and mud fought six hours and were at the close of the action encumbered with some six hundred (600) killed and wounded including those of the enemy to be buried &amp; cared for with five or six hundred prisoners to be guarded which prevented Genl Porter from pressing forward last night to cut the Fredericksburg and Richmond Rail Road This will be done tomorrow The prisoners that were taken yesterday and are here now say that they were ordered to reinforce Jackson via Hanover Junction and were ordered back to Richmond It is therefore presumed that this is the same force referred to by Genl King"(DLC- RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan2 May 28, 1862. Washington City, D.C. Maj. Gen. McClellan May 28, 1862. 8.40 P.M. I am very glad of Gen. F. J. Porter's victory. Still, if it was a total rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad was not seized. Again, as you say you have all the Railroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg, I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West-Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole force of the enemy is concentrating in Richmond, I think can not be certainly known to you or me. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry, informs us that a large force (supposed to be Jackson's and Ewells) forced his advance from Charlestown to-day. Gen. King telegraphs us from Frederick'sburg that contrabands give certain information that fifteen thousand left Hanover Junction monday morning to re-inforce Jackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you; and I shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due regard to all points.1 A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. McClellan's reaction to this message is indicated by his reply to Stanton on May 30, "From the tone of your dispatches and the President's I do not think that you at all appreciate the value and magnitude of Porter's victory. It has entirely relieved my right flank. . . routed and demoralized a considerable portion of the rebel forces; taken over 750 prisoners; killed and wounded large numbers. . . . It was one of the handsomest things in the war. . . . I regard the burning of South Anna bridges as the least important result of Porter's movement. . . ."(I, XI, I, 37). 1 Lincoln deleted an additional clause: "and last I must be the Judge as to the duty, of the government in this respect."</field>

Two hours later he telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an Engine and six cars on the Virginia Central which he at once sent to communicate with F. J. Porter. Nothing further from McClellan. If Porter effects a lodgement on both R.R. near Hanover C.H. consider whether your force in front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join him. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, RPB. McDowell's reply, received at 5:45 P.M., reads as follows: "I beg leave to report, in reply to your telegram of this morning directing me to consider whether my force in front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join the army under General McClellan, that I do not think, in the present state of affairs, it would be well to attempt to push through a part of that force, or to leave Fredericksburg otherwise than strongly held which could not be done as the troops are now posted.

As soon as the rail-roads can be unloaded I will use them to get the troops forward, so that nothing shall be left undone to catch them.

May 30, 1862 I transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to ratification, a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, Consular privileges and Extradition between the United States and the Republic of Salvador, signed in this City on the 29th. instant. It is believed that, though this instrument contains no stipulation which may not be found in some subsisting Treaty between the United States and Foreign Powers, it will prove to be mutually advantageous. Several of the Republics of this hemisphere, among which is Salvador, are alarmed at a supposed sentiment tending to reactionary movements against Republican institutions on this continent. It seems therefore to be proper that we should show to any of them who may apply for that purpose, that, compatibly with our cardinal policy and with an enlightened view of our own interests, we are willing to encourage them by strengthening our ties of good will and good neighborhood with them.

Quite certainly they were within it two days ago. Some part of these forces attacked Harper's Ferry at dark last evening, and are still in sight this morning. Shields---with McDowell's advance. re-took Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a dozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, one hundred and fifty of the enemy, two locomotives and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved the bridge. Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or near Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day. Banks, at Williamsport, with his old force, and his new force at Harpers Ferry, is directed to co-operate. Shields, at Front-Royal, reports a rumor of still an additional force of the enemy, supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia. This last may or may not be true.

Fremont June 13 1862 We can not afford to keep your force, and Banks', and McDowell's, engaged in keeping Jackson South of Strasburg and Front-Royal. You fought Jackson alone, and worsted him. He can have no substantial reinforcement, so long as a battle is pending at Richmond. Surely you and Banks in supporting distance are capable of keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if Sigel be sent forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to other work, Jackson will break through at Front Royal again. He is already on the right side of the Shenandoah to do it, and on the wrong side of it to attack you. The orders already sent you and Banks place you and him in the proper positions for the work assigned you. Jackson can not move his whole force on either of you, before the other can learn of it, and go to his assistance. He can not divide his force, sending part against each of you because he will be too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the order of the 8th. and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th. and neither you nor Banks will be overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper scouts-look-outs, and beacons of smokes by day, and fires by night, you can always have timely notice of the enemies approach.

      <field name="fulltext">To John C. Fremont3 June 15, 1862. War Department, Washington City, D.C., Major-General Fremont: June 15, 1862. My Dear Sir: Your letter of the 12th, by Colonel Zagonyi, is just received. In answer to the principal part of it I repeat the substance of an order of the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since. We have no indefinite power of sending re-enforcements; so that we are compelled rather to consider the proper disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish to have. We may be able to send you some dribs by degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone beat Jackson last Sunday I argue that you are stronger than he is to-day, unless he has been re- enforced; and that he cannot have been materially re-enforced, because such re-enforcement could only have come from Richmond, and he is much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is to come to him. Neither is very likely. I think Jackson's game---his assigned work---now is to magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and thus by constant alarms keep three or four times as many of our troops away from Richmond as his own force amounts to. Thus he helps his friends at Richmond three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game is not to allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you to halt at Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the objects being to guard against Jackson's returning by the same route to the Upper Potomac, over which you have just driven him out, and at the same time give some protection against a raid into West Virginia. Already I have given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead, if, on full consideration, you think best. I do not believe Jackson will attack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and if he comes upon you in superior force you have but to notify us, fall back cautiously, and Banks will join you in due time. But while we know not whether Jackson will move at all, or by what route, we cannot safely put you and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave no force on the Front Royal line, the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The true policy is to place one of you on one line and the other on the other, in such positions that you can unite on either once you actually find Jackson moving upon it. And this is precisely what we are doing. This protects that part of our frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the assistance of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to have it deranged. While you have only asked for Sigel I have spoken only of Banks, and this because Sigel's force is now the principal part of Banks's force. About transferring General Schenck's command, the purchase of supplies, and the promotion and appointment of officers1 mentioned in your letter, I will consult with the Secretary of War to-morrow. Yours, truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 3 OR, I, XII, I, 661. Fremont's letter delivered by his aide-de-camp Colonel Charles Zagonyi, read as follows: "The situation here gives me some anxiety and I wish therefore to trouble you with a few lines. We have been operating against the enemy with a force greatly inferior to his. He has been still farther re- enforced and my men have been exhausted by the demand made upon them. . . . I have asked you by telegraph which I send forward this afternoon to direct General Sigel with his force immediately to report to me here. . . . In the battle at Cross Keys I do not think I had 10,000 men, the enemy according to all acounts. . . not less than 20,000. . . . I ought to have a moveable corps of not less than 30000 men. . . . I should also have the power. . . to order the proper officer to procure immediately and as they are required such supplies as are necessary. . . . I hope that you will find it agreeable to your views to give me what I ask &amp; that you will be good enough to give me a reply as soon as you have considered the subject. . . . I have to ask that you will have the appointment of Col. Anselm Albert as Brig. Genl. confirmed as well as that of Brig Genl. Stahel. . . . I still continue to desire. . . that you will permit me to raise a cavalry regiment to be commanded by Col. Zagonyi whom I send to you with this letter. . . . The Secretary of War informed me that if there should be officers in this command with whom it was not agreeable to me to act they could be transferred. . . . I avail myself of this assurance to ask that Brig. General Schenck be transferred from my Dept.

      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 June 15, 1862 War Department Washington City, D. C. Major General McClellan June 15, 1862 My dear Sir: The night between your two late battles of Saturday and Sunday, I went earnestly to work to find a way of putting Gen. Wool's force under your control without wounding any one's feelings.2 But after all, Gen. Dix was a little hurt at being taken from an independent command and put in a dependent one.3 I could not help this without giving up the principal object of the move. So soon as you can, (which I do not expect is yet,) I wish you to give me the benefit of your suggestions as to how an independent command can be given him without detriment. The Secretary of War has turned over to me your despatch about sending McDowell to you by water, instead of by land.4 I now fear he can not get to you either way in time. Shields' Division has got so terribly out of shape, out at elbows, and out at toes, that it will require a long time to get it in again. I expect to see McDowell within a day or two, when I will again talk with him about the mode of moving. McCall's Division has nearly or quite reached you by now. This, with what you get from Gen. Wool's old command, and the new regiments sent you, must give you an increase since the late battles of over twenty thousand. Doubtless the battles and other causes have decreased you half as much in the same time; but then the enemy have lost as many in the same way. I believe I would come and see you, were it not that I fear my presence might divert you and the army from more important matters. Yours truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS copy, DLC-RTL. 2 AGO General Orders No. 57, June 1, 1862, extended McClellan's Department of Virginia to include Wool's command at Fort Monroe, assigned Wool to command the Middle Department at Baltimore, and Dix to command at Fort Monroe and to report to McClellan for orders. 3 Dix telegraphed Lincoln at 6:45 P.

      <field name="fulltext">To John C. Fremont1 June 16, 1862 "Cypher" Major General Fremont Washington City, D.C. Mount Jackson, Va. June 16, 1862 Your despatch of yesterday reminding me of a supposed understanding that I would furnish you a corps of thirty five thousand men, and asking of me "the fulfillment of this understanding"is received. I am ready to come to a fair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfillment of understandings. Early in March last, when I assigned you to the command of the Mountain Department, I did tell you I would give you all the force I could, and that I hoped to make it reach thirty five thousand. You, at the same time told me that, within a reasonable time, you would seize the Railroad at, or East of, Knoxville, Tenn. if you could. There was then in the Department a force supposed to be twentyfive thousand---the exact number as well known to you as to me. After looking about two or three days you called and distinctly told me that if I would add the Blecker [Blenker] Division to the force already in the Department, you would undertake the job. The Blecker [Blenker] division contained ten thousand; and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to Gen. McClellan, I took it from his army, and gave it to you. My promise was litterally fulfilled. I had given you all I could, and I had given you very nearly if not quite thirtyfive thousand. Now for yours. On the 23rd. of May, largely over two months afterwards, you were at Franklin Va, not within three hundred miles of Knoxville, nor within eighty miles of any part of the Railroad East of it---and not moving forward, but telegraphing here that you could not move for lack of everything. Now, do not misunderstand me. I do not say you have not done all you could. I presume you met unexpected difficulties; and I beg you to believe that as surely as you have done your best, so have I. I have not the power now to fill up your corps to thirtyfive thousand. I am not demanding of you to do the work of thirtyfive thousand. I am only asking of you to stand cautiously on the defensive, get your force in order, and give such protection as you can to the valley of the Shenandoah, and to Western Virginia. Have you received the orders? and will you act upon them?1 A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Fremont's telegram received at 3 P. M. on June 15, reminded Lincoln that "when assigned to this command I was informed that I should have a corps of thirty five thousand men I now ask from the President the fulfillment of this understanding. . . ."(DLC-RTL). 1 Fremont telegraphed in reply the same day that he had received the orders and "as a matter of course I will act upon them as I am now doing."(Ibid.). Upon reports arriving at the War Department which indicated that Fremont understood his orders to require him to remain at Mount Jackson regardless of circumstances, Stanton at Lincoln's direction telegraphed Fremont on June 17 that the president "does wish you to hold your position at Mount Jackson if you can safely do so; but if pressed beyond your strength that you will then fall back toward Strasburg for support from General Banks. General Banks is now here, and will see you immediately upon his return to his command." (OR, I, XII, I, 663).</field>

The information you give is valuable. You say it is fortunate that Fremont did not intercept Jackson---that Jackson had the superior force, and would have over-whelmed him. If this is so, how happened it that Fremont fairly fought and worsted him on the 8th.? Or, is the account that he did fight and worst him, false, and fabricated? Both Gen. Fremont and you speak of Jackson having beaten Shields. By our accounts, he did not beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He did meet, and drive back with disaster, about two thousand of Shields' advance, till they were met by an additional Brigade of Shields, when Jackson himself turned and retreated. Shields himself, and more than half his force, were not nearer than twenty miles of any of it.3 A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, RPB. Schurz's seven-page letter written from Fremont's headquarters on June 12 reads in part as follows: "When I took leave of you, you authorized me to send you a confidential report about the condition of things in this Department. . . . I have already seen and heard enough to give a reliable opinion. . . . It is a fact. . . that, when you ordered Gen. Fremont to march from Franklin to Harrisonburg, it was absolutely impossible to carry out the order. The army was in a starving condition and literally unable to fight. . . . it is undoubtedly a very fortunate circumstance that Gen. Fremont did not succeed in placing himself across Jacksons line of retreat; for Jacksons force was so much superior (all the Generals. . . put at 25,000 as the very lowest) that he would in all probability have been beaten. . . ."(DLC-RTL). 3 Schurz replied to Lincoln's questions in a telegram received at 5:40 P.M. on June 16, as follows: "Your Despatch received About the correctness of Genl Fremonts report there can be no question When he attacked Jackson at Cross Keyes the cooperation of Genl Shields was expected Jackson being immediately between them when Shields withdrew and Jackson was largely reinforced. The conditions were no longer the same and it was in reference to this new state of things that my letter was written. As to Shields I wrote on the information I had More by letter"(DLC-RTL).

If large re-inforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one of two things, either that they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to defend the place desperately. On reflection, I do not see how re-inforcements from Richmond to Jackson could be in Gordon'sville as reported by the Frenchman.

      <field name="fulltext">Remarks to a Delegation of Progressive Friends3 June 20, 1862 June 20, 1862 The President said that, as he had not been furnished with a copy of the memorial in advance, he could not be expected to make any extended remarks. It was a relief to be assured that the deputation were not applicants for office, for his chief trouble was from that class of persons. The next most troublesome subject was Slavery. He agreed with the memorialists, that Slavery was wrong, but in regard to the ways and means of its removal, his views probably differed from theirs. The quotation in the memorial, from his Springfield speech, was incomplete. It should have embraced another sentence, in which he indicated his views as to the effect upon Slavery itself of the resistance to its extension. The sentiments contained in that passage were deliberately uttered, and he held them now. If a decree of emancipation could abolish Slavery, John Brown would have done the work effectually. Such a decree surely could not be more binding upon the South than the Constitution, and that cannot be enforced in that part of the country now. Would a proclamation of freedom be any more effective? Mr. Johnson replied as follows: "True, Mr. President, the Constitution cannot now be enforced at the South, but you do not on that account intermit the effort to enforce it, and the memorialists are solemnly convinced that the abolition of Slavery is indispensable to your success." The President further said that he felt the magnitude of the task before him, and hoped to be rightly directed in the very trying circumstances by which he was surrounded. Wm. Barnard addressed the President in a few words, expressing sympathy for him in all his embarrassments, and an earnest desire that he might, under divine guidance, be led to free the slaves and thus save the nation from destruction. In that case, nations yet unborn would rise up to call him blessed and, better still, he would secure the blessing of God. The President responded very impressively, saying that he was deeply sensible of his need of Divine assistance. He had sometime thought that perhaps he might be an instrument in God's hands of accomplishing a great work and he certainly was not unwilling to be. Perhaps, however, God's way of accomplishing the end which the memorialists have in view may be different from theirs. It would be his earnest endeavor, with a firm reliance upon the Divine arm, and seeking light from above, to do his duty in the place to which he had been called. Footnotes 3 New York Tribune, June 21, 1862. Less extended but similar reports appeared in other papers. The delegation called upon the president to present a memorial praying him to decree the emancipation of the slaves, which had been adopted by the annual meeting of the Progressive Friends. Members of the delegation were: Thomas Garrett, Alice Eliza Hambleton, Oliver Johnson, Dinah Mendenhall, William Barnard, and Eliza Agnew.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate1 June 23, 1862 To the Senate of the United States. June 23, 1862 On the 7th. day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of a Treaty between the United States and Mexico, which had been proposed to me by Mr Corwin, our Minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the advice of the Senate there-upon. On the 25th. day of February, last, a resolution was adopted by the Senate to the effect, "That it is not advisable to negotiate a Treaty that will require the United States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European Powers." This resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was immediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to consider his instructions, upon the subject referred to, modified by this resolution, and would gove[r]n his course accordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr Corwin, by reason of the disturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr Corwin being without instructions or thus practically left without instructions to negotiate further with Mexico. In view of the very important events occurring there, he has thought that the interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that Republic. He has therefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the Government of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration. The action of the Senate of course is conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties on my part. I have nevertheless thought it just to our excellent Minister in Mexico, and respectful to the Government of that Republic, to lay the treaties before the Senate,---together with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them. In performing this duty, I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate cannot be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may think proper to give upon the subject.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate1 June 23, 1862 To the Senate of the United States: June 23, 1862 The bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, entitled "An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits the circulation of bank notes of a less denomination than five dollars in the District of Columbia,"2 has received my attentive consideration; and I now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following objections: 1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation, prohibiting the circulation of bank notes of a less denomination than five dollars within the District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my judgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make such a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie payments; and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical operation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or unauthorized. If this view be correct, the currency of the District, should this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious injury of honest trade and honest labor. 2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and beneficially attained. During the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the national government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing circumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private, except interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to me, namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension, can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of less denomination than five dollars. Such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the bill; would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest; would greatly facilitate payments, to soldiers and other creditors, of small sums; and would furnish to the people a currency as safe as their own government.3 Entertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to withhold from it my approval, and return it for the further consideration and action of Congress. June 23, 1862. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any General in the country.

Footnotes 1 New York Times, June 26, 1862. On Monday, June 23, Lincoln had left Washington on an unannounced trip to West Point for consultation with General Winfield Scott. Returning late at night, he was met at the Jersey City station by a small crowd who called for a speech. The substance of Lincoln's conference with Scott is indicated in Scott's memorandum in the Lincoln Papers: "The President having stated to me, orally, the present numbers &amp; positions of our forces in front of the rebel armies, south &amp; South west of the Potomack, has done me honor to ask my views, in writing, as to the further dispositions now to be made, of the former, &amp; particularly of the army under McDowell, towards the suppression of the rebellion. "Premising that, altho' the statements of the President were quite full &amp; most distinct &amp; lucid---yet from my distance from the scenes of operation, &amp; not having, recently, followed them up, with closeness---many details are still wanted to give professional value to my suggestions---I shall, nevertheless, with great deference, proceed to offer such as most readily occur to me---each of which has been anticipated by the President. "I consider the numbers &amp; positions of Fremont &amp; Banks, adequate to the protection of Washington against any force the enemy can bring by the way of the Upper Potomack, &amp; the troops, at Manassas junction, with the garrisons of the forts on the Potomack &amp; of Washington, equally adequate to its protection on the South. "The force at Fredericksburg seems entirely out of position, &amp; it cannot be called up, directly &amp; in time, by McClellan, from the want of rail-road transportation, or an adequate supply train, moved by animals. If, however, there be a sufficient number of vessels, at hand, that force might reach the head of York river, by water, in time to aid in the operations against Richmond, or in the very improbable case of disaster, there, to serve as a valuable reinforcement to McClellan. "The defeat of the rebels, at Richmond, or their forced retreat, thence, combined with our previous victories, would be a virtual end of the rebellion, &amp; soon restore entire Virginia to the Union. "The remaining important points to be occupied, by us, are---Mobile, Charleston, Chattanooga. These must soon come into our hands. "McDowell's force, at Manassas, might be ordered to Richmond, by the Potomack &amp; York rivers, &amp; be replaced, at Manassas, by King's brigade, if there be adequate transports at, or near Alexandria.

My dear Sir: I have been considering the appeal made by yourself, and Senator Pearce in behalf of Judge Carmichael. His charge to the Grand-Jury, was left with me by the Senator, and, on reading it, I must confess I was not very favorably impressed towards the Judge. The object of the charge, I understand, was to procure prossecutions, and punishment of some men for arresting, or doing violence to some secessionists---that is, the Judge was trying to help a little, by giving the protection of law to those who were endevoring to overthrow the Supreme law---trying if he could find a safe place for certain men to stand on the constitution, whilst they should stab it in another place. But possibly I am mistaken. The Secretary of War and I have agreed that if the Judge will take the oath of allegiance, usually taken in such cases, he may be discharged. Please ascertain, and inform me whether he will do it. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ADfS, DLC-RTL. The circumstances of the arrest of Judge Richard B. Carmichael, whose release was requested by Representative Crisfield and Senator James A. Pearce of Maryland, are recounted in the report of General John A. Dix to Secretary Stanton, June 25, 1862, which reads in part as follows: "In October [October 3, 1861] last I was authorized by the Secretary of State to arrest Judge R. B. Carmichael of [Talbot County] the Eastern Shore of Maryland, if I should deem it expedient . . . and if necessary in his own Court. In the communication . . . was enclosed a printed memorial . . . to the Legislature of Maryland, signed by him and expressing the most disloyal sentiments. . . . I did not . . . deem it advisable to make the arrest at that time. Soon afterwards a Military arrest was made on the Eastern Shore . . . in a county in Judge Carmichael's District, by Officer of the Second Regiment of Delaware Volunteers. At the next term of the Court, the Judge charged the Grand jury that it was their duty to present all persons concerned in such arrest. . . . His charges in . . . other Counties as well as this, were of a most disloyal and offensive character. . . . Under the charge referred to the Hon. Henry H. Goldsborough, President of the Senate of Maryland and several officers of the 2nd. Delaware . . . I was informed that bills of indictment had been found against them. The trial of the Hon. Mr. Goldsborough was expected to take place in . . . May last, and four Officers of the Delaware Regiment were summoned as witnesses in his behalf. They came to me and expressed a great unwillingness to obey . . . as they had been presented by the Grand jury . . . and would be arrested if they made their appearance in the county. . . . I dispatched Mr. [Daniel H.] McPhail, Deputy Provost Marshal of the Baltimore Military Police with four police-men to Easton . . . where the Court was in session [May 23-27], to accompany the four officers . . . with instructions to arrest Judge Carmichael, if on consultation with . . . Mr. Goldsborough, it should be thought expedient. . . . It was, on full consideration, deemed expedient that the arrest should be made in Court in order that the proceeding might be the more marked. . . . When Mr. McPhail accompanied by two . . . policemen ascended the bench and respectfully announced to the Judge the order to take him into custody by the authority of the United States, he denied the authority of the Government and made a violent attack on one of the policemen. Mr. McPhail was thus compelled to use force to secure him, and he unluckily received a superficial wound on the head. . . ."(DLC-RTL).

I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could. I feel any misfortune to you and your Army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself. If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington. We protected Washington, and the enemy concentrated on you; had we stripped Washington, he would have been upon us before the troops sent could have got to you.

As Pope now has charge of the Capital, please confer with him through the telegraph. A. L. Footnotes 3 ALS, IHi. McClellan's dispatch to Stanton, June 28, 12:20 A.M., is as follows: "I now know the full history of the day. On this side of the river (the right bank) we repulsed several strong attacks. On the left bank our men did all that men could do, all that soldiers could accomplish, but they were overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, even after I brought my last reserves into action. The loss on both sides is terrible. I believe it will prove to be the most desperate battle of the war. "The sad remnants of my men behave as men. Those battalions who fought most bravely and suffered most are still in the best order. My regulars were superb, and I count upon what are left to turn another battle, in company with their gallant comrades of the volunteers. Had I 20,000 or even 10,000 fresh troops to use to-morrow I could take Richmond, but I have not a man in reserve, and shall be glad to cover my retreat and save the material and personnel of the army. "If we have lost the day we have yet preserved our honor, and no one need blush for the Army of the Potomac. I have lost this battle because my force was too small. "I again repeat that I am not responsible for this, and I say it with the earnestness of a general who feels in his heart the loss of every brave man who has been needlessly sacrificed to- day. I still hope to retrieve our fortunes, but to do this the Government must view the matter in the same earnest light that I do. You must send me very large re-enforcements, and send them at once. I shall draw back to this side of Chickahominy, and think I can withdraw all our material. Please understand that in this battle we have lost nothing but men, and those the best we have. "In addition to what I have already said, I only wish to say to the President that I think he is wrong in regarding me as ungenerous when I said that my force was too weak. I merely intimated a truth which to-day has been too plainly proved. If, at this instant, I could dispose of 10,000 fresh men, I could gain a victory to-morrow. I know that a few thousand more men would have changed this battle from a defeat to a victory. As it is, the Government must not and cannot hold me responsible for the result. "I feel too earnestly to-night. I have seen too many dead and wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that the Government has not sustained this army. If you do not do so now the game is lost. "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. "You have done your best to sacrifice this army."(OR, I, XI, I, 61). McClellan's last two sentences were deleted by Colonel Edward S. Sanford, military supervisor of the telegraph, from the copy delivered to Stanton, and the fact was not known until 1907 when David H. Bates told the story in Lincoln in the Telegraph Office. They were included, however, in McClellan's official report as printed in the Official Records. 4 At Lincoln's direction Stanton telegraphed Halleck on June 28, "immediately to detach 25,000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of Baltimore and Washington to Richmond. . . . The direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by a serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday, the full extent of which is not yet known. . . ."(OR, I, XVI, II, 69).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To William H. Seward3 June 28. 1862. Hon. W. H. Seward Executive Mansion My dear Sir June 28. 1862. My view of the present condition of the War is about as follows: The evacuation of Corinth, and our delay by the flood in the Chicahominy, has enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be no substantial rebel force any where else. But if we send all the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take Washington. Or, if a large part of the Western Army be brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri &amp;c. What should be done is to hold what we have in the West, open the Mississippi, and, take Chatanooga &amp; East Tennessee, without more---a reasonable force should, in every event, be kept about Washington for it's protection. Then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which added to McClellan, directly or indirectly, will take Richmond, without endangering any other place which we now hold---and will substantially end the war. I expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsakes me; and I would publicly appeal to the country for this new force, were it not that I fear a general panic and stampede would follow---so hard is it to have a thing understood as it really is. I think the new force should be all, or nearly all infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 3 ADfS, DLC-RTL. Secretary Seward carried the original letter to New York to show to Union governors in order to get them to issue new calls for troops, but at the New York conference it was decided that a direct official appeal would be preferable, this to be issued in response to a memorial from the governors to the president suggesting the call.

"Fulton"3 of Baltimore American, is now with us. He left White House at 11. A.M. yesterday. He conversed fully with a Pay-Master who was with Porter's force during the fight of Friday and fell back to near McClellan's Quarters, just a little sooner that [sic] Porter did, seeing the whole of it; staid on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy over night and left for White House at 5. AM. Saturday. He says Porter retired in perfect order, under protection of guns, arranged for the purpose, under orders, and not from necessity, and, with all other of our forces, except what was left on purpose to go to White House, was safely in position over the Chickahominy before morning; and that there was heavy firing on the Richmond side began at 5 and ceased at 7 AM. Saturday On the whole, I think we had the better of it up to that point of time. What has happened since we still know not, as we have no communication with Gen. McClellan. A despatch from Col. Ingalls1 shows that he thinks McClellan is fighting with the enemy at Richmond to- day, and will be tomorrow. We have no means of knowing upon what Col Ingalls' founds, his opinion. All confirmed about our saving all property. Not a single unwounded straggler came back to the White-House from the field; and the number of wounded reaching there up to 11. A.M. Saturday was not large. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Seward telegraphed from New York on June 29, "Have you any later news from McClellan."(DLC-RTL). To Lincoln's reply as given above, Stanton added at the end as follows: "To what the President has above stated I will only add one or two points that may be satisfactory for you to know. "1st. All the sick and wounded were safely removed from the White House not a man left behind. "2d A despatch from Burnside shows that he is in condition to afford efficient support and is probably doing so. "3d The despatch from Col Ingalls impresses me with the conviction that the movement was made by General McClellan to concentrate on Richmond, and was successful to the latest point of which we have any information. "4th. Mr Fulton says that on Friday night between twelve and one oclock General McClellan telegraphed Commodore Goldsborough that the result of the movement was satisfactory to him. "5th. From these and the facts stated by the President my inference is, that General McClellan will probably be in Richmond within two days. "EDWIN M STANTON" 2 PM"was added by Stanton. 3 Charles C.

Meigs from Fort Monroe, 2:45 P.M., June 29, "The White House depot was abandoned by me last night at sunset. . . . moving out from the narrow and tortuous Pamunkey some four hundred vessels laden with supplies, quite all of which I now have with me, en route to James River by Fort Monroe, if our arms are successful to-day and to-morrow at Richmond. . . ."(OR, I, XI, III, 273).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Call for Troops2 June 30. 1862. New York, June 30. 1862. To the Governors of the several States: The capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by the national forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about Richmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in fact, there will soon be no formidable insurgent force except at Richmond. With so large an army there, the enemy can threaten us on the Potomac and elsewhere. Until we have re-established the national authority, all these places must be held, and we must keep a respectable force in front of Washington. But this, from the diminished strength of our Army by sickness and casualties, renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the struggle which has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy and success. Rather than hazard the misapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by proclamation, I have deemed it best to address you in this form. To accomplish the object stated we require without delay 150,000 men, including those recently called for by the Secretary of War. Thus re-enforced, our gallant Army will be enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of the Government and the people. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 OR, III, II, 183. This call was drafted by Seward at the New York conference (see Lincoln to Seward, June 28, supra) and telegraphed to Lincoln for approval, but was not issued. Governor Morgan and Governor Curtin attended the conference and Seward communicated with the others by telegraph. At 5 P.M. on June 30, Seward telegraphed Lincoln of a new suggestion---a memorial to the president from the governors, asking that a call be made, and a circular from the president in reply, making a call for 150,000 men. Copies of both memorial and circular were telegraphed to Lincoln for approval (ibid., p. 181). Stanton answered at 9 P.M. that the president had "gone to the country very tired. In the morning you shall have his answer."(Ibid., pp. 181-82). On July 1 Stanton telegraphed that Lincoln approved but suggested 200,000 men (ibid., p. 186). Seward replied at 4 P.M., "The Governors respond, and the Union Committee approve. . . . The number of troops to be called is left to the President to fix. . . ."(Ibid., p. 187).

At 2 P.M. he replied to Lincoln's dispatch, "We have no doubt that McClellan intended to abandon the White House. Our only line of communication with him by telegraph from that point would be along the railroad, which the enemy will hardly give up. "The communication of . . . Goldsborough, telegraphed to Gideon Welles, will have advised you that the general relies on the James River for all his communications hereafter. The commodore was with me an hour ago. I suggested we should extend our wires from Williamsburg to the mouth of the Chickahominy and there communicate by the James River by steamers or carry them on the left bank of the river to Turkey Island Point. . . .

If not, I doubt our ability to hold West Tennessee after detaching so large a force as that called for. . . ."(OR, I, XI, III, 279).

Up to the latest point to which we are posted, he effected everything in such exact accordance with his plan contingently announced to us before the battle began, that we feel justified to hope he has not failed since. He had a severe engagement in getting the part of his army on this side of the Chickahominy over to the other side, in which the enemy lost certainly as much as we did. We are not dissatisfied with this, only that the loss of enemies does not compensate for the loss of friends.

      <field name="fulltext">To Henry W. Halleck4 July 2 1862. "Cypher" Major Gen. Halleck Washington, D.C., Corinth, Miss. July 2 1862. Your several despatches of yesterday to Sec. of War, and myself, received. I did say and now repeat, I would be exceedingly glad for some re-inforcements from you, still do not send a man, if, in your judgment, it will endanger any point you deem important to hold, or will force you to give up, or weaken, or delay the Chattanooga expedition. Please tell me, could you make me a flying visit, for consultation, without endangering the service in your Department? A. LINCOLN Footnotes 4 ALS, RPB. Halleck replied at 6 P.M., "The Enemy attacked us at Booneville yesterday in considerable force. . . . Particulars not yet received--- . . . . According to reports . . . [Braxton] Bragg is preparing to attack us. . . . Under these circumstances I do not think I could safely be absent from my Army, although being somewhat broken in health and wearied . . . a trip to Washington would be exceedingly desirable."(DLC-RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 July 2 1862. Washington, D.C., Major Gen. McClellan July 2 1862. Your despatch of Tuesday morning induces me to hope your Army is having some rest. In this hope, allow me to reason with you a moment. When you ask for fifty thousand men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces, made last spring, for the defence of Washington, and advising a return to that plan.2 I find it included in, and about Washington seventyfive thousand men. Now please be assured, I have not men enough to fill that very plan by fifteen thousand. All of Fremont in the valley, all of Banks, all of McDowell, not with you, and all in Washington, taken together do not exceed, if they reach sixty thousand. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of your Army, seventyfive thousand men East of the mountains. Thus, the idea of sending you fifty thousand, or any other considerable force promptly, is simply absurd. If in your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that I blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of such impression. I only beg that in like manner, you will not ask impossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the Army, material and personal; and I will strengthen it for the offensive again, as fast as I can. The Governors of eighteen states offer me a new levy of three hundred thousand, which I accept. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, IHi. McClellan telegraphed Lorenzo Thomas at 2:45 A.M., July 1, "Another desperate combat to-day. Our troops repulsed the enemy. . . . I have taken steps to adopt a new line, the left resting on Turkey Island, and thence along a ridge parallel to James River as far as I have the force to hold it. . . . I will probably be obliged to change this line in a few days, when I have rested the men, for one lower down. . . . If it is the intention of the Government to re-enforce me largely it should be done promptly and in mass. I need 50,000 more men, and with them I will retrieve our fortunes. More would be well, but that number sent at once, will . . . enable me to assume the offensive. I cannot too strongly urge the necessity of prompt action in this matter. . . . I must apologize for the probable incoherency of this letter. I am exhausted by want of sleep and constant anxiety. . . ."(OR, I, XI, III, 281). 2 On May 26, McClellan had forwarded copies of his instructions to Banks and Wadsworth of March 16 and a copy of his letter to Lorenzo Thomas written on April 1, containing the "plan"which he advised Lincoln to adopt (OR, I, XI, I, 33).</field>

It is three hundred thousand. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Governor Morgan had telegraphed on July 2, "Is the call for 300,000 or for 200,000 volunteers? It appears in all the New York papers for 300,000."(OR, III, II, 199).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate2 July 2, 1862 To the Senate of the United States: July 2, 1862 I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, an act entitled "An act to provide for additional medical officers of the Volunteer service,"without my approval. My reason for so doing is that I have approved an act of the same title passed by Congress after the passage of the one first mentioned, for the express purpose of correcting errors in, and superseding the same, as I am informed. Executive Mansion ABRAHAM LINCOLN. July 2, 1862. Footnotes 2 DS, DNA RG 46, Senate 37A F3. The bill which Lincoln returned (S. 343) had passed the Senate and House on June 11 and 13 respectively.

      <field name="fulltext">To Andrew Johnson4 July 3, 1862. Hon. Andrew Johnson. July 3, 1862. My Dear Sir: You are aware we have called for a big levy of new troops. If we can get a fair share of them in Tennessee I shall value it more highly than a like number most anywhere else, because of the face of the thing, and because they will be at the very place that needs protection. Please do what you can, and do it quickly. Time is everything. A word on another subject. If we could, somehow, get a vote of the people of Tennessee and have it result properly it would be worth more to us than a battle gained. How long before we can get such a vote? Yours truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 4 Hertz, II, 871-72. Governor Johnson replied on July 10, "The number of troops suggested can and will be raised in Tennessee. As to an expression of public opinion as soon as the rebel army can be expelled from East Tennessee there can &amp; will be an expression of public opinion that will surprise you but I am constrained to say one thing as I said to you repeatedly in the fall Genl Buell is not the man to redeem East Tennessee. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 July 3, 1862. Washington City, D.C. Major Genl. McClellan July 3, 1862. Yours of 5.30. yesterday is just received. I am satisfied that yourself, officers and men have done the best you could. All accounts say better fighting was never done. Ten thousand thanks for it. On the 28th. we sent Gen. Burnside an order to send all the force he could spare, to you. We then learned that you had requested him to go to Goldsborough, upon which, we said to him our order was intended for your benefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views. We hope you will have help from him soon. To day we have ordered Gen. Hunter to send you all he can spare.2 At last advices Halleck thinks he can not send reinforcements, without endangering all he has gained.3 A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, IHi. McClellan's dispatch of 5:30 P.M., July 2, sent from Berkeley, Harrison's Bar, via Fort Monroe, reads in part as follows: "I have succeeded in getting this army to this place on the banks of the James. . . . I have lost but one gun. . . . An hour and a half ago the rear of the wagon train was within a mile of camp, and only one wagon abandoned. As usual, we had a severe battle yesterday and beat the enemy badly, the men fighting even better than before. We fell back to this position during the night and morning. Officers and men thoroughly worn-out by fighting every day and working every night for a week. They are in good spirits, and after a little rest will fight better than ever. If not attacked during this day I will have the men ready to repulse the enemy to-morrow. . . . Our losses have been very heavy, for we have fought every day since last Tuesday. I have not yielded an inch of ground unnecessarily, but have retired to prevent the superior force of the enemy from cutting me off and to take a different base of operations. "I thank you for the re- enforcements. Every 1,000 men you send at once will help me much."(OR, I, XI, III, 287-88). 2 At Lincoln's direction Stanton ordered Hunter at Hilton Head, South Carolina, to forward "all the infantry force that can be spared. . . . It is believed that you can forward 10,000. . . ." (Ibid., pp. 290-91). 3 Lincoln's final sentence was inserted to replace the following deletion: "I repeat what I have twice before said, `save the Army, at all events."'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Union Governors2 July 3. 1862. Gov. E. D. Morgan Washington, My dear Sir--- July 3. 1862. [10:30 A.M.] I should not want the half of three hundred thousand new troops, if I could have them now. If I had fifty thousand additional troops here now, I believe I could substantially close the war in two weeks. But time is every-thing; and if I get fifty thousand new men in a month, I shall have lost twenty thousand, old ones during the same month, having gained only thirty thousand, with the difference between old and new troops still against me. The quicker you send, the fewer you will have to send. Time is everything. Please act in view of this. The enemy having given up Corinth, it is not wonderful that he is thereby enabled to check us for a time at Richmond. A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 2 ALS, RPB. Stanton wrote "Private and Confidential"on the top of the manuscript, crossed out "Gov. E.D. Morgan,"and inserted "Yours truly"before Lincoln's signature. This letter seems to have been written primarily to Governor Morgan, but was telegraphed to the other governors also, in view of their common problem. Replies from the several governors (OR, III, II, 201-06) indicate difficulties in meeting the call but promise prompt action.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To John A. Dix3 July 4, 1862 Major Gen. Dix Washington City, D.C. Fort-Monroe. July 4, 1862 Send forward the despatch to Col Hawkins, and this also. Our order, and Gen. McClellan's to Gen. Burnside being the same, of course we wish it executed as promptly as possible. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 3 ALS, RPB. Dix had forwarded at 3 P.M. on July 3 a dispatch from Colonel Rush C. Hawkins at Roanoke Island, July 2, 6 P.M., in which Hawkins asked further orders for Burnside's command (DLC-RTL). Stanton's reply to Hawkins directed that "General Burnside in person, with all the infantry force he can spare, move by way of Hampton Roads and the James River to General McClellan's headquarters to re-enforce him immediately."(OR, I, XI, III, 290). Dix replied to Lincoln at 8:10 P.M., "Soon after sending you Colonel Hawkins' dispatch I received from General McClellan an order to General Burnside to bring on all the troops he could spare. I sent it off immediately with a letter from myself describing to General Burnside the position of General McClellan's army. The steamer having gone, I cannot send your dispatch to Colonel Hawkins until morning. I will do so then, if you desire it."(Ibid.).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Henry W. Halleck1 July 4. 1862. Major Genl. Halleck Washington City, D.C. Corinth---Miss July 4. 1862. You do not know how much you would oblige us, if, without abandoning any of your positions, or plans, you could promptly send us even ten thousand infantry. Can you not? Some part of the Corinth Army is certainly fighting McClellan in front of Richmond. Prisoners are in our hands from the late Corinth Army. A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Halleck replied on July 5, "For the last week there has been great uneasiness among Union men in Tennessee on account of the secret organizations of insurgents to co-operate in any attack of the enemy on our lines. Every commanding officer from Nashville to Memphis has asked for re-enforcements. . . . I submitted the question of sending troops to Richmond to the principal officers of my command. They are unanimous in opinion that if this army is seriously diminished the Chattanooga expedition must be revoked or the hope of holding Southwest Tennessee abandoned. I must earnestly protest against surrendering what has cost us so much . . . and which in a military point of view is worth more than Richmond. . . ."(OR, I, XVI, II, 95). Lincoln forwarded Halleck's dispatch to McClellan on July 5, infra.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan2 July 4. 1862 War Department Washington City, D.C. Major Gen. McClellan: July 4. 1862 I understand your position as stated in your letter, and by Gen. Marcy. To reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible. In addition to that arrived, and now arriving from the Potomac, (about ten thousand, I suppose) and about ten thousand I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about five thousand from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month. Under these circumstances the defensive, for the present, must be your only care. Save the Army---first, where you are, if you can; and secondly, by removal, if you must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as opinion, that with the aid of the Gun-Boats, and the re-inforcements mentioned above, you can hold your present position, provided, and so long as, you can keep the James River open below you. If you are not tolerably confident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon as possible. I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you; yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN P.S. If, at any time, you feel able to take the offensive, you are not restrained from doing so. A. L. Footnotes 2 ADfS, DLC-RTL. McClellan sent his chief of staff Randolph B. Marcy to Washington in order to press his plea for reinforcements. Marcy reported to McClellan on July 4, "I have seen the President and Secretary of War. Ten thousand men from Hunter, 10,000 from Burnside, and 11,000 from here have been ordered to re-enforce you as soon as possible. . . . The President and Secretary speak very kindly of you and find no fault. I will remain here until I hear from you. . . ."(OR, I, XI, III, 294).</field>

PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN: I am indeed very grateful for this courtesy which you have thought fit to extend me (for the time being), the head of the Government. I am exceedingly sorry that the continual and intense engrossment of my attention by other matters has not permitted me to devote a moment's thought to the manner in which I should receive you. I have no pretty speech, or any other sort of speech, prepared, with which to entertain you for a single moment. I am indeed surrounded, as is the whole country, by very trying circumstances. I am grateful to you for the approbation which you give me of what I have done, and grateful for the support which the whole country seems to give me. I hope that, although far advanced in life as many of you are, you will, gentlemen, yet live to see better days than those which it is now our misfortune to behold. Thanking you for the support which you in this manner give me, unprepared as I am, I could not with any degree of entertainment detain you longer. Footnotes 1 New York Tribune, July 7, 1862.

Capt O D Greene Asst Adjt Genl of Buell's staff who exercises command over the troops here so far as to order them wherever he wishes refuses to take notice . . . &amp; afford the necessary relief for Kentucky &amp; Tennessee. This attack is aimed at the . . . Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. . . .

My opinion is that he is at this time in complicity with the traitors here &amp; shall therefor have him arrested &amp; sent beyond the Influence of rebels and traitors if he is not immediately removed. . . . Mr. President since I reached this place there has been a struggle . . . going on between the provost marshalls Brigadier Generals &amp; Staff officers of Genl Buell which has retarded the . . . development of Union sentiment. . . .

I desire an order from you at once reinstating Col Campbell &amp; a transfer of Capt Greene to some post beyond the limits of this State. . . . The commission I hold as I conceive gives me full &amp; ample power to appoint a Prov. Marshal yet I prefer the order from you. I must have the means to execute my orders or abandon the undertaking. . . ."(DLC-RTL). On July 12, at Lincoln's direction, Stanton ordered Captain Oliver D. Greene to release Colonel Lewis D.

      <field name="fulltext">Order Extending the Pacific Railroad1 July 11, 1862 July 11, 1862 Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the Railroad line, called and known as the South West Branch of the Pacific Railroad in the State of Missouri, be repaired, extended and completed, from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the said State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war, and to the maintenance of the authority of the government, in the South West. Therefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled "An act to authorise the President of the United States, in certain cases, to take possession of Railroad and Telegraph lines, and for other purposes" Approved January 31, 1862, it is--- Ordered that the portion of the said Railroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon, be repaired, extended and completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the Government, as speedily as may be. And in as much as, upon the part of the said line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney, a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been done, by the Railroad Company, and the road, to this extent, may be completed at comparatively small cost, it is ordered that the said line, from Rolla to and across Little Piney, be first completed, and as soon as possible. The Secretary is charged with the execution of this order. And, to facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his discretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of the said Railroad line, and the whole or each part of the rolling stock, offices, shops, buildings and all their appendages and appertenances, as he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road, from Rolla to Lebanon.

      <field name="fulltext">Appeal to Border State Representatives to Favor Compensated Emancipation2 July 12, 1862 July 12, 1862 Gentlemen. After the adjournment of Congress, now very near, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months. Believing that you of the border-states hold more power for good than any other equal number of members, I feel it a duty which I can not justifiably waive, to make this appeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation message of last March, the war would now be substantially ended. And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent, and swift means of ending it. Let the states which are in rebellion see, definitely and certainly, that, in no event, will the states you represent ever join their proposed Confederacy, and they can not, much longer maintain the contest. But you can not divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own states. Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break that lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever. Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration; and I trust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for the sake of the whole country I ask "Can you, for your states, do better than to take the course I urge? ["] Discarding punctillio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible even? You prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the nation shall be practically restored, without disturbance of the institution; and if this were done, my whole duty, in this respect, under the constitution, and my oath of office, would be performed. But it is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war can not be avoided. If the war continue long, as it must, if the object be not sooner attained, the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion---by the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of it's value is gone already. How much better for you, and for your people, to take the step which, at once, shortens the war, and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event. How much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in the war. How much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it. How much better for you, as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out, and buy out, that without which the war could never have been, than to sink both the thing to be sold, and the price of it, in cutting one another's throats. I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America for colonization, can be obtained cheaply, and in abundance; and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people will not be so reluctant to go. I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned---one which threatens division among those who, united are none too strong. An instance of it is known to you. Gen. Hunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope, still is, my friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere, could be free. He proclaimed all men free within certain states, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected more good, and less harm from the measure, than I could believe would follow. Yet in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to many whose support the country can not afford to lose. And this is not the end of it. The pressure, in this direction, is still upon me, and is increasing. By conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and much more, can relieve the country, in this important point. Upon these considerations I have again begged your attention to the message of March last. Before leaving the Capital, consider and discuss it among yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen; and, as such, I pray you, consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the consideration of your states and people. As you would perpetuate popular government for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do in no wise omit this. Our common country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest views, and boldest action to bring it speedy relief. Once relieved, it's form of government is saved to the world; it's beloved history, and cherished memories, are vindicated; and it's happy future fully assured, and rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the previlege is given, to assure that happiness, and swell that grandeur, and to link your own names therewith forever. Footnotes 2 AD and ADf, DLC-RTL. Lincoln invited the representatives and senators of the Border States to the White House and read his address to them. On July 14, a majority reply argued against compensated emancipation on the ground that the federal government could not stand the expense, that emancipation in any form would further consolidate the spirit of rebellion in the seceded states and fan the spirit of secession among loyal slaveholders in the Border States, and that emancipation in the Border States would not, as the president supposed, lessen the pressure for "unconstitutional"emancipation by proclamation of the remaining three million slaves in the seceded states, which the majority were unwilling to approve. The majority reply was signed by twenty representatives and senators. On July 15, a minority reply in approval of Lincoln's appeal was signed by John W. Noell of Missouri, Samuel L. Casey of Kentucky, George P. Fisher of Delaware, Andrew J. Clements of Tennessee, William G. Brown, Jacob B. Blair, and Waitman T. Willey of West Virginia. Horace Maynard of Tennessee replied individually on July 16, in support of the appeal. The several replies were published in full by the New York Tribune (July 19) as well as other papers.</field>

I am told that over 160-000 men have gone into your Army on the Peninsula. When I was with you the other day we made out 86,500 remaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I believe 23,500, will cover all the killed, wounded and missing in all your battles and skirmishes, leaving 50-000 who have left otherwise. Not more than 5000 of these have died, leaving 45,000 of your Army still alive, and not with it. I believe half, or two thirds of them are fit for duty to-day. Have you any more perfect knowledge of this than I have? If I am right, and you had these men with you, you could go into Richmond in the next three days. How can they be got to you? and how can they be prevented from getting away in such numbers for the future? A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, IHi. McClellan's telegram received at 8 P.M. on July 15, reads in part as follows: ". . . The difference between the effective force of troops and that expressed in returns is considerable in every Army. All commanders find the actual strength less than the strength represented on paper. I have not my own returns for the tri-monthly period since arriving at Fort Monroe at hand at this moment but even on paper I will not . . . be found to have received one hundred and sixty thousand officers and men present although present and absent my returns will be accountable for that number. . . . I find from official reports that I have present for duty---Officers three thousand two hundred fifteen. Enlisted men Eighty Eight thousand four hundred fifty. In all present for duty Eighty Eight thousand six hundred sixty-five. Absent by authority thirty four thousand four hundred seventy two---without authority three thousand seven hundred seventy eight. Present and absent, One hundred forty four thousand four hundred and seven. The number . . . present sick is sixteen thousand six hundred nineteen. . . . Thus the number . . . really absent is thirty eight thousand two hundred fifty. Unquestionably of the number present some one absent, say forty thousand will cover the absentees. I quite agree with you that more than one half these men are probably fit for duty to-day. I have frequently called the attention lately of the War Dept to the evil of absenteeism. . . . It is to be remembered that many of those absent by authority are those who have got off either sick or wounded . . . and . . . are still reported absent by authority. If I could receive back the absentees and could get my sick men up I would need but small reinforcements to enable me to take Richmond. . . . I can now control people getting away better for the natural opportunities are better. Leakages by desertion occur in every Army and will occur here of course, but I do not at all . . . anticipate anything like a recurrence of what has taken place."(DLC-RTL).</field>

As to the moral character of the institution of Slavery, and as to its political bearing on the institutions of this or any other Nation, he said there was, between him and the committee, no difference of sentiment. He went on to say: "Had Slavery no existence among us, and were the question asked shall we adopt such an institution? we should agree as to the reply which should be made. If there be any diversity in our views it is not as to whether we should receive Slavery when free from it, but as to how we may best get rid of it already amongst us. Were an individual asked whether he would wish to have a wen on his neck, he could not hesitate as to the reply; but were it asked whether a man who has such a wen should at once be relieved of it by the application of the surgeon's knife, there might be diversity of opinion, perhaps the man might bleed to death, as the result of such an operation.

      <field name="fulltext">To the Senate and House of Representatives1 July 17, 1862 July 17, 1862 Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives, Considering the bill for "An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason, and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes"and the Joint Resolution [explanatory of said act,]2 as being substantially one, I have apporved and signed both. Before I was informed of the passage of the Resolution, I had prepared the draft of a Message, stating objections to the bill becoming a law, a copy of which draft is herewith transmitted. [ABRAHAM LINCOLN] [July 17, 1862.] Fellow citizens of the House of Representatives I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the bill for an act entitled "An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes"together with my objections to it's becoming a law. There is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly prospective; and it touches neither person or property, of any loyal citizen; in which particulars, it is just and proper. The first and second sections provide for the conviction and punishment of persons who shall be guilty of treason, and persons who shall "incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion, or insurrection, against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to any such existing rebellion, or insurrection"By fair construction, persons within these sections are not to be punished without regular trials, in duly constituted courts, under the forms, and all the substantial provisions of law, and of the constitution, applicable to their several cases. To this I perceive no objection; especially as such persons would be within the general pardoning power, and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty, contained in this act. It is also provided, that the slaves of persons convicted under these sections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of expression, rather than a substantial objection, in this. It is startling to say that congress can free a slave within a state; and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the nation, and that congress had then liberated, him, the difficulty would at once vanish. And this is the real case. The traitor against the general government forfets his slave, at least as justly as he does any other property; and he forfeits both to the government against which he offends. The government, so far as there can be ownership, thus owns the the [sic] forfeited slaves; and the question for Congress, in regard to them is, "Shall they be made free, or be sold to new masters?"I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in advance that they shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she has been the owner of some slaves by escheat, and that she sold none, but liberated all. I hope the same is true of some other states. Indeed, I do not believe it would be physically possible, for the General government, to return persons, so circumstanced, to actual slavery. I believe there would be physical resistance to it, which could neither be turned aside by argument, nor driven away by force. In this view I have no objection to this feature of the bill. Another matter involved in these two sections, and running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter. I perceive no objection to the third and fourth sections. So far as I wish to notice the fifth, and sixth sections, they may be considered together.1 That the enforcement of these sections would do no injustice to the persons embraced within them, is clear. That those who make a causeless war should be compelled to pay the cost of it, is too obviously just, to be called in question. To give governmental protection to the property of persons who have abandoned it, and gone on a crusade to overthrow that same government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light of justice. The severest justice may not always be the best policy. The principle of seizing, and appropriating the property of the persons embraced within these sections is certainly not very objectionable; but a justly discriminating application of it, would be very difficult, and, to a great extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a power of remission somewhere, so that these persons may know they have something to lose by persisting, and something to save by desisting?1 I am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not within section Thirteen. Without any special act of congress, I think our military commanders, when, in military phrase, "they are within the enemies country"should in an orderly manner, seize and use whatever of real or personal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands; at the same time, preserving, in some way, the evidence of what they do. What I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting on the first and second sections, is applicable to the ninth, with the difference, that no provision is made in the whole act for determining whether a particular individual slave does or does not fall within the classes defined in that section. He is to be free upon certain conditions; but whether those conditions do, or do not pertain to him, no mode of ascertaining is provided. This could be easily supplied. To the tenth section, I make no objection. The oath therein required seems to be proper; and the remainder of the section is substantially identical with an already existing law. The eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary powers upon the executive. Without this law I have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated, as I may at any time deem expedient. And I am ready to say now I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ, as laborers, as many persons of African de[s]cent, as can be used to advantage. The twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than objectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper if all other parts of the act shall stand. That to which I chiefly object, pervades most parts of the act, but more distinctly appears in the first, second, seventh and eighth sections. It is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever. For the causes of treason, and the ingredients of treason, not amounting to the full crime, it declares forfeiture, extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares that "no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted."True, there is to be no formal attainder in this case; still I think the greater punishment can not be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same offence. With great respect, I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act is unconstitutional. It would not be difficult to modify it. I may remark that this provision of the constitution, put in language borrowed from Great Brittain, applies only in this country, as I understand, to real, or landed estate. Again, this act, by proceedings in rem forfeits property, for the ingredients of treason, without a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given him in any proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within our reach, because we can not give personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the govern[ment,] is certainly not very satisfactory; still the owner may not be thus engaged, and I think a reasonable time should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings. Similar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem. For the reasons stated I return the bill to the House in which it originated. Footnotes 1 ADf, DLC-RTL; Thirty-seventh Congress, Second Session, Senate Executive Document No. 70. A forgery of the first page of this message is in the New York Public Library. The present text follows the autograph draft, which is undated and unsigned. The "Act to suppress insurrection. . . ."presented for Lincoln's approval on July 14, was responsible for Lincoln's request that Congress remain in session an extra day (see Lincoln to Foot and to Grow, July 15, supra) in order to receive his message of rejection. On July 15, however, a resolution (H.R. 110) introduced by Representative Horace Maynard correcting portions of the act to which Lincoln most seriously objected, was further amended in the Senate and passed both houses on the same day. Thus Lincoln probably concluded it better to sign the act and the resolution, rather than to reject the act on the other less important objections set forth in his message. 2 Explanatory of said act,]"is in pencil handwriting, not Lincoln's, inserted in the draft in the blank space which Lincoln left for description of the resolution. 1 The joint resolution explanatory of the act, which was passed on July 15 while Lincoln was preparing his message of rejection, undertook to remove some of the objections to section 5 to which Lincoln refers. The language of the resolution is as follows: "Resolved. . . . That the provisions of the third clause of the fifth section . . . shall be so construed as not to apply to any act or acts done prior to the passage thereof; nor to include any member of a State legislature, or judge of any State court, who has not in accepting or entering upon his office, taken an oath to support the constitution of the so-called `Confederate States of America'; nor shall any punishment or proceedings under said act be so construed as to work a forfeiture of the real estate of the offender beyond his natural life." 1 At this point Lincoln deleted the following passage in the draft: "When you extinguish hope, you create desperation. Leave to misguided men, some motive for returning to the Union."</field>

And I hereby make known that it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure for tendering pecuniary aid to the free choice or rejection, of any and all States which may then be recognizing and practically sustaining the authority of the United States, and which may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, gradual abolishment of slavery within such State or States---that the object is to practically restore, thenceforward to be maintain[ed], the constitutional relation between the general government, and each, and all the states, wherein that relation is now suspended, or disturbed; and that, for this object, the war, as it has been, will be, prossecuted. And, as a fit and necessary military measure for effecting this object, I, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, do order and declare that on the first day of January in the year of Our Lord one thousand, eight hundred and sixtythree, all persons held as slaves within any state or states, wherein the constitutional authority of the United States shall not then be practically recognized, submitted to, and maintained, shall then, thenceforward, and forever, be free. Emancipation Proclamation as first sketched and shown to the Cabinet in July 1862.1 Footnotes 2 ADf, DLC-RTL. The first paragraph of this draft was issued as the proclamation of July 25, infra. According to Lincoln's recollection as quoted by Francis B. Carpenter in Six Months at the White House (pp. 20- 22), Montgomery Blair opposed the proclamation of emancipation on the ground that it would cost the administration the fall election, and Seward approved it but proposed that issuance be postponed until military success gave the administration a more favorable position. Bates' Diary is silent on this discussion, but Nicolay and Hay in Abraham Lincoln: A History (VI, 127) record that Bates gave "unreserved concurrence."On the day following the meeting Postmaster General Blair wrote Lincoln a lengthy opinion objecting to the proclamation on political grounds. "There is therefore no public sentiment at the North, even among extreme men which now demands the proposed measure,"he wrote. It would "endanger our power in Congress, and put the power in the next House of Representatives in the hands of those opposed to the war, or to our mode of carrying it on,"but "if adopted to meet foreign intervention and to make issue between the Governments of Europe and the people there,"the measure might be favorably received (D, DLC-Chase Papers). Chase's Diary records the cabinet discussion as follows: "The question of arming slaves was then brought up and I advocated it warmly. The President was unwilling to adopt this measure, but proposed to issue a proclamation, on the basis of the Confiscation Bill, calling upon the States to return to their allegiance . . . adding, on his own part, a declaration of his intention to renew, at the next session of Congress, his recommendation of compensation to States adopting the gradual abolishment of slavery---and proclaiming the emancipation of all slaves within States remaining in insurrection on the first of January, 1863. "I said that I should give to such a measure my cordial support; but I should prefer that no new expression on the subject of compensation should be made, and I thought that the measure of Emancipation could be much better and more quietly accomplished by allowing Generals to organize and arm the slaves . . . and by directing the Commanders of Departments to proclaim emancipation within their Districts as soon as practicable; but I regarded this as so much better than inaction on the subject, that I should give it my entire support. . . ." (Diary and Correspondence of Salmon P. Chase, pp. 48-49). 3 The sixth section provided that property of persons in States in rebellion, who did not cease to give aid to the rebellion within sixty days after proclamation by the president, would be liable to seizure. At Lincoln's direction Stanton prepared on July 22 the Executive Order authorizing seizure of property "which may be necessary or convenient"and the employment of "so many persons of African descent as can be advantageously used for military or naval purposes."This order was issued by the Adjutant General's Office on August 16 as General Orders No. 109. See also Lincoln's memorandum on recruiting Negroes, infra. 1 This endorsement was written by Lincoln on the back of the second page of the draft.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Edwin M. Stanton2 July 22, 1862. Executive Mansion, Hon. Secretary of War. Washington, July 22, 1862. Sir---I think it will be better to do nothing now which can be construed into a demand for troops in addition to the three hundred thousand for which we have recently called. We do not need more, nor, indeed, so many, if we could have the smaller number very soon. It is a very important consideration, too, that one recruit into an old regiment is nearly or quite equal in value to two in a new one. We can scarcely afford to forego any plan within our power, which may facilitate the filling of the old regiments with recruits. If, on consideration, you are of opinion that this object can be advanced, by causing the Militia of the several states to be enrolled, and by drafts therefrom, you are at liberty to take the proper steps, and do so, provided that any number of recruits so obtained from any state within the next three months, shall, if practicable, be an abatement, of the quota of volunteers from such state under the recent call. Yours truly A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 2 ALS, DLC-Stanton Papers. Chase's Diary records that in the cabinet meeting on July 22 Stanton "brought forward a proposition to draft 50,000 men. Mr. Seward proposed . . . 100,000."(Diary and Correspondence of Salmon P. Chase, p. 49). The slowness with which the call for new troops was being met prompted Lincoln to direct Stanton's order of August 4, 1862, calling for a draft of three hundred thousand militia for nine months, which provided that deficiencies in the volunteer quotas under the call of July 1 would be made up by the draft.</field>

This event will occasion mourning in the nation for the loss of a citizen and a public servant whose memory will be gratefully cherished. Although it has occurred at a time when his country is afflicted with division and civil war, the grief of his patriotic friends will measurably be assuaged by the consciousness that, while suffering with disease and seeing his end approaching, his prayers were for the restoration of the authority of the government of which he had been the head, and for peace and good will among his fellow citizens. As a mark of respect for his memory, it is ordered that the Executive Mansion and the several Executive Departments, excepting those of War and the Navy, be immediately placed in mourning, and all business be suspended during to morrow.

      <field name="fulltext">To Reverdy Johnson3 July 26, 1862. PRIVATE Executive Mansion, Hon Reverdy Johnson Washington, July 26, 1862. My Dear Sir. Yours of the 16th. by the hand of Governor Shepley is received. It seems the Union feeling in Louisiana is being crushed out by the course of General Phelps. Please pardon me for believing that is a false pretense. The people of Louisiana---all intelligent people every where---know full well, that I never had a wish to touch the foundations of their society, or any right of theirs. With perfect knowledge of this, they forced a necessity upon me to send armies among them, and it is their own fault, not mine, that they are annoyed by the presence of General Phelps. They also know the remedy---know how to be cured of General Phelps. Remove the necessity of his presence. And might it not be well for them to consider whether they have not already had time enough to do this? If they can conceive of anything worse than General Phelps, within my power, would they not better be looking out for it? They very well know the way to avert all this is simply to take their place in the Union upon the old terms. If they will not do this, should they not receive harder blows rather than lighter ones? You are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies. I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends, who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing. You remember telling me the day after the Baltimore mob in April 1861, that it would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over Maryland soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the next autumn which in turn elected a very excellent Union U. S. Senator! I am a patient man---always willing to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance; and also to give ample time for repentance. Still I must save this government if possible. What I cannot do, of course I will not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed. Yours truly A LINCOLN Footnotes 3 Copy, DLC-RTL. The copy is in John Hay's handwriting. Reverdy Johnson, who had been appointed by the Department of State as a special agent to investigate and report on complaints by foreign consuls against military proceedings in New Orleans under Benjamin F. Butler, wrote that "So far, for want, mainly, of adequate military force, little has been done but to obtain the possession of this City, &amp; the Country, immediately surrounding it. . . . Whatever Union feeling (&amp; it is said to have been extensive---) there was . . . has nearly subsided, &amp; principally, from an impression that it is the purpose of the Govt. to force the Emancipation of the slaves. This impression grows, in a great measure, from the course of Genl. Phelps. . . . Depend upon it, my Dear Sir, that unless this is at once corrected, this State cannot be, for years, if ever, reinstated in the Union. . . ."(DLC-RTL). Brigadier General John S. Phelps was military governor of Arkansas and Louisiana. In May, Butler placed Colonel George F. Shepley of the Twelfth Maine Volunteers in command at New Orleans, and in June Shepley became military governor of Louisiana. On September 5, 1862, Reverdy Johnson answered Lincoln's letter, which had been forwarded from New Orleans to Washington, "Your private letter to me of the 26th of July, has been forwarded to me from New Orleans. When, some days since, you read a copy of it to me, in the presence of some Louisiana Gentlemen, I deemed it due to us both, to correct you in a fact that it alleged. It was that I told you `the day after the Baltimore mob of April `61, that it would crush all union feeling in Maryland, for me to attempt bringing troops over Md. soil to Washington.'

      <field name="fulltext">To Cuthbert Bullitt2 July 28. 1862 PRIVATE Cuthbert Bullitt Esq Washington D.C. New Orleans La. July 28. 1862 Sir: The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant, has been shown to me. The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely sincere man. The first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the Secession Ordinance of Louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true; and in that fact may be found some instruction. Why did they allow the Ordinance to go into effect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by a minority? Why did they not hold popular meetings, and have a convention of their own, to express and enforce the true sentiment of the state? If preorganization was against them then, why not do this now, that the United States Army is present to protect them? The paralysis ---the dead palsy---of the government in this whole struggle is, that this class of men will do nothing for the government, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident! Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our Army; and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity. The truth is, that what is done, and omitted, about slaves, is done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military necessity to have men and money; and we can get neither, in sufficient numbers, or amounts, if we keep from, or drive from, our lines, slaves coming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction; nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he, and such as he shall have time to help themselves. I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which Mr. Durant complains. If experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be set right. I think I can perceive, in the freedom of trade, which Mr. Durant urges, that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose of Mr. Durant; or that he is conscious of any purpose, other than national and patriotic ones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it, without loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no duty---apparently thinks of none---resting upon Union men. He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump, but to be merely passengers,---dead-heads at that---to be carried snug and dry, throughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay, more; even a mutineer is to go untouched lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound. Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in Louisiana, if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it, nor permit the government to do it without their help. Now, I think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity for the war. The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and property, have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them, in good faith, reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State Government conforming thereto under the constitution. They know how to do it, and can have the protection of the Army while doing it. The Army will be withdrawn so soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the people of the State can then upon the old Constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy. If they will not do this, if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government, it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If they decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do. What would you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or, would you prosecute it in future, with elder-stalk squirts, charged with rose water? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier1 ones? Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied. I am in no boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing. Yours truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 LS, DLC-RTL. The original letter, in John Hay's handwriting signed by Lincoln, was returned to John G. Nicolay by General Nathaniel P. Banks, on March 13, 1865, with a request that the president "consent that his letter will be published. Considering the time and circumstances under which it was written, I think it one of the best of his letters. . . ."(Ibid.). Also in the Lincoln Papers is a copy of the letter with corrections in Lincoln's handwriting and endorsed on the verso "to be returned." This copy was presumably made for the purpose indicated in Banks' letter of March 13, 1865, but if it was published at that time, the editors have not been able to verify the fact.

      <field name="fulltext">To August Belmont2 July 31, 1862. July 31, 1862. Dear Sir: You send to Mr. W[eed] an extract from a letter written at New Orleans the 9th instant, which is shown to me. You do not give the writer's name; but plainly he is a man of ability, and probably of some note. He says: "The time has arrived when Mr. Lincoln must take a decisive course. Trying to please everybody, he will satisfy nobody. A vacillating policy in matters of importance is the very worst. Now is the time, if ever, for honest men who love their country to rally to its support. Why will not the North say officially that it wishes for the restoration of the Union as it was?" And so, it seems, this is the point on which the writer thinks I have no policy. Why will he not read and understand what I have said? The substance of the very declaration he desires is in the inaugural, in each of the two regular messages to Congress, and in many, if not all, the minor documents issued by the Executive since the inauguration. Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs. The sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail still come back into the Union unhurt. If they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the writer in saying, "Now is the time." How much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this, under the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward! Yours truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 2 NH, VII, 299-300. Belmont, the New York financier, replied on August 10, "I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed favor. Its contents bear the stamp of that statesmanship and patriotism which I know to have guided all your actions. . . . I share entirely your views with regard not only to the duty, but also the policy of the revolted States to return to their allegiance without allowing their unequal struggle . . . to increase in violence. . . . The words conquest and subjugation have been used to good effect by our opponents. . . . while the rebel leaders can keep up . . . the idea that the North means conquest and subjugation, I fear that there is very little hope for any Union demonstration in the revolted States. . . . My own conviction has always been, that . . . we would have to come to a national convention for the reconstruction of one government over all the States. . . . My impression is, that such a solution would, at the proper time, be acceptable to a majority of the Southern people, and I sent to Mr. Weed the letter which procured me the honor of receiving your note, for the very reason that I saw in it an indication of the writer's desire for a reconstruction of the Union. He is a very wealthy and influential planter. . . ."(August Belmont, A Few Letters and Speeches of the Late Civil War, privately printed, New York, 1870, pp. 71-72).</field>

The people are uneasy, anxious and suspicious. They begin to fear . . . that we are trifled with, that there is not &amp; never has been any serious determination to put down the rebels. . . .

      <field name="fulltext">To Agenor-Etienne de Gasparin1 August 4. 1862 Executive Mansion Washington August 4. 1862 Dear Sir: Your very acceptable letter dated Orbe Canton de Vaud, Switzerland 18th of July 1862 is received. The moral effect was the worst of the affair before Richmond; and that has run its course downward; we are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope. I believe it is true that in men and material, the enemy suffered more than we, in that series of conflicts; while it is certain he is less able to bear it. With us every soldier is a man of character and must be treated with more consideration than is customary in Europe. Hence our great army for slighter causes than could have prevailed there has dwindled rapidly, bringing the necessity for a new call, earlier than was anticipated. We shall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems strange, even to me, but it is true, that the Government is now pressed to this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes, provided they can have assurance that unwilling persons similarly situated will be compelled to do like wise. Besides this, volunteers mostly choose to enter newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be sent to fill up the old ones, wherein, man for man, they are quite doubly as valuable. You ask "why is it that the North with her great armies, so often is found, with inferiority of numbers, face to face with the armies of the South?"While I painfully know the fact, a military man, which I am not, would better answer the question. The fact I know, has not been overlooked; and I suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts that the enemy holds the interior, and we the exterior lines; and that we operate where the people convey information to the enemy, while he operates where they convey none to us. I have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of addressing to me, and for which please accept my sincere thanks. You are much admired in America for the ability of your writings, and much loved for your generosity to us, and your devotion to liberal principles generally. You are quite right, as to the importance to us, for its bearing upon Europe, that we should achieve military successes; and the same is true for us at home as well as abroad. Yet it seems unreasonable that a series of successes, extending through half-a-year. and clearing more than a hundred thousand square miles of country, should help us so little, while a single half-defeat should hurt us so much. But let us be patient. I am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your judgement, of propriety and policy. I can only say that I have acted upon my best convictions without selfishness or malice, and that by the help of God, I shall continue to do so. Please be assured of my highest respect and esteem. Footnotes 1 Copy, DLC-RTL. The unsigned copy in John Hay's handwriting has "Dear Sir"added in Lincoln's hand. A translation of Count Gasparin's letter of July 18, furnished to Lincoln by Secretary Seward on August 1, reads as follows: "It is in moments of difficulty that friends should show themselves. "The check sustained by the federal army before Richmond was certainly a situation of difficulty for the United States. Learn that your friends in Europe do not lose courage, and that they pray for you. "This, besides, is not a Bull Run. There is nothing in it like defeat. The mischief, please God, will soon be repaired. "Why is it that the north with her great armies, so often is found, with inferiority in numbers, face to face with the armies of the South? You know that battles are won by the feet! and that the great principle of war is to concentrate forces in place of scattering them. It is necessary that at important points the national troops should always outnumber those of the rebel forces. It seems that the contrary has too often taken place. "Have you received, recently, the volume and the letter I had the honor to address to you? I have attempted to sustain in Europe a struggle which is not always easy. There, assuredly, the greatest peril of America is to be found; without Europe; without the chances of European intervention, or mediation, the revolt . . . would have been at an end long since. "That ideas of intervention may be counteracted in our old world, there is need not only of military successes achieved by you, but more than that, a continuation of your wise policy; avoid, I entreat you, the complications you may find in Mexico---avoid also, revolutionary me[a]sures---confiscations---capital punishments---appeals to the negroes---precipitate emancipation. "You have traced a programme which every upright mind must applaud. Whilst developing it in the spirit of liberty, it tends to the preservation of fundamental principles. On the day when it can be said in Europe that your Government is, either indifferent to abolition, or carried away by the extreme abolitionists, the partizans of intervention, in favor of the South, will succeed in effecting it. "Pardon me for writing these things to you, my excuse lies in the interest which I take in the cause of which you are the worthy representative. "Accept Sir the assurance of my devotion and of my respect."(DLC-RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remarks to Deputation of Western Gentlemen1 August 4, 1862 August 4, 1862 A deputation of Western gentlemen waited upon the President this morning to offer two colored regiments from the State of Indiana. Two members of Congress were of the party. The President received them courteously, but stated to them that he was not prepared to go the length of enlisting negroes as soldiers. He would employ all colored men offered as laborers, but would not promise to make soldiers of them. The deputation came away satisfied that it is the determination of the Government not to arm negroes unless some new and more pressing emergency arises. The President argued that the nation could not afford to lose Kentucky at this crisis, and gave it as his opinion that to arm the negroes would turn 50,000 bayonets from the loyal Border States against us that were for us. Upon the policy of using negroes as laborers, the confiscation of Rebel property, and the feeding the National troops upon the granaries of the enemy, the President said there was no division of sentiment. He did not explain, however, why it is that the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia carry out this policy so differently. The President promised that the war should be prosecuted with all the rigor he could command, but he could not promise to arm slaves or to attempt slave insurrections in the Rebel States. The recent enactments of Congress on emancipation and confiscation he expects to carry out. Footnotes 1 New York Tribune, August 5, 1862. Members of the deputation are not identified.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Address to Union Meeting at Washington3 August 6, 1862 August 6, 1862 FELLOW-CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion, [applause] but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves, [applause and laughter;] and I offer, in justification of myself and of you, that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution against. [Renewed applause.] I, however, have an impression that there are younger gentlemen who will entertain you better, [voices--- "No, no; none can do better than yourself. Go on!"] and better address your understanding, than I will or could, and therefore, I propose but to detain you a moment longer. [Cries---"Go on! Tar and feather the rebels!"] I am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I hope to produce some good by it. [A voice---"You do that; go on.] The only thing I think of just now not likely to be better said by some one else, is a matter in which we have heard some other persons blamed for what I did myself. [Voices---"What is it?] There has been a very wide-spread attempt to have a quarrel between Gen. McClellan and the Secretary of War. Now, I occupy a position that enables me to observe, at least, these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the quarrel as some pretending to be their friends. [Cries of "Good."] Gen. McClellan's attitude is such that, in the very selfishness of his nature, he cannot but wish to be successful, and I hope he will---and the Secretary of War is in precisely the same situation. If the military commanders in the field cannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War, but myself for the time being the master of them both, cannot be but failures. [Laughter and applause.] I know Gen. McClellan wishes to be successful, and I know he does not wish it any more than the Secretary of War for him, and both of them together no more than I wish it. [Applause and cries of "Good."] Sometimes we have a dispute about how many men Gen. McClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say that he has had a very large number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War insist that Gen. McClellan has had a very small number. The basis for this is, there is always a wide difference, and on this occasion, perhaps, a wider one between the grand total on McClellan's rolls and the men actually fit for duty; and those who would disparage him talk of the grand total on paper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War talk of those at present fit for duty. Gen. McClellan has sometimes asked for things that the Secretary of War did not give him. Gen. McClellan is not to blame for asking what he wanted and needed, and the Secretary of War is not to blame for not giving when he had none to give. [Applause, laughter, and cries of "Good, good."] And I say here, as far as I know, the Secretary of War has withheld no one thing at any time in my power to give him. [Wild applause, and a voice---"Give him enough now!"] I have no accusation against him. I believe he is a brave and able man, [applause,] and I stand here, as justice requires me to do, to take upon myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War, as withholding from him. I have talked longer than I expected to do, [cries of "No, no---go on,"] and now I avail myself of my privilege of saying no more. Footnotes 3 New York Times, August 7, 1862 (brackets in original).

In reply Lee endorsed at length on August 9, "The President's suggestion as to the construction to be, or that may be put on the finding, is in accordance with legal logic. . . . But it is not according to the rule and usage of courts- martial. . . . This would be bad pleading in a court of common law. It is good in a court martial. . . .

      <field name="fulltext">Address on Colonization to a Deputation of Negroes2 August 14, 1862 August 14, 1862 This afternoon the President of the United States gave audience to a Committee of colored men at the White House. They were introduced by the Rev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration. E. M. Thomas, the Chairman, remarked that they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had to say to them. Having all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary observations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at his disposition for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people, or a portion of them, of African descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time been his inclination, to favor that cause; and why, he asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this country? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration. You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a word we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated. You here are freemen I suppose. A VOICE: Yes, sir. The President---Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoy. The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on this broad continent, not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal. I cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact, about which we all think and feel alike, I and you. We look to our condition, owing to the existence of the two races on this continent. I need not recount to you the effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of Slavery. I believe in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present condition---the country engaged in war!---our white men cutting one another's throats, none knowing how far it will extend; and then consider what we know to be the truth. But for your race among us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other. Nevertheless, I repeat, without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men among you, who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those, who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe you can live in Washington or elsewhere in the United States the remainder of your life [as easily], perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country. This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the case. But you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves. There is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. Now, if you could give a start to white people, you would open a wide door for many to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the beginning, and whose intellects are clouded by Slavery, we have very poor materials to start with. If intelligent colored men, such as are before me, would move in this matter, much might be accomplished. It is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically oppressed. There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people. It is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usage of the world. It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself, and claims kindred to the great God who made him. In the American Revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it; but they were cheered by the future. Gen. Washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British subject. Yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting his race---something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own. The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain sense it is a success. The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me---the first time I ever saw him. He says they have within the bounds of that colony between 300,000 and 400,000 people, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones. They are not all American colonists, or their descendants. Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere, their offspring outnumber those deceased. The question is if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there? One reason for an unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity. I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race. It does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to them at all events. The place I am thinking about having for a colony is in Central America. It is nearer to us than Liberia---not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers. Unlike Liberia it is on a great line of travel---it is a highway. The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native land---thus being suited to your physical condition. The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On both sides there are harbors among the finest in the world. Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines. A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country, and there may be more than enough for the wants of the country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes. If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make a farm. But if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage. Coal land is the best thing I know of with which to commence an enterprise. To return, you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen, who have an interest in the country, including the coal mines. We have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites as well as blacks look to their self-interest. Unless among those deficient of intellect everybody you trade with makes something. You meet with these things here as elsewhere. If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you. You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on external help as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to the coal mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance. I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provisions made that you shall not be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise I will spend some of the money intrusted to me. I am not sure you will succeed. The Government may lose the money, but we cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can succeed. The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory condition as I wish. There are contending factions in that quarter; but it is true all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and are more generous than we are here. To your colored race they have no objection. Besides, I would endeavor to have you made equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the equals of the best. The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go, when I present evidence of encouragement and protection. Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, to "cut their own fodder,"so to speak? Can I have fifty? If I could find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children, good things in the family relation, I think I could make a successful commencement. I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not. This is the practical part of my wish to see you. These are subjects of very great importance, worthy of a month's study, [instead] of a speech delivered in an hour. I ask you then to consider seriously not pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind---not confined to the present generation, but as "From age to age descends the lay, To millions yet to be, Till far its echoes roll away, Into eternity." The above is merely given as the substance of the President's remarks. The Chairman of the delegation briefly replied that "they would hold a consultation and in a short time give an answer."The President said: "Take your full time---no hurry at all." The delegation then withdrew. Footnotes 2 New York Tribune, August 15, 1862. An act "releasing certain persons held to labor in the District of Columbia"and providing $100,000 for colonization, became law on April 16, 1862, and an act approved on July 16, freed slaves in the hands of the army and granted $500,000 for colonization. Since October, 1861, the Chiriqui Project for colonization had been under cabinet consideration (see Lincoln to Smith October 23 and 24, 1861, supra). The appointment of Reverend James Mitchell of Indiana as agent of emigration is not listed in the Official Register, but contemporary records indicate that he operated in the Department of Interior as early as May 28, 1862, when he sent Lincoln his long letter on colonization printed by the Government Printing Office. His activity in July and August brought the matter of colonization to a head with the arrangement for an interview between Lincoln and the committee of Negroes headed by Edward M. Thomas on August 14. Thomas was president of the Anglo-African Institute for the Encouragement of Industry and Art. The committee's reception of Lincoln's views is indicated by a letter from Thomas written on August 16: "We would respectfully suggest that it is necessary that we should confer with leading colored men in Phila New York and Boston upon the movement of emigration to the point recommended in your address. "We were entirely hostile to the movement until all the advantages were so ably brought to our view by you and we believe that our friends and colaborers for our race in those cities will when the subject is explained by us to them join heartily in sustaining such a movement. . . ." (DLC-RTL). Subsequent developments, however, indicated that Negroes in the District of Columbia received the colonization proposal with hostility. A Negro meeting held at Union Bethel Church was reported in the Baltimore Sun on August 23 as protesting against the plan: "Such dissatisfaction had been manifested in regard to the course of the committee who lately waited on the president . . . that they did not attend. It was hinted that they had exceeded their instructions." Plans were fully matured in August, however, to send Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy with "500 able-bodied negroes as the first colony"to be settled on a site on the Isthmus of Chiriqui to be selected by Pomeroy (New York Tribune, September 15, 1862). A letter of authority from Lincoln to Pomeroy was prepared for Lincoln's signature, probably by the State Department, under date of September 10, 1862, but remains unsigned in duplicate copies in the Lincoln Papers. The project was abandoned when first Honduras and later Nicaragua and Costa Rica protested the scheme and hinted that force might be used to prevent the settlement.</field>

Washington, Aug. 16. 1862 I was painfully surprised by your letter, handed me by the P.M.G.; because the Secretary of War, who saw you after I did, had assured me, that you and accompanying friends, were fully satisfied with what he had undertaken to do. Since receiving your letter, I have seen him again, and he again assures me that such was his understanding. I went over your eight points with him to see which he accepted, and which he rejected. He rejects that about postponing drafting till the 15th. of September. He accepts that about the 3rd. Delaware Regiment. He accepts that about Col. Grimshaw's Regiment. He accepts that about the battery of Artillery, if it be the battery heretofore authorized. He accepts that about the Battalion of Cavalry. He accepts that about forces remaining in the State. He rejects that about drafting being made under the Marshal of the District. He thinks he could not be justified to thus snub the Governor who is apparently doing right, but he will at once check anything which may be apparently wrong. He accepts that about appointing officers by the War Department---unless some serious, and now unforeseen obstacle shall be presented. I do hope you will be able to get along upon this. The Secretary feels very sure that Judge Gilpin2 thinks you can. I mean this as a private letter, but I am quite willing for you to show it to Judge Gilpin. I do hope you will not indulge a thought which will admit of your saying the administration turns you over to the fury of your enemies. You certainly know I wish your success as much as you can wish it yourself. Your friend, as ever A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. On August 13 the Delaware delegation interviewed Lincoln in regard to drafting in that state. Fisher's letter of August 14 reads as follows: "You requested our delegation from Delaware, that before leaving this city, they would submit to you in writing the desires of our friends in that state respecting the calls for troops. All of them except myself have left, but before leaving they desired me to express to you our views, which are as follows. "1st That the time for drafting may be extended till the 15th day of September. "2d That the 3d Delaware Regiment (now in the field) which was over and above the quota which we were called upon to furnish, prior to the recent calls may be set down to the credit of the state, as part of the quota required of her under the call for 300,000 additional Volunteers. "3d That Col. [Arthur H.] Grimshaw may have till the 15th day of September to fill up the 4th Delaware Regiment and that it also be credited as above. "4th That the battery of Artillery now just made up by Capt Ben. Nields [Shields?] also be so credited. "5th That the Battallion of Cavalry, for the raising of which an order was yesterday issued to N. B. Knight Esq, when raised may be credited as above if necessary to make up the quota of additional volunteers; or if not so necessary there [then?] that it be set off against an equal number of militia called for under the recent orders. "6th That none of the troops now being organized or hereafter to be raised shall be removed from the State of Delaware until after the election to be held on the 4th day of Novr. next. Let them be placed in a camp of instruction under Genl. Lockwood . . . ; or if the new levies shall be removed from the state that they and the three Regts. now in the field may be allowed to return home to vote. "7th That the drafting be made under the Marshall of the district &amp; not by Comrs. &amp;c. appointed by the Governor. "8th That the officers of the Vols. &amp; militia will be appointed by the War Dept. &amp; not by the Governor. "I deem it my duty to say that. . . . We have but 16,000 voters in the state all told; and of them we have sent already 2,000 men into the field. . . . The present arrangement will diminish our strength from 500 to 1000 votes.

I trust and believe its influence will go far to fill the quota now required without resort to a draft on the militia of the several States. "The President sends you a brief note of thanks." Lincoln's note was probably an effort to mollify the indignant Miss Carroll, who following an interview with the president had written him on August 14 a very long letter reading in part as follows: "I am just informed, that at a public dinner . . . in a Washington Hotel, a gentleman . . . stated, that the President had said `a lady demanded fifty thousand dollars, for writing a document,' &amp;c; meaning myself. . . . I saw . . . that you did not comprehend me . . . at the time of my interview. . . . It is due to myself . . . that I make this statement plain. "I had a verbal agreement, with Hon Thos. A.

      <field name="fulltext">To Gillet F. Watson1 August 21, 1862. Gillet F. Watson Executive Mansion, Williamsburg, Va. Washington, August 21, 1862. Your Telegram in regard to the Lunatic Assylum has been received. It is certainly a case of difficulty; but if you can not remain, I can not conceive who, under my authority, can. Remain as long as you safely can, and provide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the Institution. A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. Watson was appointed superintendent of the asylum by Governor Peirpoint after Union forces occupied Williamsburg. He telegraphed Lincoln on August 20 that "Williamsburg is being evacuated by the Union forces. Under these circumstances the safety of my life requires that I shall leave in a very few hours. When I leave all the officers and servants will leave so that the unfortunate inmates will be left locked up without any one to minister unto them. I have made known this condition of things to Genl Dix and Genl McClellan and they have done nothing! I now communicate it to you which is the last effort I can make."(DLC-RTL). McClellan's telegram of the same day explained: "Williamsburg is not evacuated by our forces but will be held . . . for several days. When applied to furnish medical attendance &amp; servants to enable the present employees to run away I took the ground that the superintendent must make these arrangements himself. I recommended that they be required to provide employees who can &amp; will remain. There is time enough to do this."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Horace Greeley1 August 22, 1862. Hon. Horace Greely: Executive Mansion, Dear Sir Washington, August 22, 1862. I have just read yours of the 19th. addressed to myself through the New-York Tribune. If there be in it any statements, or assumptions of fact, which I may know to be erroneous, I do not, now and here, controvert them. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here, argue against them. If there be perceptable in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right. As to the policy I "seem to be pursuing"as you say, I have not meant to leave any one in doubt. I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be "the Union as it was."2 If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men every where could be free. Yours, A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut. Greeley's communication of August 19, printed in the Tribune of August 20, 1862, under the headline "The Prayer of Twenty Millions,"expressed disappointment with "the policy you seem to be pursuing with regard to the slaves of Rebels. . . . I. We require of you . . . that you EXECUTE THE LAWS. . . . II. We think you are strangely and disastrously remiss . . . with regard to the emancipating provisions of the new Confiscation Act. . . . III. We think you are unduly influenced by the counsels . . . of certain fossil politicians hailing from the Border Slave States. . . . IV. We think timid counsels in such a crisis calculated to prove perilous. . . . V. We complain that the Union cause has suffered . . . from mistaken deference to Rebel Slavery. . . . VI. We complain that the Confiscation Act which you approved is habitually disregarded by your Generals. . . . VII. Let me call your attention to the recent tragedy in New- Orleans. . . . A considerable body of . . . men, held in Slavery by two Rebel sugar-planters . . . made their way to the great mart of the South-West, which they knew to be in the undisputed possession of the Union forces. . . . They came to us for liberty and protection. . . . They were set upon and maimed, captured and killed, because they sought the benefit of that act of Congress. . . . VIII. On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one disinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile. . . . IX. I close as I began with the statement that what an immense majority of the Loyal Millions of your countrymen require of you is a frank, declared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the laws of the land. . . ." Greeley printed Lincoln's letter in the Tribune on August 25 and followed with a lengthy response, of which the following provides the core: "I never doubted . . . that you desire, before and above all else, to re-establish the now derided authority . . . of the Republic. I intended to raise only this question---Do you propose to do this by recognizing, obeying, and enforcing the laws, or by ignoring, disregarding, and in effect denying them?" 2 At this point Lincoln crossed out the following sentence: "Broken eggs can never be mended, and the longer the breaking proceeds the more will be broken."</field>

[8 A.M.] I am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent to assist in organizing and getting off troops. Pensylvania and Indiana accepted such officers, kindly; and they now have more than twice as many new troops in the field, as all the other states together. If Illinois had got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be relieved from it's present peril. Please do not ruin us on punctilio. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 4 ALS, RPB.

Yates replied somewhat heatedly to Lincoln's telegram, "I have received your unjust dispatch. I have not rejected the service of any officer. The statement is false. Illinois may be behind in getting her troops into the field because you have sent your paymasters and mustering officers to Pennsylvania and Indiana first, but I assert, sir, that no State has done more in so short a time than Illinois has without aid from your paymasters and mustering officers, and I point with pride to 50,000 men now ready to go into the field, and only delayed, not by me, but for the want of blankets, guns, camp-kettles, &amp;c., which come from your depot.

Yours denying that you have rejected the service of an officer sent you by us, is received. Of course I do not question your word; and yet what I said was based upon direct evidence; and I the more readily gave credit to it because I had previously had so much trouble between officers sent to Illinois and the State government there. I certainly can not conceive what it was I said which can be construed as injustice to Illinois.

This same telegram appears in Haupt's Reminiscences (1901), p. 119, dated "August 30, 1862, 9 A.M."Lincoln may have sent two identical telegrams, since there are three telegrams which may be considered as replies. The first is dated at 11 A.M., "Firing this morning is heard in direction of Centreville. I have sent out four trains. . . . The intelligence last evening was that Hooker and Pope were pushing the enemy toward the gap in the mountains through which they had advanced, and that McDowell and Sigel were heading them off. This morning the direction of the firing seems to be changing and it is not impossible that the enemy's forces may be changing direction and trying to escape toward Fredericksburg. . . . I await intelligence . . . and will communicate anything of importance that I hear."(OR, I, XII, III, 762). The second is dated as sent at 11:30 A.M., received at 11:35 A.M., "Our opr. has reached Manassas. Hears no firing of importance. I have directed part of the 200 Riflemen to go out as Scouts make observations &amp; report constantly. 2 of [sic] 3 flashes just seen from Manassas in direction of Centreville. Our Expedition this A M appears to have [been] completely successful We have re-established teleg communication with Manassas &amp; if protected will even have cars running but the Military authorities heretofore have never extended to us the protection that was necessary &amp; we have assumed the responsibility of going ahead without it.

They have been advance "pioneers"occupying the posts of danger &amp; the Exploit of penetrating to Fairfax &amp; Bringing off the wounded when they supposed twenty thousand Rebels were in their front &amp; flank was one of the boldest performances I have heard of."(DLC-RTL). The third is dated as received at 11:50 A.M., "One of our men who is just in left Bristoe yesterday noon says our men had nearly finished repairing Kettle-Run Bridge A large number of cars with four Engines were the other side of Kettle-Run Bridge ready to come over as soon as possible One of the Engines, the one in advance had 12 cars of ammunition &amp; more behind After the completion of Kettle Run the Trains can advance to Bristoe They are probably there now This intelligence is extremely gratifying I learn too that Broad Run Bridge has been attempted to be destroyed by cutting off the legs of all the trestles They could not have done mischief in a way that would render it more easy &amp; Expeditious for us to repair Very few hours should make Broad Run passable &amp; then Bull Run will remain the only obstacle."(DLC-RTL).</field>

As in the case of the preceding telegram, there may have been two with identical wording sent at different hours. Haupt's Reminiscences, p. 119, prints this telegram as sent at 8:50 P.M. Haupt's reply, however, is dated as sent and received at 5 P.M., as follows: "The latest news is that our men are busy building bridges beyond Bull Run. One of my assistants has just returned from Bristoe to Manassas Reports bridge across Kettle Run finished A good force at work at Broad Run and another at Bull Run.

Wright telegraphed Halleck from his headquarters, Department of the Ohio, at Cincinnati on August 31, "Nelson has been badly beaten, I fear, in an encounter with the enemy near Richmond, Ky.; his force being, as he says, hopelessly broken and scattered. He is in Lexington, Ky., wounded, and I leave for that place in a couple of hours to see what can be done. He gives me no particulars. My orders were to make the Kentucky River the line of defense, and his orders in pursuance seem to have been disregarded. At any rate his force has been routed."(OR, I, XVI, II, 464). To Lincoln's telegram Boyle answered: "I am not accurately informed of the force Gen Nelson had in the Engagement but believe that he had seven or eight thousand men all of them new lev[i]es except eighteenth Ky.

A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, owned by Robert Matlock, Owensboro, Kentucky. Haupt replied, "No news received as yet this morning; firing heard distinctly in direction of Bristoe at 6 o'clock"(Reminiscences, p. 124). At 10 A.M. Haupt reported, "We escaped any injury to the track or bridges last night. We sent forward trains until 2 am. They all reached their destination which affords I think an ample supply of subsistence &amp; ammunition. We sent 88 cars The trains were all guarded the tops filled with riflemen &amp; strong guards at all the bridges. We asked Manassas a short time ago if firing was heard He said no Fairfax just answered no firing heard. I sent out one of Genl Couches [Darius N. Couch] regiments about 12 last night The other reported for duty after 2 AM. It was of no use to send it at that hour as no train was ready."(DLC-RTL). At 10:10 Haupt reported further: "One of our train dispatchers reports from Manassas that he was ordered out of his car at Bristoe this morning by our own troops with the information that they were ordered to destroy the cars &amp; engines &amp; they have been burned. I suppose this was done by command of Genl Banks" (ibid).

      <field name="fulltext">Meditation on the Divine Will4 [September 2, 1862?] [September 2, 1862?] The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God can not be for, and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party---and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true---that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds. Footnotes 4 AD-P, ISLA. The bracketed date September [30?], 1862, is given to the meditation by Nicolay and Hay in the Complete Works (VIII, 52). According to their account, however, the fragment was written "in September, 1862, while his mind was burdened with the weightiest question of his life. . . . It was not written to be seen of men. . . ."(Abraham Lincoln: A History, VI, 341-42). If this comment means anything, September 30 is too late for the meditation. The "weightiest question"must be understood to refer to the issuing of the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, and it is evident that Lincoln's mind was made up on this question some time before the proclamation was actually issued. Quite possibly the meditation was written as early as September 2, at which time, following the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lincoln seems to have plumbed his lowest depths, and was reported by Attorney General Bates to have "seemed wrung by the bitterest anguish---said he felt almost ready to hang himself."(See note to Lincoln's order to Halleck dismissing McClellan, November 5, infra). In choosing an approximate date of September 2, rather than September 30, the editors have been prompted by these considerations of milieu.</field>

This telegram is misdated September 8, 1862, in the Complete Works (VIII, 22). Buell replied September 10, 12 M., "Bragg is certainly this side of the Cumberland Mountains with his whole force, except what is in Kentucky under [E. Kirby] Smith. His movements will probably depend on mine. I expect that for the want of supplies I can neither follow him nor remain here. Think I must withdraw from Tennessee. I shall not abandon Tennessee while it is possible to hold on.

He also heard the command under Colonel [John F.] Farnsworth, near Poolesville, was fired on by artillery, but heard no report from Colonel Farnsworth. I do not think, from the tenor of General Pleasonton's dispatches, that any great force was seen, but he guards every approach carefully, and will keep me fully advised. I will inform you of everything of importance that occurs. Burnside will be at Mechanicsville to-night. While I am writing, another dispatch from General Pleasonton, dated 5.15 p.m., says Colonel Farnsworth has occupied Poolesville after a skirmish, in which the rebels brought up one gun.

McClellan's telegram received at 1:40 P.M. is as follows: "In reply to your dispatch of the morning I have the honor to state that Genl Pleasanton at Barnesville reports that a movement of the Enemy last night is said to have been made across the Potomac from this side to the other Side. We shall know the truth of this rumor soon. Pleasanton is watching all the fords as high as Conrad's ferry &amp; has pickets out to the mouth of the Monocacy He has sent out this morning to occupy Sugar Loaf Mountain from which a large extent of country can be seen in all directions. "Genl Burnside had his scouts out last night to Ridgeville &amp; within 3 miles of New Market. No Enemy seen with the exception of a few pickets. They were told that Stuart's Cavalry 5000 in number occupied New Market &amp; that the main Rebel force under Jackson was still at Frederick. Burnside has sent a strong reconnaissance today to the mountain pass at Ridgeville I propose if the information I have rec'd proves reliable regarding the natural strength of this position to occupy it with a sufficient force to resist an advance of the Enemy in that direction. I have scouts &amp; spies pushed forward in every direction shall soon be in possession of reliable &amp; definite information The statements I get regarding the Enemy's forces that have crossed to this side range from 80 to 150,000. I am perfectly certain that none of the Enemy's troops have crossed the Potomac within the last 24 hours below the mouth of the Monocacy. I was informed last night by Genl Pleasanton that his information rendered it probable that Jackson's forces had advanced to New Market with Stuart's Cavalry at Urbana. In view of this I ordered the army forward this morning to the line along the high ridge from Ridgeville through Damascus[,] Clarksburg &amp;c but the information subsequently obtained from Genl Burnside's Scouts that the mass of the Enemy was still at Frederick induced me to suspend the movement of the right wing until I could verify the truth of the reports by means of Burnside's reconnaissance in force today.

Sir: The application made to me by your adjutant-general for authority to call out the militia of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful consideration. It is my anxious desire to afford, as far as possible, the means and powers of the Federal Government to protect the State of Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces, and since, in your judgment, the militia of the State are required, and have been called upon by you, to organize for home defense and protection, I sanction the call that you have made, and will receive them into the service and pay of the United States to the extent that they can be armed, equipped, and usefully employed. The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government will be needed for the troops called out for the national armies, so that arms can only be furnished for the quota of militia furnished by the draft of nine-months' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by the militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will probably be sufficient for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will be authorized to provide such equipments as may be required, according to the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being turned over to the United States Quartermaster's Department, will be paid for at regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such articles. Railroad transportation will also be paid for, as in other cases. Such general officers will be supplied as the exigencies of the service will permit. Yours, truly, A. LINCOLN.

He is as much responsible for Louisville, as for Cincinnati. Gen. Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject yesterday; and I telegraph him now; but for us here, to control him there on the ground would be a Babel of confusion which would be utterly ruinous. Where do you understand Buell to be? and what is he doing? A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, RPB. General Boyle telegraphed on September 11, 9:15 P.M. that "Genl Wrights withdrawing the troops from this place and sending to Cincinnati is creating a panic and will ruin the State."(DLC-RTL).

There is some force but it is not large Bragg may enter soon Buell is at Nashville. Part of his Army are at Bowling Green. [Alexander M.] McCooks Division which was no this side the Cumberland, now is reported to have recrossed to the Nashville side. I have heard nothing from Buell. My information is from Col Bruce at Bowling Green I concur with you that Genl Wrights military opinion is better than I ever thought mine to be but I can know facts as well as the ablest military man. There are many reports Deserters from Buckner report him with ten thousand 10000 men near Tompkinsville. Bragg reported at Burkesville and Columbia advancing into the centre of the State.

We have not to exceed eighty thousand disciplined troops, properly so called, this side of the mountains, and most of them, with many of the new regiments, are now close in the rear of the enemy supposed to be invading Pennsylvania.

      <field name="fulltext">Reply to Emancipation Memorial Presented by Chicago Christians of All Denominations2 September 13, 1862 September 13, 1862 "The subject presented in the memorial is one upon which I have thought much for weeks past, and I may even say for months. I am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are equally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps in some respects both. I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God would reveal his will to others, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter. And if I can learn what it is I will do it! These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case, ascertain what is possible and learn what appears to be wise and right. The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For instance, the other day four gentlemen of standing and intelligence (naming one or two of the number) from New York called, as a delegation, on business connected with the war; but, before leaving, two of them earnestly beset me to proclaim general emancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them! You know, also, that the last session of Congress had a decided majority of anti-slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is true of the religious people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting God to favor their side; for one of our soldiers, who had been taken prisoner, told Senator Wilson, a few days since, that he met with nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers. But we will talk over the merits of the case. "What good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially as we are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court, or magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them? How can we feed and care for such a multitude? Gen. Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command. They eat, and that is all, though it is true Gen. Butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again; for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off! They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee river a few days ago. And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it! For instance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help and sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the Government would probably do nothing about it. What could I do? [Here your delegation suggested that this was a gross outrage on a flag of truce, which covers and protects all over which it waves, and that whatever he could do if white men had been similarly detained he could do in this case.] "Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war, I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy. Nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the South. I view the matter as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion." Thus invited, your delegation very willingly made reply to the following effect; it being understood that a portion of the remarks were intermingled by the way of conversation with those of the President just given. We observed (taking up the President's ideas in order) that good men indeed differed in their opinions on this subject; nevertheless the truth was somewhere, and it was a matter of solemn moment for him to ascertain it; that we had not been so wanting in respect, alike to ourselves and to him, as to come a thousand miles to bring merely our opinion to be set over against the opinion of other parties; that the memorial contained facts, principles, and arguments which appealed to the intelligence of the President and to his faith in Divine Providence; that he could not deny that the Bible denounced oppression as one of the highest of crimes, and threatened Divine judgments against nations that practice it; that our country had been exceedingly guilty in this respect, both at the North and South; that our just punishment has come by a slaveholder's rebellion; that the virus of secession is found wherever the virus of slavery extends, and no farther; so that there is the amplest reason for expecting to avert Divine judgments by putting away the sin, and for hoping to remedy the national troubles by striking at their cause. We observed, further, that we freely admitted the probability, and even the certainty, that God would reveal the path of duty to the President as well as to others, provided he sought to learn it in the appointed way; but, as according to his own remark, Providence wrought by means and not miraculously, it might be, God would use the suggestions and arguments of other minds to secure that result. We felt the deepest personal interest in the matter as of national concern, and would fain aid the thoughts of our President by communicating the convictions of the Christian community from which we came, with the ground upon which they were based. That it was true he could not now enforce the Constitution at the South; but we could see in that fact no reason whatever for not proclaiming emancipation, but rather the contrary. The two appealed to different classes; the latter would aid, and in truth was necessary to re-establish the former; and the two could be made operative together as fast as our armies fought their way southward; while we had yet to hear that he proposed to abandon the Constitution because of the present difficulty of enforcing it. As to the inability of Congress to agree on this policy at the late session, it was quite possible, in view of subsequent events, there might be more unanimity at another meeting. The members have met their constituents and learned of marvellous conversions to the wisdom of emancipation, especially since late reverses have awakened thought as to the extreme peril of the nation, and made bad men as well as good men realize that we have to deal with God in this matter. Men of the most opposite previous views were now uniting in calling for this measure. That to proclaim emancipation would secure the sympathy of Europe and the whole civilized world, which now saw no other reason for the strife than national pride and ambition, an unwillingness to abridge our domain and power. No other step would be so potent to prevent foreign intervention. Furthermore, it would send a thrill through the entire North, firing every patriotic heart, giving the people a glorious principle for which to suffer and to fight, and assuring them that the work was to be so thoroughly done as to leave our country free forever from danger and disgrace in this quarter. We added, that when the proclamation should become widely known (as the law of Congress has not been) it would withdraw the slaves from the rebels, leaving them without laborers, and giving us both laborers and soldiers. That the difficulty experienced by Gen. Butler and other Generals arose from the fact that half-way measures could never avail. It is the inherent vice of half-way measures that they create as many difficulties as they remove. It is folly merely to receive and feed the slaves. They should be welcomed and fed, and then, according to Paul's doctrine, that they who eat must work, be made to labor and to fight for their liberty and ours. With such a policy the blacks would be no incumbrance and their rations no waste. In this respect we should follow the ancient maxim, and learn of the enemy. What the rebels most fear is what we should be most prompt to do; and what they most fear is evident from the hot haste with which, on the first day of the present session of the Rebel Congress, bills were introduced threatening terrible vengeance if we used the blacks in the war. The President rejoined from time to time in about these terms: "I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine qua non. The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument. I will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition. I grant further that it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine. Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the war. And then unquestionably it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance. But I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and indeed thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and contempt: There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from the Border Slave States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels. I do not think they all would---not so many indeed as a year ago, or as six months ago---not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases their Union feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people in the fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is a fundamental idea, going down about as deep as any thing." We answered that, being fresh from the people, we were naturally more hopeful than himself as to the necessity and probable effect of such a proclamation. The value of constitutional government is indeed a grand idea for which to contend; but the people know that nothing else has put constitutional government in danger but slavery; that the toleration of that aristocratic and despotic element among our free institutions was the inconsistency that had nearly wrought our ruin and caused free government to appear a failure before the world, and therefore the people demand emancipation to preserve and perpetuate constitutional government. Our idea would thus be found to go deeper than this, and to be armed with corresponding power. ("Yes,"interrupted Mr. Lincoln, "that is the true ground of our difficulties.") That a proclamation of general emancipation, "giving Liberty and Union"as the national watch-word, would rouse the people and rally them to his support beyond any thing yet witnessed---appealing alike to conscience, sentiment, and hope. He must remember, too, that present manifestations are no idex of what would then take place. If the leader will but utter a trumpet call the nation will respond with patriotic ardor. No one can tell the power of the right word from the right man to develop the latent fire and enthusiasm of the masses. ("I know it,"exclaimed Mr. Lincoln.) That good sense must of course be exercised in drilling, arming, and using black as well as white troops to make them efficient; and that in a scarcity of arms it was at least worthy of inquiry whether it were not wise to place a portion of them in the hands of those nearest to the seat of the rebellion and able to strike the deadliest blow. That in case of a proclamation of emancipation we had no fear of serious injury from the desertion of Border State troops. The danger was greatly diminished, as the President had admitted. But let the desertions be what they might, the increased spirit of the North would replace them two to one. One State alone, if necessary, would compensate the loss, were the whole 50,000 to join the enemy. The struggle has gone too far, and cost too much treasure and blood, to allow of a partial settlement. Let the line be drawn at the same time between freedom and slavery, and between loyalty and treason. The sooner we know who are our enemies the better. In bringing our interview to a close, after an hour of earnest and frank discussion, of which the foregoing is a specimen, Mr. Lincoln remarked: "Do not misunderstand me, because I have mentioned these objections. They indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement. And I can assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other. Whatever shall appear to be God's will I will do. I trust that, in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views, I have not in any respect injured your feelings." Footnotes 2 Chicago Tribune, September 23, and National Intelligencer, September 26, 1862. Reverend William W. Patton and Reverend John Dempster composed the delegation which presented the president with a memorial in favor of national emancipation adopted by a public meeting of Christians of all denominations held in Bryan Hall, Chicago, on September 7. The delegation also presented a similar memorial in German signed by German citizens of Chicago. On September 20 following their visit to Washington, the delegates reported to a meeting in Bryan Hall.

I know it is your purpose to send the paroled prisoners to the seat of the Indian difficulties; and I write this only to urge that this be done with all possible despatch. Gen.

We need a well-drilled force . . . to resist the over-whelming force of Indians now attacking our frontier settlements. Cannot you order the Third Regiment to report at once to me . . .? This service would not be a violation of their parole. . . ."(OR, II, IV, 417). On September 9, Governor David Tod pursued the question further, "If the Indian troubles in Minnesota are serious and the paroled Union prisoners are not soon to be exchanged would it not be well to send them to Minnesota? It is with great difficulty we can preserve order among them at Camp Chase."(OR, II, IV, 499). Stanton replied the same day, "Your suggestion as to the paroled prisoners being sent to the Indian borders is excellent and will be immediately acted upon."(Ibid). On October 14, Lorenzo Thomas gave his opinion that employment of paroled troops "against Indians would seem to be contrary to the fourth article of the cartel."(Ibid., p. 621). The terms of parole specified that paroled Union troops were to be kept in Union camps as non-combatants until they were exchanged for Confederate prisoners. Insubordination and mutiny among parolees at both Camp Chase and Camp Douglas, as well as the need for troops in Minnesota, prompted the project, but no reference has been found to the actual service of any of the paroled regiments in Minnesota, excepting a portion of the Third Minnesota, as first requested by Governor Ramsey.

That the executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States, and parts of states, if any, in which the people thereof respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any state, or the people thereof shall, on that day be, in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States, by members chosen thereto, at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States. That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled "An act to make an additional Article of War"approved March 13, 1862, and which act is in the words and figure following:5 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of the army of the United States, and shall be obeyed and observed as such: Article---. All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor, who may have escaped from any persons to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be found guilty by a court- martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the service. SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That this act shall take effect from and after its passage. Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled "An Act to suppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and Rebellion, to seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,"approved July 17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:1 SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the government of the United States; and all slaves of such persons found on (or) being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves. SEC. 10. And be it further enacted, That no slave escaping into any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other State, shall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for crime, or some offence against the laws, unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person engaged in the military or naval service of the United States shall, under any pretence whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or surrender up any such person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service. And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective spheres of service, the act, and sections above recited. And the executive will in due time1 recommend that all citizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the rebellion, shall (upon the restoration of the constitutional relation between the United States, and their respective states, and people, if that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of the United States, including the loss of slaves. L.S. In2 witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

The autograph proclamation in the New York State Library was presented by Lincoln to the Albany Army Relief Bazaar held in February and March, 1864, where it was purchased by Gerrit Smith for $1,100 and given to the U.S. Sanitary Commission, whence it was purchased again for $1,000 in April, 1865, by the State of New York for the State Library. A letter of transmittal from Frederick W. Seward to Mrs. Emily W. Barnes, January 4, 1864, correctly describes the body of the document as being in Lincoln's own handwriting, the pencilled additions in the hand of the Secretary of State, and the formal beginning and ending, in the hand of the chief clerk." Seward's emendations as well as other peculiarities of the document are indicated in succeeding footnotes. From Lincoln's original the engrossed copy in the National Archives was made and an official printing was issued by the State Department accompanied by a Circular from Secretary Seward to Diplomatic and Consular officers. A copy of this Circular printing is preserved in the Lincoln Papers bearing Lincoln's endorsement "Preliminary Proclamation from which a scrap was cut to paste onto the final one."The "scrap"cut away comprised paragraphs three and four of the Preliminary Proclamation, incorporated as paragraphs two and three of the Final Proclamation January 1, 1863, infra. The purported facsimile of the original document which appears in Whitney, Life on the Circuit with Lincoln, and which has been referred to as a forgery (Charles Eberstadt, "Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,"The New Colophon, 1950, pp. 312-56), is not reliable in detail, but appears to have been made from the original by a tracing process rather than by photography, and presents the passages which appear in the original as clippings from the official printings of the acts referred to, in type face and line length which do not correspond to the clippings themselves. The history of the original document, prior to the cabinet meeting on September 22 at which Lincoln presented it, is somewhat obscure, except for the notation in Hay's Diary on September 23 that "The President rewrote the Proclamation on Sunday morning carefully."This may be interpreted to mean that Lincoln rewrote directly from the draft of July 22 (supra), or that he rewrote from an intervening draft in more or less complete form. If the latter possibility is the case, the intervening draft has not been found. Later accounts of the writing of the Preliminary Proclamation are reminiscent and unreliable in detail (see George S. Boutwell, The Lawyer, the Statesman, and the Soldier, 1887, pp. 116-17). The full reports of the cabinet meeting on September 22 as recorded in the diaries of Chase and Welles are too long for reproduction here, but should be consulted by anyone interested in the reaction of the several members to Lincoln's announcement that he had made up his mind to issue the Proclamation forthwith. 1 And"inserted and deleted at this point not in Lincoln's handwriting. 2 With their consent"inserted by Seward. 3 With the previously obtained consent of the Governments existing there"inserted by Seward. 4 At this point, following a suggestion of Seward concurred in by Chase and other members at the cabinet meeting, Lincoln deleted and revised his original phrasing, which read as follows: "will, during the continuance in office of the present incumbent, recognize such persons, as being free, and will"etc. 5 A clipping from the official printing of the act is pasted on the page of Lincoln's autograph document. 1 This quotation is also in the form of a clipping from the official printing. 1 In due time"is inserted in handwriting not Lincoln's, to replace "at the next session of Congress,"which had been inserted by the chief clerk at this point. 2 The remainder, including signatures, is in the hand of the clerk.</field>

The fact may be a singular one; but from evidence before us we are inclined to believe that many of the haps and mishaps of the nation, during this war, may be traced to a matter no greater than the corns and bunions which have afflicted the feet of our leaders. . . ."The writer further pointed out that "The President has been greatly blamed for not resisting the demands of the radicals; but how could the President put his foot down firmly when he was troubled with corns?"</field>

[Cries of "Good,"and applause.] I was about to say, I suppose I understand it.

[Cries of "Good," "Good,""Bless you,"and applause.] I can only trust in God I have made no mistake. [Cries "No mistake---all right; you've made no mistakes yet. Go ahead, you're right."] I shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain what I have done or said by any comment. [Voices---"That's unnecessary; we understand it."] It is now for the country and the world to pass judgment on it, and, may be, take action upon it. I will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am environed with difficulties. [A voice--- "That's so."] Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those who, upon the battle field, are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country. [Applause, long and continued.] Let us never forget them. On the 14th and 17th days of the present month there have been battles bravely, skillfully and successfully fought.

Inst. was received two days ago. In the multitude of cares claiming my constant attention I have been unable to examine and determine the exact treaty relations between the United States and the Cherokee Nation. Neither have I been able to investigate and determine the exact state of facts claimed by you as constituting a failure of treaty obligation on our part, excusing the Cherokee Nation for making a treaty with a portion of the people of the United States in open rebellion against the government thereof. This letter therefore, must not be understood to decide anything upon these questions. I shall, however, cause a careful investigation of them to be made. Meanwhile the Cherokee people remaining practically loyal to the federal Union will receive all the protection which can be given them consistently with the duty of the government to the whole country.2 I sincerely hope the Cherokee country may not again be over-run by the enemy; and I shall do all I consistently can to prevent it.

I therefore beg leave very respectfully to represent--- "1st That the relations which the Cherokee Nation sustained towards the United States, have been defined by Treaties . . . extending through a long series of years. "2nd Those Treaties were Treaties of Friendship and Alliance---The Cherokee Nation . . . placing itself under the protection of the United States . . . and the United States solemnly promising that Protection. "3rd . . . in consequence of the want of that protection . . . The Cherokees were forced for the preservation of their country and their existence to negotiate a Treaty with the `Confederate States.' ". . . . The advance of the Indian Expedition gave the Cherokee People an opportunity to manifest their views by taking . . . a prompt and decided stand in favor of their relations with the U States Government. The withdrawal of that expedition and the reabandonment of that people and country to the forces of the Confederate States leaves them in position fraught with distress, danger and ruin. What the Cherokee People now desire is ample military protection . . . and a recognition by the Government of the obligations of existing Treaties. . . . "For the satisfaction and encouragement of my own People and of the Indian Nations who live near them, I beg leave very respectfully to suggest that you will issue a Proclamation to them, if deemed proper, in accordance with the views which you entertain on this subject and which will enable me to make assurances in behalf of the Government in which they can confide. . . ."(DLC- RTL). 2 No more than this can safely be promised, even to the loyal white people of Missouri, or other border states"has been deleted at this point in Lincoln's draft.</field>

As to the proclamation, he said no fact had assured him so thoroughly of the justice of the conclusion at which he had arrived as that the Executives of the loyal States gave it their hearty approbation. As to the suggestions which they had made in the address just read, he was grateful for them all, but at that moment he would not answer them specifically, although he could say that he would give them his most favorable consideration, and believed he should carry most if not all of them out, so far as possible.

"Second, a determination, under all circumstances, to support and maintain his constitutional authority, speaking for themselves and people of their respective States. "Third, pledges their aid in all measures to bring the war to an early termination, and that it should be prosecuted to ultimate victory, unless all rebels voluntarily return to their constitutional duty and obedience. "Fourth, congratulates the President upon his proclamation, believing it will do good as a measure of justice and sound policy.

Key1 September 26-27, 1862 September 26-27, 1862 We have reason to believe that the following is an exact copy of the record upon which Major John J. Key was dismissed from the military service of the United States. Executive Mansion Major John J. Key Washington, Sept. 26. 1862. Sir: I am informed that in answer to the question "Why was not the rebel army bagged immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?"propounded to you by Major Levi C. Turner, Judge Advocate &amp;c. you answered "That is not the game""The object is that neither army shall get much advantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when we will make a compromise and save slavery." I shall be very happy if you will, within twentyfour hours from the receipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner, that you did not, either litterally, or in substance, make the answer stated. Yours, A. LINCOLN (Indorsed as follows) "Copy delivered to Major Key at 10.25 A.M. September 27th. 1862. JOHN HAY." At about 11 o'clock, A.M. Sept. 27. 1862. Major Key and Major Turner appear before me. Major Turner says: "As I remember it, the conversation was, I asked the question why we did not bag them after the battle at Sharpsburg? Major Key's reply was that was not the game, that we should tire the rebels out, and ourselves, that that was the only way the Union could be preserved, we come together fraternally, and slavery be saved" On cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key converse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter a a [sic] sentiment unfavorable to the maintainance of the Union. He has never uttered anything which he Major T. would call disloyalty. The particular conversation detailed was a private one A. LINCOLN. (Indorsed on the above) In my view it is wholly inadmissable for any gentleman holding a military commission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to have done. Therefore let Major John J. Key be forthwith dismissed from the Military service of the United States. A LINCOLN. The foregoing is the whole record, except the simple order of dismissal at the War Department. At the interview of Major Key and Major Turner with the President, Major Key did not attempt to controvert the statement of Major Turner; but simply insisted, and sought to prove, that he was true to the Union. The substance of the President's reply was that if there was a "game"ever among Union men, to have our army not take an advantage of the enemy when it could, it was his object to break up that game.

October 14), this document entirely in Lincoln's handwriting preserves not only Lincoln's letter of September 26 to Major Key but also the record of subsequent events. The original letter of September 26 and the other original documents copied by Lincoln have not been found. On September 27, Major Key wrote Lincoln an explanation as follows: ". . . I have never uttered a word that might not have been addressed to you without giving offence The conversation held with Major Turner was in his own room and with him as a friend---and although I have no recollection of the expression, as reported---I have no doubt Major Turner so understood me. "I have often remarked, that the Rebels would never let this contest be decided, if they could help it---by a decided battle between us, but would protract this war---as they hoped to make a compromise in the end &amp; that they were fighting with that end in view. "In conclusion I solemnly aver---that if this war terminates in the entire destruction of the South---they have brought it on themselves."(DLC-RTL).

It is known to some that while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some friends. The time for its effect southward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous. It is six days old, and while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks have declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever. This, looked soberly in the face, is not very satisfactory. We have fewer troops in the field at the end of six days than we had at the beginning---the attrition among the old outnumbering the addition by the new. The North responds to the proclamation sufficiently in breath; but breath alone kills no rebels. I wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you the less for the kindness of your letter. Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 NH, VIII, 49-50. Hamlin's letter of September 25, written from Bangor, Maine, expressed "sincere thanks for your Emancipation Proclamation.

Apparently the surgeon general did not act, for on December 17, Attorney General Bates endorsed a note from Forsha with the comment that "it is evident that Dr. Forsha is not much of a scholar. But he certainly has great curative powers; and really works wonders in relieving pain and healing wounds."Forsha's letter reads as follows: "If the President will give me the charge of a hospital or a ward in one to use my owne medisen in and up on the wounded Soldiers for three Months I will insure ninety percent of all the flesh wounds to be well and the Soldiers to be in a healthy condition and fit for duty within thirty days from the time I take them if I can have them within 8 or 10 days from the time they are wounded and I will only ask the same assistance that the other Surgeons are allowed.

A.M General Stuart of the Rebel Army, has sent in a few of our prisoners under a flag of truce, paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the Indians, and evidently seeking to commit us to their right to parole our prisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the prisoners back with a distinct notice that we will recognize no parole given to our prisoners by the rebels, as extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them. Yet I wish your opinion upon it, based upon the general law and our cartel. I wish to avoid violations of law and bad faith. Answer as quick as possible, as the thing, if done at all, should be done at once. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 Copy, DLC-McClellan Papers. Concerning the Union troops paroled by Confederate General James E. B. Stuart, Halleck at first replied that he thought there was "nothing against"Lincoln's proposal (OR, II, IV, 593), but later on the same day he replied, "When I telegraphed you this morning I had only heard the cartel read by the Secretary of War. I have since examined the original document and withdraw my opinion. I am disposed to think the parole is made by the cartel to include all military duty." (Ibid., 593-94). On October 4, he concluded, "After full consultation with the Secretary of War and Colonel Holt it is concluded that the parole under the cartel does not prohibit doing service against the Indians."(Ibid., 598). But Attorney General Bates on October 18 gave his opinion that "The terms of the contract are . . . explicit . . . beyond a doubt. . . . It is the plainly declared purpose of the Cartel to prevent the use of prisoners paroled . . . in the discharge of any of the duties of a soldier. . . ."(DLC-RTL).

I return thanks to our soldiers for the good service they have rendered, for the energies they have shown, the hardships they have endured, and the blood they have so nobly shed for this dear Union of ours; and I also return thanks not only to the soldiers, but to the good citizens of Maryland, and to all the good men and women in this land, for their devotion to our glorious cause.

Your army must move now while the roads are good. If you cross the river between the enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation, you can be re- enforced with 30,000 men. If you move up the Valley of the Shenandoah, not more than 12,000 or 15,000 can be sent to you. The President advises the interior line between Washington and the enemy, but does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible. You will immediately report what line you adopt and when you intend to cross the river; also to what point the re-enforcements are to be sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be positively determined on before orders are given for building bridges and repairing railroads.

      <field name="fulltext">To Thomas H. Clay2 Oct. 8 1862. Thomas H. Clay. Washington, D.C., Cincinnati O. Oct. 8 1862. You can not have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order Gen. Morgan's command to Kentucky as a favor, because they have marched from Cumberland Gap. The precedent established by it would instantly break up the whole army. Buell's old troops now in pursuit of Bragg, have done more hard marching recently. And, in fact, if you include marching and fighting, there are scarcely any old troops East or West of the mountains that have not done as hard service. I sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter business than it is; but it does not admit of holy-days.

W. Morgan to Kentucky. They think this division has done so much and suffered so much in their late march from Cumberland Gap to Greenupsburg that they are entitled to this favor at the hands of Your Excellency; and it is believed to be the wish of every loyal Kentuckian that this should be done."(OR, I, XVI, II, 589).</field>

Lincoln's endorsement appears on a letter from Benjamin F. Wade, September 30, 1862: "I have just returned from a six weeks residence about the head of Lake Superior. I have taken pains, to make myself acquainted with our relations with the Indians in that region and from all I can learn I fear that there is danger of trouble with the Chippeways as well as the Sioux. I know that the people there live under the greatest apprehension of an outbreak, and have no doubt that measures should be immediately taken to prevent it. What those measures should be, Mr [Henry B.] Whipple will be able to inform you, but my principal object in writing to you . . . is, to induce you, if possible to appoint Hon. Henry M. Rice, Major Genl. with full command of the Department now under command of Genl. Pope. And this I do without any disparagement of Genl. Pope, who I regard as one of our very best officers, but he has no acquaintance with the Indian character, or experience of their mode of warfare, without which, no man is competent to command against them. Now for God's sake, let us not in this Sioux war, repeat the blunders of Genl. Braddock in the French war, or of our Administration in the conduct of the Florida War. What we want is, a man thoroughly acquainted with the Indian character, who is acquainted with their method of warfare and who can speak their language. A man, who the Indians both fear and respect. Such a man is Henry M. Rice of Minnesota, he is also well acquainted with military affairs, having spent a large portion of his active life with the army, as well as among the Indians. From what I have seen, I know the Chippeway tribe have the fullest confidence in him, and the Sioux before the war had like confidence in him. From all I can learn the people who are exposed to Indian depredations, have more confidence in his ability to protect them than in any other man. Mr. Rice is brave, sagacious and vigilant and persevering beyond any man I know. I hope therefore you will appoint him at once and I will answer with my head for the result. Genl.

      <field name="fulltext">To Samuel R. Curtis1 Oct. 12, 1862 Major General Curtis Washington D.C. St. Louis, Mo. Oct. 12, 1862 Would the completion of the railroad some distance further in the direction of Springfield, Mo, be of any military advantage to you? Please answer. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS, RPB. This telegram is misdated August 12, 1862, in the Official Records (I, XIII, 560; also NH, VII, 308). No answer from Curtis has been found. See also Lincoln's order extending the Pacific Railroad, July 11, supra. On September 11, Attorney General Bates wrote Lincoln urging the completion of the railroad "at all events to Little Piney---without delay. If that is not done, we put to fearful hazard, the success of the campaign in that region. . . ."(DLC-RTL). On September 19. Bates wrote again about Missouri matters in general and the railroad in particular, and on September 23 addressed Lincoln "earnestly to entreat you to grant . . . an order for the continuation of the . . . S. W. Branch of the Pacific Railroad, from Rolla to Lebanon, through the Ozark Mountains. [a draft of an order for that purpose, is herewith presented.]" (Ibid.). Brackets are in the source. If the order of July 11 was actually issued on that date, Bates' letters of September 11, 19, and 23 are hardly comprehensible. It seems barely possible that the "draft of an order"enclosed by Bates on September 23 may have been the order signed by Lincoln on July 11, but in this case it is difficult to conjecture why Bates dated it "June 27"and later changed the date to "July 11."It is also possible that the "draft of an order"enclosed by Bates on September 23 was an undated draft of a letter which is preserved in the Lincoln Papers (No. 18528) immediately following Bates' letter of September 19 rather than following the letter of September 23. If so, there is no evidence that the letter was ever sent by Lincoln. The text of the draft of the letter is as follows: "To Major General Curtis "Commanding Department of Missouri "General Many persons, including several Major Generals who have commanded in Missouri, have urged me to order the completion of the South West Branch of the Pacific Railroad to Lebanon. Nevertheless the burdens of the National Treasury are so enormous that I hesitate to make this order, and have concluded to refer the subject to you with the following instructions. "You will investigate the matter thoroughly, and in doing so, you will exclude all considerations of a local character and confine yourself to the point whether the completion of this road will decrease instead of increasing the national expenditures in the prosecution of the war and the maintainance of the supremacy of the Government in that section of the country. "Should you be well satisfied upon this point you will order the work to be done and the materials to be provided as expeditiously and as economically as possible, and for this purpose you are hereby authorized to appoint a Superintendant of the same; and to make such contracts as may be requisite therefor, and to make the proper requisitions upon the Quartermaster at St. Louis for payment thereof. "You will be especially careful to undertake no work beyond Little Piney unless you are thoroughly satisfied that you are acting within these instructions, and you will also be careful to guard the Government against imposition as to the price or quality of the work and materials."

      <field name="fulltext">To George B. McClellan1 Oct. 13, 1862. Major General McClellan Executive Mansion, My dear Sir Washington, Oct. 13, 1862. You remember my speaking to you of what I called your over-cautiousness. Are you not over- cautious when you assume that you can not do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be at least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim? As I understand, you telegraph Gen. Halleck that you can not subsist your army at Winchester unless the Railroad from Harper's Ferry to that point be put in working order. But the enemy does now subsist his army at Winchester at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad transportation as you would have to do without the railroad last named. He now wagons from Culpepper C.H. which is just about twice as far as you would have to do from Harper's Ferry. He is certainly not more than half as well provided with wagons as you are. I certainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage of the Railroad from Harper's Ferry to Winchester, but it wastes all the remainder of autumn to give it to you; and, in fact ignores the question of time, which can not, and must not be ignored. Again, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is "to operate upon the enemy's communications as much as possible without exposing your own."You seem to act as if this applies against you, but can not apply in your favor. Change positions with the enemy, and think you not he would break your communication with Richmond within the next twentyfour hours? You dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he gives up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do but to follow, and ruin him; if he does so with less than full force, fall upon, and beat what is left behind all the easier. Exclusive of the water line, you are now nearer Richmond than the enemy is by the route that you can, and he must take. Why can you not reach there before him, unless you admit that he is more than your equal on a march. His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the chord. The roads are as good on yours as on his. You know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac below, instead of above the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was that this would at once menace the enemies' communications, which I would seize if he would permit. If he should move Northward I would follow him closely, holding his communications. If he should prevent our seizing his communications, and move towards Richmond, I would press closely to him, fight him if a favorable opportunity should present, and, at least, try to beat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say "try"; if we never try, we shall never succeed. If he make a stand at Winchester, moving neither North or South, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we can not beat him when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we bear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a simple truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In coming to us, he tenders us an advantage which we should not waive. We should not so operate as to merely drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere, or fail finally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us, than far away. If we can not beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he again being within the entrenchments of Richmond. Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside track, the facility of supplying from the side away from the enemy is remarkable---as it were, by the different spokes of a wheel extending from the hub towards the rim---and this whether you move directly by the chord, or on the inside arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord-line, as you see, carries you by Aldie, Hay-Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how turn-pikes, railroads, and finally, the Potomac by Acquia Creek, meet you at all points from Washington. The same, only the lines lengthened a little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way. The gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following distances from Harper's Ferry, towit: Vestal's five miles; Gregorie's, thirteen, Snicker's eighteen, Ashby's, twenty-eight, Mannassas, thirty- eight, Chester fortyfive, and Thornton's fiftythree. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest the enemy, disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together, for dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the way, you would be practically between the enemy and both Washington and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here. When at length, running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way; if he does so, turn and attack him in rear. But I think he should be engaged long before such point is reached. It is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy; and it is unmanly to say they can not do it. This letter is in no sense an order. Yours truly A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. On October 16, 8:30 A.M., McClellan acknowledged Lincoln's letter "just received from Colonel [Delavan D.] Perkins. . . . I go to the front. . . . This may delay my reply."(OR, I, XIX, I, 16). On October 17, McClellan replied as follows: "Your letter of the 13th . . . and reached me yesterday morning by the hands of Colonel Perkins. "I had sent out strong reconnaissances . . . and as sharp artillery fire was heard, I felt it incumbent to go to the front. I did not leave Charlestown until dark, so that I have been unable to give Your Excellency's letter that full and respectful consideration which it merits at my hands. "I do not wish to detain Colonel Perkins beyond this morning's train; I therefore think it best to send him back with this simple acknowledgment of the receipt of Your Excellency's letter. . . . I promise you that I will give to your views the fullest and most unprejudiced consideration, and that it is my intention to advance the moment my men are shod and my cavalry are sufficiently renovated to be available. . . ."(Ibid.). No further reply has been found, but McClellan continued to delay and sought changes in the order of October 6 (see note, Lincoln to McClellan, October 7, supra). On October 21, Halleck telegraphed McClellan that the president "directs me to say that he has no change to make in his order of the 6th instant. If you have not been and are not now in condition to obey it, you will be able to show such want of ability. The President does not expect impossibilities, but he is very anxious that all this good weather should not be wasted in inactivity. Telegraph when you will move, and on what lines you propose to march."(OR, I, XIX, I, 81).</field>

Since the battle of Antietam, six regiments have made a trip of 200 miles, marching 55 miles in one day, while endeavoring to reach Stuart's cavalry. "General Pleasonton, in his official report, states that he, with the remainder of our available cavalry, while on Stuart's track, marched 78 miles in twenty-four hours. "Besides these two remarkable expeditions, our cavalry has been engaged in picketing and scouting 150 miles of river front ever since the battle of Antietam, and has made repeated reconnaissances since that time, engaging the enemy on every occasion, and, indeed, it has performed harder service since the battle than before. I beg that you will also consider that this same cavalry was brought from the Peninsula, where it encountered most laborious service, and was, at the commencement of this campaign, in low condition, and from that time to the present has had no time to recruit.

Of course you know the facts better than I, still two considerations remain. Stuart's cavalry outmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the Peninsula, and everywhere since. Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate, instead of "foraging"in squads everywhere? But I am so rejoiced to learn from your despatch to Gen. Halleck, that you begin crossing the river this morning. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ALS copy, DLC-RTL. McClellan replied at 9 P.M., "I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of this morning. You will pardon me for most respectfully differing with you in regard to the expression in your dispatch `Stuart's cavalry has done more marked service on the Peninsula and everywhere since.' I cannot resist the strength of my own conviction that some one has conveyed to your mind an erroneous impression in regard to the service of our cavalry, for I know you would not intentionally do injustice to the excellent officers and men of which it is composed . . . . "With the exception of the two raids by Stuart, I am unconscious of a single instance where the rebel cavalry has exhibited any superiority over ours. The fact that Stuart outmarched Pleasonton in his last raid is easily accounted for. It is said that he received a relay of fresh horses when he crossed the river at McCoy's Ferry. From that point he had extra lead horses to take the places of those that gave out on the road, besides which he stole some 1,000 horses in Pennsylvania, which contributed toward giving him another relay. Notwithstanding all this, he dropped a great many broken-down horses along the road. Pleasonton made his entire trip without a change of horses. "After this statement of facts has been placed before you, I feel confident you will concur with me that our cavalry is equally as efficient as that of the rebels."(OR, I, XIX, II, 490- 91).</field>

The New York Tribune, October 28, 1862, however, gives an account of the interview as occurring on October 27, but Lincoln's letter to Mrs. Gurney, September 4, 1864, infra, specifies Sunday, September 26. Mrs. Gurney was the widow and third wife of Joseph J. Gurney, English Quaker, philanthropist and religious writer.

McClellan telegraphed asking Gen. Halleck to have the order made. Gen. Halleck went to the Sec. of War with it, stating his approval of the plan, the Secretary assented, and Gen.

On October 27, 1862, Governor Curtin telegraphed Lincoln his protest against AGO General Orders No. 154, October 9, 1862, "as unjust to the people of the States, and calculated to demoralize and destroy volunteer organizations. . . ."(OR, I, XIX, II, 500). Order No. 154, issued on McClellan's recommendation, instructed that, "The commanding officer of each regiment, battalion, and battery of the Regular Army in the field, will appoint one or more recruiting officers, who are hereby authorized to enlist, with their own consent, the requisite number of efficient volunteers to fill the ranks of their command to the legal standard. . . ."Lincoln referred Curtin's telegram to the Secretary of War, and Stanton returned it on October 30 with his endorsement, "Order No 154 referred to within was made at the special request of Major General McClellan approved by General Halleck. . . . The protest of Governor Curtin is ill advised, revolutionary and tends to excite discontent and mutiny in the army and in my judgment should be severely rebuked by the President."(DLC-RTL). On October 31, Halleck authorized McClellan, "if you deem best, to revoke all enlistments from the volunteer artillery under your command, and to return them to their batteries."(OR, I, XIX, II, 516).</field>

The Army is constantly depleted by company officers who give their men leave of absence in the very face of the enemy, and on the eve of an engagement, which is almost as bad as desertion. At this very moment there are between seventy and one hundred thousand men absent on furlough from the Army of the Potomac. The army, like the nation, has become demoralized by the idea that the war is to be ended, the nation united, and peace restored, by strategy, and not by hard desperate fighting.

Also, that Major General Hunter take command of the Corps in said Army, which is now commanded by General Burnside. That Major General Fitz-John Porter be relieved from the command of the corps he now commands in said Army; and that Major General Hooker take command of said corps." The General-in-Chief, is authorized, in discretion, to issue an order substantially as the above, forthwith, or so soon as he may deem proper. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, IHi. Halleck issued the first paragraph of Lincoln's order relieving McClellan and appointing Burnside as AGO General Orders No. 182. November 5, 1862. The second paragraph concerning Hunter was not issued, but "no revocation of the order is of record."(OR, I, XIX, II, 545 n.). The Ninth Corps which had been commanded by Burnside was under command of Brigadier General Orlando B. Willcox as of November 10, 1862 (OR, I, XIX, II, 569). The third paragraph appointing Hooker to the Fifth Corps was issued as AGO Special Orders No. 337, November 10, 1862. Burnside assumed command on November 9. Lincoln's order of removal had been long delayed in spite of tremendous pressure from many political figures and private citizens, as well as the majority of his cabinet. On August 30, Secretary Chase had drawn up a letter to the president which Secretaries Stanton and Smith joined him in signing, recommending "the immediate removal of George B. McClellan."(ORB). On September 2, a similar document was drafted by Secretary Bates "declaring to you our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any of the armies of the United States."(DLC-Stanton Papers). Stanton, Chase, Smith, and Bates signed this document, a copy of which is in the Nicolay Papers bearing the following note in Bates' handwriting: "Note. M.

At the opening of the Council, he seemed wrung by the bitterest anguish---said he felt almost ready to hang himself---in ansr to something said by Mr. Chase, he sd. he was far from doubting our sincerity, but that he was so distressed, precisely because he knew we were earnestly sincere. "He was, manifestly alarmed for the safety of the City. He had been talking with Gen Halleck (who, I think is cowed) &amp; had gotten the idea that Pope's army was utterly demoralized--- saying that "if Pope's army came within the lines (of the forts) as a mob, the City wd be overrun by the enemy in 48 hours!!" "I said that if Halleck doubted his ability to defend the City, he ought to be instantly, broke. 50,000 men were enough to defend it against all the power of the enemy. If the City fell, it would be by treachery in our leaders, &amp; not by lack of power to defend. The shame was that we were reduced to the defensive, instead of the aggressive policy &amp;c.

Butler replied on November 28 that Colonel John W. Shaffer "has had put up to be forwarded to you a Bbl. of the first sugar ever made by free black labor in Louisiana. . . . The planters seem to have been struck with a sort of judicial blindness, and some of them so deluded have abandoned their crops rather than work them with free labor."Concerning the elections to be held on November 12, Butler added, "I found Dr. [Thomas E. H.] Cottman to be one of the candidates . . . but he had voluntarily signed the Ordinance of Secession . . . and as the Doctor had never by any public act testified his abnegation of that act . . . I thought it would be best that the Government should not be put to the scandal of having a person so situated elected, although the Doctor may be a good Union man now . . . I fear . . . we shall lose Mr. Bouligny. He was imprudent enough to run for the office of Justice of Peace under the Secessionists . . . and although . . . a good Union man . . . that fact tells against him.

I think I know what it was, but I may be mistaken. Three main causes told the whole story. 1. The democrats were left in a majority by our friends going to the war. 2. The democrats observed this &amp; determined to re-instate themselves in power, and 3. Our newspaper's, by vilifying and disparaging the administration, furnished them all the weapons to do it with. Certainly, the ill-success of the war had much to do with this. You give a different set of reasons. If you had not made the following statements, I should not have suspected them to be true. "The defeat of the administration is the administrations own fault."(opinion) "It admitted its professed opponents to its counsels"(Asserted as a fact) "It placed the Army, now a great power in this Republic, into the hands of its' enemys" (Asserted as a fact) "In all personal questions, to be hostile to the party of the Government, seemed, to be a title to consideration."(Asserted as a fact) "If to forget the great rule, that if you are true to your friends, your friends will be true to you, and that you make your enemies stronger by placing them upon an equality with your friends.""Is it surprising that the opponents of the administration should have got into their hands the government of the principal states, after they have had for a long time the principal management of the war, the great business of the national government." I can not dispute about the matter of opinion. On the the [sic] three matters (stated as facts) I shall be glad to have your evidence upon them when I shall meet you. The plain facts, as they appear to me, are these. The administration came into power, very largely in a minority of the popular vote. Notwithstanding this, it distributed to it's party friends as nearly all the civil patronage as any administration ever did. The war came. The administration could not even start in this, without assistance outside of it's party. It was mere nonsense to suppose a minority could put down a majority in rebellion. Mr. Schurz (now Gen. Schurz) was about here then &amp; I do not recollect that he then considered all who were not republicans, were enemies of the government, and that none of them must be appointed to to [sic] military positions. He will correct me if I am mistaken. It so happened that very few of our friends had a military education or were of the profession of arms. It would have been a question whether the war should be conducted on military knowledge, or on political affinity, only that our own friends (I think Mr. Schurz included) seemed to think that such a question was inadmissable. Accordingly I have scarcely appointed a democrat to a command, who was not urged by many republicans and opposed by none. It was so as to McClellan. He was first brought forward by the Republican Governor of Ohio, &amp; claimed, and contended for at the same time by the Republican Governor of Pennsylvania. I received recommendations from the republican delegations in congress, and I believe every one of them recommended a majority of democrats. But, after all many Republicans were appointed; and I mean no disparagement to them when I say I do not see that their superiority of success has been so marked as to throw great suspicion on the good faith of those who are not Republicans. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, DLC-Schurz Papers. Schurz's letter dated at headquarters of the Third Division of the Eleventh Corps at New Baltimore, Virginia, November 8, 1862, is in the Lincoln Papers, but Lincoln's letter so adequately summarizes as well as answers the general's political opinions that further quotation seems superfluous.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Order for Sabbath Observance3 November 15, 1862. Executive Mansion, Washington, November 15, 1862. The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in the military and naval service. The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the Divine will, demand that Sunday labor in the Army and Navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity. The discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer, nor the cause they defend be imperiled, by the profanation of the day or name of the Most High. "At this time of public distress"---adopting the words of Washington in 1776---"men may find enough to do in the service of God and their country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality."The first General Order issued by the Father of his Country after the Declaration of Independence,1 indicates the spirit in which our institutions were founded and should ever be defended: "The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country."ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

My dear Sir Your very patriotic and judicious letter, addressed to Judge Davis, in relation to the Mississippi, has been left with me by him for perusal. You do not estimate the value of the object you press, more highly than it is estimated here. It is now the object of particular attention. It has not been neglected, as you seem to think, because the West was divided into different military Departments. The cause is much deeper. The country will not allow us to send our whole Western force down the Mississippi, while the enemy sacks Louisville and Cincinnati. Possibly it would be better if the country would allow this, but it will not. I confidently believed, last September that we could end the war by allowing the enemy to go to Harrisburg and Philadelphia, only that we could not keep down mutiny, and utter demoralization among the Pennsylvanians. And this, though very unhandy sometimes, is not at all strange. I presume if an army was starting to-day for New-Orleans, and you confidently believed that St. Louis would be sacked in consequence, you would be in favor of stopping such army.

After magnificently depicting the scene of triumph following the surrender of the British at Yorktown, Henry concluded, "But hark! what notes of discord are these which disturb the general joy, and silence the acclamations of victory---they are the notes of John Hook, hoarsely bawling through the American camp, beef! beef! beef!"(pp. 389-90).</field>

Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that Federal officers, not citizens of Louisiana, may be set up as candidates for Congress in that State. In my view, there could be no possible object in such an election. We do not particularly need members of congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana, are willing to be members of congress &amp; to swear support to the constitution; and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them. To send a parcel of Northern men here, as representatives, elected as would be understood, (and perhaps really so,) at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of congress here I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.

I now regret the necessity of inferring that you had not seen this letter up to the 6th. Inst. I inclose you a copy of it, and also a copy of another addressed to yourself this morning, upon the same general subject, and placed in the hands of Dr. Kennedy. I ask attention to both. I wish elections for Congressmen to take place in Louisiana; but I wish it to be a movement of the people of the Districts, and not a movement of our military and quasi-military, authorities there. I merely wish our authorities to give the people a chance---to protect them against secession interference. Of course the election can not be according to strict law---by state law, there is, I suppose, no election day, before January; and the regular election officers will not act, in many cases, if in any. These knots must be cut, the main object being to get an expression of the people. If they would fix a day and a way, for themselves, all the better; but if they stand idle not seeming to know what to do, do you fix these things for them by proclamation. And do not waste a day about it; but, fix the election day early enough that we can hear the result here by the first of January. Fix a day for an election in all the Districts, and have it held in as many places as you can. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ADfS, DLC-RTL.

      <field name="fulltext">To Nathaniel P. Banks1 Nov. 22, 1862. Executive Mansion, My dear General Banks Washington, Nov. 22, 1862. Early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that week, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you, which, I am assured, can not be filled, and got off within an hour short of two months! I inclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine---that you have never seen it. My dear General, this expanding, and piling up of impedimenta, has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more. And, after all, where you are going, you have no use for them. When you parted with me, you had no such idea in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said. You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start. You must be off before Congress meets. You would be better off any where, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons, doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers. Now dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter---it is the very reverse. The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you. Very truly your friend A.

It was drawn up by an officer who did not fully comprehend my instructions, and inadvertently approved by me without sufficient examination and proper explanation. My purpose has not been changed since I left Washington, and I have waited nothing not absolutely necessary. . . . I have explained by letter to Secretary of War."(OR,III,II,865). Banks' despatch to Stanton of the same date specified that his requisition was for supplies which would be needed "for ultimate operations some weeks hence. I deeply regret that my purpose was not more clearly explained. I have waited only vessels, men, commissary stores and ordnance stores. . . ."(Ibid.).</field>

No record has been found of Ullmann's transfer at this time, but on March 25, 1863, Stanton notified Banks that Ullmann, who had been made a brigadier general as of January 13, had been "intrusted with authority"to raise "a large military force from the colored population of Louisiana . . . and directed to report to you. . . ."(OR, III,III, 101-102).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To William L. Vance1 Nov. 22, 1862. Mr. W. L. Vance Executive Mansion, Sir: Washington, Nov. 22, 1862. You tell me you have in your hands some two hundred and seventy thousand dollars of "Confederate Scrip"which was forced upon Union men of Kentucky, in exchange for supplies, by the rebels during their late raid into that State; and you wish government authority for you to take this Scrip into the Cotten-States, exchange it for cotten if found practicable, and to bring the cotten out. While I have felt great anxiety to oblige you, and your friends, in this matter, I feel constrained to decline it. It would come to something, or it would come to nothing---that is, you would get cotten for the Scrip, or you would not. If you should get none, the effort would have been a useless failure. If you should get any, to precisely that extent, this government would have aided in giving currency to this Scrip---that is, men seeing that the Scrip would bring cotten, would gladly give produce for the scrip; and hence a scramble for it, as for gold would ensue. If your two hundred and seventy thousand dollars, was to be the sole instance, I would gladly risk it. But it would not be the beginning, or, at most, only the beginning. Having begun, I could not stop. What I had done for some, I must do for others. All that sort of Scrip now in Kentucky, and much not yet in Kentucky, would find it's way into Union-hands and be presented under the rule. We all know how easily oaths are furnished, when required, in transactions of this sort. And the thing would become even broader yet. Men who have been robbed out-right by the rebels, without even receiving scrip would appeal, (and with quite as equitable a case) to be permitted a means of indemnity, by leave to go in and bring out cotten. This would run till at length I should have to abandon all restraint, or put a stop to what it is now much easier to not begin. Footnotes 1 ADf, DLC-RTL. A William L.

      <field name="fulltext">To John J. Key2 Nov. 24, 1862 Major John J. Key Executive Mansion, Dear Sir: Washington, Nov. 24, 1862 A bundle of letters including one from yourself, was, early last week, handed me by Gen. Halleck, as I understood, at your request. I sincerely sympathise with you in the death of your brave and noble son.3 In regard to my dismissal of yourself from the military service, it seems to me you misunderstand me. I did not charge, or intend to charge you with disloyalty. I had been brought to fear that there was a class of officers in the army, not very inconsiderable in numbers, who were playing a game to not beat the enemy when they could, on some peculiar notion as to the proper way of saving the Union; and when you were proved to me, in your own presence, to have avowed yourself in favor of that "game,"and did not attempt to controvert the proof, I dismissed you as an example and a warning to that supposed class. I bear you no ill will; and I regret that I could not have the example without wounding you personally. But can I now, in view of the public interest, restore you to the service, by which the army would understand that I indorse and approve that game myself? If there was any doubt of your having made the avowal, the case would be different. But when it was proved to me, in your presence, you did not deny or attempt to deny it, but confirmed it in my mind, by attempting to sustain the position by argument. I am really sorry for the pain the case gives you, but I do not see how, consistently with duty, I can change it. Yours, &amp;c. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 LS (copy?), DLC-RTL.

      <field name="fulltext">To Carl Schurz2 Nov. 24. 1862. Gen. Carl Schurz Executive Mansion, My dear Sir Washington, Nov. 24. 1862. I have just received, and read, your letter of the 20th. The purport of it is that we lost the late elections, and the administration is failing, because the war is unsuccessful; and that I must not flatter myself that I am not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if the war fails, the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for it, whether I deserve it or not. And I ought to be blamed, if I could do better. You think I could do better; therefore you blame me already. I think I could not do better; therefore I blame you for blaming me. I understand you now to be willing to accept the help of men, who are not republicans, provided they have "heart in it."Agreed. I want no others. But who is to be the judge of hearts, or of "heart in it"? If I must discard my own judgment, and take yours, I must also take that of others; and by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject, I should have none left, republicans, or others---not even yourself. For, be assured, my dear sir, there are men who have "heart in it"that think you are performing your part as poorly as you think I am performing mine. I certainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan; but before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors to them, who would do better; and I am sorry to add, that I have seen little since to relieve those fears. I do not clearly see the prospect of any more rapid movements. I fear we shall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case, rather than in particular generals. I wish to disparage no one---certainly not those who sympathize with me; but I must say I need success more than I need sympathy, and that I have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting success from my sympathizers, than from those who are denounced as the contrary. It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been very much alike, in what they have done, and what they have failed to do. In sealing their faith with their blood, Baker, an[d] Lyon, and Bohlen, and Richardson, republicans, did all that men could do; but did they any more than Kearney, and Stevens, and Reno, and Mansfield, none of whom were republicans, and some, at least of whom, have been bitterly, and repeatedly, denounced to me as secession sympathizers?1 I will not perform the ungrateful task of comparing cases of failure. In answer to your question "Has it not been publicly stated in the newspapers, and apparantly proved as a fact, that from the commencement of the war, the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the confidential subordinates of as important an officer as Adjutant General Thomas?"I must say "no"so far as my knowledge extends. And I add that if you can give any tangible evidence upon that subject, I will thank you to come to the City and do so. Very truly Your friend A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 ALS, DLC-Schurz Papers. On November 20, Schurz replied to Lincoln's communication of November 10, supra, in part as follows: "I fear you entertain too favorable a view of the causes of our defeat in the elections. . . . "Whatever proportion of Republicans may have entered the army---if the administration had succeeded in preserving its hold upon the masses, your majorities would . . . have put the majorities of 1860 into the shade. . . . But the general confidence and enthusiasm yielded to general disappointment, and . . . too many Republicans . . . either voted against you or withheld their votes. I know this to be a fact. . . . That some of our newspapers disparaged and vilified the administration may be true. . . . But however that may be, I ask you . . . what power would there have been in newspaper-talk . . . had the administration been able to set up against it the evidence of great successes? . . . "I am far from presuming to blame you for having placed old democrats into high military positions. . . . But it was unfortunate that you sustained them . . . after they had been found failing;---failing not only in a political but also in a military sense. Was I really wrong in saying that the principal management of the war had been in the hands of your opponents? Or will perhaps anybody assert, that such men as McClellan and Buell and Halleck have the least sympathy with you or your views and principles?---or that their efficiency as military leaders has offered a compensation for their deficiency of sympathy, since the first has in 18 months succeeded in effecting literally nothing except the consumption of our resources with the largest and best appointed army this country ever saw;---since the second by his criminal tardiness and laxity endangered even the safety of Cincinnati; and since the appearance of the third on the battlefield of Shiloh served suddenly to arrest the operations of our victorious troops. . . . Has it not been publicly stated in the newspapers and apparently proved as a fact, that from the commencement of the war the enemy has [been] continually supplied with information by some of the confidential subordinates of so important an officer as Adjutant General Thomas?. . . . I am far from being inclined to impeach the loyalty and good faith of any man; but the coincidence of circumstances is such, that if the case were placed before a popular jury, I would find it much easier to act on the prosecution than on the defence. . . . You say that our Republican generals did no better. . . . I ask . . . what Republican General has ever had a fair chance . . .? "No, sir, let us indulge in no delusions as to the true causes of our defeat in the elections. . . . The people had sown confidence and reaped disaster and disappointment. They wanted a change, and . . . they sought it in the wrong direction. I entreat you, do not attribute to small incidents . . . what is a great historical event. It is best that you . . . should see the fact in its true light and appreciate its significance: the result of the elections was a most serious and severe reproof administered to the administration. . . ."(DLC-RTL).

      <field name="fulltext">To George Robertson2 Nov. 26, 1862. Private Executive Mansion, Hon. George Robertson, Washington, Nov. 26, 1862. My dear Sir: A few days since I had a despatch from you which I did not answer. If I were to be wounded personally, I think I would not shun it. But it is the life of the nation. I now understand the trouble is with Col. Utley; that he has five slaves in his camp, four of whom belong to rebels, and one belonging to you. If this be true, convey yours to Col. Utley, so that he can make him free, and I will pay you any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars. Yours, &amp;c. A. LINCOLN Footnotes 2 Copy, DLC-RTL. See Lincoln's first letter of November 20, supra, in reply to Robertson's dispatch of November 19, 1862. On November 17, Colonel William L. Utley of the Twenty-second Wisconsin Volunteers wrote Lincoln from Nicholasville, Kentucky, as follows: "Permit me respectfully to appeal to you. . . . For a long time . . . enduring hardships and privasions of military life and of army marches . . . we penetrated the state of Kentucky, the devastating hords of rebels fleeing before us. . . . "As a compensation for these sacrifices, hardships and exposures . . . I now find myself indited for man-stealing, by a Kentucky court, and hunted by her officers as a fellon for her penitentiary. "The facts in the case are few, simple, and easily understood. . . . On Friday last, Judge Robinson of Lexington, representing himself as a Union man of whose counsels . . . you have seen fit to avail yourself, came into my lines, and claimed and demanded as his property, a Negro boy found in the regiment. How, when, where, or by what means the boy came into the lines, or by whom he was claimed as property, I had previously no knowledge. . . . I refused to recognize his claims, to lead the boy, as he requested, beyond my lines, or to forbid the soldiers from interfereing should he attempt to do so. He was not, however, forbidden to take him. . . . The boy refused to go with him and claimed protection from the power of one whose cruel treatment, as he asserted, had already made him a dwarf instead of a man. . . . To you, I now appeal for . . . protection . . . for simply standing by the Constitution, obeying the laws of Congress and honoring the Proclamation . . . issued on the 23d day of September last. . . . Judge Robinson declared the President's proclamation of the 23d of Sept, to be unconstitutional, to have no bearing on Kentucky and that the state would never submit to it. . . ."(DLC- RTL). On the same day Colonel Utley penned another classic to his friend Alexander W. Randall, recently returned from his post as minister to Rome, who transmitted it to the president. Although too long to reproduce in full, the pertinent portions read as follows: "I am in a devil of a scrape, and appeal to you for assistance. . . . I am ahead yet, but they have taken a new dodge on me, they have got me indicted at Lexington under the Laws of Kentucky. The Warrant is in the hands of the Sherriff of this county he finds the same difficulty that the rats did in getting the bell on the cat, it would be a good thing to have done, but a bad thing to do. they find it so in arresting me. they can never do it while there is a man left in the 22d Regiment. the Brig. Genl. in whose Brigade we now are, Refuses to assist in arresting me. Now what I want, is to have you use your influence with the President to have him retained in command of this Brigade. for he certainly will be removed . . . unless measures are taken to prevent, or we shall again be placed under some pro Slavary Jcass (?) as we have been . . . untill we were placed under him. You know how we was hurried off without blankets, tents or anything. . . . Kentucky was howling like a set of d---d Hyenas (as they are) for help. the men left their grain standing . . . we all throwed down our impliments and . . . came directly to Kentucky. . . . We have been Brigaded under five or six different Genls all just alike all chosen for their adherence to the Kentuckey policy. We have had to submit to the most degrading orders. . . . We have laid in the dirt five nights on an old Rebel ex Congressmans farm (with a large straw stack roting down within 40 Rods of us). . . . When we left there two or three of his nigers got in the Regt and claimed protection. I refused to be made a niger ketcher, as you have no doubt seen by the papers. . . . I have tryed to avoid trouble on the niger question, but I could not escape it, but I am just the boy to meet it when it comes. . . . There is no such thing as unionism in Kentuckey. . . . I wish Abraham Lincoln could hear what the professed union men call him. I told the Governor (Robinson) that all Kentuckeyans were either d---d trators or cowards, that there was no loyalty in the state, that you might put it all in to one end of the scales, and a niger baby in the other end, and Loyalty and unionism would go up with a rush I have given them hell, and now they intend to give me h---l. . . . What I want is . . . to be kept under Generals that acknowledge the power of the president, or be taken out of the state. there is a general understanding among the genl officers commanding in Kentucky to ignore the proclimation. . . . I am the first man that has attempted to carry it out, and now I am indicted by Loud mouthed Union men. . . ."(DLC-RTL). On December 1, Judge Robertson replied to Lincoln's letter, "In my late telegram to you I did not allude to either my boy Adam, or to Col. Utley, or to his case. Divining your information, as you must have done, from some other source, you have been misinformed, and . . . misconceived the motive of my dispatch. . . . I had put Col. Utley in the position which I preferred, and I neither intended nor disired to seek any . . . intervention in . . . my own case. . . . The citation in my civil suit against him having been served, I can certainly obtain a judgement for $1000, and perhaps more. . . . My object in that suit was far from mercenary---it was solely to try the question whether the civil or the military power is Constitutionally supreme in Kentucky. . . ."(DLC-RTL). Whatever his intentions were at this time, Robertson pressed his suit in the courts and on October 6, 1871, eventually obtained judgment against Utley in the U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, in the amount of $908.06 plus costs of $26.40. By an act approved February 14, 1873, congress directed the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the amount "together with interest from the date of recovery"for the relief of William L. Utley.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To Henry W. Halleck2 Nov. 27. 1862 Steamer Baltimore Major General Halleck Off Acquia Creek, Va Sir: Nov. 27. 1862 I have just had a long conference with Gen. Burnside. He believes that Gen. Lees whole army, or nearly the whole of it is in front of him, at and near Fredericksburg. Gen. B. says he could take into battle now any day, about, one hundred and ten thousand men, that his army is in good spirit, good condition, good moral, and that in all respects he is satisfied with officers and men; that he does not want more men with him, because he could not handle them to advantage; that he thinks he can cross the river in face of the enemy and drive him away, but that, to use his own expression, it is somewhat risky. I wish the case to stand more favorable than this in two respects. First, I wish his crossing of the river to be nearly free from risk; and secondly, I wish the enemy to be prevented from falling back, accumulating strength as he goes, into his intrenchments at Richmond. I therefore propose that Gen. B. shall not move immediately; that we accumulate a force on the South bank of the Rappahanock---at, say, Port-Royal, under protection of one or two gun-boats, as nearly up to twentyfive thousand strong as we can. At the same time another force of about the same strength as high up the Pamunkey, as can be protected by gunboats. These being ready, let all three forces move simultaneously, Gen. B.'s force in it's attempt to cross the river, the Rappahanock force moving directly up the South side of the river to his assistance, and ready, if found admissable, to deflect off to the turnpike bridge over the Mattapony in the direction of Richmond. The Pamunkey force to move as rapidly as possible up the North side of the Pamunkey, holding all the bridges, and especially the turnpike bridge immediately North of Hanover C.H; hurry North, and seize and hold the Mattapony bridge before mentioned, and also, if possible, press higher up the streams and destroy the railroad bridges. Then, if Gen. B. succeeds in driving the enemy from Fredericksburg, he the enemy no longer has the road to Richmond, but we have it and can march into the city. Or, possibly, having forced the enemy from his line, we could move upon, and destroy his army. Gen. B.'s main army would have the same line of supply and retreat as he has now provided; the Rappahanock force would have that river for supply, and gun-boats to fall back upon; and the Pamunkey force would have that river for supply, and a line between the two rivers- --Pamunkey &amp; Mattapony---along which to fall back upon it's gun-boats. I think the plan promises the best results, with the least hazzard, of any now conceiveable. Note--- The above plan, proposed by me, was rejected by Gen. Halleck &amp; Gen. Burnside, on the ground that we could not raise and put in position, the Pamunkey force without too much waste of time A.L. Footnotes 2 ADfS, DLC-RTL. A dispatch from Washington dated November 29 in the New York Herald, November 30, 1862, reported that "Major General Burnside arrived here last night, and spent this forenoon principally in consultation with President Lincoln and General Halleck. He has already returned to his head-quarters." Lincoln's note at the end of the draft was presumably added after this conference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Edward Bates1 Nov. 29, 1862. Executive Mansion, Washington, Hon. Attorney General Nov. 29, 1862. My dear Sir: Few things perplex me more than this question between Gov. Gamble, and the War Department, as to whether the peculiar force organized by the former in Missouri are "State troops,"or "United States troops."Now, this is either an immaterial, or a mischievous question. First, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the forces is to be called by, it is immaterial. Secondly, if it is desired for more than the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from which to draw practical inferences, then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one dispute by deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest full of eggs for hatching new disputes. I believe the force is not strictly either "State troops"or "United States troops."It is of mixed character. I therefore think it is safer when a practical question arises, to decide that question directly, and not indirectly, by deciding a general abstraction supposed to include it, and also including a great deal more. Without dispute, Gov. Gamble appoints the officers of this force, and fills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute is "Can Gov. Gamble make a vacancy, by removing an officer, or accepting a resignation? Now, while it is proper that this question shall be settled, I do not perceive why either Gov. Gamble, or the government here, should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only because there seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that it might be either way without injury to the service; or that the offer of the Secretary of War to let Gov. Gamble make vacancies, and he, the Secretary, to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory. Footnotes 1 ADf, DLC-RTL. On November 17, Governor Gamble, who was in Washington, wrote Lincoln concerning Lincoln's order of November 6, 1861, "You accepted the proposal . . . with the condition, that I should appoint the Major Genl. of . . . the Department, the Major General of the force thus to be raised. . . . I proceeded to raise the force and put it in the field, where it has rendered eminent service. . . . "A question has now arisen between the War Department and myself---Whether the force thus raised is a state force or a United States force. . . . I have acted with perfectly good faith on the clear conviction that I was dealing with a state force. "The question now pending . . . involves the construction of the instrument in which my offer to raise this force is accepted by you. . . ."(DLC-RTL).

      <field name="fulltext">Memorandum Concerning J. Wesley Greene2 [December, 1862?] [December, 1862?] After inquiry, I believe it is true that a man calling himself J. Wesley Greene, and professing to reside at Pittsburg, Pa., called on the President some time in November, and stated to him that he, Greene, had had two interviews with Jeff. Davis, at Richmond, Va., on the last day of October; and also related certain statements which he said Davis had made to him upon the occasion. The President became satisfied that Greene had not seen Davis at all, and that the whole thing was a very shallow attempt at humbuggery. Jeff. Davis can redeem Greene's character if he will, by verifying his statement. Footnotes 2 Hertz, II, 961. As printed by Hertz this item is described as "a manuscript memo."But Hertz's date, February, 1865, probably taken from the American Art Association Anderson Galleries Catalog, October 20, 1930, would seem to be incorrect. The New York Tribune for December 11, 1862, prints a similar statement at the end of a news item reprinted from the Chicago Times, Wednesday, December 10, 1862, which gives an account of J. Wesley Greene's visits to Jefferson Davis and to President Lincoln. The Tribune does not, however, credit the statement as Lincoln's, although implying that Lincoln is the source of information, and it seems possible that Lincoln may have written the memorandum in answer to a query from the press on the reliability of Greene's narrative. A letter from Greene to Lincoln, November 11, 1862, reads in part as follows: "An entire stranger to fame, and almost unknown . . . but at the same time an ardent lover of the country which for nearly fifty years has encompassed me with its protection, I presume to introduce myself to your notice in reference to the . . . termination of the Rebellion and the restoration of the Union. "One week has but just elapsed since I returned to my home in this city, fresh from two interviews with the controlling man of the rebellious states. I not only found him depressed in spirit, beyond my conception of him, in view of the terrible circumstances in which he is placed and the condition of the Confederacy, but I found him anxious for an end of hostilities and a return to the Union. In the last interview he cautiously intimated the terms on which the desired end might be accomplished. They are of a nature which forbids me to commit them to writing from this distance. This much I can say that, while he now deprecates foreign intervention or foreign mediation, the terms are such as may be secretly negotiated, and can in no way reflect upon the Government of which you are the head should they in any future period become known. "I am no visionary, . . . no speculator, no party demagogue. I am but a plain business man, who in other days became incidentally acquainted with Mr. Davis, an acquaintance which secured his friendship. . . . "I sincerely and daily pray for the peace and unity and prosperity of my beloved country, again. I honestly believe they can be brought about at an early day, honorably to the North without the continuance of bloodshed and devastation. If, therefore, Your Excellency desires an interview with me on this subject such an order as will convey me to Washington will be promptly complied with. "Permit me to add, Sir, that I have never intimated this matter to any human being; and desire that it may, at least for the present, be treated confidentially."(DLC-RTL).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Annual Message to Congress1 December 1, 1862 December 1, 1862 Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: Since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed. And while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time, and wise way, all will yet be well. The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, made by the House of Representatives near the close of the last session of Congress.2 If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might reasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of our domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that position,3 which has proved only less injurious to themselves, than to our own country. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the national arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.1 The civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment, the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same time, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign states, and between parties or factions in such states. We have attempted no propagandism, and acknowledged no revolution. But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits, than to its supposed, and often exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it, on the part of Her Majesty's government, has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the stade dues has been carried into full effect, under the act of Congress for that purpose. A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established, and vigorously enforced, in a season of great commercial activity like the present, without committing occasional mistakes, and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states, thus interested, mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented by the commander of the blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had, shortly before, been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees.1 Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad---some from interested motives, others upon patriotic considerations, and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments---have suggested similar measures; while, on the other hand, several of the Spanish-American republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circumstances, I have declined to move any such colony to any state, without first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen; and I have, at the same time, offered to the several states situated within the tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are, as yet, the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here, could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons, contemplating colonization, do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries, as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them, in this respect, is improving; and that, ere long, there will be an augmented, and considerable migration to both these countries, from the United States. The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states, remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan. During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent, but, more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed, are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress, are so intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile. The commission under the convention with the republic of New Granada closed its session, without having audited and passed upon, all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint commission between the United States and the republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco, to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the Russian empire. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted into the federal Union. The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government, and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries---results which cannot fail to be auspicious. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude, and certainty, unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field, demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue, without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor. The suspension of specie payments by the banks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, be so economically, or so well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency; and has satisfied, partially, at least, and for the time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people, immense sums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned, should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility into coin, is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes, payable in coin, and sufficiently large for the wants of the people, can be permanently, usefully and safely maintained. Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured? I know of none which promises so certain results, and is, at the same time, so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247 06, of which sum $49,056,397 62 were derived from customs; $1,795,331,73 from the direct tax; from public lands $152,203,77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787 64; from loans in all forms, $529,692,460 50. The remainder, $2,257,065 80, was the balance from last year. The disbursements during the same period were for congressional, executive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009 29; for foreign intercourse, $1,339,710,35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges, $14,129,771 50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985 52; under the War Department, $394,368,407,36; under the Navy Department, $42,674,569 69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324 45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan, and redemptions, $96,096,922 09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700 25; and leaving a balance in the treasury on the first day of July, 1862, of $13,043,546,81. It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922 09, expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted, both from receipts and expenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324 97; and the expenditures, $474,744,778 16. Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention. The reports of the Secretaries of War, and of the Navy, are herewith transmitted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of them here, upon any principle, which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking your attention to them. It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post Office Department, as compared with several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296 40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820 90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759 11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364 13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States, and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster General has also opened a correspondence, through the Department of State, with foreign governments, proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage, and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens, and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained, and agreed to, by all the governments from whom replies have been received. I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster General in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service. The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands: "The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were $137,476 26---a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers, that sales for cash cannot be expected, to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office, and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market" The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands, and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really, coincident at the beginning point---the Treasury report including a considerable sum now, which had previously been reported from the Interior---sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior, and not by the Treasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas, renounced their allegiance to the United States, and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained, by superior force, to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required. In the month of August last the Sioux Indians, in Minnesota, attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing, indiscriminately, men, women, and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no means of defence had been provided. It is estimated that not less than eight hundred persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to be stated. Information was received by the Indian bureau, from different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains. The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property. The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as a guarantee against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodelled. Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done. I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific railroad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital, and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan canal, and improving the Illinois river, is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask attention to it. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized. The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States. Also that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants and cuttings, and has already published, and liberally diffused, much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory. The creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens; and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize, at no distant day, all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people. On the twenty-second day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called "compensated emancipation." A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever."It is of the first importance to duly consider, and estimate, this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States, is well adapted to be the home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more. Its vast extent, and its variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, in this age, for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these, to be an advantageous combination, for one united people. In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat: "One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section; while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. "Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous, or more satisfactory, after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties, easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens, than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you." There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary, upon which to divide. Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length, are merely surveyor's lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper, or parchment, as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding section, the fugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. But there is another difficulty. The great interior region, bounded east by the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky mountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above ten millions of people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United States---certainly more than one million of square miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body of the republic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the Pacific, being the deepest, and also the richest, in undeveloped resources. In the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has, as yet, been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented. An[d] yet this region has no sea-coast, touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But separate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations. And this is true, wherever a dividing, or boundary line, may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains, that none south of it, can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north of it, can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable to the well- being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the best, is no proper question. All, are better than either, and all, of right, belong to that people, and to their successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow, rather, that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to, and through them, to the great outside world. They too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of the West, without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary. Our national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land we inhabit; not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes, it demands union, and abhors separation. In fact, it would, ere long, force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves---to the passing generations of men; and it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever with the passing of one generation. In this view, I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to the Constitution of the United States: "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both houses concurring,) That the following articles be proposed to the legislatures (or conventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all or any of which articles when ratified by three-fourths of the said legislatures (or conventions) to be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz: "Article ---. "Every State, wherein slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein, at any time, or times, before the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand and nine hundred, shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit: "The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State, bonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rate of --- per cent, per annum, to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each slave shown to have been therein, by the eig[h]th census of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such State by instalments, or in one parcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual, or at one time, within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond, only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterwards reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon. "Article ---. "All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war, at any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them, at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way, that no slave shall be twice accounted for. "Article ---. "Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise provide, for colonizing free colored persons, with their own consent, at any place or places without the United States." I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it could not continue. Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity, of sentiment, and of policy, in regard to slavery, and the African race amongst us. Some would perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, and without compensation; some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation; some would remove the freed people from us, and some would retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities, we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize, and act together. This would be compromise; but it would be compromise among the friends, and not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least, in several of the States. As to the first article, the main points are: first, the emancipation; secondly, the length of time for consummating it---thirty-seven years; and thirdly, the compensation. The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement---in fact, from the necessity of any derangement---while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each State, choosing to act under it, to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period; and it obliges no two states to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay, and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and economical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property---property acquired by descent, or by purchased, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having been often said, that the people of the south are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property, than are the people of the north; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say, that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance. If then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed is it not just that it be done at a common charge? And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means, than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let us consider it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted, by even some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war, than has been otherwise done. If so the measure would save money, and, in that view, would be a prudent and economical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing; but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation, of course, would be large. But it would require no ready cash; nor the bonds even, any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead of thirty one millions, as now. And not only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first national census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a population of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period? Our abundant room---our broad national homestead---is our ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born away. But such is not our condition. We have two millions nine hundred and sixty-three thousand square miles. Europe has three millions and eight hundred thousand, with a population averaging seventy-three and one-third persons to the square mile. Why may not our country, at some time, average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface, by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage? If, then, we are, at some time, to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States are already above the average of Europe---seventy three and a third to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each, 80; also two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 63, and the latter 59. The States already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio, since passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country, in natural capacity for sustaining a dense population. Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase, for the several decennial periods, to be as follows:--- 1790 3,929,827 1800 5,305,937 35.02 per cent. {ratio of {increase 1810 7,239,814 36.45 " 1820 9,638,131 33.13 " 1830 12,866,020 33.49 " 1840 17,069,453 32.67 " 1850 23,191,876 35.87 " 1860 31,443,790 35.58 " This shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent. in population through the seventy years from our first, to our last census yet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no one of these seven periods, is either two per cent. below, or two per cent. above, the average; thus showing how inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable, the law of increase, in our case, is. Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results:--- 1870 42,323,341 1910 138,918,526 1880 56,967,216 1920 186,984,335 1890 76,677,872 1930 251,680,914 1900 103,208,415 These figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is, at some point between 1920 and 1930---say about 1925---our territory, at seventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000. And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance, by the folly and evils of disunion, or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us. While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious. The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the country. With these, we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt, without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now, than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men, through the whole period, has been greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus, time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt. This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due; but it shows the great importance of time in this connexion---the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to pay now, when we number but thirty one millions. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war, than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both. As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners; and hence, provision is made in this article for compensating such. The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable, on the one hand, or on the other, in so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress. I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor colonization. And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. It is insisted that their presence would injure, and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor, by being free, than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and, very surely, would not reduce them. Thus, the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably, for a time, would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and, consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market-- -increase the demand for it, and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor, by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and, by precisely so much, you increase the demand for, and wages of, white labor. But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth, and cover the whole land? Are they not already in the land? Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one, in any way, greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now, having more than one free colored person, to seven whites; and this, without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites; and yet, in its frequent petitions to Congress, I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should emancipation south, send the free people north? People, of any color, seldom run, unless there be something to run from. Heretofore colored people, to some extent, have fled north from bondage; and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured; and the freed men, in turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages, till new homes can be found for them, in congenial climes, and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved. And, in any event, cannot the north decide for itself, whether to receive them? Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people northward, because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring? What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites, in the District, is from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here. The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption. Nor will the war, nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration and thereby stay both. And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation, before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both. This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily, and maintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all it would cost, considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war, if we rely solely upon force. It is much---very much---that it would cost no blood at all. The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become such without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and, afterwards, three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave states. Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation, at no very distant day, upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now, and save the Union forever. I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience than I, in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves, in any undue earnestness. I may seem to display. Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here-- -Congress and Executive---can secure its adoption? Will not the good people respond to a united, and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly, or so speedily, assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not "can any of us imagine better?"but "can we all do better?"Object whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs "can we do better?"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall our selves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We---even we here---hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free--- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best, hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just---a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. December 1, 1862.

On the third of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba between the United States War Steamer `San Jacinto' and the French Brig `Jules et Marie,' resulting in serious damage to the latter. The obligation of this government to make amends therefor, could not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault on the part of the `San Jacinto.' With a view to ascertain this, the subject was referred to a Commission of the United States and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of Italy as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived at was, that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the `San Jacinto' seasonably to reverse her engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to the injured party. The United States Consul General at Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the Consul of France on this point, and they have determined that the sum of nine thousand five hundred dollars is an equitable allowance under the circumstances. I recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the `Jules et Marie.'

Brigadier General Benjamin Gratz Brown, editor of the Missouri Democrat who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1863, wrote Lincoln on December 3, 1862, "Hearing incidentally that you have under consideration the subject of ordering an Election for Congress in Arkansas, or such districts as are held by our troops I would . . . call your attention to the fact that on the South west our advance post is and has for some time been at Elkhorn. Genl [James G.] Blunt is some 60 miles from the state lineand intends holding his position. With him are considerable numbers of loyal Arkansas citizens. . . . With an Election ordered we can by legal voting send to Congress a Union administration Emancipation member of Congress. . . . It seems to me that under this state of things, it would be unwise in the government, if it has embarked upon the policy of ordering Elections held in the rebel territories occupied by our armies, to loose this opportunity to secure a support from the state of Arkansas while it can when it can be done legally and without opposition. . . ."(DLC- RTL).</field>

On November 25, 1862, Raymond wrote Lincoln as follows: "I beg permission `just once' to intrude upon your time . . . in order to make a suggestion concerning the best mode of carrying into practical effect the policy of your Proclamation. "1. I think it clear that any attempt to make this war subservient to the sweeping abolition of Slavery, will revolt the Border States, divide the North and West, invigorate and make triumphant the opposition party, and thus defeat itself as well as destroy the Union. "2. I think it equally clear that an effort to use emancipation, within the limitations of law, against rebels as a military weapon purely &amp; exclusively, will be sustained by the whole loyal country, Border States and all. "3. I suggest, then, that the Proclamation to be issued in January, take the form of a MILITARY ORDER,---commanding the Generals of the Army, within every designated state and part of a state in rebellion, to deprive the rebel forces of the aid direct &amp; indirect derived from their slaves, by setting them free and protecting them in their freedom.

      <field name="fulltext">To Henry W. Halleck2 Dec 8th. 1862. Executive Mansion, Washington, Maj Genl. Halleck. Dec 8th. 1862. I find on maps here that Huntsville [Hartsville, Tennessee] is on the North bank of Cumberland river, sixteen miles directly east of Gallatin, and apparently on a turnpike road leading towards East Tennessee generally. What on earth an isolated Brigade was doing there I can not concieve The road is not a line between any two places in our possession. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN. Footnotes 2 Copy, DNA WR RG 108, HQA, Letters Received, L 1243. On December 9, 1862, Halleck directed Rosecrans to "immediately report why an isolated brigade was at Hartsville, and by whose command; and also by whose fault it was surprised and captured."(OR, I, XX, I, 42). Rosecrans replied at 11 P.M. on December 9: "In reply to your telegram, inquiring why the brigade was stationed at Hartsville, I respectfully state that it was necessary to cover the crossing of the Cumberland River against rebel cavalry, who would essay to attack our road and capture our trains. We have, for all our immense line of front communications, picket, and couriers, less than 4,000 cavalry, and the enemy not less than 10,000, who are much relieved by guerrilla scouts, and can concentrate for mischief with almost perfect secrecy and impunity. The subjoined copy of General Thomas' report shows that it was a pretty full brigade, posted strongly, with a cavalry regiment for picket duty on the north side of the river, in a commanding position; that it was strongly supported within 9 miles, and, but for being surprised and making feeble resistance, it would have been succored, and the enemy badly whipped. That outpost was stronger and better supported than our outpost at Rienzi, 7 miles below Corinth, last summer. The difference was in the superiority and number of rebel cavalry: "`Hartsville was garrisoned by the Thirty-ninth Brigade, Twelfth Division (Dumont's), for duty, and was commanded by Col. A.B. Moore, One hundred and fourth Illinois. There was also a regiment of cavalry posted there, the Second Indiana, sent there by your order. The effective force not known. The troops were posted so as to guard the ford and the approaches from the direction of Lebanon, and the cavalry for picket duty and scouting. Col. J.M. Harlan, Second Brigade, First Division, was posted at Castalian Springs. This brigade reports 2,725 men present for duty. Colonel [Abram O.] Miller, commanding the Fortieth Brigade, was also posted at Castalian Springs, sent there to relieve Colonel Harlan. This brigade reports 2,274 men present for duty. The last two brigades were nine miles distant from Hartsville when the attack was made. As soon as cannonading was heard, Colonel Harlan ordered Colonel Miller to march with his command in the direction of Hartsville, and, with a portion of his brigade, followed Colonel Miller, and orders were given to the cavalry from these headquarters to be vigilant and scour the country, so that no enemy could approach without giving timely notice to the garrison. Colonel Harlan, upon being relieved by Colonel [Joseph R.] Scott at Hartsville, informed me that the position was strong and defensible; added to the information received from my officers, led to the belief that the officer in command allowed himself to be surprised, which resulted in the capture of nearly his whole force. The attack was sudden, and so quickly decided that it was impossible for re- enforcements to reach Hartsville in time to take part in the action, and the enemy have been defeated and probably cut off before crossing the river."' (Ibid., p. 43). On February 13, 1863, Halleck recommended that Colonel Absalom B. Moore be dismissed for neglect of duty. Moore was not dismissed, however, but resigned on account of disability, his resignation taking effect on September 9, 1863, (ibid., p. 45, note).

Proceedings suspended." (DLC-RTL). On December 12 he replied at length as follows: "Your telegraphic dispatch of the 10th inst. suspending proceedings in the order made by General Schofield for collecting half a million from Secessionists and southern sympathizers, . . . was duly received, and proceedings immediately suspended. . . . I had supposed and so held, that Gen. Schofield issued the order in his capacity of Brigadier General of Enrolled Missouri Militia, and I only stood ready to support the State in the execution of her affairs. But the Governor and Genl. Schofield send me papers . . . which try to place the United States in the front rank. Before taking that place myself, I had referred the matters to my Commanding General, presenting some legal doubts such as these:--- "1st. The words defining the persons to be assessed . . . are too indefinite. "2d. . . . Is it competent for the United States to make assessments for State purposes, and if we do it for one State, will we not open a wide door. . . . "3d. If there was a military necessity . . . which would justify an assessment, as a military duty, I cannot say it now exists. . . . "4th. If it is a tax, it conflicts with the Constitution of the United States. . . . "5th. It conflicts with the direct tax prescribed by the revenue laws of Congress. . . . "6th. It conflicts with the Confiscation act . . . by taking for State purposes, that which should be confiscated for the United States. "In my judgement, some of these objections are insurmountable. Besides, I consider the sum exorbitant for one County. . . . "To `suspend' is better than to relinquish or annul, as it acts as a restraint on disloyal persons who fear its execution. Let the matter rest till the rebels all come in and swear their fidelity to our cause. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</field>

I further state, that on the 8th. day of November last I received a long telegraphic dispatch from Major General Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota, simply announcing the names of the persons sentenced to be hanged. I immediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all the cases forwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me until two or three days before the present meeting of Congress. Meantime I received, through telegraphic dispatches and otherwise, appeals in behalf of the condemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of opinion as to proper policy in regard to them, and to the Indians generally in that vicinity, none of which, as I understand, falls within the scope of your inquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of records, but before I had sufficient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint letter from one of the Senators and two of the Representatives from Minnesota, which contains some statements of fact not found in the records of the trials, and for which reason I herewith transmit a copy, marked "C."I also, for the same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of St Paul, addressed to me, and forwarded with the letter aforesaid. Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on the one hand, nor with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I caused a careful examination of the records of trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved guilty of violating females. Contrary to my expectations, only two of this class were found. I then directed a further examination, and a classification of all who were proven to have participated in massacres, as distinguished from participation in battles. This class numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female violation. One of the number is strongly recommended by the Commission which tried them, for commutation to ten years' imprisonment.2 I have ordered the other thirty-nine to be executed on Friday, the 19th. instant. The order was dispatched from here on Monday, the 8th. instant, by a messenger to General Sibley; and a copy of which order is herewith transmitted, marked "D." An abstract of the evidence as to the forty is herewith enclosed, marked "E."

Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of Gen. David E. Twiggs, which I now place at the disposal of Congress. They were forwarded to me from New Orleans by Major General Benjamin F. Butler. If they, or any of them, shall be by Congress disposed of in reward or compliment of military service, I think General Butler is entitled to the first consideration. A copy of the General's letter to me, accompanying the swords, is herewith transmitted. ABRAHAM LINCOLN December 12, 1862. Footnotes 3 DS, DNA RG 46, Senate 37A F2; DS, DNA RG 233, House Executive Document No. 11. Butler's letter forwarding the swords---one of which had been presented to the hero of Monterey by Congress, one by the State of Georgia, and one by his native city of Augusta---is printed in House Executive Document No. 11. Upon fleeing from New Orleans, Twiggs presented the swords to Miss Rowena Florence, "but as she had neglected to inform her father of this singular donation, causa fugae, and as the girl's mother caused them to be given to a negro, to be sent back to General Twiggs' house, I ventured to interfere. . . ."Butler suggested that the congressional sword be presented to "some officer as a token of appreciation of loyalty,"that the State of Georgia sword be placed in the library at West Point "as a perpetual memento . . . how worse than useless are all education and military training . . . if heartfelt patriotism and undying fealty to the Constitution and the flag is wanting,"and that the Augusta sword be placed in the Patent Office "as a warning against the folly and uselessness of such an invention as `secession."' A resolution (S. 116) introduced on January 7, 1863, disposing of the swords as Butler had suggested and following Lincoln's recommendation that Butler receive the congressional sword, was pigeonholed. Butler deposited the swords in the Treasury, and after the war they were returned to Twiggs' daughter (Butler's Book, p. 568 note).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Fernando Wood1 December 12, 1862. Executive Mansion, Washington, Hon. Fernando Wood December 12, 1862. My dear Sir Your letter of the 8th. with the accompanying note of same date, was received yesterday. The most important paragraph in the letter, as I consider, is in these words: "On the 25th. November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful, that the Southern States would send representatives to the next congress, provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarranties or terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to." I strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless; nevertheless I thank you for communicating it to me. Understanding the phrase in the paragraph above quoted "the Southern States would send representatives to the next congress"to be substantially the same as that "the people of the Southern States would cease resistance, and would re-inaugerate, submit to, and maintain the national authority, within the limits of such states under the Constitution of the United States,"I say, that in such case, the war would cease on the part of the United States; and that, if within a reasonable time "a full and general amnesty"were necessary to such end, it would not be withheld. I do not think it would be proper now for me to communicate this, formally or informally, to the people of the Southern States. My belief is that they already know it; and when they choose, if ever, they can communicate with me unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military operations to try any experiment of negotiation. I should, nevertheless, receive with great pleasure the exact information you now have, and also such other as you may in any way obtain. Such information1 might be more valuable before the first of January than afterwards. While there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to see in history, it is, perhaps, better for the present, that it's existence should not become public. I therefore have to request that you will regard it as confidential. Your Obt. Servt A. LINCOLN Footnotes 1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. Fernando Wood's letter of December 8, 1862, reads in part as follows: "On the 25th November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful that the southern states would send representatives to the next congress, provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarantees or terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to. Deeming this information of great value . . . I communicated it . . . to . . . George Opdyke . . . whom I knew to hold confidential relations to members of your administration, and proposing through him that if the government would permit the correspondence, under its own inspection I would undertake to procure something definite &amp; positive from persons connected with the so called Confederate authorities. Mr. Opdyke in reply stated that several senators from New England . . . were then in this city . . . to whom he would at once communicate the proposition and advise me of the answer . . . supposing that they would immediately confer with you. . . . "I now learn . . . from Mr. Opdyke this day that he failed to see these Senators. . . . Therefore the object of this letter. "As an humble, but loyal citizen . . . I ask your immediate attention to this subject. . . . I suggest that gentlemen whose former social &amp; political relations with the leaders of the southern revolt may be allowed to hold unofficial correspondence with them on this subject. . . . Your Inaugural address . . . pointed out with prophetic vision. . . . that after a bloody and terrible struggle `the still small voice of reason' would intervene and settle the controversy. . . .

It is to this end that I address you. . . ."(DLC-RTL).
