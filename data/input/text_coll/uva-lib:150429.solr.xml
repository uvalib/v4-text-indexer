Vol. 2. contains chapters on "Visitors," "Slave stories," "Friendly white citizens," "Characters among the freedmen" "Letters from pupils," and "Leftovers", plus Carkin's reflections on her work and the progress of her pupils and the freedmen in general.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;The section on visitors very briefly notes the names of visitors to the school including the Marquis of Lorne, the wife of William Barton Rogers, and General Samuel C. Armstrong who assisted a pupil in attending Hampton Institute.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;The chapter on slave stories contains brief life histories or anecdotes about local freedmen.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;The chapter on friendly white citizens describes cordial relations with tradespeople and lists the few whites who evinced a friendly interest in their work including Professors Minor and McGuffey, Alexander Rives, and bank cashier [Alexander P.?] Abell, and discusses the resignation of Anna Gardner over religious views.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;"Special characters among freedmen" relates stories about "Aunt" Jenny Pickett, Thomas Farrar, Robert Sellers, the Rev. William Gibbons (a former slave of University of Virginia professor Henry Howard), Isabella Gibbons, Jesse Kelly, Margaret Lewis, and the musical Scott family.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;"Letters from pupils" contains letters from Tilly M. Sellers, 1886, who sends news of former pupils and the work at his own school at Boyd's Station, whose library was named for Franklin B. Sanborn who sent books for the school. Letters from Rives Minor, 1910, mentions the success of many former pupils including the Scotts, Benjamin Tonsler, John West, and [?] Inge, and describes teaching in Highland County, Va., in 1879.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;In "Leftovers," Carkin describes predjudice encountered by Isabella Gibbons and herself on a train trip to see Grant's inaugural. She also gives more information about Benjamin Tonsler, the student that Armstrong provided for at Hampton, as well as Robert Scott and Egbert Terry.&lt;/description&gt;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Reminiscences of my Life and Work among the Freedmen of Charlottesville Virginia &gt;From March 1st 1866 to July 1st 1875 Vol. 2. Chapter Fifteenth Visitors During the first and second years of my work in Charlottesville we had occasional visits from a Mr. Frost who was, I think, located at Gordonsville. I have no numbers of the Freedmens Record for 1866, and do not remember what position he held under the Society in Boston, but I think he had some kind of supervision over the schools in that vicinity. I recall that our supplies of books etc came through him. It was only for a short time that he was in any way connected with our schools. Although it was likely we had other visitors that year, I do not now recall their names or the circumstances of their visits, greatly to my present regret. June 7, 1867 We were surprised by a visit from a party of teachers and army officers, who came to call on us and visit the places of interest about Charlottesville. The party consisted of Miss Jane Hosmer, and Miss Harriet Stone, teachers at Gordonsville, Maj. Morse Provost Marshall at Gordonsville, and Maj. Hopkins, and Lieut. Poor located at the same place. Capt. Carpenter Provost Marshall at Madison Court House, accompanied by his wife, and Dr. Nason, whose position I do not now recall. They had hired an omnibus, and invited us to accompany them to Monticello. Just as we were about to start a colored woman — Mrs. Young came to invite us to a supper on her grounds, and when she saw our large party of guests included them in the invitation. One can easily imagine how anxiously Miss Gardner and I had been studying the problem of entertainment for so large and unexpected a company, and this opened a way out, as all agreed to accept the invitation It was a pretty jolly party that drove through the town, forded the river, and climbed the rough sides of Monticello. The trip was a hard one, but all felt well repaid when we reached the summit and looked around us upon what several persons who had travelled extensively, assured us was the most beautiful view they had ever seen. At the house we met a one armed young man whom Miss Gardner and I recognized as one of the pupils in Mr. Williams school. He made himself very helpful in showing us about the place, and we appreciated his courtesy all the more as we had every reason to believe he had been a Confederate soldier, and these officers wearing the uniform of the United States were his one time enemies. But no word or act of his showed that he remembered it Everything we saw was so interesting that we stayed longer than we were aware, and when we arrived at Mrs. Youngs it was already dark, and supper had been kept waiting a long time for us. They had hung Chinese lanterns in the trees to light up the table so that it made a charming picture as we drove up. The table groaned (or rejoiced) under the burden of a profusion of delicacies. Beside ourselves there were perhaps, a score of the most prominent colored people of the town and vicinity. Poor Mrs. Carpenter was ill, and obliged to go into the house and lie down, but everyone else had a good appetite and felt in high spirits, in view of the bountiful collation provided Our visitors spent the evening with us returning to Gordonsville on the midnight train, Miss Hosmer declaring that it had been a day that deserved to be "marked with a white stone." Lieut Poor came again not long after and formed a political organization among the colored people called a "Union League." He was one of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention at Richmond later on. Miss Hosmer and Miss Stone also visited us several times while they taught in Gordonsville. I find in my diaries the following names of persons who visited us, of whom I remember nothing whatever: Mr. Manley, Lieut. Higgs, Dr. Bridges, and Mr. Cole, but I think one of these must have been a young man who came there on some mission to the colored people, but on what mission or by whom sent I remember nothing. He told us some of his exciting experiences in places he had visited, farther south I think. At one time he was attacked by a mob in the house where he was spending the night. He stood at the head of the stairs, and fought them off until they finally gave up and went away. The next day when he appeared on the street, some of the same men who formed part of the mob of the night before, shook hands with him and congratulated him upon his brave and successful defence. In another place he was siezed by a mob and carried to a lonely spot where a rope was formed into a noose and put around his neck preparatory to hanging him, when the sudden appearance of a black man upon the scene diverted the attention of his captors for the moment. Taking advantage of this he slipped the noose over his head and ran for his life. In his course he came upon a stream several feet wide, which he cleared at a bound, and so escaped his pursuers. Mrs. E. D. Cheney with her daughter Margaret and Miss Lucretia Crocker made a tour among the schools in the spring of 1869 and reached Charlottesville on May 22d of that year remaining with us a few days. Mrs. Cheney made us one or two other visits in the time we were there. I think we could not have been in Charlottesville more than two years, when Mrs. Rogers, wife of Prof Wm. B. Rogers came to Charlottesville accompanied by Maj. Copeland, to erect a stone over the grave of Mrs. Rogers brother Maj. Savage who died a prisoner in the hospital at C. and was buried in the University cemetery with about fourteen other Union soldiers who died prisoners here. Prof. Rogers held at one time a position in the University of Va. so this had been Mrs. Rogers home and she knew many of the people here. Miss Abbie Francis, a teacher in one of the Richmond schools, and Miss Lydia B. Chace from Louisa Court House, visited us once in company, and I think Miss Francis had been in Charlottesville once before. She was naturally interested in the school here, as she paid the salary of Paul Lewis, one of the Primary teachers Miss Francis gave her own services in the work. She was a niece of Lydia Maria Child. Feb. 15th 1870. We had a brief call from Gen. Armstrong who had come to Charlottesville to see if he could induce Judge Rives to act as one of the trustees of the Hampton School. I remember Gen. Armstrong as a breezy earnest man wide awake and keenly alive to the importance of educating the Freedmen. I had some correspondence with him later on, in regard to a very bright boy Tonsler who wished to become a teacher among his people, but whose mother was a poor widow, and he, being her oldest son she felt that he would be obliged to give up school to help support the others. I arranged with Gen Armstrong that he should be allowed to work enough to pay all his expenses at the school so finally his mother consented to let him go. He came home in two years fitted to teach, and was employed at once in the Charlottesville schools. Feb. 6th 1871 Miss Holmes came to Charlottesville on my invitation to attend an Exhibition of my school. This was our first meeting. We were surprised one day by a call from from a stranger who introduced herself as Mrs. Vernon. She had come to Charlottesville to open a pay school for colored pupils, but had not been successful, and having used all her money was in destitute circumstances so she came to us for aid and sympathy. She said she had acted as a spy for the United States government at some time during the Civil War, and told how she carried messages in a small silver tube under her tongue, mentioning interviews she had held with President Lincoln and other prominent men. She was a Southern woman and said that her father was a large slaveholder. To tell the truth we had very little confidence in her, or her stories, but as there seemed no reason to doubt her need, we could not refuse her a little aid, and we advised her to open a school for colored children in some place where free schools had not already been established. The desire of the colored people to learn even a little would make them willing to do what they could to support such a school. So taking our advice she left Charlottesville and we heard no more from her. Not very long before the romantic marriage of the Princess Louise of England to the Marquis of Lorne, that gentleman, accompanied by a friend whose card bore the name of Mr. Arthur Strutt, visited our schools. He was then travelling in the United States, and dropped in upon us in passing through Charlottesville. He had time for but two rooms, Miss Gardners the highest and one of the Primary schools, so I did not have the good fortune to meet him personally — only had a passing glimpse of the future son-in-law of Queen Victoria, and sometime Gov. Gen. of Canada to which post he was appointed after his marriage. Mr. Ruffin Ruffner the State Superintendent of schools living in Richmond came to see us once but I have forgotten the circumstances, as well as the date of his visit. Mr. &amp; Mrs. John W. Pratt came from Orange Court House to visit us on some now forgotten date, and Miss Lucy Chase from Gordonsville was present at the dedication of our new school house A sick and destitute Union soldier came to our house late one afternoon and asked for food. According to his story he had tramped a long distance, — from Georgia, I think — and was trying to reach Staunton where he had a brother living. He had a bad cough and was very much emaciated, and looked indeed as if he were not long for this world. He had sold every article of clothing he could spare, and what was left was very shabby. He seemed intelligent and honest, and was diffident about coming up to see us when we sent word for him to do so. We put a good meal on the table for him, and he told, his story while he ate. He thanked us warmly for his food, and started off, but we called him back and gave him a little money to help him on his journey to Staunton which was only thirty miles from Charlottesville. Had it been much farther, I doubt if his strength would have carried him through. On two occasions some of the boys from Mr. Williams school, which I have mentioned in a former chapter as being located only a few rods from our own, came in to visit us. The first call was rather unpremeditated on their part, and happened in this way. About a dozen boys ranging in age from eight or nine to twelve or thirteen years were seen one afternoon looking into our windows, so I sent a boy out to ask them if they would like to come in. They seemed pleased with the invitation, were ushered in at once. I told them to find seats wherever they could in the room and they scattered themselves about among the boys of the school, giggling among themselves at the strangeness of the situation. I took no notice of this but went on with the work as usual. Their visit was a short on — not more than twenty or twenty-five minutes, when they rose to go. Some bowed as they passed through the door, while others pushed through in awkward haste. I asked them to call again, and so ended their first visit. A few evenings later Mr. Williams, their teacher, called saying he had been told of their visit, and came to learn particulars, as he feared that some of the boys might have been rude and unmannerly, but I relieved his apprehensions by assuring him that they had conducted themselves like gentlemen. He seemed gratified to hear so good an account of his pupils, and probably told them what I said, for our school seemed to become suddenly popular with these boys, and not long after a much larger delegation consisting in part of young men well on in their teens, asked permission to visit the school. We gave them a cordial welcome, and when they left they urged us to return the visit. Miss Gardner and I accepted the invitation, and a little later on found an hour we felt we could spare from our school duties and made our call. They did what they could to make our visit a pleasant one, and we were urged to come again, and several times after that when out walking we would meet some of the boys; who would tell us on what days they were to have extra exercises, recitations etc, and want to know if we couldn't manage so as to come. I do not think we ever repeated the visit, although it was well for us and the cause in which we were employed to encourage all friendly advances on the part of the citizens, and it is pleasant now to recall the fact that there was never any friction, so far as we knew between the boys of the two schools, although of different races and in such close proximity. Sometime in the early seventies Mr. Robinson ("Warrington" of the Boston Journal Transcript) visited Charlottesville, and called into the schools unexpectedly early one morning accompanied by Dr. McKee Superintendent of Charlottesville schools. Mr. Southall Editor of the Charlottesville Chronicle, and one other gentleman whose name I have forgotten. It happened at the time they came in I had a class at the blackboard working out problems in cube root — problems similar to this: A room is 17 feet long, 14 feet wide and 8 feet high Required the length of a line reaching from the top of the wall at the right hand corner to the floor at the left hand corner of the room: Some of the visitors were much interested in the process of solving these problems, particularly when the pupils explained the method of extracting the cube root by the use of blocks. "That's pretty smart" said one. "I couldn't couldn't do that." Before they left Mr. Robinson gave the pupils some good advice urging them to make the most of their present opportunities, and appreciate what was being done for them Other visitors of whom I catch a fleeting glimpse in the mirror of my memory were Mr. Chapin, employed by the Freedmens Aid Society — a Mr. Brown colored, of whom I now only recall the one fact that he was a vegetarian, a Quaker named Jones who was interested in placing young colored men and women in positions as teachers in schools in small county places, and a man who called upon us and gave his name as Frederick W. Lincoln. At that time the Hon. Frederick W. Lincoln was Mayor of Boston, and as we knew nothing of His Honor travelling in the south, we concluded that our visitor was an imposter. If it were the real, genuine Mayor, he must have concluded that we were not overwhelmed by the honor of the visit, It now seems a remarkable piece of stupidity on our part that we did not make some effort to ascertain if Mayor Lincoln was visiting in the south at that time. We had become accustomed to keeping our eyes open for imposters that we did not like to be too cordial to strangers who could not show their credentials. Scores of other persons dropped in upon us for an hour or two, of whom I now remember nothing — not ever their names but travellers passing through the town would often call, some from interest in the work, and some merely out of curiosity. They came from all classes, and were of various nationalities. Most of them were cordially welcomed because they showed an intelligent interest in our work, but we occasionally had callers whose object was to boom some matter of their own personal interest, and wanted win favor with us that we might influence the colored people in their behalf. To all such we turned the cold shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Sixteenth Slave Stories etc Living as we did for several years among the Freedmen we heard many stories of their lives while in slavery, some of which were very tragic. After all these years I have only a vague recollection of most of them, but a few are still remembered with tolerable clearness and I will relate some of them. The first I will call the Story of Margaret I never saw her but once. She was a tall, finely formed, handsome woman — I think a quadroon. The most noticeable feature about her was the weary look of sadness in her large brown eyes. My friend who was with me when we had occasion to meet her on a matter of business knew her story which she related, substantially as follows. Margaret was a slave, and unfortunately for her an exceptionally attractive one, and as ignorant of her own status under the laws of Virginia as an infant. When she was but fourteen years old the son of her master overcame her scruples against living with him as his mistress by a pretended marriage — whether it was jumping over a broomstick or some other absurdity I do not know, but she thought she was his wife legally and in all honor. He was kind and loving to her, and she worshipped him with a whole-souled devotion. A few years of happiness, and then came the rumor that he whom she supposed to be her husband was soon to marry a beautiful and wealthy young lady of the vicinity. At first she could not, would not believe it and when at last the truth was forced upon her she went into spasms. But she recovered and finally was able to resume her duties, but the sad, far-away look in her eyes was pitiful to see. Poor Margaret! The Story of Joanna. Joanna was unlike Margaret. She had so little of the negro blood in her veins that no one would have suspected she was not pure white. Her master was a wealthy plantation owner, who had so many slaves that half of them could pass him by unrecognized — a not uncommon circumstance on large plantations, I imagine. As far as I know Joanna was comfortable and happy enough in her life on the plantation. She probably had enough to eat, and was kindly treated according to the code of slavery. But one day she found herself in a new position as regards the life of a slave woman. She had become a mother. She had heretofore felt but little anxiety about herself and her own future, but what about her child? She knew that little children were often sold from their mothers at a tender age. It was not uncommon on her masters plantation. What should she do? How prevent this dreadful possibility? For weeks and months she was haunted by the horrible fear that some day her child would be taken from her until at last her mind was made up to escape from slavery by running away. I do not know how she got away from her masters plantation with her child unsuspected, but she succeeded in reaching the railway station some miles distant without any trouble. There one of the first persons she saw was her master. He did not recognize her as his chattel or even as a colored woman. He saw in her He saw in her only a young lady travelling without an attendant, and encumbered with an infant, so he kindly assisted her upon the train, found her a seat, and performed such other acts of courtesy as his chivalrous nature suggested, then left her undisturbed to pursue her journey North. Whether he ever learned that he had assisted one of his own slaves to escape I do not know. A Chivalrous Slave The following anecdote will serve to show that chivalry, which the southern white man has so long claimed as a trait peculiar to himself, may sometimes be found among the humblest of Gods children. In ante-bellum days there was a law in Charlottesville, as I suppose there was in all large places in the slave states, that any slave found on the street after a certain early hour of the evening, unaccompanied by a white person, should be punished by a certain number of lashes on the bare back — some dozen or fifteen as near as I remember. The streets were patrolled at night by men whose duty it was to sieze any slave who set this rule at defiance by staying beyond the appointed hour. The colored people always spoke of these men as "patrollers." A slave whom I will designate as "Joe" had ventured out one evening accompanied by a female friend, also a slave. They had carelessly stayed beyond the allotted time, and were arrested on their way home by the patrol. The cruel punishment was inevitable, when Joe, with a gallantry not surpassed by any of his white superiors, begged to be allowed to take a double number of lashes and let his companion go free and unharmed, insisting that the fault of their being out beyond the hour was due entirely to his own carelessness. His offer was accepted, and a double punishment was inflicted upon him, which the poor fellow took in a spirit of thankfulness that by so doing his companion was spared the humiliation. The Story of Elizabeth She was a dressmaker — a quiet, hard working woman, with a very small amount of negro blood in her veins, being in fact so nearly white that one would hardly suspect she had any. She sent at different times all of her children to my school — four boys and a girl. The father of these children was a prominent white citizen of the place, and none of the boys showed any trace of color, having fair skins and light, straight hair. The little girl was somewhat darker with a slightly yellow tinge in her complexion. This was all that hinted of her African descent. Elizabeth had inherited a keen sense of delicacy — was modest and retiring, and desired to live a clean, honorable, upright life, but Fate impersonated in Slavery was against her. As a slave she truly "had no rights that a white man was bound to respect" and the chivalry of the southern white man was not often exercised in behalf of the defenceless slave woman. The son of her master began to show his preference for her in a way that alarmed her, and she made every effort to avoid him. Finding this impossible there seemed to her but one alternative — to run away. She managed to escape, but instead of turning North as was the usual custom of fugitive slaves, she went South and established herself as a dressmaker in some village in North Carolina, calling herself a free colored woman. She became acquainted with the son of a free colored man, and a mutual attachment sprang up between them. They soon became engaged and began to make preparations to get married In the meantime Elizabeths master in Virginia advertised his runaway slave, giving a full description of her, and this came to under the notice of the father of the young man she expected to marry. He had all along been suspicious that she was not what she represented herself to be and was now confirmed in his suspicions. So in order to prevent his son from becoming entangled in an affair that might cause him trouble, he immediately sent word to her master that his missing slave was there. So Elizabeth was brought back and sold to Dr. C—. Broken hearted and discouraged she could struggle no longer against such heavy odds, and she yielded — because she must. Dr. C. seemed fond of their children, and was probably as kind to her as their relations permitted. When the war ended, and the Emancipation Proclamation became an established fact, she proved her desire to lead a pure and honest life by taking her children and making a home for them and herself by the work of her hands, although their father would have willingly contributed towards their support, had she consented to continue the old relations She was an anxious mother, and her boys caused her more or less trouble, but she worked early and late to educate them and provide for their comfort. I hope and trust that they proved a comfort to her when she could work no longer. When she told me the story of her life in her quiet, unemotional way I did not grasp the full pathos of it as I have done since. We heard so many such that we became in a sense hardened, but away from the environment of our work they stand out in ones memory as the real tragedies that they were. I can recall bits of the personal history of some others among the Freedmen as interesting as these I have related, but very few of these stories could be made complete, because the interests that have since that period of my life have effaced much I would be glad to remember. Other teachers had similar experiences, and probably some took pains to preserve what they learned in this way for future use. I wish I had done the same.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Seventeenth. Friendly White Citizens No one who has any idea of the feeling that existed between the people of the North and South at the close of the Civil War will be surprised that so very few of the citizens of Charlottesville welcomed us in anything like a friendly manner. There were a few however, who accorded us more or less recognition, and to such I wish to give all due credit. First, there were the trades people of the town. In the late sixties money was very scarce in the community, and our trade was desirable because we always paid in ready cash — so the market etc men, grocers, dry goods merchants etc. with whom we traded, usually gave us a pleasant greeting when we met them on the street. Of course their friendliness of manner was based upon their interest in us as good paying customers — and nothing more. However, we had no reason to complain of that, as our only interest in them depended upon their ability to furnish us with needed supplies A Mr. Munday was teaching a pay school for the colored people when Miss Gardner began work for the Freedmen's Aid Society there. It was for his interest to keep on good terms with us, as in that way he would win favor with those whose patronage he was seeking: but aside from that his wife's sister had married a Union soldier, and in consequence of this connection the whole family were more friendly with people from the North, than perhaps they otherwise would have been. Mr. Clark, the soldier above mentioned was employed as a clerk in a grocery where we did most of our trading and this was an added inducement for the family for the family to be on good terms with us. Professors Miner and McGuffey of the University of Va showed sufficient interest in our work to visit our schools on a few occasions. Judge Alexander Rives, who, I suppose, might be considered the foremost citizen of the place, accepted a position as one of the trustees of the school, but never manifested his interest in it by honoring us with a visit, but he was very polite to Miss Gardner when, one Sunday she attended services in the Episcopal church of which he was a member. When she entered the church, no one came forward to show her to a seat, so she quietly sat down in a pew near the door which was marked "Free." When Judge Rives saw who was seated there, he went back and taking her by the arm conducted her to his own pew and seated her with his family. This was the only mark of attention he ever paid to any of the Northern teachers Mr. Thompson, a printer, and formerly a publisher of a small local paper, called to see us when we had been there about a year I think, bringing Mr. Munday to introduce him. He made two or three others calls while we were there, and confided to us the fact that he was an old friend of Wm. Lloyd Garrison, the noted abolitionist showing us a book presented to him by Garrison with the autograph of the donor on the fly leaf. I doubt if the public generally were taken into his confidence in this matter. Mr. Thompson was one of the delegates sent from Charlottesville to the Constitutional Convention at Richmond in 1868, and his friendliness toward us, and our work had no small influence in winning for him the votes of the colored men. I do not think his friendly recognition of our work there had any selfish motive back of his action, but he was so fortunate as to reap some benefit from it in the course of a very few years. But perhaps the one who showed real interest in us and our work, with no possible axe in the back shed that needed grinding, was Mr. Abell the cashier of the Charlottesville National Bank. He had always shown as friendly an interest in the colored people as the law allowed. He was a very devout man, and had gathered the colored children into a Sunday School for religious instruction. This was in ante-bellum days, and was all he could do under the laws of Virginia. There is every reason to believe that he performed this duty faithfully according to his own religious views. He not only promptly visited our school, showing a keen interest in our work, but he called on us personally in a friendly way. He regretted that he could not induce his wife and daughter to meet us, but they could not overcome the bitterness caused by a great sorrow that had come to them through the war. He said in excuse of their unfriendly attitude. "I had a son who served in the war, and he was young and gentle, and he was killed." Miss Gardner replied to the effect that it was harder for women to overlook a real or fancied wrong than for a man, as they were truer to their principles. When free schools were opened under the new Constitution of Va, Mr. Abell was appointed the first Superintendant. The Society in Boston took immediate steps, to co-operate with the local school board, so we came more or less into business relations with Mr. Abell as the head of the Board. He was rigidly Orthodox in his religious views, but I must do him the justice to say that he never interfered with our ideas of these subjects, until Miss Gardner who was uncompromisingly radical, and very outspoken at all times sincerely believed that she would be acting a lie if she failed to utter her inmost thought, shocked him by openly expressing opinions in regard to matters held sacred in that community which seemed to him not only irreverent but positively blasphemous. And as the larger part of the colored people shared Mr. Abells feelings in this matter, as much as they loved and respected Miss Gardner, she herself felt that the episode had imperilled her usefulness there. The Society accepted her resignation from her position as principal of the school, and transfered her to another post of duty in Elizabeth N.C. It was well known that I held views quite as heretical as those of Miss Gardner, but, although I never concealed them, neither did I think it wise to seek a controversy in such matters as would cause unpleasant feelings, so I remained as Principal in Miss Gardners place, and Miss Holmes was sent to take charge of the next grade. Mr. Abell continued to show a friendly interest in our work as long as we remained there, and as he had nothing to gain by identifying himself with an unpopular cause, we had every reason to feel that he was the best friend we had among the white people of the vicinity A young German, who I think was in charge of the grounds at the University and whose name eludes my memory, made some attempts to appear interested, by bringing us plants and flowers a few times, but these gifts lost something of their value in our estimation when we learned that he was working for the position of Postmaster at the University. He probably thought our influence greater than it really was. I have striven to give credit to every one who gave us a word of encouragement in our work. The list is not a long one. The list is not a long one but it covers about everything that could be construed as a friendly word or act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Eighteenth Special Characters among the Freedmen If any teacher who went from the North at the close of the Civil War to work among the Freedmen expected to find a class of people closely resembling each other in person, manners, character and intellect, she would have been a much surprised woman after a few weeks experience among them. There was one idea common to all in those early days and that was the desire for an education. As this had been denied them by law, they naturally considered it the key to the success of their white superiors. They were shrewd enough to see that the class of whites who lacked an education — the poor whites, as they were called — were not their superiors except as their color gave them greater privileges. But the educated man was a power in the community, and they realized it and thirsted for a little of the knowledge that made so wide a difference between persons of the same race. But aside from the common desire to learn from books, their tastes and characters were as varied as those of any other race, or mixture of races. I have already given a brief description of Mrs. Isabella Gibbons and Paul Lewis in the chapter on "Our Teachers" and it may not be wholly uninteresting to have a few others appear upon the stage for a brief inspection, so I will introduce to you the oldest person we knew among these people Aunt Jenny Pickett How or where she lived I did not know but I fancy she existed upon the meagre alms of the kindly disposed among the people both white and colored. I wish I knew her age for it seemed as if Death must have made many failures in trying to gather her in with his yearly harvests. According to her own story she had attained to an almost fabulous age. She did not know the date of her birth but she claimed that she had long since passed the century mark. She could remember when the country around Charlottesville was a wilderness, and there were many Indians about. Asked if she remembered Thomas Jefferson she replied "O, yes! I 'member old Tom Jefferson. He was at the head of making we all slaves!" How she got the idea that Jefferson was responsible for the fact of slavery I never knew but she always spoke of him irreverently as "Old Tom." There could be but little doubt that she was, as she claimed "morn a hunderd" She paid us occasional visits, knowing that she would not go away empty handed. She usually spent a good part of the day in the kitchen with Margaret when she came — She would sit by the fire and smoke a pipe, nodding in a kind of sleepy stupor. Among the articles sent to Miss Gardner one year for distribution among the very poor, was a bonnet of very ancient date. I judge it might have been in fashion sometime between 1820 and 1830 Miss Gardner gave it to Aunt Jenny who could not have been more pleased with the most modern creation of the milliners art. The next time she came to our place with a handkerchief tied on her head, Margaret asked, "Why Aunt Jenny wheres your new bonnet?" "Why chile dats my gold bunnit." She told us that she had been the mother of twenty children all of whom had been sold away from her years ago. In spite of her years and poverty, she was as happy as a child to think she had lived to be free. I think a year or so later one of her long lost children, or a granchild came from some other part of the south in search of her and took her away to a new home. So she passed out of our lives leaving a unique picture on the pages of our memory. See "Left Overs" page 104 Thomas Farrar, or, as he was usually styled, Tom Farrar, was free born and at the time I knew him I should judge that he was some sixty years old. He was a well digger by trade and very skillful and reliable in this business. The blood of his African ancestors was in an insignificant minority in his system. He was very arbitrary in his own family — exacting the most implicit obedience from every member, being known even to have inflicted corporeal punishment upon his married daughters upon occasions when they had presumed to act in open opposition to his wishes. He never had a doubt that to "spare the rod" meant to "spoil the child." and I am quite sure that if any of his offspring failed to walk in the paths of righteousness, it was not because the rod had been allowed to rust in idleness. He was very religious according to his idea of religion, sure in his own mind that the King James version of the Bible was handed directly down from Heaven neatly bound and printed as it came from the bookstore. To doubt any statement found between the two covers was to his mind the rankest blasphemy, consequently he was very scrupulous as to the letter of the text but somewhat hazy in regard to its spirit. He stood ready to demolish every scientific advance the world had made with thunderbolts in the shape of Scripture quotations Soon after our school had been organized and properly graded, the Society in Boston sent us among other necessary articles for our school work a nice magnetic globe with all the various images of men houses, beasts trees etc to illustrate the power of gravitation and every arrangement for explaining the movements of the earth in its relations to the sun and other celestial bodies Farrar, who believed that the sun travelled around the earth once in twenty four hours (did he not have the evidence of his own eyes to prove it?) was interested when he heard of the new instrument and and came up to see it one Saturday afternoon. I placed an object at a little distance to represent the sun, and put the figures of men, animals, ships etc on the globe in the positions where they would naturally belong, and turned the sphere about, answering his questions and explaining everything to him as clearly as I could for about half an hour. When I had finished he sat and looked at it thoughtfully for a few minutes, and then said. "That is the best explanation I have heard about the earth's movements, but if that is true how could Joshua command the sun to stand still for hours?" This was a poser, for I was wholly unable to explain how Joshua could arrest the motion of the earth, so he went away with his old faith unshaken. In all matters that concerned his religious belief, what he thought he knew he was sure of, so his creed was a very simple one. He believed in God and Tom Farrar, and he was reverent enough to put his belief in God first, which was certainly modest in him Farrar had accumulated quite a little property by hard work and close saving. He told us that his father was a drinking man, and when the craving for liquor was on him, he would take the small earnings of his children to get the means to satisfy his appetite, so Tom made a box for himself in which he kept various articles he called his own. This box was made with a double bottom, one part of which was removable and in the secret compartment thus provided Tom concealed such odd bits of money as he managed to earn without his fathers knowledge. When the old mans drunken fit was on him, he would search through the box and finding no money would throw it out doors, or kick it about in his anger, Tom would let it lie where it was thrown until his fathers condition was again normal, when he would quietly restore it to its former condition. All the time the bits of money accumulated in this queer bank, and when he was grown to man's estate he had quite a little nest egg to help him start in life. He soon acquired enough to purchase himself a comfortable little home and I think when I knew him he had enough to supply the modest needs of himself and his wife in their old age. Notwithstanding his saving, economical ideas he would be very liberal at times. He gave to his church, of course, for that was "treasure laid up in Heaven" and he expected a return in celestial dividends sometime: and he would readily put his hand in his pocket for the needs of the school. Neither was he heedless of the suffering of the very poor. One day he met a friend who told him a pitiful story of the poverty of a poor widow whom they both knew, and how badly he felt in view of her distressing circumstances. "How much do you feel for her?" said Farrar. "I feel about five dollars worth. How much do you feel?" Whether the friend felt bad to the same amount as Farrar, I do not know. I hope he did and that the widow benefitted accordingly. Although Farrars views of life were sometimes sadly distorted, yet he was a shrewd observer of men and things, and something of a philosopher in his way, and it can truly be said of him that he dutifully lived up to the light that had been given him. Robert Sellars was one of the pupils in our school — a bright, good-looking lad in his teens, of an amiable, pleasant disposition, always ready to perform a service for another. He certainly never lacked opportunities of this nature. Was there some necessary duty to be performed about the school building, and the question was asked "Who will do it?" Robert's hand went up first and highest always. I remember one time hearing Miss Gardner say that she was actually afraid she should impose upon him because he was always so ready and willing to do, that it made it easy to ask him. He was the oldest son in a large family of brothers and sisters, and I imagine he found ample opportunity at home to exercise this benevolent faculty of lightening the burdens of others. I do not now recall a single instance when I saw him sulky or out of temper, neither do I remember an instance of any one being out of temper with him. It is not easy to quarrel with one of his disposition. He was sometimes careless, and forgetful of his duties — enough so to severely try ones patience, but only a very surly person could retain his anger, in the face of Roberts penitence for his fault. He was a fairly good scholar although he was not intellectually the equal of his two younger brothers, Tilly and Joseph who were in school at the same time. From the very fact of his amiability he was naturally the object of many good-natured jokes, perpetrated by his friends and schoolmates, all of which he bore with the utmost serenity. There is an old saying, "Beware the wrath of the peaceful man." I have often wondered if Roberts wrath would have been terrible to the extent of the injury that would have been required to rouse it. Sometime in the '70s I found him a position with Dr. Hare of Westboro Mass. where I think he remained for two or more years. Whether he ever returned to his friends in Virginia I do not know. The Rev. William Gibbons was the husband of Mrs. Isabella Gibbons of whom I have given a brief sketch in Chapter 8.th William Gibbons was a man of rare natural abilities. He was born in slavery, his master being Prof. Howard of the University of Virginia. He was a fine looking man, with a rich, sonorous voice and a wonderfully magnetic manner. Armed with such qualities it was easy for him to rouse his hearers to the highest pitch of religious enthusiasm. When I went to Charlottesville in 1866 he was acting as pastor of the 1st colored Baptist church in that place. He was ordained some time during that year, and in 1867 went to Washington, where, a year later he was installed as pastor of the Zion Baptist church in that city. His rare eloquence, exceptional character, and kindly disposition rendered him popular with all classes of people, and when he died after several years of service every tribute of respect was paid to his memory, by the members of his own church, and his old friends in Charlottesville. When I think of what an influence this man exerted in his the narrow sphere in which his destiny had placed him, I try to figure what his power would have been, if Fortune had bestowed upon him the advantages she so lavishes upon many who discredit their opportunities. According to all standards he was an ignorant man. He had picked up such meagre bits of book-learning as he could with his meagre opportunities, but he made the most of what he had gathered in this way, and with this slight aid to his natural abilities he became a power among his people. His manner was that of a cultivated gentleman, courteous and dignified, but never pompous, gentle but never servile. He was a good husband and father, and a kindly neighbor. His preaching while in Charlottesville was of the type in vogue at that time, not only among the negroes, but to a great extent among the white people as well — the vociferous and excitable kind, with its terrible denunciations of sinners (meaning those outside the church fold) its arraignment of all wickedness (such as dancing, card playing and similar evils) its word painting of the joys of heaven, and its vivid description of the torments of hell. I have reason to think however, that after he had lived for a time in Washington his style of address became somewhat modified, for in that city he naturally came in contact with those who, although of the same religious faith were in the habit of presenting its tenets to their congregations in a less lurid manner and Gibbons was quick to learn and could readily adapt himself to what he saw were the real needs of his parish. At first glance it seems unfortunate that so much native talent, should have been wasted in so narrow a field of labor, but but upon reflection we must admit that he was exactly the kind of man needed at that time. He could meet the people of his race understandingly, and upon their own level, and yet they recognized and yet they recognized his superiority to the extent that they were gradually led to a higher level of thought and action by his example It is to be lamented that a larger proportion of those who professed to feel a call to preach the gospel to these people had not done so from motives as conscientious as I sincerely believe impelled William Gibbons in his choice of a profession. In introducing Jesse Kelley I bring upon the stage the most extreme specimen I ever knew, of a type I did not find very common in the part of Virginia where I was located — I mean the Jim Crow type of negro. Jesse was a caricature upon his race; with the blackest and coarsest of skins, the thickest and reddest of lips, the whitest of teeth, and the kinkiest of hair; as mischievous as a monkey, though in a harmless way, and quite as imitative. He kept his schoolmates amused in their play time, with his impersonations. His favorite game was the holding of a mock slave auction, and with his chattel on the block beside him, he would expatiate eloquently upon the sterling qualities of the human article he was selling. Jesse had a sister Betty, also a pupil in our school, who was of the same though a somewhat modified type. A real black full blooded negro was not very common with us there, but surely there could not have been the fraction of a drop of white blood in the veins of these children. I do not remember of having ever seen their parents, but they must have been of pure African blood. Jesse and his sister were not with us after my first year in Charlottesville. I think the family moved to some other place but before they left school Jesse had experienced religion, and given up his game of selling slaves, and all the other "sinful" amusements to which he had been addicted. I never heard what became of the family Margaret Lewis was the wife of one of the teachers in the Primary department of our school — Paul Lewis — and as unlike her husband as it was possible for two persons to be. While he was slow and ponderous, both in intellect and manner, she was quick bright, alert, and humorous. She was a handsome woman, slightly dark for a quadroon, tall, straight and lithe, with good regular features and a pair of clear brown eyes that took note of everything within their range of vision. She was our servant for several years, and was most faithful and devoted to us. She was of great assistance to us in ways outside her domestic duties, on account of her knowledge of the characters and needs of the people with whom we had to deal. Every year there were boxes and barrels of clothing sent to us from the north, for us to distribute among the most needy colored people, and we always took counsel with Margaret who seemed nearly always to know just where any certain article was most needed. We felt we could trust both her judgment and conscience in this matter, for she carefully avoided asking favors for those of her own kin until others had been provided for. I remember the first time she assisted me in this way. Article after article had been looked over, assigned to some one, and marked with the name she had given, until most of the contents of the box had been exhausted, when, picking up a childs garment of very small value, she modestly said, "If there is no one else you want to give this to I would like to have it for my sisters little girl." This was the first intimation we had that there was a needy sister with little children to provide for. Although she and Paul had several children of their own for whom they were struggling to give a fair start in life, Margaret was also helping to bear the burdens of this more needy sister, and never asked favors of us for herself or her own children, although it would have been the most natural thing in the world under the circumstances However, she lost nothing on account of her modest lack of selfseeking Margaret had been trained for a housemaid, and knew very little about cooking so I cooked a good part of my own food with such conveniences as I could arrange for the purpose and one Saturday I managed to fry some doughnuts. Margaret watched the process eagerly and absorbed the idea, for a few days later she proudly brought me a small plate of doughnuts of her own manufacture which were quite a success But perhaps nothing endeared her more to Miss Gardner and myself than the fact that she always had some amusing story or anecdote to relate, which, told in her own inimitable manner never failed to provoke our laughter. She never gave herself up to malicious gossip, but the queer speech, and actions of the many queer people with whom she came in contact furnished her with an inexhaustible supply of material to feed her sense of humor. Her life was far from being an easy one, with her husband, and four or five little children to care for, besides doing a good deal of work for us, but she made light of ordinary troubles, and performed her duties cheerfully in spite of them. Her gift for seeing the comical side of things in general, probably helped her over many rough places. After we left Charlottesville some very tragic circumstances shadowed her life, and I have often wondered if the cheerful spirit that had upborne her through so many minor troubles, was sufficient to carry her serenely through those that must have been so much harder to bear. I hope and trust it proved to be so. She was only one more example of a bright spirit forced to grovel in the mire of unkind circumstance. If living now she must be quite old — more than seventy five, and her children are middle aged men and women. They have had very good educational advantages some of them having been to the Hampton School for a longer or shorter period of time. None of them could compare with her in looks, when they were little children, and I doubt if any of them are as observing and quick witted as she was. I hope they give her good care, and make her declining years comfortable and happy in return for the efforts she made to educate them and give them a fair start in life. See "Left Overs" Page 106 Robert Scott Sr. Robert Scott was free born, and at the time I knew him, was, I should say, some sixty years of age. He was quite light in color — probably a quadroon — with good features, and an intelligent expression. He had a very fair education — picked up I cannot tell how, was well read and could converse ably upon all the important subjects of the day, whether it was the Reconstruction of the Confederate States, the Darwinian theory of the descent of man, or Woman Suffrage He met a congenial spirit in Miss Gardner, being like her, fond of an argument, and they enjoyed many a battle of words together. He was in very comfortable circumstances financially, and his family consisted of three daughters and a son. His wife died some years before we knew him, and his oldest daughter, Mary, a fine looking and intelligent woman, kept house for him. His brother, James, also a widower with one little girl, lived — I think in the house with him. The Scotts were musicians of no mean quality, and they were employed to furnish music for parties by all the most aristocratic families for miles around — sometimes going great distances for this purpose. Being a man of much ability and intelligence, and coming in contact with people of the highest and most cultured families of Virginia as the Rives' the Cochranes, the Miners the Randolphs, the Peytons and others like them, and wise enough not to assume anything beyond what was expected of him, and dignified enough not to be servile in his manner, he won their respect, and they treated him in a very friendly manner, conversing with him more upon terms of equality than was usual on the part of white people with those of the subject race. The brothers, Robert Sr. and James with Robert Jr. very generously gave their services as musicians whenever we had an entertainment for the school. This was great help to us as it was always a popular feature on such occasions and added much to the interest the colored people felt in our attempts to instruct and amuse our pupils and their friends, by giving them a little variation from the regular course of study. Mr. James Scott was more reserved in his manner than his brother — perhaps not as well educated, and much less confident in conversation, but a very pleasant man to meet, and very proud of his little daughter, Lizzie, a flaxen haired blue eyed blond, with no visible trace of negro blood in her veins. The son and daughters of Robert Scott were of about the same complexion as their father — dark eyes, straight or slightly curly dark hair, and skins not darker than those of many Italians. I have remarked that Mr. Scott was circumspect in his manner toward the white citizens of the place, and as I think of it now, his wisdom in this respect governed his conduct toward all both white and colored. I do not remember of ever hearing of his having trouble in his dealings with any one of either race. He was evidently careful to avoid running against the sharp corners of those about him, and as far as I can remember he always presented an amiable surface to all. The popularity of the Scott brothers as musicians was noteworthy enough to receive mention in some volume of local Virginia history which fell into my hands a few years ago, the author devoting considerable space in praise of their musical ability. I am sorry I have forgotten the title of the book, as well as the name of the author. I find it hard to delineate the character of Robert Scott because there seem to be no specially salient points to grasp. It was like a smooth round ball, beneath the surface of which you felt that there were qualities that under certain conditions might made a hump on its surface, but which were so well controlled ordinarily, and the various phases of its force were so subtly shown, that I can only place him upon the stage as an intelligent amiable man and a popular musician, but he was really much more than that and deserves a better biographer. His son, Robert Scott Jr. spent one winter in the service of Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney of Jamaica Plain. He was afterward employed as teacher in the Charlottesville schools, under the local school board, where he did credit to the teaching instruction he had received as a pupil of Miss Anna Gardner. There were many others among the Freedmen, both in, and outside of, our schools whose peculiarities and abilities would make an interesting study, but as I cannot do justice to all in this way, I think the few I have mentioned are quite sufficient to show that there was as much variety of character and ability among these people, as among the more favored race of whites Of course the training they had received under different masters developed or repressed their natural traits but Nature never wholly looses her grasp, and glimpses of the man or woman who might have been developed were often apparent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Nineteenth Letter from Pupils I had frequent letters from my old pupils for several years after closing my work in Charlottesville but they gradually dropped of and finally ceased entirely for a time Then after nine or ten years I received a letter from Tilly Sellers, one of my brightest pupils who was now a teacher asking my assistance in collecting books to form a small library for the use of his school. I applied to several persons who had interested themselves in the Freedmen and succeeded in securing quite a respectable number from one and another. Mr. F. B. Sanborn gave me 20 that were entirely new, and very interesting. I forwarded these to his address, and several letters passed between us during the years '86 and '87 from which I will copy a few extracts which seem to me may be of interest to other persons beside myself. Several of the letters have been lost, but four or five remain from which I will make extracts or copy as a whole. Boyds Va March 1886 My Dear Miss Carkin Arriving in Charlottesville last Friday I found your letter and now acknowledge its receipt with many thanks. Although I date my letters from this place Charlottesville is still my home — Keswick is my express office. Your kindness will be long remembered for we will dedicate it (the Library) the Philena Carkin Library. Many of your old pupils are married and have Charlottesville their home. My sisters husband is in the service of the government at Washington. Robert is at Rices School in Boston: Joseph teaches near me — post office Keswick James Anderson has been Principal of a Staunton Graded School for three years. John Brown has been in the mercantile business at home for seven years and is conducting it with marked success. Henry Cash is a public school teacher He was nominated for clerk of the county court about three years ago, but failed of election because of a split in the party the white portion contending for a white man. A democrat gained the victory Jesse Sammons is also a teacher. He was nominated for the General Assembly of the State in 1880, but the best men (whites) of the party thought the time had not come for such a move in Albemarle then so they saw fit to defeat his election. Dabney Minor is at Oberlin College Ohio, this winter Rives is teaching five miles from town. Harrison Jenkins is in Boston. David is assistant teacher in a Scottsville school, Egbert Terry Principal. David married a Miss Jones. Egbert our Maggie. Willis Coller is proprietor of one of the most flourishing hotels in Denver Colorado. In fact I think I can say truthfully that most of your pupils of the last years of your teaching here have made considerable progress up ward and in the language of the little Southern boy they "are rising" Most of them have homes of their own and are saving money. Here where I am teaching I board with an aunt of Lucy Rogers who owns a hundred acres of land with several good houses upon it. She got 20.00 a month as cook at the Edge Hill school near Charlottesville which enabled her to buy this place She is a widow My father and mother and all at home were much pleased to hear of you, and wish you many happy days. My mother says she will give you much praise for the interest you took in her children, because you made men and women of them. My sister Emma is dead, and also one brother. My little family consists of four children, the older of my two boys is nearly four, named Robert. Hoping you will not tire of hearing this account of the boys and girls of times gone by I am your former pupil T. M. Sellers. Charlottesville July 2d '86 My Dear Miss Carkin Words of mine cannot express the obligations I am under to you for the letter sent me in April. I have been tardy in answering, as I wished I wished to gather some information which I knew would interest you. I feel sure you will do your best in the matter of the books so I will proceed to give you an idea of the changes in Charlottesville and its surroundings In the first place, if you should visit us now you would take a new road at Orange Court House and not come by Gordonsville as of old. The new road is called the Charlottesville and Rapidan R. R. after the river of that name along which it runs in Orange County. Then they have placed a depot just at the junction above your old school house inserted which the front of the building is closed in so now the children use the back part of the yard in going from and coming to the school. Two young pupils disregarded the law requiring them to leave by that route, and were stuck by a passing engine. One was scalped and the other lost his right arm. The father of the latter succeeded in recovering one hundred dollars damages, after three trials, while the other got nothing. Now if a pupil goes that way he is dismissed from the school. It has often occurred to me as a little surprising that you all never had an accident of the kind A look at the "—— McCormick Telescope" on the University Mountain would richly repay you for the time and money spent to go up there. It is truly a wonderful thing. They claim for it a great many merits over all save one some where in Europe. The University and vicinity having undergone many improvements since you left, presents a very grand appearance. The grandest thing of all though is the freedom they accord to the colored people. You will remember that during your stay here we did not dare to go on to the lawn Now we are cordially invited to come into the hall and listen to the orations and I tell you a great many of us avail ourselves of the opportunity The Jefferson Homestead is well cared for now, and the town itself is about half as large again as when you knew it. Now there is quite a town at the old iron bridge, which in time may be styled West Charlottesville The factory has been the means of building up that place. Nancy Randolph lives here now, but her brother Francisco has been dead about ten years. Robert Scott teaches in Miss Gardners old room. Rinaldo is still here, and recently bought a part of the tailor Brockmans property opposite Thomas Farrars. Nannie was married on the 21st inst to William Jackson. They are now in the North spending their honey moon. Our paper mentions the affair as very grand. Frank and Eustace Scott are in the navy, so is William Scotts son Thomas. Willie is here. The Buchanan boys are in Washington and Burrill Gaines is brakeman on the road between this place Staunton and Richmond. George Howard now leads an Episcopal following in Lexington Va. He married Wm Jackson and Nannie Scott in the Delevan church. I shook his hand the next day, and told him you asked after him, and he thanks you very much, and says he is trying to make his mark in the world Now, Miss Carkin the saddest of all I have to tell is the death of the Rev. William Gibbons. He died suddenly at Washington last Monday morning, and was brought here and buried today. The funeral services were held in the Delavan church and were quite affecting when the pastor mentioned the two girls in Australia (Bella &amp; Georgia) I do not think there was a dry eye in the room. Just think — their father taken away so suddenly and they so far away! Well, I must not worry you any longer, so thanking you for your trouble for me thus far, and hoping for your success I am very truly yours Tilly M Sellers My family send kind remembrances. Charlottesville Aug 9 — 1886 Dear Miss Carkin I am unable to find words to express my gratitude for the letters you are so kind as to write to me. Please to accept my thanks for your interest in my school. I will endeavor to give you a description of it. We are situated about 10 miles east of Charlottesville, on the old "Richmond Turnpike," and have a neat house. The ground (one acre) was furnished by the patrons, and the School Board put up the house for us, after we had got half the lumber and paid for hauling all the materials used. We got the lumber by each patron giving so many pine trees on the stump, and so determined were they all to have the house that a number of the larger boys would go into the woods, and fell and cut up a tree preparatory to sending it to the saw mill. Our white friends aided us by lending teams etc. We have some advanced pupils. I had one boy who completed Venables Practical Arithmetic, and Harveys higher Grammar. M— State History and other branches. At the examination for teachers positions last year I persuaded him to try, and he succeeded in getting the 2d grade which they say is a creditable thing for a country school. His father promises to send him to the Petersburg Normal College the coming season if he can spare the money. I am urging him to do so if he has to sacrifice some of his stock for the purpose. I have also another class of three boys to complete the "Practical" next year. We have about thirty five scholars each winter, and our school year is seven months. The School Board will not do much for country schools unless they show a good deal of interest by helping to get what they want. We needed maps for the school. The Board agreed to pay two thirds of the price if we would give the other third and pay the express on them. I called a meeting of the patrons and the money was raised and the maps secured. After getting so much, I thought a Library in the room would set if off, and be more beneficial than anything we have so far, hence my reason for trying to interest you, and I thank you again for what you have done. I want you to know, too, that I have not been idle since I asked you to help me, but have been begging here also, and have secured a few books with the promise of more by the time we commence again. The patrons of the school own their homes ranging from five to one hundred and fifty acres of land. Some of them are very thrifty Very Truly Yours Tilly M. Sellers. Boyds Va. Feb. 18 — 1887 Dear Miss Carkin I am afraid you are being annoyed by our constant expression of thanks for what you have done for us. I assure you it is no small thing, and we appreciate it very highly. Since your wishes must be respected the pupils have decided to call it the "F. B. Sanborn Library" though they wished very much to call it by your name. Now I wish to ask your perusal of the accompanying little letter, written, without my knowledge by our little secretary who is only ten years this coming June. Her father is a prosperous blacksmith and is, apparantly one of the latest importations from Africa he is so very black and ignorant. This child was in her "letters" as they say less than four years ago (our school year consists of seven months) and now reads in the 5th Reader. I send you the childs letter because it seems to be the outpouring of of the heart. Hoping you will kindly think of us and with kind wishes for your happiness from many here. T. M. Sellers The pupils letter follows Jan 27 — 1887 My Dear Miss I will spend this pleasant afternoon in writing to one I have never seen but I have often heard my teacher speak of you and read letters from you to us, and talk of you as being his teacher. We are strangers but that matters but a little. I can write to you with just as much love as to any of my friends. We received your box and all were very proud of it indeed, and all my schoolmates thank you and your friends for your kindness. They are such nice books and make such a respectable little Library — just what we had talked about a long while and O, if you could just see if now it looks so beautiful! You said you didn't care to have it named after you, but we had no other name that we thought would suit so nicely as yours, and the scholars all seem to love that so well that we were compelled to name it the P. Carkin Free Library Jennie A. Brockman This series of letters were written from eleven to twelve years after I left Charlottesville After the close of the correspondence between Mr. Sellers and myself in regard to the Free Library at Boyds Station, I heard nothing further relating to my old pupils in Ch'ville until the present year 1910 being thirty four and a half years since I left Virginia Another old pupil Rives Minor sought me out through the mail, and I will copy extracts from some of his letters which have interested me very much. Charlottesville Va. Jan. 3/10 Miss Carkin My Dear Friend and Teacher. It is a long, long time since you were here, and I've been thinking for several years of writing to see if you were still numbered with the living, but have kept putting it off from time to time until I've made it very late, but I hope not too late. I have taught in the public schools thirty three years and retired this session, and am now farming. I own a farm of 80 acres, two horses, a colt, four cows, two calves and we raise hogs every year. I succeeded (they say) very well as a teacher and am doing very well as a farmer. I have been twice married — first in 1891 and second in 1902. By my first marriage two girls, by the second three girls and a boy — the baby, by name Frederick Douglass. I am sure you have all along heard very bad reports of the colored people. True they have not always done as well as they might have done any more the the white people, but many of the stories are without foundation and others much exaggerated, and highly colored. I hope this letter will find you well and that you will let me hear from you. I shall be glad to give a full account of myself, and of the immediate community. I know you would be greatly surprised to see what wonderful progress the colored people have made along all lines. You would find it much pleasanter, as there is more civilization, and so many pleasant homes among your pupils, that you might visit. Trusting that this may find you well, with bright prospects for the New Year I am your scholar. Rives C. Minor P.S. My mother died in 1880, my father in 1893 and many others have passed away since you left among them Mr. Scott whom you probably remember. Charlottesville Va Jan. 31/10 My Dear Miss Carkin Your letter of the 10th inst was duly received. It found us well, and indeed, more than glad to hear from you. I am sorry to know that your sight has gotten so poor, but my prayer is that it may not grow much worse for years to come. I was glad and thankful to receive the picture of the "Minute Man" I remember so distinctly about your telling, and trying to have us understand about them years ago. And not only that, but you told and read to us so much that I recall and which has since become real to me, that I have often wished that I could see you, and make some apology for my ignorance and ingratitude, for then it was meaningless to me, and as with me, so I presume it was to a greater or less extent with the others. But much of the ignorance, inexperience and darkness that met you here, have disappeared, and it is beginning to look like a real dispensation of freedom in which every one has some sort of a chance in the race of life. I taught, with the exception of the first three sessions, in my own county (Albemarle) near my home — the first two in Harrisonburg Va. the third in Bath Co. Va. My parents owned nothing and I was early called upon to get some sort of a home for them, so I had to go to work in real earnest about the time you left. By perseverance and the most rigid practice of economy I succeeded My mother lived in her new home just five years and my father eighteen. Now I guess you don't remember my brother Dabney, for he was one of the younger pupils. He was about 10 years of age and stammered a little. Well he has been going to school the greater part of the time since you left, and has not got through yet. He graduated from the Richmond Va Institute and from a theological seminary in Michigan, and became a B. A. from Oberlin college, Ohio in 1897 and lacks four months of finishing a four years course in medicine in the medical college in Indianapolis Ind. His eyes failed him and he is now preaching in Cincinnati Ohio. As for myself I have been a great slave to public school, Sunday school, church and farm. My farming has been done largely in the night. I attended the Storer college West Va. two sessions after I began to teach. My sessions were only five months. I entered school 1st March and remained until August. I left lacking two years of finishing the Academic course. I attended the schools held for the benefit of teachers in the different in different parts of the state 15 summers. The last three summers I was an instructor. There are but few of our people who do not own their homes. There are farms er all around me, ranging in size from half an acre, to one hundred and fifteen acres. Most of them are doing well. My first wife was from Culpepper Co where I spent several summers in teaching school. Her name was Mary Green. The second — Elizabeth Curry was born and reared near Monticello the home of Jefferson, My oldest daughter Mabel will be 17 in March. Frederick Douglass is 14 months old. Now I must tell you something of the town people. Benjamin Tonsler had been Principal of the town school ever since you left The building is a large brick structure of eight rooms, and with all female assistants. Robert Scott used to assist him but he died about 20 years ago. The school is doing well, and a class graduates about every year. The colored people have five churches in town, and some of them are very fine. Mrs. Gibbons who taught in the lower schools has been dead several years. Mr Lewis also died about 8 years ago. Mrs Lewis is living but most of her children are dead. Mrs. Gibbons son, John West, who came to school when you were here has been a barber since before you left. His owner gave him several thousand dollars to start with and now he is said to be worth a hundred thousand dollars in real estate. Mr. Ferguson owns a nice residence on Main St. The old Farrars are all dead. Some of the the younger ones are here and have nice homes. The Rickmonds all went to Pittsburg many years ago and never returned. The Taylors are here and doing very well. The Buchanans went to Philadelphia. The Buckners are here. One of them owns and conducts a large grocery store near the University. Mr. Inge, Mr. Fergusons son-in-law owns and conducts a large and well kept store on Main St. and there are countless smaller concerns run run by the people who owned nothing when you were here. Now a word about the scholars you knew best. David Smith died about 7 or 8 years ago very poor. William Jackson taught 10 or 12 years and then lost his sight entirely. He is totally blind. Jesse Sammons taught about 20 years and died of a fever. Henry Cash went west and never returned Egbert Terry married Maggie Halestork and they live in Ch-ville. Maggie is one of Mr. Tonslers assistants. Two of Mr. Fergusons daughters and one of John Wests daughters also assist. Now a word about professionals. One of John Wests sons, and one of Fergusons are medical men, and doing very well. Lawyers have failed to succeed here so not one in town. Jesse Sammons married Lula Gibbons who used to attend your school. She was left with four children — two 2 boys and two girls. She is doing very well. The oldest boy is nearly 20 years old so with farming and dressmaking she is doing nicely. She is my neighbor. I shall have a group picture of my family taken to send you as soon as the weather gets so we can all get into town. I regret that I can't do more for you than to thank you for teaching us our first lessons. I am sure you were not aware when kindling the little flame of education here among us that you were doing a work that was to be so far reaching. I told you I would give a full account of myself, but that would fill many pages, and I'll only say but little now about my experience. I acquired a knowledge of music, and can sing and play very well. My older girls, Mabel and Irene can also play very nicely, and in town you would be well entertained at any of the churches by the singing Now I've written a long letter for you to read and hope it will not be too much for your eyes Your Friend and once Pupil Rives C. Minor. I will copy some extracts from a third letter I received from Mr. Minor dated May 3 — 1910 After answering various questions I had asked he continued as follows. "The old building where you taught has long since been torn away and all that part of the town is laid out in streets and thickly settled It would be hard for you to tell where the old school house stood. The new school house is farther down, near the Court House. If you remember where the gas house was, it is on the same street. x x x I should be glad if you could see this place again and witness the strides the colored people have made from barbarism to civilization. I did not think to tell you in my last, that they own and publish one newspaper in Charlottesville x x x I will tell you my age as well as I can. I call myself 54. The farm house where I was born was burned in May 1865, and with it all the records. My mother, a short time before her death, took me with her to the old place to get our ages, and what they gave us was all guess work. I was born in January 1855 or 1856 Mother knew it was three weeks after Christmas. That was all she knew about it. I am still vigorous and can do more work at almost anything than the average man." After telling of the sickness and death of his first wife, he continued by saying that he was left with all the household cares, two babies to look after, the farm to attend to, and a school of 70 or 80 children to teach. He managed by hiring one and another to take care of the children until he made a second marriage six years later, after which, he adds, "It was better for me and the children. Extracts from a letter dated June 14 1910 I had sent Mr. Minor some pamphlets of the Humane Society and asked him if there was anything of the kind yet in Charlottesville. To which he replied as follows. "No, they have nothing like a humane society any where in Virginia that I ever heard of certainly not in Charlottesville or in Albemarle County I hope to see a "Red Acre Farm" here in our state some day. At present worn out horses as well as worn out men fare tolerably rough. There is nothing like a "Rescue League" These things have not been thought of yet x x x x I will give you an account of a trip I took to Highland Co. Va. in 1879 to teach school. It is a hundred miles from Ch-ville to Highland Co. No railroad sixty miles of the hundred. I walked (wading the rivers and creeks) the entire distance. It was snowing about all the way. I went very near the sources of the Potomac and James rivers which geographers say are so near each other that a rider may hold the reins and drink from one spring while his horse drinks from the other, but I did not think of that at the time. I arranged my school business, taught five months and walked all but 40 miles back home. I began my school Feb. 15th and closed about the last of June. I waded rivers and creeks about 15 days in February of that year and was not made sick by it x x x It may interest you to know what it was worth to me. I got 20 dollars a month. x x All schools near home in the country were closed that year is why I had to go from home. They generally paid 25 or 30 dollars in the different districts in our county x x x Your friend and old pupil Rives C. Minor. Extract from letter dated March 4 1911 Dear Miss Carkin Your last letter of Sept 16th was duly received. We were glad to hear from you and to learn of the many helpful Societies among you. I thank you very much for the "horses prayer." Some horses do need to say it daily, but I am thankful to say mine have not said it this winter though the winter has been long and severe, interspersed with a day or two of mild weather now and then. x x x x I am quite busy preparing for my crops, and at present the prospects before me are quite bright. I have a great deal more work than I can do but and cannot afford to hire help but am doing very well alone, and when school closes in April Mabel and Irene will help me a little. (I had sent him an article I cut from a paper called "The Horses Prayer" which is what he refers to in his letter. The Mabel and Irene whom he mentions are his two oldest daughters)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boyds Va March 1886 My Dear Miss Carkin Arriving in Charlottesville last Friday I found your letter and now acknowledge its receipt with many thanks. Although I date my letters from this place Charlottesville is still my home — Keswick is my express office. Your kindness will be long remembered for we will dedicate it (the Library) the Philena Carkin Library. Many of your old pupils are married and have Charlottesville their home. My sisters husband is in the service of the government at Washington. Robert is at Rices School in Boston: Joseph teaches near me — post office Keswick James Anderson has been Principal of a Staunton Graded School for three years. John Brown has been in the mercantile business at home for seven years and is conducting it with marked success. Henry Cash is a public school teacher He was nominated for clerk of the county court about three years ago, but failed of election because of a split in the party the white portion contending for a white man. A democrat gained the victory Jesse Sammons is also a teacher. He was nominated for the General Assembly of the State in 1880, but the best men (whites) of the party thought the time had not come for such a move in Albemarle then so they saw fit to defeat his election. Dabney Minor is at Oberlin College Ohio, this winter Rives is teaching five miles from town. Harrison Jenkins is in Boston. David is assistant teacher in a Scottsville school, Egbert Terry Principal. David married a Miss Jones. Egbert our Maggie. Willis Coller is proprietor of one of the most flourishing hotels in Denver Colorado. In fact I think I can say truthfully that most of your pupils of the last years of your teaching here have made considerable progress up ward and in the language of the little Southern boy they "are rising" Most of them have homes of their own and are saving money. Here where I am teaching I board with an aunt of Lucy Rogers who owns a hundred acres of land with several good houses upon it. She got 20.00 a month as cook at the Edge Hill school near Charlottesville which enabled her to buy this place She is a widow My father and mother and all at home were much pleased to hear of you, and wish you many happy days. My mother says she will give you much praise for the interest you took in her children, because you made men and women of them. My sister Emma is dead, and also one brother. My little family consists of four children, the older of my two boys is nearly four, named Robert. Hoping you will not tire of hearing this account of the boys and girls of times gone by I am your former pupil T. M. Sellers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville July 2d '86 My Dear Miss Carkin Words of mine cannot express the obligations I am under to you for the letter sent me in April. I have been tardy in answering, as I wished I wished to gather some information which I knew would interest you. I feel sure you will do your best in the matter of the books so I will proceed to give you an idea of the changes in Charlottesville and its surroundings In the first place, if you should visit us now you would take a new road at Orange Court House and not come by Gordonsville as of old. The new road is called the Charlottesville and Rapidan R. R. after the river of that name along which it runs in Orange County. Then they have placed a depot just at the junction above your old school house inserted which the front of the building is closed in so now the children use the back part of the yard in going from and coming to the school. Two young pupils disregarded the law requiring them to leave by that route, and were stuck by a passing engine. One was scalped and the other lost his right arm. The father of the latter succeeded in recovering one hundred dollars damages, after three trials, while the other got nothing. Now if a pupil goes that way he is dismissed from the school. It has often occurred to me as a little surprising that you all never had an accident of the kind A look at the "—— McCormick Telescope" on the University Mountain would richly repay you for the time and money spent to go up there. It is truly a wonderful thing. They claim for it a great many merits over all save one some where in Europe. The University and vicinity having undergone many improvements since you left, presents a very grand appearance. The grandest thing of all though is the freedom they accord to the colored people. You will remember that during your stay here we did not dare to go on to the lawn Now we are cordially invited to come into the hall and listen to the orations and I tell you a great many of us avail ourselves of the opportunity The Jefferson Homestead is well cared for now, and the town itself is about half as large again as when you knew it. Now there is quite a town at the old iron bridge, which in time may be styled West Charlottesville The factory has been the means of building up that place. Nancy Randolph lives here now, but her brother Francisco has been dead about ten years. Robert Scott teaches in Miss Gardners old room. Rinaldo is still here, and recently bought a part of the tailor Brockmans property opposite Thomas Farrars. Nannie was married on the 21st inst to William Jackson. They are now in the North spending their honey moon. Our paper mentions the affair as very grand. Frank and Eustace Scott are in the navy, so is William Scotts son Thomas. Willie is here. The Buchanan boys are in Washington and Burrill Gaines is brakeman on the road between this place Staunton and Richmond. George Howard now leads an Episcopal following in Lexington Va. He married Wm Jackson and Nannie Scott in the Delevan church. I shook his hand the next day, and told him you asked after him, and he thanks you very much, and says he is trying to make his mark in the world Now, Miss Carkin the saddest of all I have to tell is the death of the Rev. William Gibbons. He died suddenly at Washington last Monday morning, and was brought here and buried today. The funeral services were held in the Delavan church and were quite affecting when the pastor mentioned the two girls in Australia (Bella &amp; Georgia) I do not think there was a dry eye in the room. Just think — their father taken away so suddenly and they so far away! Well, I must not worry you any longer, so thanking you for your trouble for me thus far, and hoping for your success I am very truly yours Tilly M Sellers My family send kind remembrances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville Aug 9 — 1886 Dear Miss Carkin I am unable to find words to express my gratitude for the letters you are so kind as to write to me. Please to accept my thanks for your interest in my school. I will endeavor to give you a description of it. We are situated about 10 miles east of Charlottesville, on the old "Richmond Turnpike," and have a neat house. The ground (one acre) was furnished by the patrons, and the School Board put up the house for us, after we had got half the lumber and paid for hauling all the materials used. We got the lumber by each patron giving so many pine trees on the stump, and so determined were they all to have the house that a number of the larger boys would go into the woods, and fell and cut up a tree preparatory to sending it to the saw mill. Our white friends aided us by lending teams etc. We have some advanced pupils. I had one boy who completed Venables Practical Arithmetic, and Harveys higher Grammar. M— State History and other branches. At the examination for teachers positions last year I persuaded him to try, and he succeeded in getting the 2d grade which they say is a creditable thing for a country school. His father promises to send him to the Petersburg Normal College the coming season if he can spare the money. I am urging him to do so if he has to sacrifice some of his stock for the purpose. I have also another class of three boys to complete the "Practical" next year. We have about thirty five scholars each winter, and our school year is seven months. The School Board will not do much for country schools unless they show a good deal of interest by helping to get what they want. We needed maps for the school. The Board agreed to pay two thirds of the price if we would give the other third and pay the express on them. I called a meeting of the patrons and the money was raised and the maps secured. After getting so much, I thought a Library in the room would set if off, and be more beneficial than anything we have so far, hence my reason for trying to interest you, and I thank you again for what you have done. I want you to know, too, that I have not been idle since I asked you to help me, but have been begging here also, and have secured a few books with the promise of more by the time we commence again. The patrons of the school own their homes ranging from five to one hundred and fifty acres of land. Some of them are very thrifty Very Truly Yours Tilly M. Sellers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boyds Va. Feb. 18 — 1887 Dear Miss Carkin I am afraid you are being annoyed by our constant expression of thanks for what you have done for us. I assure you it is no small thing, and we appreciate it very highly. Since your wishes must be respected the pupils have decided to call it the "F. B. Sanborn Library" though they wished very much to call it by your name. Now I wish to ask your perusal of the accompanying little letter, written, without my knowledge by our little secretary who is only ten years this coming June. Her father is a prosperous blacksmith and is, apparantly one of the latest importations from Africa he is so very black and ignorant. This child was in her "letters" as they say less than four years ago (our school year consists of seven months) and now reads in the 5th Reader. I send you the childs letter because it seems to be the outpouring of of the heart. Hoping you will kindly think of us and with kind wishes for your happiness from many here. T. M. Sellers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jan 27 — 1887 My Dear Miss I will spend this pleasant afternoon in writing to one I have never seen but I have often heard my teacher speak of you and read letters from you to us, and talk of you as being his teacher.

It is a hundred miles from Ch-ville to Highland Co. No railroad sixty miles of the hundred. I walked (wading the rivers and creeks) the entire distance. It was snowing about all the way. I went very near the sources of the Potomac and James rivers which geographers say are so near each other that a rider may hold the reins and drink from one spring while his horse drinks from the other, but I did not think of that at the time. I arranged my school business, taught five months and walked all but 40 miles back home. I began my school Feb. 15th and closed about the last of June. I waded rivers and creeks about 15 days in February of that year and was not made sick by it x x x It may interest you to know what it was worth to me. I got 20 dollars a month. x x All schools near home in the country were closed that year is why I had to go from home. They generally paid 25 or 30 dollars in the different districts in our county x x x Your friend and old pupil Rives C. Minor.</field>

We were glad to hear from you and to learn of the many helpful Societies among you. I thank you very much for the "horses prayer." Some horses do need to say it daily, but I am thankful to say mine have not said it this winter though the winter has been long and severe, interspersed with a day or two of mild weather now and then. x x x x I am quite busy preparing for my crops, and at present the prospects before me are quite bright. I have a great deal more work than I can do but and cannot afford to hire help but am doing very well alone, and when school closes in April Mabel and Irene will help me a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ChapterLeft Overs. See Chap 12 The incident I am about to relate should have appeared in Chap 12th and formed a part of the story of my trip to Washington to witness the inauguration of President Grant. As stated in that chapter, I was accompanied by Mrs. Isabella Gibbons one of the teachers in the Primary department of our school. I had told her in advance that she was to go in the ladies car with me, instead of the smoking car, where the rules of the road required all colored people to travel in spite of the fact that they were called upon to pay first class fare, and also that this rule was in direct violation of the Civil Rights Bill — or rather of the 15th Amendment — the above Bill had not then been passed. In one or two instances previous to the trip of which I write, colored persons had been awarded quite large sums as damages against railroad companies on account of being ejected from the cars to which their tickets entitled them. The tracks of the Orange &amp; Alexandria R. R. upon which we would travel to Washington, formed a junction near our school with the Virginia Central. At this place the O &amp; A trains always made a short stop to change the switch, and from this point the O. &amp; A. ran on the V. C. track to Gordonsville where their lines again diverged We frequently took advantage of this arrangement by boarding our trains at the switch and did so that day Mrs. Gibbons was about to follow me into the ladies car when the conductor seeing her called to her to go back to the next car, and she, fearing they would start the train and leave her behind did as directed. When I saw what had happened I immediately sought her out in the negro, otherwise the smoking car where I sat down beside her until the conductor came for our tickets. I asked him if she could go into the ladies car with me "Is she your servant?" said he. "No, she is a friend with whom I am travelling." "I will see about it" was the answer. "We shall put on another car a little farther on." Of course I knew that this pretense that the ladies car was full was all a subterfuge, as I had just come from there and there were plenty of vacant seats. As I was getting interested in a new experience I made no further appeal, but every time he came to tear off a coupon from our tickets I gave him a look which meant "I understand you sir." and he would look conscious and hurry by as quickly as possible. So I had the experience of riding in a second class smoking car on a first class ticket to Washington just to uphold a principle, but I told Mrs. Gibbons it must not happen on our return. The bridge across the Potomac was undergoing repairs when we started for home some days later so we had to cross the river in a steamboat and take our train at Alexandria. As Mrs. Gibbons followed me into the ladies car a brakeman stopped her and ordered her back into the next car. I turned to him and said, "She goes with me sir." "O, is she — is she your — " "She goes with me." He stepped back, and as she came in she heard him say. "There, that colored woman had gone in!" The other brakeman replied. "O well the captain will make it all right." (They often called the conductor — captain) I put Mrs. G. into the seat next to the window, and told her not to move if they told her to leave the car. — that they could not get her out without they moved me first, and I knew they would not attempt that, — and that if they were rash enough to do so we could bring suit against the company that might cost them several thousand dollars. So she sat there nervous and trembling when the conductor came. I had both tickets and looked him straight in the face as I handed them to him. He simply said "For you and her?" I said "Yes." and he tore a coupon from each and passed on. When we were about half way on our journey Mrs. Gibbons laughingly remarked, "I am afraid I don't get $15 000 out of this trip." And thus she had the experience of a ride from Alexandria to Washington Charlottesville first class car to balance my experience in the smoking car because I was determined to uphold a principle. Left Overs See Aunt Jenny Pickett Chap 18 Aunt Jenny, in spite of her years and poverty was as happy in her freedom as if she had been young and capable of earning her living. To test her some one said to her one day when she was glorying in the thought that she was not longer a chattel. "Now Aunt Jenny, as you are so old and without means to live upon, would it not have been better for you if you could have remained a slave, and had a good master or mistress to take care of you"? Aunt Jennys eyes blazed as she replied "I'se glad to be free if only for tonight!" See Chap 8th Our Teachers There were three other teachers employed in our school before I gave up the work there, viz. Robert Scott Jr. Egbert Terry, and Benjamin Tonsler. As they were not working under the auspices of the Society in Boston I omitted to mention them in the Chapter on "Our Teachers," but feel that they should receive recognition as having taken up the work under the local School Board while it was co-operating with the Freedmens Aid Society. Robert Scott was a pupil of Miss Gardners as also was Egbert Terry until she resigned when the latter came under my instruction for a time, and both were soon given places in the towns schools. As well as I can now recall they did very satisfactory work and Terry is still teaching near Charlottesville. Robert Scott died many years ago. Benjamin Tonsler was in my class for about two years, I think, possibly more, when, finding him a particularly bright and promising boy, I appealed to Gen. Armstrong in his behalf, and succeeded in getting him into a position in the Hampton School where he could earn all the expenses of board tuition etc. while he remained there. He graduated at the end of two years, and upon his return to Charlottesville was immediately given a school by the local Board. He was very successful, and at last accounts, was Principal of the colored schools in that city. Margaret Lewis. Chapter 18th In a recent letter from Rives Minor I have learned that Margaret Lewis is now alone in the world, her husband Paul Lewis and all her children having passed away. Paul had become the owner of a home before I left Charlottesville, but I doubt if he had much other property so I fear her last years are to be not only lonely, but years of poverty as well She truly deserved better of Fate. I have mentioned in some of the previous chapters that Miss Gardner and I stopped in Washington at the Hotel corner 8th st and Pennsylvania Ave on two occasions I think. This hotel was conducted by Mr. Joy, a native of Massachusetts if I have been correctly informed. Upon learning that we were teachers in schools for the freedmen Mr. J. exerted himself to make our stay in his house as pleasant as possible, and in the afternoon of our first day there he sent a servant up to our room asking us to come down to the parlor as he wished to introduce us to a gentleman from Virginia "Is he a rebel?" asked Miss Gardner. "I don't want to meet any rebels." "N-n-n-no." stammered the colored man. "There are no r-r-r-rebels in this house, nor no J-J-J-Johnson men either." The following incident occurred on our visit to Libbey Prison as related in Chap. 12th While being shown over the prison by the officer in charge, we saw several soldiers who were under guard for some offence or breach of discipline. Some of these had a heavy iron ball attached to their ancles by a stout chain a few feet in length, so when they moved about they were obliged to lift the ball and carry it in the hand. Miss Gardner asked the officer what they had done to deserve such a punishment. He told her they had attempted to desert. "And they must be punished like this just because they wanted to be free?" said she in horrified tones. "Why Madam" was the reply. "I think desertion is the greatest crime a soldier can commit!" These were the different points of view of a Quaker woman and a military man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Forty Years later After my nine and half years experience among the Freedmen of Virginia — an experience wholly different from that of persons who spend a few weeks or months in some part of the south for the benefit of their health or to take advantage of a milder climate than that of New England — an experience in which we learned to know the colored people as they really were; their abilities and their good qualities as well as their bad ones: and added to that what I have learned through letters from old pupils, and through articles in papers and magazines — after all this what is my opinion of them as a race? What would have been their progress after being freed had they been left wholly to their own devices? What advance would they have made in education and in a decent manner of living? and in their nearly half a century of freedom what have they to show for the advantages they have enjoyed? These are pertinent questions, and should be answered thoughtfully, candidly and without prejudice. In the first place, is it hardly fair to speak of them as a race? To most minds this would convey the idea that they were negroes, and yet a large proportion of those I knew were descendants of two races. It seems a common trait of the Anglo Saxon that wherever he perceives an individual of mixed races to classify him with the one he considers the inferior and if he displays any undesirable qualities, they are the traits of that inferior race, while all his brilliant and otherwise desirable characteristics can be traced to a white ancestor. I knew many among the so-called colored people who were perfect blonds — white skins, blue eyes and flaxen hair, but despite the testimony of ones eyes they were negroes, or as more commonly designated — niggers, and of course belonged to the African race, even if the African ancestors were twenty generations back. However, for the sake of convenience I shall adopt the common rule and speak of them as a race. As benevolent societies took up the work of educating and otherwise assisting this people immediately after their emancipation, it is difficult to form any idea as to how long their poverty, added to the habits engendered by slavery would have held them in abject ignorance and degredation. The struggle of the greater number to satisfy their most pressing needs would probably have exhausted all their time and strength, and to many life would have been harder in some ways than during the days of slavery. But there were some among them in better circumstances than the majority — free colored people who had, in one way and another accumulated a little property, and, in spite of obstacles acquired the rudiments of an education — men and women of much natural intelligence and public spirit enough to feel an interest in their race Their better positions and attainments would have spurred the ambition of those of a lower grade, for the humblest among them were anxious to learn, and the services of the more fortunate would have been called into requisition, as teachers of the ignorant and poverty stricken. The work would have been slow and very imperfect at first and many would have yielded to discouragements, but the instinct to learn was so strong in the race that I firmly believe that although it might have taken generations to do so, they would have won out in the end. Of course there were shiftless, degenerate individuals among them as there are in all races and all classes, but I believe taking all the circumstances into consideration they have made as much progress in the brief period of their lives as free people, as any race would have done in the same time and under similar circumstances. The obstacles they had to overcome in spite of the aid that was extended them through various educational and charitable organizations were greater than most people can realize To say nothing of the limitations that descended to them through a barbarian ancestry; or of the brutalizing effects of slavery upon their natures, they came out of bondage owners of themselves to be sure but of little else — poor not only in worldly goods, but utterly poverty stricken as regards a knowledge as to how to make the best use of such means and qualifications as had fallen to their lot. They looked out upon the world with bewildered eyes, not knowing what to do in the strange situation in which they found themselves, and finally, when their brains had been able to solve the puzzle, and they had started out to make their way in the world, they were met with prejudice and persecution in all directions. It seems to me that instead of it being a matter of surprise that so many of them are still shiftless and ignorant the fact that so many are sober, industrious intelligent citizens, and no small number of individuals among them who have attained to positions of considerable eminences should excite our admiration and applause. "What have they to show for the advantages they have enjoyed in their half century of freedom?" In answer I would say that I have no statistics at hand, but that these can be procured from various sources, notably from the report of such schools as Hampton, Tuskeegee and dozens of others through which we learn of the progress they have made, not only in book learning, but in industrial education, wealth, and the art of decent living. And a reference to the letters of some of my former pupils, to be found in Chapter 19th of these Reminiscences, must surely convince any unprejudiced person that in one locality at least there has been most hopeful progress. Fifty years is a brief period in the educating and civilizing of a race. It is true that some civilizing influences reached them through slavery. The servants in families of culture and intelligence acquired some of the manners and habits of those they served, and naturally each generation took on something more of the qualities of the governing race than the preceding one, so they had this advantage as a foundation to build upon; and some of them found good friends in their former masters when the bonds of slavery were broken. But it was more often that the bitterness of their defeat roused a feeling of enmity in the hearts of the masters towards their former chattels, and instead of stretching out a helping hand, they either tried to obstruct their progress, or ignored them entirely so the help they received from friends, and the obstacles put in their way by unfriendly ones, just about balanced each other. Instead of judging too harshly those who tried to restrain the progress of the Freedmen we should exercise feelings of pity and charity towards them They did not view the shield from the same side as ourselves, and the change from the old regime was very hard on them. It was only human nature that they should feel bitter and resentful, but in taking this course they stood in their own light, and in retarding the progress of the colored people they also retarded their own interests as well. But they are learning their lesson, and prosperity smiles upon them in these new industries which are springing up all over the South — industries in which their old time chattels are an important factor. As years go on, it is possible that whatever of ill feeling remains between the white people and their former bondmen will gradually fade away and future generations of southerners will wonder as do we in the North how it was ever possible for our ancestors to think it right to hold human beings in slavery. It is good to feel that this greatest of all blots upon our free institutions, this "sum of all villianies" as it was designated by one of our brave old time abolitionists, has been erased as we trust for all time. There is still much to be done to remove the effects of the great wrong our fathers handed down to us as a legacy, but time, and patience, and the growing moral sense of the world at large are working wonders. And as a final word I would say that my faith in the future of this people has never wavered, and I am glad, glad, glad that I had even a small and insignificant part in the uplifting of the freed people of Virginia. O dark, sad millions! Patiently and dumb Waiting for God. Your hour at last has come And Freedoms song, Breaks the long silence of your night of wrong. Whittier</field>
