      <field name="fulltext">Songs of Innocence Introduction Piping down the valleys wild,Piping songs of pleasant glee,On a cloud I saw a child,And he laughing said to me: "Pipe a song about a Lamb!"So I piped with merry chear."Piper, pipe that song again;"So I piped, he wept to hear."Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;Sing thy songs of happy chear:"So I sung the same again,While he wept with joy to hear."Piper, sit thee down and writeIn a book, that all may read."So he vanis'd from my sight,And I pluck'd a hollow reed,And I made a rural pen,And I stain'd the water clear,And I wrote my happy songsEvery child may joy to hear. The Shepherd How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!From the morn to the evening he strays;He shall follow his sheep all the day,And his tongue shall be filled with praise.For he hears the lamb's innocent call,And he hears the ewe's tender reply;He is watchful while they are in peace,For they know when their Shepherd is nigh. The Ecchoing Green The Sun does arise,And make happy the skies;The merry bells ringTo welcome the Spring;The sky-lark and thrush,The birds of the bush,Sing louder aroundTo the bells' chearful sound,While our sports shall be seenOn the Ecchoing Green.Old John, with white hair,Does laugh away care,Sitting under the oak,Among the old folk.They laugh at our play,And soon they all say:"Such, such were the joysWhen we all, girls &amp; boys,In our youth time were seenOn the Ecchoing Green."Till the little ones, weary,No more can be merry;The sun does descend,And our sports have an end.Round the laps of their mothersMany sisters and brothers,Like birds in their nest,Are ready for rest,And sport no more seenOn the darkening Green. The Lamb Little lamb, who made thee?Dost thou know who made thee?Gave thee life &amp; bid thee feed,By the stream &amp; o'er the mead;Gave thee clothing of delight,Softest clothing, wooly, bright;Gave thee such a tender voice,Making all the vales rejoice?Little Lamb, who made thee?Dost thou know who made thee?Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:He is called by thy name,For he calls himself a Lamb.He is meek &amp; he is mild;He became a little child.I a child &amp; thou a lamb.We are called by his name.Little Lamb, God bless thee!Little Lamb, God bless thee! The Little Black Boy My mother bore me in the southern wild,And I am black, but O! my soul is white;White as an angel is the English child,But I am black as if bereav'd of light.My mother taught me underneath a tree,And, sitting down before the heat of day,She took me on her lap and kissed me,And pointing to the east began to say:"Look on the rising sun: there God does live,And gives his light, and gives his heat away;And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieveComfort in morning, joy in the noonday."And we are put on earth a little space,That we may learn to bear the beams of love;And these black bodies and this sunburnt faceIs but a cloud, and like a shady grove. "For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,The cloud will vanish; we shall hear his voice,Saying: 'Come out from the grove, my love &amp; care,And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.'"Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;And thus I say to little English boy.When I from black and he from white cloud free,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bearTo lean in joy upon our father's knee;And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,And be like him, and he will then love me. The Blossom Merry Merry Sparrow!Under leaves so green,A happy BlossomSees you, swift as arrow,Seek your cradle narrowNear my Bosom.Pretty Pretty Robin!Under leaves so green,A happy BlossomHears you sobbing, sobbing,Pretty Pretty Robin,Near my Bosom. The Chimney Sweeper When my mother died I was very young,And my father sold me while yet my tongueCould scarcely cry "'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bareYou know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."And so he was quiet &amp; that very night,As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned &amp; jack,Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black.And by came an Angel who had a bright key,And he open'd the coffins &amp; set them all free;Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,And wash in a river, and shine in the Sun.Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,He'd have God for his father &amp; never want joy.And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark,And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm;So if all do their duty they need not fear harm. The Little Boy Lost "Father! father! where are you going?O do not walk so fast.Speak, father, speak to your little boy,Or else I shall be lost."The night was dark, no father was there;The child was wet with dew;The mire was deep, &amp; the child did weep,And away the vapour flew. The Little Boy Found The little boy lost in the lonely fen,Led by the wand'ring light,Began to cry; but God, ever nigh,Appear'd like his father, in white.He kissed the child, &amp; by the hand led,And to his mother brought,Who in sorrow pale, thro' the lonely dale,Her little boy weeping sought. Laughing Song When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;When the air does laugh with our merry wit,And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;When the meadows laugh with lively green,And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,When Mary and Susan and EmilyWith their sweet round mouths sing "Ha, Ha, He!"When the painted birds laugh in the shade,Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread,Come live &amp; be merry, and join with me,To sing the sweet chorus of "Ha, Ha, He!" A CRADLE SONG Sweet dreams form a shadeO'er my lovely infant's head;Sweet dreams of pleasant streamsBy happy, silent, moony beams.Sweet sleep with soft downWeave thy brows an infant crown.Sweet sleep, Angel mild,Hover o'er my happy child.Sweet smiles in the nightHover over my delight;Sweet smiles, Mother's smiles,All the livelong night beguiles.Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,Chase not slumber from thy eyes.Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,All the dovelike moans beguiles.Sleep sleep, happy child,All creation slept and smil'd;Sleep sleep, happy sleep,While o'er thee thy mother weep.Sweet babe, in thy faceHoly image I can trace.Sweet babe, once like thee,Thy maker lay and wept for me, Wept for me, for thee, for all,When he was an infant small.Thou his image ever see,Heavenly face that smiles on thee,Smiles on thee, on me, on all;Who became an infant small.Infant smiles are his own smiles;Heaven &amp; earth to peace beguiles. The Divine Image To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and LoveAll pray in their distress;And to these virtues of delightReturn their thankfulness.For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and LoveIs God, our father dear,And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and LoveIs Man, his child and care.For Mercy has a human heart,Pity a human face,And Love, the human form divine,And Peace, the human dress.Then every man, of every climeThat prays in his distress,Prays to the human form divine,Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.And all must love the human form,In heathen, turk, or jew;Where Mercy, Love &amp; Pity dwellThere God is dwelling too. HOLY THURSDAY 'Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,The children walking two &amp; two, in red &amp; blue &amp; green,Grey-headed beadles walk'd before, with wands as white as snow,Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames' waters flowO what a multitude they seem'd, these flowers of London town!Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own.The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,Thousands of little boys &amp; girls raising their innocent hands.Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among.Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door. Night The sun descending in the west,The evening star does shine;The birds are silent in their nest,And I must seek for mine.The moon like a flower,In heaven's high bower,With silent delightSits and smiles on the night.Farewell, green fields and happy groves,Where flocks have took delight;Where lambs have nibbled, silent movesThe feet of angels bright;Unseen they pour blessing,And joy without ceasing,On each bud and blossom,And each sleeping bosom.They look in every thoughtless nest,Where birds are cover'd warm;They visit caves of every beast,To keep them all from harm;If they see any weepingThat should have been sleeping,They pour sleep on their headAnd sit down by their bed. When wolves and tygers howl for prey,They pitying stand and weep;Seeking to drive their thirst away,And keep them from the sheep.But if they rush dreadful,The angels, most heedful,Recieve each mild spirit,New worlds to inherit.And there the lion's ruddy eyesShall flow with tears of gold,And pitying the tender cries,And walking round the fold,Saying "Wrath, by his meekness,And, by his health, sicknessIs driven awayFrom our immortal day."And now beside thee, bleating lamb,I can lie down and sleep;Or think on him who bore thy name,Graze after thee and weep.For, wash'd in life's river,My bright mane for everShall shine like the goldAs I guard o'er the fold." Spring Sound the Flute!Now it's mute.Birds delightDay and Night;NightingaleIn the dale,Lark in Sky,Merrily,Merrily, Merrily, to welcome in the Year.Little Boy,Full of joy; Little Girl,Sweet and small;Cock does crow,So do you;Merry voice,Infant noise,Merrily, Merrily, to welcome in the Year.Little Lamb,Here I am;Come and lickMy white neck;Let me pullYour soft Wool;Let me kissYour soft face:Merrily, Merrily, we welcome in the Year. Nurse's Song When the voices of children are heard on the green,And laughing is heard on the hill,My heart is at rest within my breast,And everything else is still."Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,And the dews of night arise;Come, come, leave off play, and let us awayTill the morning appears in the skies.""No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,And we cannot go to sleep;Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,And the hills are all cover'd with sheep.""Well, well, go &amp; play till the light fades away,And then go home to bed."The little ones leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'dAnd all the hills ecchoed. Infant Joy "I have no name:I am but two days old."What shall I call thee?"I happy am,Joy is my name."Sweet joy befall thee!Pretty joy!Sweet joy, but two days old.Sweet joy I call thee:Thou dost smile,I sing the while,Sweet joy befall thee! A Dream Once a dream did weave a shadeO'er my Angel-guarded bed,That an Emmet lost its wayWhere on grass methought I lay.Troubled, 'wilder'd, and forlorn,Dark, benighted, travel-worn,Over many a tangled spray,All heart-broke I heard her say:"O, my children! do they cry?Do they hear their father sigh?Now they look abroad to see:Now return and weep for me."Pitying, I drop'd a tear;But I saw a glow-worm near,Who replied: "What wailing wightCalls the watchman of the night?"I am set to light the ground,While the beetle goes his round:Follow now the beetle's hum;Little wanderer, hie thee home." On Another's Sorrow Can I see another's woe,Can I see another's grief,And not be in sorrow too?And not seek for kind relief?Can I see a falling tear,Can a father see his childAnd not feel my sorrow's share?Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd?Can a mother sit and hearAn infant groan, an infant fear?No, no! never can it be!Never, never can it be!And can he who smiles on allHear the wren with sorrows small,Hear the small bird's grief &amp; care,Hear the woes that infants bear,And not sit beside the nest,Pouring pity in their breast;And not sit the cradle near,Weeping tear on infant's tear;And not sit both night &amp; day,Wiping all our tears away?O! no, never can it be!Never, never can it be!He doth give his joy to all;He becomes an infant small;He becomes a man of woe;He doth feel the sorrow too.Think not thou canst sigh a sigh,And thy maker is not by;Think not thou canst weep a tear,And thy maker is not near.O! he gives to us his joyThat our grief he may destroy;Till our grief is fled &amp; goneHe doth sit by us and moan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Songs of Experience Introduction Hear the voice of the Bard!Who Present, Past, &amp; Future, sees;Whose ears have heardThe Holy WordThat walk'd among the ancient trees,Calling the lapsed Soul,And weeping in the evening dew;That might controllThe starry pole,And fallen, fallen light renew!"O Earth, O Earth, return!"Arise from out the dewy grass;"Night is worn,"And the morn"Rises from the slumberous mass."Turn away no more;"Why wilt thou turn away?"The starry floor,"The wat'ry shore,"Is giv'n thee till the break of day." EARTH'S Answer Earth rais'd up her headFrom the darkness dread &amp; drear.Her light fled,Stony dread!And her locks cover'd with grey despair."Prison'd on wat'ry shore,"Starry jealousy does keep my den:"Cold and hoar,"Weeping o'er,"I hear the Father of the ancient men."Selfish father of men!"Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!"Can delight,"Chain'd in night,"The virgins of youth and morning bear?"Does spring hide its joy"When buds and blossoms grow?"Does the sower"Sow by night,"Or the plowman in darkness plow?"Break this heavy chain"That does freeze my bones around."Selfish! vain!"Eternal bane!"That free Love with bondage bound." The CLOD &amp; the PEBBLE "Love seeketh not Itself to please,"Nor for itself hath any care,"But for another gives its ease,"And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair."So sang a little Clod of ClayTrodden with the cattle's feet,But a Pebble of the brookWarbled out these metres meet:"Love seeketh only Self to please,"To bind another to its delight,"Joys in another's loss of ease,"And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite." HOLY THURSDAY Is this a holy thing to seeIn a rich and fruitful land,Babes reduc'd to misery,Fed with cold and usurous hand?Is that trembling cry a song?Can it be a song of joy?And so many children poor?It is a land of poverty!And their sun does never shine,And their fields are bleak &amp; bare,And their ways are fill'd with thorns:It is eternal winter there.For where-e'er the sun does shine,And where-e'er the rain does fall,Babe can never hunger there,Nor poverty the mind appall. The Little Girl Lost In futurityI prophetic seeThat the earth from sleep(Grave the sentence deep)Shall arise and seekFor her maker meek;And the desart wildBecome a garden mild.In the southern clime,Where the summer's primeNever fades away,Lovely Lyca lay.Seven summers oldLovely Lyca told;She had wander'd longHearing wild birds' song."Sweet sleep, come to meUnderneath this tree.Do father, mother, weep?Where can Lyca sleep?"Lost in desart wildIs your little child.How can Lyca sleepIf her mother weep?"If her heart does akeThen let Lyca wake;If my mother sleep,Lyca shall not weep."Frowning, frowning night,O'er this desart bright,Let thy moon ariseWhile I close my eyes."Sleeping Lyca layWhile the beasts of prey,Come from caverns deep,View'd the maid asleep.Thhe kingly lion stood,And the virgin view'd,Then he gambol'd roundO'er the hallow'd ground. Leopards, tygers, playRound her as she lay,While the lion oldBow'd his mane of goldAnd her bosom lick,And upon her neckFrom his eyes of flameRuby tears there came;While the lionessLoos'd her slender dress,And naked they convey'dTo caves the sleeping maid. The Little Girl Found All the night in woeLyca's parents goOver vallies deep,While the desarts weep.Tired and woe-begone,Hoarse with making moan,Arm in arm seven daysThey trac'd the desart ways.Seven nights they sleepAmong shadows deep,And dream they see their childStarv'd in desart wild.Pale, thro' pathless waysThe fancied image strays Famish'd, weeping, weak,With hollow piteous shriek.Rising from unrest,The trembling woman prestWith feet of weary woe:She could no further go.In his arms he boreHer, arm'd with sorrow sore;Till before their wayA couching lion lay.Turning back was vain:Soon his heavy maneBore them to the ground.Then he stalk'd around,Smelling to his prey;But their fears allayWhen he licks their hands,And silent by them stands.They look upon his eyesFill'd with deep surprise;And wondering beholdA Spirit arm'd in gold.On his head a crown;On his shoulders downFlow'd his golden hair.Gone was all their care."Follow me," he said;"Weep not for the maid;In my palace deepLyca lies asleep."Then they followedWhere the vision led,And saw their sleeping childAmong tygers wild.To this day they dwellIn a lonely dell;Nor fear the wolvish howlNor the lions' growl. THE Chimney Sweeper A little black thing among the snow,Crying ''weep! 'weep!' in notes of woe!"Where are thy father &amp; mother? say?""They are both gone up to the church to pray."Because I was happy upon the heath,"And smil'd among the winter's snow,"They clothed me in the clothes of death,"And taught me to sing the notes of woe."And because I am happy &amp; dance &amp; sing,"They think they have done me no injury,"And are gone to praise God &amp; his Priest &amp; King,"Who make up a heaven of our misery. NURSE'S Song When the voices of children are heard on the greenAnd whisp'rings are in the dale,The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,My face turns green and pale.Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,And the dews of night arise;Your spring &amp; your day are wasted in play,And your winter and night in disguise. The SICK ROSE O Rose, thou art sick!The invisible wormThat flies in the night,In the howling storm,Has found out thy bedOf crimson joy:And his dark secret loveDoes thy life destroy. THE FLY Little Fly,Thy summer's playMy thoughtless handHas brush'd away.Am not IA fly like thee?Or art not thouA man like me?For I dance,And drink, &amp; sing,Till some blind handShall brush my wing.If thought is lifeAnd strength &amp; breath,And the wantOf thought is death;Then am IA happy fly,If I liveOr if I die. The Angel I Dreamt a Dream! what can it mean?And that I was a maiden Queen,Guarded by an Angel mild:Witless woe was ne'er beguil'd!And I wept both night and day,And he wip'd my tears away,And I wept both day and night,And hid from him my heart's delight.So he took his wings and fled;Then the morn blush'd rosy red;I dried my tears, &amp; arm'd my fearsWith ten thousand shields and spears.Soon my Angel came again:I was arm'd, he came in vain;For the time of youth was fled,And grey hairs were on my head. The Tyger Tyger! Tyger! burning brightIn the forests of the night,What immortal hand or eyeCould frame thy fearful symmetry?In what distant deeps or skiesBurnt the fire of thine eyes?On what wings dare he aspire?What the hand dare sieze the fire?And what shoulder, &amp; what art,Could twist the sinews of thy heart?And when thy heart began to beat,What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet?What the hammer? what the chain?In what furnace was thy brain?What the anvil? what dread graspDare its deadly terrors clasp?When the stars threw down their spears,And water'd heaven with their tears,Did he smile his work to see?Did he who made the Lamb make thee?Tyger! Tyger! burning brightIn the forests of the night,What immortal hand or eyeDare frame thy fearful symmetry? My Pretty ROSE TREE A flower was offer'd to me,Such a flower as May never bore;But I said "I've a Pretty Rose-tree,"And I passed the sweet flower o'er.Then I went to my Pretty Rose-tree,To tend her by day and by night;But my Rose turn'd away with jealousy,And her thorns were my only delight. AH! SUN-FLOWER Ah, Sun-flower, weary of time,Who countest the steps of the Sun,Seeking after that sweet golden climeWhere the traveller's journey is done:Where the Youth pined away with desire,And the pale Virgin shrouded in snowArise from their graves, and aspireWhere my Sun-flower wishes to go. THE LILLY The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,The humble Sheep a threat'ning horn;While the Lilly white shall in Love delight,Nor a thorn, nor a threat, stain her beauty bright. The GARDEN of LOVE I went to the Garden of Love,And saw what I never had seen:A Chapel was built in the midst,Where I used to play on the green.And the gates of this Chapel were shut,And "Thou shalt not" writ over the door;So I turn'd to the Garden of LoveThat so many sweet flowers bore;And I saw it was filled with graves,And tomb-stones where flowers should be;And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,And binding with briars my joys &amp; desires. The Little Vagabond Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold,But the Ale-house is healthy &amp; pleasant &amp; warm;Besides I can tell where I am used well,Such usage in heaven will never do well.But if at the Church they would give us some Ale,And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,We'd sing and we'd pray all the live-long day,Nor ever once wish from the Church to strayThen the Parson might preach, &amp; drink, &amp; sing,And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church,Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch.And God, like a father rejoicing to seeHis children as pleasant and happy as he,Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel,But kiss him, &amp; give him both drink and apparel. LONDON I wander thro' each charter'd street,Near where the charter'd Thames does flow,And mark in every face I meetMarks of weakness, marks of woe.In every cry of every Man,In every Infant's cry of fear,In every voice, in every ban,The mind-forg'd manacles I hear.How the Chimney-sweeper's cryEvery black'ning Church appalls;And the hapless Soldier's sighRuns in blood down Palace walls.But most thro' midnight streets I hearHow the youthful Harlot's curseBlasts the new born Infant's tear,And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse. The Human Abstract Pity would be no moreIf we did not make somebody Poor;And Mercy no more could beIf all were as happy as we.And mutual fear brings peace,Till the selfish loves increase:Then Cruelty knits a snare,And spreads his baits with care.He sits down with holy fears,And waters the ground with tears;Then Humility takes its rootUnderneath his foot.Soon spreads the dismal shadeOf Mystery over his head;And the Catterpiller and FlyFeed on the Mystery.And it bears the fruit of Deceit,Ruddy and sweet to eat;And the Raven his nest has madeIn its thickest shade.The Gods of the earth and seaSought thro' Nature to find this Tree;But their search was all in vain:There grows one in the Human Brain. INFANT SORROW My mother groan'd! my father wept.Into the dangerous world I leapt:Helpless, naked, piping loud:Like a fiend hid in a cloud.Struggling in my father's hands,Striving against my swadling bands,Bound and weary I thought bestTo sulk upon my mother's breast. A POISON TREE I was angry with my friend:I told my wrath, my wrath did end.I was angry with my foe:I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I water'd it in fears,Night &amp; morning with my tears;And I sunned it with smiles,And with soft deceitful wiles.And it grew both day and night,Till it bore an apple bright;And my foe beheld it shine,And he knew that it was mine,And into my garden stoleWhen the night had veil'd the pole:In the morning glad I seeMy foe outstretch'd beneath the tree. A Little BOY Lost "Nought loves another as itself,"Nor venerates another so,"Nor is it possible to Thought"A greater than itself to know:"And Father, how can I love you"Or any of my brothers more?"I love you like the little bird"That picks up crumbs around the door."The Priest sat by and heard the child,In trembling zeal he siez'd his hair:He led him by his little coat,And all admir'd the Priestly care.And standing on the altar high,"Lo! what a fiend is here!" said he,"One who sets reason up for judge"Of our most holy Mystery."The weeping child could not be heard,The weeping parents wept in vain;They strip'd him to his little shirt,And bound him in an iron chain;And burn'd him in a holy place,Where many had been burn'd before:The weeping parents wept in vain.Are such things done on Albion's shore? A Little GIRL Lost Children of the future AgeReading this indignant page,Know that in a former timeLove! sweet Love! was thought a crime.In the Age of Gold,Free from winter's cold,Youth and maiden brightTo the holy light,Naked in the sunny beams delight.Once a youthful pair,Fill'd with softest care,Met in garden brightWhere the holy lightHad just remov'd the curtains of the night.There, in rising dayOn the grass they play;Parents were afar,Strangers came not near,And the maiden soon forgot her fear.Tired with kisses sweet,They agree to meetWhen the silent sleepWaves o'er heaven's deep,And the weary tired wanderers weep.To her father whiteCame the maiden bright;But his loving look,Like the holy book,All her tender limbs with terror shook."Ona! pale and weak!"To thy father speak:"O, the trembling fear!"O, the dismal care!"That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair." To Tirzah [Probably added about 1801] Whate'er is Born of Mortal BirthMust be consumed with the EarthTo rise from Generation free:Then what have I to do with thee?The Sexes sprung from Shame &amp; Pride,Blow'd in the morn; in evening died;But Mercy chang'd Death into Sleep;The Sexes rose to work &amp; weep.Thou, Mother of my Mortal part,With cruelty didst mould my Heart,And with false self-decieving tearsDidst bind my Nostrils, Eyes, &amp; Ears:Didst close my Tongue in senseless clay,And me to Mortal Life betray.The Death of Jesus set me free:Then what have I to do with thee? The School Boy I love to rise in a summer mornWhen the birds sing on every tree;The distant huntsman winds his horn,And the sky-lark sings with me.O! what sweet company.But to go to school in a summer morn,O! it drives all joy away; Under a cruel eye outworn,The little ones spend the dayIn sighing and dismay.Ah! then at times I drooping sit,And spend many an anxious hour,Nor in my book can I take delight,Nor sit in learning's bower,Worn thro'with the dreary shower.How can the bird that is born for joySit in a cage and sing?How can a child, when fears annoy,But droop his tender wing,And forget his youthful spring?O! father &amp; mother, if buds are nip'dAnd blossoms blown away,And if the tender plants are strip'dOf their joy in the springing day,By sorrow and care's dismay,How shall the summer arise in joy,Or the summer fruits appear?Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,Or bless the mellowing year,When the blasts of winter appear? The Voice of the Ancient Bard Youth of delight, come hither,And see the opening morn,Image of truth new-born.Doubt is fled &amp; clouds of reason,Dark disputes &amp; artful teazing.Folly is an endless maze,Tangled roots perplex her ways.How many have fallen there!They stumble all night over bones of the dead,And feel they know not what but care,And wish to lead others, when they should be led.</field>
