      <field name="fulltext">LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the students. The Licentiates of Session 1890-'91 were as follows: E. J. Buchanan, Anatomy. A. B. Dinwiddie, M. A., Latin, Greek, German, Mathematics. A. D. Drew, Chemistry. Champe C. McCulloch, Natural History and Geology. W. D. Macon, Latin. E. M. Magruder, M. D., Studies of the Medical Department. T. J. Randolph, B. Ph., B. A., Greek, Mathematics. F. L. Taylor, M. A., Anatomy. J. S. Taylor, French, Latin. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANNOUNCEMENTS. 1891-'92. The University of Virginia is in a picturesque and healthful location among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railwayâthe Chesapeake and Ohio and the Virginia Midlandâand is thus of easy access from every part of the country. It has a post-office, with numerous daily mails, is in communication by telephone with the neighboring city of Charlottesville, and is connected by telegraph with every quarter of the world. The climate is invigorating and healthful, and at all times free from malarial conditions. The Sanitary Arrangements are considered almost perfect. There is a copious supply of the purest water; the system of drains and sewers is complete; and the moderate Infirmary fee secures medical treatment by the Professors of the Medical Department, and in case of serious illness skilful nursing in a well-equipped Infirmary. The Session begins on the 1st of October, and continues nine months without intermission. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 3d of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the public are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in seven departments, the Literary, the Scientific, the Law, the Medical, the Pharmaceutical, the Engineering, and the Agricultural Department. In the various Departments there are altogether nineteen distinct Schools, each affording an independent course, under Professors, who are responsible to the Visitors for the system and methods pursued. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, so far as the times appointed for lectures and examinations permit. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Degrees.âBut even here it has been found advantageous to mark out in the several Departments carefully arranged groups of studies leading to corresponding Degrees; and it is always best for the student, in either the Academical or the Professional Schools, to follow from the outset some definite plan of studies, formed under competent advice. Such a course will generally lead to one of these Degrees, although not necessarily limited by the requirements for any one of them. Equipment.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction both in the Academical and the Professional Departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, and the Biological Laboratory. Ample opportunities are afforded for the practical study of Human Anatomy. And the Engineering Department possesses a newly-equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. The University Library is common to all the Departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has been since much enlarged by purchases and donations, and now contains about 50,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the library for six hours daily to attend to their wants. Preparation.âSome special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purposes of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome all disadvantages, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. Admission.âTo be admitted as a student of the University the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They strictly forbid drunkenness, gaming, dissoluteness, swearing, habits of expense, and the introduction of wine or other intoxicating drinks into the University. They require a decorous observance of Sunday, and forbid all outdoor sports on that day. They forbid the use or possession by a student of pistols or other weapons, and the introduction of them into the University precincts. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LITERARY DEPARTMENT. WILLIAM E. PETERS, LL. D. Professor of Latin. MILTON W. HUMPHREYS, M. A., Ph. D., LL. D. Professor of Greek. M. SCHELE DE VERE, Ph. D., J. U. D. Professor of Modern Languages. JAMES M. GARNETT, M. A., LL. D. Professor of English. GEORGE FREDERICK HOLMES, LL. D. Professor of Historical Science. NOAH K. DAVIS, M. A., Ph. D., LL. D. Professor of Moral Philosophy. WM. H. PERKINSON, Ph. D. Adjunct Professor of Modern Languages. R. HEATH DABNEY, M. A., Ph. D. Adjunct Professor of General History. ROBERT S. RADFORD, Instructor in Latin and Greek. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Peters. This School is divided into three classesâJunior, Intermediate and Senior. Junior Class.âA student who is able to read CÃ¦sar or Vergil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this class. The class begins with Sallust or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Ovid, Curtius, and Vergil. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. There are two examinationsâthe Intermediate, held about the middle of the session; the Final, at its close. These examinations are conducted in writing. Intermediate Class.âWork in this class will be directed to the acquirement of readiness in translation and syntactical interpretation, with as little specialistic investigation as is consistent with a general but sound and permanent knowledge of the language. As an indispensable auxiliary to this end written exercises in translating English into Latin and Latin into English will be required. Proper attention will be given to Roman History and Literature. The metrical work 3 will be limited to the structure and accurate recitation of the Dactylic, AnapÃ¦stic, Trochaic, and Iambic verses, with the verses occurring in the odes of Horace. Translation will be confined to Livy, Horace, Cicero, Seneca, or Tacitus. Selections from each author will be assigned as parallel reading. There will be two written examinationsâ Intermediate and Final. Senior Class.âThis class commences with Juvenal or Livy, and reads during the session selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, or a play of Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is taken up early in the session and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the Language. Portions of the authors read in the Lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the Lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the Lectures. In this class there are two examinationsâone occurring about the middle of the session, the second at its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the second of Final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In this class due attention is given to Roman History and Literature: Text-Books.âAny approved edition of the authors above named. GrammarsâGildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. HistoryâLiddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. LiteratureâBender's, as a Hand-book and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. The Graduate Course in this school is intended for students who propose to teach or who desire to equip themselves for original investigation in the language. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize them with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The Lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the archaic period of the language, which cannot be considered to any great extent in the under-graduate course. Sanskrit.âThe Professor will also give instruction in the elements of Sanskrit whenever a sufficient number of students desire it. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. The School is organized in three classesâthe Junior, the Intermediate, and the Senior. The method of instruction is by lectures, by daily examination upon the matter of the lectures, and upon assigned portions of the text-books, and by written and oral exercises. A full knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translation are necessary as a preparation for the Junior Class. Two books of Xenophon's Anabasis, or some suitable equivalent, may be regarded as a proper amount of preparatory reading. Diligent students inadequately prepared often make good progress with the aid of a Licentiate. Junior Class.âThe work of this class is directed to the acquirement of a practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is rapidly but carefully reviewed; for translation into Greek, sentences are given out which involve the vocabulary and the idioms of the Greek texts studied. The authors read are Xenophon and Lysias. The Geography and Political History of Greece are taught in this class. Intermediate Class.âThis class, for which the Junior course, or some equivalent, is the appropriate preparation, continues the study of Attic prose usage, and enters upon the study of the Drama and of Homer. Weekly exercises for translation into Greek are given, each being a passage of simple but idiomatic English based on a Greek author. Selected portions of the Grammar are closely studied, and the whole Syntax is reviewed. The authors read are Lysias, Plato, Euripides, and Homer. Instruction in Greek Literature and Antiquities is given in this class. Senior Class.âThe successful pursuit of the Senior course demands such attainments as may be acquired in the two lower classes, or an equivalent. The authors read this session are Demosthenes, Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristophanes, and the fragments of the Lyric Poets. The Syntax of the Greek Verb is discussed, and courses of lectures are given upon Metres and the History of Greek Literature. The weekly exercises are partly based on ancient authors and partly specially prepared or taken from standard English writers. Text-books.âLiddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon (seventh edition), Veitch's Greek Verbs, Goodwin's Greek Grammar, Goodwin's Greek Moods and Tenses, and approved editions of the authors read. For each class a course of private reading is prescribed, not restricted to the authors named above. The state of preparation of a pupil joining the School may often make it expedient to take two classes at once. In the examination of candidates for graduation, all the subjects taught in the School are involved, and the passages set for translation are selected from the classic writers at will. The Graduate Course is designed primarily for those who intend to become teachers of the classical languages, and who desire a thorough introduction to Greek philology as a part of their professional equipment. With such students the Professor will read and discuss the more difficult Greek authors. Courses of private reading are marked out, including important text-books and monographs; and by systematic lectures, as well as by constant supervision and advice, the Professor will aid and direct the student's endeavors. As an exercise in the independent investigation of philological problems, each student is from time to time expected to prepare a paper, discussing thoroughly some topic selected by himself. Constant practice is given in Greek composition. Hebrew.âElementary instruction in Hebrew will be given when the demand for such instruction is sufficient. SCHOOL OF MODERN LANGUAGES. Spanish, Italian and Anglo-Saxon. Professor Schele De Vere. In Spanish and Italian each there is one class in which a number of classic and of modern authors is read, to practice pronunciation, to acquire facility in prompt rendering of the foreign idiom, and to learn to appreciate the literary beauties of eminent writers. A much larger number of works, mainly by modern authors, is assigned to be read privately. At every meeting a lecture is delivered, and to a large extent illustrated by examples and quotations. In these lectures the Grammar and the Syntax of each idiom are discussed. The treatment is mainly historical, the words, the sentences, and the general structure being exhibited as they gradually develop themselves from the earliest efforts made by the infant nation to the highest results obtained in its so-called Golden Age. These lectures are accompanied by weekly exercises, translations from the vernacular into the foreign idioms. They furnish the Professor with evidence of the degree of success with which he has tried to explain the rules and usages of each language. After having been carefully marked, they are returned to the student, and then written, in correct form. The Professor, as he writes them, accompanies the exercises with a running commentary on the various rules that have been violated or misunderstood. At stated intervals the Professor reads aloud, so as to train the ear; at others, he dictates extracts from foreign writers for the same purpose. After the classes have become somewhat familiar with the language, they are given a series of lectures treating of the history of the idiom. Its forms, its structure, and its spiritual characteristics are carefully traced through the different periods, and minutely compared with each other. This gives an opportunity for instruction in the fundamental rules of the Science of Language, to which much attention is given. These lectures are followed by another course on the Literature of each idiom. The different periods of the literature are explained and illustrated by sketches of the lives, and criticisms on the works, of the principal writers of each age. The parallelism between the national growth of a people and its literary proficiency is constantly pointed out. In the Class of Anglo-Saxon the study of the language is mainly pursued in its aspect as the mother of English, furnishing the student the means of tracing the history of his native tongue from its earliest beginning. Much attention is given to the illustration of the history of words, their birth, their fate under the rule of the Norman, and their subsequent modification. Extracts from Anglo-Saxon writers are read, and the boaring of their works on the history of our race is explained. The following text-books are used: Spanish.âThe Professor's Grammar; Seoane's Dictionary; Velasquez' Reader; Breton's La Independencia; Don Quijote; Calderon's El Principe Constante; Lope's Estrella de Sevilla; Cervantes' Novelas Ejemplares; Galdos's Trafalgar; Caballero's La Familia de Alvareda; Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature. In default of the Professor's Grammar, now out of print, Knapp's Spanish Grammar will be used. Italian.âCuore's Grammar; Foresti's Reader; Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi; Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata; Pellico's Le Mie Prigioni; Petrarca; Dante's La Divina Commedia. Anglo-Saxon.âShute's Manual of Anglo-Saxon, or Sweet's Primer; The Professor's Studies in English; March's Anglo-Saxon Grammar (for reference); the Anglo-Saxon Gospels. French and German. Adjunct Professor Perkinson. There will be two classes in each language. The Junior Classes embrace the work for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Students who desire to enter them must possess an accurate knowledge of the elements of English grammar. They will study the grammar of the language, and will be practiced in pronunciation, on which special stress will be laid, and in translation, supplemented by weekly written exercises, copious parallel reading, and a course in the history and the literature of the language. The amount of parallel reading to be done is definite, and is assigned at the beginning of the session. Special attention is paid to reading at sight. The Senior Classes study the historical grammar of the language, given by lectures, continue the practice of translation and composition, and enter more minutely into the study of certain authors and selected periods. Candidates for graduation will be expected to translate at sight any passage that may be assigned, and to render selections from English authors into the foreign idiom. The text-books in all the classes and the authors to be read vary from year to year, and are subject to change at any time. The following are the books for class-work in 1891-'92. Parallel reading will be assigned in all classes at the beginning of the session. Junior French.âEdgren's Grammar; De Vere's Reader; La Mare au Diable; Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; Horace; Un Philosophe sous les Toits. Junior German.âWhitney's Brief Grammar; Joynes-Meissner's Grammar; Brandt's Reader; Undine; Die Jungfrau von Orleans; Minna von Barnhelm. Senior French.âWhitney's Practical Grammar; Saintsbury's History of French Literature; Taine's Notes sur L'Angleterre; Le Cid; Athalie; Le Tartuffe; Les Travailleurs de la Mer. Senior German.âWhitney's Grammar; Heine's Prosa; Egmont, Faust; Nathan der Weise. Gasc's French Dictionary. Adler's German Dictionary. Candidates for graduation in the School of Modern Languages are required to pass examination in French and German only. In the Graduate Course in this School students will read additional foreign authors, pursue the study of Comparative Philology, and write monthly essays on kindred subjects, which must give proof of original research. A thorough knowledge of at least one ancient language, and graduation in two modern languages, are deemed prerequisite. Such students will have the choice between the two methods of comparing idiomsâeither by tracing out the kinship existing between several languages, or families of languages, such as the Romanic, the Germanic, or the Slavic, in their lexical, grammatical, or psychological nature; or by comparing with each other the different aspects borne by one and the same idiom in its successive periods of life. The writings of Diez, Hovelacque, Sayce, Max MÃ¼ller, and others, are carefully studied; and the final result of the whole course of study is to be shown in a concluding dissertation evidencing original thought. SCHOOL OF ENGLISH. Professor Garnett. Instruction in this School is given in three classes: Class of Early English.âIn this class the historical and philological study of the language is pursued, the class beginning with its oldest forms, and tracing the language, by the study of specimens, through its different periods to the formation of modern English. After a thorough study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read, with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English. Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages, and on the history of the language, are also given. Two lectures a week. Text-books.âSweet's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English, Parts I and II. For Reference.âCook's Sievers's Grammar of Old English; Earle's Anglo-Saxon Literature; Ten Brink's Early English Literature. Class of Modern English.âIn this class the study of the descriptive history of the language is first pursued, and then Shakespere is made a special subject of study. The critical study of a play of Shakspere, with private reading of about one-fourth of the plays, is followed by similar study of selected works of later authors. Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama are given in connection with the study of Shakspere. Two lectures a week. Text-books.âLounsbury's History of the English Language; for 1891-'92, Henry V. (Rolfe's Edition); Dowden's Shakspere Primer; Abbott's Shaksperian Grammar; Milton's Works (Clarendon and Pitt Press editions). For Reference.âThe Globe Shakspere, Fleay's Shakspere Manual; Keltie's British Dramatists. Class of Rhetoric and English Literature.âIn this class the principles of Composition and Rhetoric are first studied, and then the study of the history of English Literature is taken up. Along with study of the text-books selected works of authors are assigned for private reading. Essays are required at regular intervals. Lectures on each subject are given in connection with the text-books when deemed necessary. Three lectures a week. Text-books.âGenung's Practical Elements of Rhetoric, Genung's Hand-Book of Rhetorical Analysis; Lectures on the Anglo-Saxon and the Norman Periods; Nicoll's Landmarks of English Literature; Minto's Manual of English Prose Literature; Garnett's Selections in English Prose. For Reference.âSaintsbury's History of Elizabethan Literature; Gosse's History of Eighteenth Century Literature; Ward's English Poets. Each class may be attended separately; but graduation in Rhetoric and English Literature in addition to one of the other classes will be necessary for a diploma of graduation in the School. N. B.âBooks marked "For reference" are used at the option of the student. Graduate Courses will be arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further either philological or literary studies. The former will comprise the further study of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English works, especially of Anglo-Saxon poetry, or the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. The latter will comprise the study of some distinctive period in English literature, or of some particular writer, or writers, including the political, social, and literary characteristics of the age under consideration. In each course a thesis will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued, in addition to such examinations as may be advisable. The selection of the course and subject is left to the student himself, under the guidance of the Professor. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Science of Society. Professor Holmes. In this class there are two courses, each extending over a half session. Political Economy.âIn the treatment of this department of knowledge, there is no rigid adherence to the school of Smith, Ricardo, and Mill. The modification of older doctrines, necessitated by the increase of productive inventions and productive operations, is steadily regarded. Attention is paid to the inquiries and criticisms of Thornton, Cairnes, Jevons, Marshall, etc.; and the altered views propounded by Laveleye, Walker, and the school of the Cathedrists, are duly considered. Text-books.âWalker's Political Economy (advanced course); Mill's Political Economy (abridged). Science of Society.âThe latter half of the course in this class is devoted to the Science of Society. In this is prosecuted the investigation of the laws and movements, the growth, decay, and constitution of Societies, in the different phases and stages of social development. The necessary organic functions of Society are studied in their several forms. They are also regarded in their reciprocal relations and in their conjoint action in successive forms of civilization. All systems are interpreted; no ideal constitution is contemplated. The course is descriptive of processes by which experienced results have been obtained, not speculative in advocacy of theoretic dreams. The Class is dependent on notes for the Lectures, as no text-book exists. History. Adjunct Professor Dabney. Class of General History.âIn this classâand, indeed, in the other alsoâgreat stress is laid on the view that the career of man, as revealed in History, is not a mere jumble of disconnected dates and facts, but a continuous stream, having its sources and tributaries in the far-off past, its outlet in the remote future. No attempt is made, however, to traverse in the class-room the entire length of this stream; for, although constant efforts are made to impress the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development, the lectures are confined to the more important periods, the student being required to fill the gaps by private reading in a manual of General History. The periods, and, therefore, the text-books studied, may be more or less varied each year. Three lectures a week. Text-books for 1890-'91.âFisher's Outlines of Universal History; Cox's The Greeks and the Persians; Curteis's Rise of the Macedonian Empire; Smith's Rome and Carthage; Merivale's Roman Triumvirates; Capes's Age of the Antonines; Bryce's Holy Roman Empire; Cox's Crusades; Fisher's History of the Reformation; Dabney's Causes of the French Revolution; Morris's French Revolution and First Empire. Class of English and American History.âIn this class the principles taught in the class of General History will be applied to a more special field. Such students, therefore, as have already completed the work in General History will derive most benefit from the course. It may be taken, however, by others; and, as considerable attention will be paid to constitutional development, it is thought that the course will be specially advantageous to first-year law students not applying for a degree. Three lectures a week. Text-books will be announced later. The Graduate Course in this school will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the accompanying social, political and intellectual development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render those pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Davis. There are two classes, best taken in two successive sessions: The Class in Logic studies Deductive Logic and Inductive Logic. Two lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Logic; Mill on Induction. The Class in Philosophy studies Psychology, Ethics, and History of Philosophy. Three lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Psychology; Janet's La Morale; Lotze's GrundsÃ¤tze der Praktischen Philosophie; Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. The Graduate Course embraces the History of Philosophy, ancient and modern, with a special study of Aristotle and Kant, and a course in Physiological Psychology.</field>

Candidates for graduation in Pure Mathematics are required to pursue in the University the studies of both the Intermediate and Senior Classes. II. Mixed Mathematics. This course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of Pure Mathematics. It embraces an extended course of reading under the instruction and guidance of the Professor on the applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Mechanics, Physical Astronomy, and selected portions of Physics. The class in Mixed Mathematics meets once a week. A diploma of graduation is conferred in Mixed Mathematics. Text-Books.âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vols. II and III; Cheyne's Planetary Theory. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The progress of the student in each class is tested constantly by his being called upon to apply the principles acquired to the independent solution of selected problems. The Graduate Course includes the course of Mixed Mathematics, with advanced studies in Modern Higher Geometry, Infinitesimal Calculus, and Higher Algebra. For those candidates for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy who select the Mathematics as their chief study, the graduate course will extend through two years. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Professor Stone. The courses in this school are arranged primarily for persons proposing to become practical astronomers. The course in General Astronomy, however, is adapted to those who desire to pursue the subject as a part of their general education; while the courses in Celestial Mechanics are recommended to graduate students in Mathematics. Each class meets twice a week. The courses pursued are as follows: I. General Astronomy.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts are permitted to select this course as an alternate for Mathematics. Its aim is to give such a knowledge of the facts, principles, and methods of Astronomy as every well-educated person should possess, and as will form a suitable introduction to the technical courses of the School. The preparation desirable is the same as that for Intermediate Mathematics. Text-book.âYoung's General Astronomy. II. Practical Astronomy, including a systematic training in making and reducing astronomical observations. Junior.âLeast Squares; Interpolation; Practical Astronomy as applied to Geodesy and Navigation. Senior.âTheory and use of the instruments of a fixed observatory; construction of star catalogues.

A prescribed course in this School, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, will be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates of these schools. The Astronomical Observatory is situated upon an elevation known as Mount Jefferson, which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda, forty-five feet in diameter, and contains the great Clark refractor of twenty-six-inch aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining, and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a three-inch Fauth transit and a four-inch Kahler equatorial. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Smith. This School includes two courses, as follows: I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with an introduction to Modern Physics, and to acquaint him with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of sensible masses. This discussion, while it is elementary, is designed to be in harmony with the more thorough mathematical treatment of the same topics and to be a helpful introduction to it. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the laws of energy are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Members of the Junior Class are admitted at suitable times to the Physical Laboratory, where they repeat and extend the experiments of the lecture-room. Such exercise is required of candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, but is optional with others. Experience shows that this privilege is highly valued and extensively used. Text-books for '91-'92.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For Reference.âAnthony and Brackett's Text-book of Physics; Glazebrook's Practical Physics; Atkinson's Ganot's Physics. Senior Class.âThis class studies selected portions of Elementary Mathematical Physics. The members of the class are required to spend about two months in the Physical Laboratory. Text-books for '91-'92.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Wave Motion; Preston's Theory of Light; Glazebrook's Practical Physics. Candidates for graduation in Natural Philosophy are required to attend only the foregoing classes. Class in Electricity and Magnetism.âAs a part of the studies of the third year in Mechanical Engineering, the Professor of Natural Philosophy conducts a class in the theory of Electricity and Magnetism, with especial reference to the measurements required in Electrical Engineering and to the applications of the theory to Dynamo-Electric Machines, Electric Lighting, and Electrical Transmission of power. The instruction is by lecture with associated laboratory exercises. Text-books for 1891-'92.âPeirce's Potential Function; Mascart and Joubert's Electricity and Magnetism. II. Practical Physics. This Graduate Course is for students preparing to become teachers of science, or desiring to push their studies in Physics beyond the limits of the under-graduate work. The instruction is partly theoretical and partly experimental, embracing the following topics: Theoretical.âReduction of observations; Method of Least Squares; Graphical representation of results; Interpolation; Essays on prescribed Physical topics. Experimental.âIn this, the main portion of the course, the student will learn physical manipulation, and the use of instruments by actual practice in the Physical Laboratory. (1.) Lecture-room Apparatus and Lecture-room Experiments. (2.) Physical Measurements and Instruments of Precision. Text-books.âMerriman's Method of Least Squares; Kohlrausch's Physical Measurements. The Physical Laboratory consists of four connected rooms, one of which is also used as a lecture-room. One of them is permanently darkened, and in two others the light may be excluded at pleasure. A fourth apartment is so supported on massive piers as to be practically insulated as regards sensible tremors. The needful appliances, in the way of fixtures and apparatus for physical experiment and research, have been so far supplied as to furnish ample opportunities in laboratory work for undergraduates, and valuable facilities for the advanced student in Practical Physics. SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School there are two courses, as follows: I. General Chemistry. This course consists of three lectures a week, throughout the session, to each of two classes, the one formed of the academic and the other of the medical students taking the course. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws regulating chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present viewed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the descriptive chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in medicine, the arts and manufactures, of the facts mentioned. Text-books.âFownes's Chemistry (last edition); Syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. Recommended for Reference.âRoscoe and Schorlemmer's (or Miller's) Elements of Chemistry; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. II. Industrial Chemistry. This course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which the development of the natural resources of the country in large measure depends, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar refiner, etc. Text-book.âWagner's Chemical Technology. Recommended for Reference.â Richardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Girardin's LÃ©Ã§ons de Chimie ÃlÃ©mentaire appliquÃ©e aux Arts Industriels; Percy's Metallurgy, etc. The lectures in both these courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France, and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. In the course of Chemistry for the degree of Bachelor of Arts the lectures on Chemical Physics may be omitted by the student. The Graduate Course will consist of laboratory work on subjects of original investigation. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. For admission to a graduate course in the School of General and Industrial Chemistry, or in the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. Professor Dunnington. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is arranged in two divisions, as follows: 1. A regularly-arranged course in Chemical Manipulation is first given. This is followed by Blowpipe Analysis and Fire Assays of ores of lead, silver and gold. A systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis follows, with practice in the analysis of mixtures of salts, alloys, ores, and so on. Instruction in the elements of Quantitative 4 Analysis completes this division of the course, which extends over the first half session. 2. The work of the second division is an extended course of Quantitative Analysis, both gravimetric and volumetric. The student determines the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, manures, technical products, and so on. As he advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assisted in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this sort is considered as having great weight. Five lessons are given each week, and the Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the Full Course or for the First Course; but candidates for graduation are required to complete the Full Course. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis; Greville Williams's Hand-Book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-Book of Mineralogy; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. In addition to the foregoing the following Special Courses are given in this School. They are open without additional charge to the regular students of the School. For fees to others, see Expenses. 1. A laboratory course on Determinative Mineralogy for students of Engineering, embracing Blowpipe Analysis, Determinative Mineralogy, and the application of chemical processes to the examination of potable waters, coal, clays, building-stones, and other materials employed in Engineering. 2. A laboratory course in Assaying including all of the above-mentioned course on determinative mineralogy together with Fire Assaying of ores of lead, silver, gold, etc., and practice in volumetric and galvanic determinations, such as are commonly employed in the valuation of certain technical products and ores. 3. A laboratory course of twelve lessons in Practical Pharmacy, including the compounding and dispensing of drugs. 4. A lecture course of twenty-four lessons on Agricultural Chemistry, including the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life; the chemical composition and preparation of manures, and so on. This course is open without charge to farmers. For Reference.âJohnston's and Cameron's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology (12th ed.); Johnson's How Crops Grow; Johnson's How Crops Feed. The Graduate Course comprises practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, study of methods, and original investigations in the composition of rare minerals and technical products presenting scientific or economic interest. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc. and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. The Museum of Industrial Chemistry, contained in the same building, consists of a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country and abroad, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. In this School there are two regular classesâGeology and Mineralogy. Geology.âThis subject is taught during the entire session, and three lectures a week are devoted to it until the examination in Mineralogy, which takes place usually in the latter part of February; thereafter five lectures a week are given to Geology until the final examination, which takes place late in April. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Text-book.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology. For ReferenceâDana's Manual and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. The teaching is chiefly by lecture. Mineralogy.âThis subject is studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures a week are devoted to it. Special attention is paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy, the geological occurrence, and the importance and relations of the species are made prominent. Text-book.âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For Reference.â Dana's Text-book of Mineralogy. The teaching is chiefly by lecture. In the Graduate Course of this School subjects will be selected from one or both of the branches included in the School, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc.; the general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.; the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully-selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing graduate courses of study in Geology and Mineralogy. The Professor, when the number of applicants is sufficient, organizes a party for Geological exploration. The field work is done in the month of July, and is entirely optional with the students. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy may, although not members of the University class, with the consent of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Professor Tuttle. The work of this School is specially designed to meet the wants of two classes of studentsâthose who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of Biology to Agriculture, as well as of the principles of Agriculture regarded as a practical application of biological knowledge; and those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology and the methods of biological research as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge. There are four regular classes, each with two lectures a week and associated laboratory work throughout the session, as follows: Botany.âIn this course the anatomy and histology of plants, the elements of vegetable physiology, and the principles of morphology and classification are successively studied. Special attention is paid to the study of Fungi and Bacteria, and to the flora of the region. Text-books.âBessey's Botany; Gray's Manual. Zoology.âThe anatomy, histology, and embryology (together with the morphological relations indicated thereby) of a series of representative animals chosen from the principal divisions of the animal kingdom will be studied, with particular attention, as far as time will permit, to the Insects and other groups of economic importance. Text-books.âBrooks's Hand-book of Invertebrate Zoology; Sedgwick's Translation of Claus's Zoology. Comparative Anatomy.âThis course is devoted to the Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology of Vertebrates, one or more systems of organs being specially discussed and examined comparatively both in the adult and the developing organism, and the normal histology of man and of the domestic mammals being studied in detail. Text-books.âWiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates; Stirling's Practical Histology; Foster and Balfour's Embryology. Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly; in each case including the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the diseases or the parasites of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic Zoology (including such subjects as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of the growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). Text-books for 1891-'92.âSmith's Diseases of Field and Garden Crops; Ward's Timber and its Diseases; Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals; Tanner's Principles of Agriculture. Graduate Work will consist of original investigations of Biological Problems of practical or scientific interest, under the direction of the Professor. Subjects of research will be assigned to each student individually. The Biological Laboratory is well provided with instruments for the gross and minute dissection of animals and plants; microscopes, microtomes, reagents, and materials for the staining and mounting of preparations; apparatus for photography and microphotography, and other necessary appliances, not only for student work, but for investigation and research as well. In addition to the large and valuable collections of the Brooks Museum, an abundant supply of other necessary specimens and material is furnished. A library of reference is attached to the Laboratory, and students have access to a number of leading biological and agricultural journals, thus acquiring practice in the intelligent use of current literature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. JAMES H. GILMORE, LL. D., Professor of Constitutional and International Law, Equity, etc. JOHN B. MINOR, Jr., B. L., Instructor in Law. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of instruction is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Professor Minor. Junior Class.âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I. The Rights which relate to the Person. Vol. II. The Rights which relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Blackstone's Commentaries. Senior Class.âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV. The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III. The Rights which relate to Personal Property. Stephen on Pleading. For Reference: Virginia Code (1887); Revised Statutes of the United States. SCHOOL OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, MERCANTILE LAW, EVIDENCE, AND EQUITY. Professor Gilmore. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, with Lectures; Lectures on Government; Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams's Equity, with Lectures. For Reference: Stephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence (Chase's edition preferred). DEGREE. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, including the science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the course must be completed here, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. But a candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Law, who in a previous session has become a Proficient in Constitutional and International Law, is not required to stand examination in this subject anew. All other examinations must be passed in the year of graduation. COURSE OF STUDY. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less time to it, the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest, as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa-constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete should imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, not to attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully) he is admitted to the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to the degree. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the Law Department for the session of nine months are estimated as below for the lowest rate and for a more liberal scale of living. Tuition $80 $80 Matriculation 25 25 Infirmary 7 7 Contingent deposit 10 10 Dormitory rent 15 30 Servant's attendance 9 9 Furniture for dormitory 9 19 Fuel and lights 12 24 Washing 14 14 Board 99 162 Total $280 $380 Payable on entrance $180 $220 The contingent deposit of $10 is credited in final settlement. This deposit is assessed for any damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on, which the student himself may commit. To the above total must be added the cost of books and stationery, about $80 for the entire course, and the cost of a degree which, if taken, is $15. For the entire course, if taken in one year, the total necessary expenses, including books, will be $360 to $460, with the addition of $15 for the degree, if the degree is taken. For a second year's entire course the total necessary expenses (books having been already provided) will be $280 to $380, with the addition of $15 for the degree, if the degree is taken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., Professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica. WILLIAM C. DABNEY, M. D., Professor of Practice of Medicine. PAUL B. BARRINGER, M. D., Professor of Physiology and Surgery. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Physics. ALBERT H. TUTTLE, M. S., Professor of Biology. WILLIAM G. CHRISTIAN, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. HAMILTON P. HOWARD, M. D., Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy. HUGH T. NELSON, M. D., Instructor in Clinical Surgery. REUBEN M. SEARCY, A. B., Instructor in Chemistry. HALSTEAD S. HEDGES, B. S., M. A., Instructor in Biology. COURSES OF STUDY IN GENERAL. The session of the Medical Department continues through the full nine months of the University session. This arrangement enables the above professors and instructors to do thoroughly the work which is often allotted to a larger number in institutions whose session is much shorter. The importance of acquiring a knowledge of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physiology, before commencing the study of the more practical branches, is fully recognized; and the course of study is so arranged that during the first half-session the instruction is in these important elementary branches. During the same time the subjects of Medical Jurisprudence and Obstetrics, especially the mechanical features of the latter branch, are studied by the class. The courses and methods of instruction in the several Schools of the Department are as follows: SCHOOL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School the students are taught Chemical Physics and the principles of Chemistry; and their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to the practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology and Sanitary Science. Text-books.âFownes's Chemistry, Syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. For Reference.âCharles's Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. SCHOOL OF ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Towles. Anatomy.âThe instruction in Descriptive, Surgical and Topographical Anatomy is given by didactic lectures combined with the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; scarcely a statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on the actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection, the effort being to convey knowledge in the so-called natural methodâthat is, by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the School for this purpose is most ample; and in addition to the numerous preparations and dissections, there are models and anatomical paintings representing the greater part of the anatomy of the body. For the course in Practical Anatomy, dissecting material obtained under the permissive law of the State is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Each medical student, however many sessions he may have attended, is required to dissect under the constant and careful supervision of the Demonstrator. Attendance in the dissecting-room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the oral examination which precedes each lecture, and the other examinations to be mentioned hereafter, each student is required to stand eight practical examinationsâone upon osteology, one upon the ligaments, four upon different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being examined alone. They consist of the identification of the truths of anatomy on the bones, the cadaver, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of the student's acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body. Materia Medica and Therapeutics.âThe lectures on Materia Medica occur in the latter half of the session, after the student has obtained the knowledge of the primary branches prerequisite to the proper understanding of the subject. Particular stress is laid upon physiological action and rational therapeutical application of drugs. The physical properties of drugs are taught by requiring the student to learn them from specimens, a complete collection being provided, which contains specimens both of all the crude drugs and of all their preparations, which have been dealt with in the lectures. Text-books.âBruce's Materia Medica and Therapeutics; United States PharmacopÅia, or Index of Materia Medica. The student should provide himself, if possible, with specimens of all the bones. SCHOOL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Professor Barringer. In Physiology the course is introduced by a series of outline lectures on Histology, before the consideration of Physiology proper is begun. The entire work of the School is designed with especial reference to its practical bearings on the subsequent study of Pathology and Therapeutics. The lectures on Embryology are not given until students are well advanced in Anatomy, and can, therefore, more fully appreciate their bearings. In the elucidation of these subjects, the large collection of plates belonging to the Department is supplemented by original preparations and models. In the Physiological Laboratory the students in sections of twelve are given daily instruction for four months in practical Histology in addition to the lecture course. Each student is thus able during the session to become familiar with the usual histological and pathological forms, as well as the ordinary working of the microscope, section-cutting, staining, etc. Text-books.âLandois's Physiology, Stirling's Histology. In Hygiene the chemical and bacterial contamination of water, food, air and soil first engages the attention of the student. With these facts before him he next takes up the natural history of the contagious and infectious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, barracks, etc., stress being laid upon the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Text-book.âRohe's Text-book of Hygiene. In Surgery the first aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles and technique of modern aseptic surgical procedure. Especial attention is then given to the causation and pathology of the various surgical affections. All amputations and ligations are shown upon the cadaver, and the lectures are illustrated by numerous paintings and morbid specimens. The application of splints, bandages, and apparatus for different fractures is taught to the class in sections. Text-books.âRoberts's Modern Surgery, Ziegler's Pathology, Senn's Principles of Surgery. SCHOOL OF PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Dabney. In this School are taught Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and Practice of Medicine. In Medical Jurisprudence the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and is taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained and illustrated by the use of suitable preparations and models. The student is drilled in this part of the subject during the early part of the course, and attention is subsequently called to the diseases and accidents incident to pregnancy and the puerperal state. Each student is also taught practically the various manipulations, both manual and instrumental. In Practice of Medicine especial attention is given to the principles of the subject, the aim being to instruct the students as thoroughly as possible in the causation of diseases and the morbid changes which occur in the different tissues. The lectures are illustrated by morbid specimens, both coarse and microscopic, and each student has the opportunity of examining the specimens for himself. Each student furthermore is taught the method of making a physical examination of a patient, and is required to learn, by actual examination, under the supervision of the Professor, the normal appearances and sounds in the different regions of the body and over the different organs. Classes have also been established in Practical Microscopy and Pathology. Attendance is optional, but the desire to make good use of the opportunity thus offered seems to be general. Each student is taught practically how to use the microscope, to cut and stain sections of tissues, to examine urine and blood, etc. In addition to a knowledge of microscopic manipulation thus obtained, it is found that students can get a far clearer idea of morbid anatomy and pathology in this way. Text-books.âReese's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology; Playfair's Midwifery (last edition); StrÃ¼mpell's Practice of Medicine; Page's Physical Diagnosis; Green's Pathology; Lewer's Diseases of Women. CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. A Free Dispensary and Hospital are now in operation near the University, in which the students are taught the methods of examining patients and the changes which occur in the normal functions of the body as a result of disease. In recognition of the impossibility of giving practical instruction by the ordinary clinical lectures, the class is divided into sections, so that each student may have the opportunity of examining patients for himself, under the guidance of the Professor. In addition to the patients who come to the Dispensary, others who are too sick to attend are visited at their homes. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. The instruction is given by systematic lectures, daily oral and periodical written examinations, with associated practical work in Anatomy, Histology, and Pathology. The daily oral examinations on the subject of the previous lecture are of great value in stimulating the student to regular and systematic habits of study, and furnishing the Professor an opportunity of discovering and removing the difficulties met with by the student. The Intermediate written examinations demand frequent and careful reviews, and familiarize the class with the form of the Final or graduating examinations, which are also in writing and of a rigorous character. Besides these examinations, there is a general oral review at the close of the session on all the different branches on which the student has graduated during either that session or some preceding one; this is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. This oral review has been found serviceable also in preparing students more thoroughly for the State examinations in Virginia, and the other States which hold such examinations, as well as for entrance into the Medical Corps of the Army and Navy and the Marine Hospital. EXPENSES. The separate fees charged when students pursue an elective, instead of the regular, course are as follows: Chemistry $25 Anatomy 30* Materia Medica 15 Physiology 20 Medical Jurisprudence 15 Anatomy and Materia Medica 35* Physiology and Surgery 25 Practice of Medicine 25 Medical Biology 25* Medical Physics 10 Practical Pharmacy 20* The courses marked with * include the charge for laboratory material. The necessary expenses of a student in the Medical Department for the session of nine months are estimated as below, both for the lowest rate of living and for a more liberal expenditure: Tuition (including fee for dissection) $110 $110 Matriculation 25 25 Infirmary fee 7 7 Contingent deposit 10 10 Dormitory rent 15 30 Servant's attendance 9 9 Furniture for dormitory 9 19 Fuel and lights 12 24 Washing 14 14 Board 99 162 Total necessary expenses $310 $410 Payable on entrance $210 $250 The contingent deposit of $10 is credited in final settlement. This deposit is assessed for any damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on, which the student himself may commit. To the above total must be added the cost of books, stationery, and dissecting instruments, about $45 for the entire course, and the cost of a degree, which, if taken, is $15. The books purchased will be of permanent value to the student as a part of his professional library. For the entire course, if taken in one year, the necessary expenses, including books, will be $355 to $455, according to the price paid for board, with the addition of $15 for the degree, if the degree is taken. PREPARATORY COURSE FOR STUDENTS OF MEDICINE. Graduation in Medicine, as in other departments of the University of Virginia, does not depend upon the time which has been spent in the study of Medicine, but upon the preparation of the student as indicated by rigid written examinations which he is required to pass. It is possible, therefore, for a well-prepared and laborious student to graduate in one session, and examples are not wanting where such graduates have attained conspicuous success in professional life. But the severe and protracted labor necessary for this purpose is attended with evils of which the Medical Faculty is fully conscious. And while the regular course is complete as far as professional studies are concerned, it leaves the student without the benefit of certain scientific studies, which furnish an admirable preparation for and enlargement of the strictly professional course. Students are therefore advised to devote two sessions to the work; and for the benefit of those who can afford the time to pursue them special courses in Biology and Physics have been arranged with particular regard to the training needed for Medical studies. This first year of preparatory work will comprehendâ 1. The course in General Chemistry attended by all medical students. 2. A special course in Physics. 3. A special course in Biology. 4. The course in Anatomy required of all medical students. The expenses of the student in this course will be the same as for a regular student of medicine, except for tuition, which will be $90, inclusive of laboratory fees. Those who are graduated in this preparatory course will attend for the second session: 1. The regular course in Physiology and Surgery. 2. The regular courses in Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics and Practice of Medicine. 3. The course in Materia Medica. 4. The regular course in Practical Anatomy. The expenses of a student in the second year course will be the same as for a regular student of medicine, except for tuition, which will be $75, inclusive of laboratory fees. SPECIAL COURSE OF PHYSICS FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. In connection with the studies of the first year of those medical students who elect to pursue the two-year medical course, a series of about fourteen lectures is offered in Physics. These lectures deal with the measurement of physical quantities, and the laws of energy, as illustrated in mechanical processes. Attention is also given to the theory of simple machines, as illustrated in the human frame, and bearing on various forms of surgical apparatus. SPECIAL COURSE IN BIOLOGY FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. This course comprises those portions of the course in Comparative Anatomy and Histology which deal especially with normal Histology and with Embryology, and that part of the course in Botany, which deals with the Bacteria and allied organisms. The lectures are ac companied throughout the course by systematic practical instruction in the laboratory. SCHEME OF LECTURES. 9â10Â½ 11â12Â½ 12Â½â2 3â4Â½ Monday Dr. Barringer. Mr. Searcy.

      <field name="fulltext">EXAMINATIONS. The regulations of the University require that at each meeting the Professors shall examine the class on the subject matter of the previous lecture before beginning the new lecture. Besides this daily oral examination, two general written examinations of each class are held during the session, which every member is required to stand. The Intermediate Examination occurs near the middle of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the first part of the course. The Final Examination occurs near the end of the session, and is in some classes upon the subjects of instruction of the second part of the course only, in others upon those of the entire course. In these examinations the questions have numerical values affixed. If the answers at any general examination amount in value to three-fourths of the aggregate value of the questions, a certificate of Distinction is awarded to the student, and the fact is published at the close of the session. Examinations for Proficiency or for Graduation coincide with the Intermediate and Final Examinations. The written examinations are conducted in each School by the Professor, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the Committee of Examination for that School. They are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for a student, without steady diligence, to attain a Distinction, and candidates for Proficiency or for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures and correlative text. Moreover, the student's command of English and his standing at both daily and general examinations are taken into account in estimating his qualification for the certificate or diploma. No special examination is granted except upon a physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other like cause which the Faculty may accept as adequate ground. No entrance examination is required except for Academical students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirements for these examinations are stated elsewhere. Candidates for admission to the higher classes in the several Schools are expected to exhibit to the Professors suitable evidences of adequate preliminary training.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PHYSICAL CULTURE. John S. Hitchcock, A. B., Instructor The work, under the personal supervision of the Instructor, consists of: I. Class Exercise with light (wooden) dumb-bells. II. Class Drill with chest weights. III. Class Exercise with Indian clubs. Each student is examined physically and measured at least once a year. On the basis of this examination a hand-book of developing exercises is made out and given to him, with exercises marked that are adapted to his individual needs. The concurrent judgment of all authorities on Physical Culture is that the true aim of gymnastic exercise should be to develop not athletes, but sound men; not to encourage professionalism in athletic sports, but to make them a means by which a healthy development of mind and body is secured. Therefore, such exercises are given as will increase the respiration, quicken the circulation of the blood, stimulate the abdominal viscera, and make the muscles and limbs elastic. In this way, and in this way only, the gymnasium and physical exercise become valuable and necessary factors in education. The appliances for Physical Culture consist of the Squibb Gymnasium, with its apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, and the Rives Boat-House, with a number of boats and appliances for rowing. In addition, ample space has been provided for out-door sports. A running-track, a base-ball and foot-ball field, and numerous tennis-courts have been laid out; and the grounds will be brought each year into a better state of improvement. The subject of Athletics is under the general control of a Committee of the Faculty, and under the special direction of the Students' Athletic Association, which appoints boards of directors for Foot-Ball, Base-Ball, Tennis, Track-Athletics, Rowing, etc. The Instructor in Physical Culture will give help and information to students training for any of the athletic contests.

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENTS FROM VIRGINIA. In compliance with the Statute (Virginia Code 1887, ch. 68, Â§ 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia over the age of sixteen years instruction without charge for tuition in all the Academical Schools, except the Laboratory courses in Chemistry and Practical Physics. The total University fees of an Academical Student from Virginia are only $47; his necessary expenses amount to but $200, exclusive of books and stationery; of this about $100 must be paid on entrance. The Faculty are required by law to be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in the branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages afforded by the University. Examinations for admission are required as follows: 1. For admission to the School of Latin, on forms, syntax and Books i., ii. of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Cataline. 2. For admission to the School of Greek, on forms, syntax and Books i., ii. of Xenophon's Anabasis. 3. For admission to the School of Mathematics or Natural Philosophy, on Arithmetic, Plane Geometry and Algebra through quadratics. For admission to the other Schools a good knowledge of English and Arithmetic is alone required. The diploma of a college, or the certificate of a high school, has appropriate weight with the examiners. White male teachers and superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academical Department of the University without payment of fees. Applicants will present certificates from the State Superintendent, or from their respective County Superintendents, that they have been teachers or superintendents in the Public Schools. Applicants for admission are requested to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 25th. University dormitories will be assigned, free of rent, in the order of the application, as far as the vacant rooms will serve. Lodgings can also be had near the University, or in Charlottesville. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights and washing, which will together cost from $3.50 to $5.50 a week. For further information address the Chairman of the Faculty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven University Scholarships are open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the academic year (October 1st); five are in the Academical Department and two each in the Departments of Law, Medicine, and Engineering. The scholarship awards are based upon a competitive examination held during the first week of the session, embracing the elements of English Grammar, Composition and Rhetoric, and the work of the Junior Classes in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics. The right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach a standard of three-fourths. The emoluments are free tuition and matriculation. The value of one of these scholarships to the successful competitor is in the Academical Department $100 to $150, in Law $105, in Medicine $125, in Engineering $125. The subjects assigned for examination in October, 1891, are as follows: English.âSwinton's Grammar and Composition; Hart's Rhetoric, or equivalents. Greek.âXenophon's Memorabilia, Books i. and ii.; Lysias, Against Eratosthenes; Grammar and Composition. Latin.âLivy, Books i. and ii.; Cicero, Against Catiline; Grammar and Composition. Mathematics.âAlgebra through the Binomial Theorem; Plane and Solid Geometry, Venable's Legendre, with exercises, or an equivalent; Plane Trigonometry, Todhunter's Trigonometry for Beginners, or an equivalent. The University scholars in 1890-'91 were R. E. Lee Dinwiddie, of Virginia; John C. Futrall, of Arkansas; and Hugh H. Young, of Texas. The Miller Scholarship, established in honor of the founder of the Agricultural Department, is awarded at the end of the session upon a competitive examination embracing the subjects of the first year's course in Agriculture. The emoluments are $250 and free tuition in the Schools of the Agricultural Department. The Miller scholar in 1890-'91 was John D. Tinsley, of Virginia (prepared at Miller School). The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. McCormick. The emoluments are free tuition and matriculation. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by the founder. The Isaac Carey Scholarships are awarded by the Carey Trustees. The Birely Scholarship founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Md., is awarded by the Visitors to some student from the State of Maryland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOCIETIES OF STUDENTS. Literary Societies.âThere are two Literary Societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Societyâconnected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session and at its close. The two Societies jointly maintain the University Magazine, and annually invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them in the Public Hall at the close of the session. In each Society medals are givenâone to the best debater, another to the best orator, and a third medal is awarded for the best original contribution to the University Magazine by a member of either Society. Temperance Union.âThis association does good service in guarding students against dissipation, promotes literary culture by meetings for debate, and offers valuable prizes to its best debaters and orators. Young Men's Christian Association.âThis society seeks to guard new students from evil influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It is the oldest of the College Associations, having been established in 1858, and has been in active operation ever since. It conducts several Sunday Schools in the neighborhood of the University, co-operates with the Chaplain in the maintenance of religious services, secures periodical public lectures and sermons, and directs the Students' Reading-Room. Students' Reading-Room.âThis is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $2 to meet its current expenses. In their hours of recreation the students are thus enabled to make themselves acquainted with the best expressions of current thought on various questions of letters and science which arise in their University work. MEDALISTS. 1889-'90. Edward L. Boyle, of Tennessee, Orator of Jefferson Society. Patrick H. C. Cabell, of Virginia, Debater of Jefferson Society. H. Snowden Marshall, of Maryland, University Magazine Medalist. George N. Conrad, of Virginia, Orator of Washington Society. R. Mack Banks, Jr., of Mississippi, Debater of Washington Society.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. ADMISSION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. DORMITORIES. Any student is permitted to reserve, for the next session, the dormitory which he occupies if he applies for it before the end of the current session. Thereafter any unreserved dormitory can be engaged upon application to the Proctor. But if the rent be not deposited with him before the 15th day of September, the room is considered unengaged. BOARDING-HOUSES. A student who boards at a University Hotel may change his boarding-house at the end of any month upon application to the Chairman. NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. An academical student must attend at least three Schools, unless upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend a less number. EXCHANGE OF SCHOOLS. Students are permitted to exchange Schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission. Thereafter no exchange is allowed except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. WITHDRAWAL FROM A SCHOOL. No student can drop a class in a School without the permission of the Professor of that School. Nor can he give up any School without the permission of the Faculty. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY. No portion of a student's University fees is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health. ABSENCE FROM LECTURE. A student is not permitted to absent himself from any lecture or examination without valid excuse, nor from the University without special leave from the Chairman, countersigned by his Professors. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of each month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such other information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may especially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of the reports greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest or prompt in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They strictly forbid drunkenness, gaming, dissoluteness, swearing, habits of expense, and the introduction of wine or other intoxicating drinks into the University. They require a decorous observance of Sunday, and forbid all outdoor sports on that day. They forbid the use or possession by a student of pistols or other weapons, and the introduction of them into the University precincts. EXCLUSION OF A STUDENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY. If in the opinion of the Faculty any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defence. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An Act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an Act of the Legislature, "any person may deposit in the treasury of the State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited . . . for the benefit of the University of Virginia. . . . The State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safe-keeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." LEGAL TITLE OF THE UNIVERSITY: "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia."</field>

Endowment of Professorships and Scholarships through the Society of Alumni.âUnder an Act of the Legislature, entitled "A Bill to incorporate the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia," this Society is authorized by the Executive Committee, or in such other way as it may direct, "to raise the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be held in the name of the `Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia,' to be safely invested, and the net annual income therefrom to be applied to the benefit of the University of Virginia." It is also empowered "to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, to solicit donations, to dispose of anything of value belonging to the Society or entrusted to its management for the purpose of endowing professorships, or for accomplishing any of the other objects of the Society authorized by its charter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL NOTE. The University of Virginia grew out of the plan for a local academy which had been chartered in 1803. In 1814 Thomas Jefferson was made one of the trustees. In 1815 he drafted the bill for the expansion of the Academy into Central College. In 1816 he procured the passage of the act establishing the College, and was made one of the Visitors. In 1817 the corner-stone of the first pavilion was laid, the scene being "graced by the presence of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, late Presidents of the United States, and of James Monroe, the actual President." On January 6, 1818, Jefferson forwarded to the Speaker of the House of Delegates a report on the condition of Central College drawn up by himself as Rector, in which, upon the authority of the Visitors, he offers to transfer the property and rights of Central College to the Legislature as the foundation for a State University. The property consisted of 200 acres of land, the partially completed buildings, and a subscription list which showed a total of over $44,000. On February 21, 1818, a bill was passed, one clause of which made an annual appropriation of $15,000 for a University, "wherein all the branches of useful science were to be taught." The Governor of the State was authorized to appoint a Board of Commissioners who should report to the next session of the Legislature on the site, the plan, the organization, and the system of government of the new University. On August 1, 1818, "at the tavern in Rockfish Gap" the Commissioners assembled in a room which now forms a part of the Mountain Top Hotel. Jefferson was elected president of the Commission, and was "the soul that animated it." By ingenious demonstrations of the central and healthful location of Charlottesville, he secured the University for its present site against the rival claims of Staunton and of Lexington, and the report of the Commissioners was manifestly from his hand. After an active struggle in the Legislature the bill establishing Central College as the University of Virginia passed both houses by large majorities, and on January 25, 1819, became a law. The next six years were spent by the Visitors in erecting buildings, purchasing a library, and collecting a Faculty, and it was not until March 5, 1825, that the University was opened with six professors and forty students. Soon after the two remaining professors arrived, and by the end of the first session, Christmas 1825, there were eight professors and one hundred and twenty-three students. The original Faculty consisted of George Long in Ancient Languages, George BlÃ¦ttermann in Modern Languages, George Tucker in Moral Philosophy, Thomas Hewitt Key in Mathematics, Charles Bonnycastle in Natural Philosophy, John Patten Emmet in Natural History, Robley Dunglison in Medicine, and John Tayloe Lomax in Law. The subsequent history of the University is a record of steady growth and expansion, a regular and normal development of the educational principles of the founder. New Schools have been created, the equipment has been enlarged, and new lines of work from year to year established. In the Academical Department the Schools of Greek and Latin were separated in 1856; the School of Historical Science was founded in 1857; the School of Biology and Agriculture in 1872; the School of Geology and Mineralogy in 1879; the School of English in 1882; the Adjunct Professorship of French and German was created in 1888, and that of General History in the same year. In the Department of Law the School of Constitutional and International Law was founded in 1851. In the Department of Medicine the School of Anatomy was founded in 1827; that of Physiology in 1849. In the Department of Engineering the Schools of Applied Mathematics and Analytical Chemistry were founded in 1867.</field>
