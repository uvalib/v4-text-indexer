      <field name="fulltext">vii FOREWORD This First Part of Volume Three completes the translation of the Former Han "Imperial Annals". Part Two will continue the history of those times by presenting a translation of "The Memoir of Wang Mang". The period covered by the two parts is that when Wang Mang first became important and later dominated China. This imperial maternal relative began to affect the government some thirty years before he came to the throne, so that the reigns of the last two Former Han emperors belong to his period. A translation of their "Annals" would be seriously incomplete without the parallel and subsequent account of Wang Mang's life and reign. By including that chapter, the history of China is continued to the beginning of the Later Han period. To the many persons who have given me assistance and advice in this work I here tender my heartiest thanks. In the notes I have tried to mention those to whom I am indebted, but many, who have contributed incidental suggestions, could not be named for lack of space. More than to anyone else, I am indebted to Professor J. J. L. Duyvendak. He has patiently gone over the whole material and has given me the benefit of his profound knowledge. To him I owe many apt renderings and corrections. My Chinese collaborator, Mr. L. C. P'an, worked with me for two years and a summer while a student in the United States. I owe much to his patient industry and aid. Next to them I am indebted to Mr. Piet van der Loon, who, during the hard winter of 1944-45 in Holland and the subsequent year, worked over the chapter on Wang Mang together with an unrevised typescript of this translation and furnished me with a volume containing 360 remarks on as many passages. Dr. Duyvendak, at whose suggestion he engaged in this task, furthermore furnished me with his comments upon Mr. van der Loon's work. Many of these corrections constituted improvements that I have thankfully adopted. I have been fortunate in my friends and have tried to welcome criticisms, adverse ones even more than favorable ones, from whatever source they have come. As far as possible without unduly burdening the notes with names, I have indicated the sources of any substantial aid. For the rest, I can only express here my deep gratitude to all those who have helped me. The correct translation of a difficult Chinese text can only be achieved by the cooperation of many mindsâhere two heads are better than one and three are better than two. To the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the American Council of Learned Societies I owe the financial assistance without which this work would have been impossible. Duke University, through its Research viiiFOREWORD Council, has made grants for the purchase of needed books and for the clerical assistance. The Committee on Chinese Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies has aided substantially in the publication of this book. To the Library of Congress and to Dr. A. W. Hummel, Chief of its Division of Orientalia, I am indebted for the use of its facilities and for advice and encouragement. I have however not hesitated to exercise my own judgment upon all the suggestions offered me, so that I alone must bear the blame for any errors in this volume. The Chinese text for chapters XCIX and XXIV was written out by Mr. John T. Find, Arlington, Virginia. Homer H. Dubs University College Oxford, England April, 1948</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1 THE HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY CHAPTER XI EMPEROR HSIAO-AI INTRODUCTION Summary of the period The short reign of Emperor Ai (7-1 B.C.) constituted a temporary eclipse to the power of the Wang clan and Wang Mang. The Emperor himself, a sickly young man, attempted to imitate the "strong" government of Emperor Wu, but only succeeded in becoming a tool, first of his grandmother and then of his favorite's family. As a result of the Emperor's attempt to rule in person, the period is full of intrigues: concerning the maternal relatives of the Emperor, concerning a certain revelation, and concerning Tung Hsien2a. Attention is centered in the court; external events continued to be uneventful. The influence of Han Confucianism, which reached its apogee in the reign of Wang Mang, continued to grow. This introduction will deal with the events and forces necessary to understand the background of this chapter, matters which are not explained in the chapter itself (for further details, cf. the Onomasticon and Glossary). It, like the other imperial annals, is rather a chronological summary than what occidentals would call a history. The intrigues of Emperor Ai's various maternal relatives The reign of Emperor Ch'eng had fixed, as a dynastic practise, the Confucian principle of favoring imperial relatives (11: 4b). Relatives on the paternal side, who were potential rivals for the imperial throne, were given kingdoms or marquisates and were carefully watched. When Emperor Ai was continually ill, the Queen of King Yang of Tung-p'ing, Liu YÃ¼n2a, an imperial fourth cousin, who was descended from Emperor HsÃ¼an, was discovered to have made magical imprecations against the Emperor, with the purpose of bringing her husband to the imperial throne. She, her husband, and her uncle (who was an imperial physician) were executed and the informers were ennobled. Imperial paternal relatives, who might benefit from any harm done to the imperial person, were ordinarily kept away from the court and drastically repressed. The imperial power was thus left to the imperial maternal relatives. Emperor Ai had however four sets of maternal relatives. The Wang clan's power rested upon the fact that the mother of Emperor Ch'eng, 2CHAPTER XI now entitled the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang, was still alive. She was the Emperor's adoptive grandmother and the head of the imperial clan. Due to her influence, Wang Mang had been put in charge of the government as Comander-in-chief just five months before Emperor Ch'eng had died. The Chao clan owed its influence to Emperor Ch'eng's second wife, the famous Chao Fei-yen. Emperor Ai had nominally been made the son of Emperor Ch'eng; this lady was consequently the Emperor's adoptive mother and was now made the Empress Dowager. Her relatives were given noble titles and positions. Emperor Ai had in addition his own maternal relatives. His grandmother, the former imperial Brilliant Companion, now the Queen Dowager nee Fu, had been Emperor YÃ¼an's favorite, and her son, Liu K'ang1a, had become the King of Ting-t'ao. His son, Liu Hsin5, now Emperor Ai, had been born of a Concubine nee Ting, so that there was also a Ting clan. The Fu and Ting clans, because they were out of the court, worked together, opposing the Wang clan, which had entrenched itself in the court. Thus the situation was ripe for abundant jealousies and intrigues. The Chao clan was quickly eliminated. Within half a year, an industrious Director of the Retainers dug up the facts about Emperor Ch'eng's imperial infanticides (cf. HFHD, II, 369-72), which were due to Chao Fei-yen's younger sister. This sister had previously committed suicide, but, when the facts became known, they occasioned such a revulsion that her male relatives were all dismissed from their positions and titles and were exiled. Because of Emperor Ai's debt to the Empress Dowager nee Chao, she was not touched and retained her title. Without any male relatives in the court, she was helpless. Before his death, Emperor Ch'eng had endeavored to prevent any conflict between the various clans among the maternal relatives of his successor by separating Liu Hsin5, the future Emperor Ai, from his own family and restricting him to intercourse with the imperial family. Emperor Ch'eng appointed Lin Ching3b, another descendant of Emperor HsÃ¼an, as the King of Ting-t'ao, to be the successor of Emperor Ai's father, so that the new Emperor would not have any further obligation to his natural father's clan. When Liu Hsin5 came to the capital as the Imperial Heir-apparent, Emperor Ch'eng separated him from his actual grandmother and mother, establishing them in the Lodge for the Princes of Ting-t'ao, while Liu Hsin5 went to the Heir-apparent's palace. (We may perhaps see Wang Mang's hand in these moves.) Emperor Ch'eng was not even going to allow them to see Liu Hsin5, but the Empress Dowager nee Wang reminded her son that Liu Hsin5 had been reared by his grandmother, so that the Queen Dowager should have the privileges 3INTRODUCTION given a nurse. She was accordingly allowed to visit her grandson every ten days. The Queen Dowager nee Fu was an indomitable and high-tempered woman, who would not easily yield up her opportunity for power and prestige. She was capable in intrigue and had previously almost succeeded in having her son, Liu K'ang1a, made the Imperial Heir-apparent in place of Emperor Ch'eng. She had taken her grandson away from his mother and had raised him herself, teaching and directing him, thus acquiring an ascendancy over him. She had paid large bribes to the Wang and Chao clans, in order that her grandson should be preferred as Heir-apparent over his cousin. Now she was not willing to lose the opportunity of reaping her reward. After Emperor Ch'eng's death, the future Emperor Ai found himself without anyone in the court upon whom he could rely. It was filled with the adherents of the Wang and Chao clans. Four days before he took the throne, his maternal uncle, Ting Ming, and his maternal great-uncle, Fu4 Yen, were enfeoffed as marquises. These ceremonies were performed by the Queen Dowager nee Fu, who had no real authority to do so (97 B: 20a). Since however these appointments would have been made anyway, this illegality was not challenged, although there was some disapproval of the Fu clan's greediness. Probably the Queen Dowager felt these appointments were essential, in order that the new Emperor would not be left without aid in the court; for an Emperor, without any courtiers to recommend what he wanted done, would be helpless. The visits of his grandmother were still limited to once every ten days, and his mother was also allowed to make such visits. The two ladies were established in Kuei Palace, in another part of the city, two miles distant. This palace was however connected by a private elevated passageway with Wei-yang Palace (where the Emperor lived), so that it was possible to go from one to the other without making a formal royal progress. The Queen Dowager nee Fu accordingly went morning and evening by this elevated passageway to the Emperor, instructing and advising him. A steadfast refusal of his grandmother's wishes would have been unthinkable, for it would have violated the Confucian principle of filial piety, in which all noble children were trained. Thereafter the Ting and Fu clans needed only to discover and report the faults of those who stood in their way, in order to achieve control over the court. As soon as Emperor Ai came to the throne, the Empress Dowager nee Wang tactfully ordered Wang Mang, who had previously controlled the government, to resign. He did so, but Emperor Ai could not permit his predecessor's chief minister to resign immediately, for such an act would 4CHAPTER XI have implied that the new ruler would not filially continue the policies of his predecessor. So Wang Mang (who probably expected such a result and may have instigated the Empress Dowager's action) was continued in office. Then strife arose concerning precedence between the Emperor's actual grandmother, the Queen Dowager nee Fu, and his nominal grandmother, the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang. An official memorialized that, according to classical principles, a mother should receive honor when her son becomes honorable, so that the Emperor's mother should receive an imperial title. Shih1 Tan and Wang Mang however opposed the proposal, and Emperor Ai did not want immediately to go contrary to the advice of his highest ministers, so let the matter drop. Instead of that, Emperor Ch'eng's old officials, who had been put in power by the Wang clan, were dropped one by one, being accused of some crime or other. When Wang Mang saw that he had incurred the enmity of the Queen Dowager nee Fu, he again asked to resign. This time he was allowed to do so and was asked to remain at the court with high honors, but no official post. Two years later he was sent away from the court to his estates. The Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang, who was not herself aggressive or interested in politics, was not interfered with. The titles of the Queen Dowager nee Fu and the Concubine nee Ting were raised. Fu Hsi, a paternal cousin of the Queen Dowager and the ablest member of the Fu clan, succeeded Wang Mang as Commander-in-chief. When he opposed female influence in the government and refused to raise the titles of the Emperor's mother and grandmother still further, he too was dismissed from his position and sent away from the court. As one after another of the court officials were removed, the Emperor's mother and grandmother were given higher and higher titles, until there were four Empresses Dowager in the court: nee Wang, nee Chao, nee Fu, and nee Ting. The latter died in 5 B.C.; two years later the Empress Dowager nee Fu was at last given the same title as her former rival, the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang; both ladies had borne sons to Emperor YÃ¼an. The Grand Empress Dowager nee Fu had previously succeeded in legally murdering her other former rival for Emperor YÃ¼an's favor, the Queen Dowager nee Feng of Chung-shan. This active and ambitious Empress Dowager thus triumphed over those who held to a strict construction of proprieties (the Confucians who had tried to prevent her elevation), but she died a year later. Meanwhile the clans of the Emperor's mother and grandmother had been highly honored: the Ting clan counted among its members two marquises, one Commander-in-chief, six generals, ministers, and officials ranking at two thousand piculs, and more 5INTRODUCTION than ten Palace Attendants and Division Heads. The Fu clan (including the Chang clan, that of the Empress Dowager nee Fu's half-brother) numbered among its members six marquises, two Commander-in-chiefs, six ministers or officials ranking at two thousand piculs, and more than ten Palace Attendants or Division Heads. These high officials of course distributed positions liberally to their henchmen and relatives. Thus a spoils system was put into full play in ancient China by the maternal relatives of the emperor. Emperor Ai's strong rule and his execution of Wang Chia1a In his government, Emperor Ai imitated Emperor Wu by not retaining any official in office for long, and by executing several of them. In this short period of six years, there were five Lieutenant Chancellors, seven Commanders-in-chief, and eleven Grandee Secretaries. Two Lieutenant Chancellors and one Grandee Secretary were executed. The most flagrant case was that of Wang Chia1a (not a member of Wang Mang's clan). He was an honest, self-respecting, and capable official, who opposed Emperor Ai's desire to advance and enrich his favorite, Tung Hsien2a. When the treason of the Emperor's fourth cousin, Liu YÃ¼n2a, was reported, Emperor Ai substituted the name of Tung Hsien2a for that of the person who had transmitted this information, thus obtaining an excuse for ennobling his favorite. Later the Emperor sent an order to the Lieutenant Chancellor and Grandee Secretary to make Tung Hsien2a a full marquis. These officials however knew the (unwritten) constitutional practise, that the Emperor can only act on the motion of his high ministers, and refused to make the necessary recommendations. The Emperor was thus blocked. But in a few months he issued an edict making this enfeoffment. Thus Emperor Ai, following the example of Emperor Wu, broke down this important provision in the Han constitution. When the Empress Dowager nee Fu died, Emperor Ai sent to these two highest ministers her testamentary edict, which ordered the granting of estates to her relatives and to Tung Hsien2a. Wang Chia1a sealed and returned this edict to the Emperor, probably because he suspected that the name of Tung Hsien2a was a forgery, thus again blocking the Emperor. When the Commandant of Justice and others had investigated Liu YÃ¼n2a, they concluded that this King was innocent, and ordered him tried again. Emperor Ai thought that they were trying to curry favor with the King, and dismissed them. A few months later there was a general amnesty, after which Wang Chia1a recommended the dismissed Commandant of Justice and his associates for official position. That was too much for Emperor Ai. He charged Wang Chia1a with having 6CHAPTER XI been unjust and with attempting to mislead the throne. The case was committed to the important courtiers. Some fifty, including K'ung Kuang, who then had high hopes of being again made Lieutenant Chancellor, supported the Emperor's charges; ten recommended mercy. A century earlier, a high spirited noble would have taken poison rather than go to jail; but that chivalric age had passed. Wang Chia1a was a high-minded Confucian; his conscience was clear and he recognized that he had acted for the best interests of the state. He refused the poison his subordinates offered him and went to jail. Emperor Ai was angry that this stubborn minister should have thus again blocked his efforts to put him out of the way, and sent a committee of high officials to argue him down. But Wang Chia1a justified his actions and condemned Tung Hsien2a and his relatives as flatterers. The dismissed minister was starved in prison and died twenty days later. A prison sentence was then frequently merely a milder form of capital punishment than public execution. Martyrs for their moral convictions were not lacking among Han Confucians. After Emperor Ai's death, Wang Mang ordered Wang Chia1a listed as a faithful minister, restored his marquisate to his son, and gave him the posthumous name, Faithful (Marquis Chung). Supernatural revelations influence governmental policy This reign witnessed the appearance of revelations or oracle books (ch'an) that affected government policy. These revelations were a natural development from the Confucian practise of interpreting visitations and portents as having a meaning for government policies. The theory of the five powers as determining history was first elaborated by Tsou Yen (iv cent. B.C.), and became popular in Confucian circles through its appearance in the "Great Plan," which became a chapter in the Book of History. This theory had as one of its consequences the doctrine that dynasties rise and fall in accordance with the dominating power. After the Han dynasty had been on the throne for a century and its virtual collapse during the last years of Emperor Wu's reign, people accordingly began to speculate what would be the next dynasty. In 78 B.C., Kuei Hung, who had studied Tung Chung-shu's interpretation of the Kung-yang Commentary and who was then a minor court official, interpreted a portent as indicating the end of the Han dynasty and the appearance of a new dynasty with the surname Kung-yang. He was executed for treason, but speculation continued. One belief was that 3 Ã 70 = 210 years was the period a dynasty endured, which era, counting from 206 B.C., would end in A.D. 4 (cf. 99 A: n. 34.5). In the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, a certain Kan Chung-k'o from the Ch'i 7INTRODUCTION commandery wrote a book in twelve chapters, which he said was a revelation from a spirit named the Essence of the Red Lord (Ch'ih-ching-tzu), by whose power Emperor Kao had killed the serpent blocking his path (HS 1 A: 7a) and had seated his dynasty on the throne. In this book, Kan Chung-k'o evidently reasoned, on a calendrical basis, that the Han dynasty, if it was to continue, must again receive a mandate from Heaven, and asserted that the Essence of the Red Lord had come down to teach the dynasty how to secure this mandate. Kan Chung-k'o was thus supporting the Han dynasty against interpretations like that of Kuei Hung. Kan Chung-k'o's book seems to have been the first of the "revelations." (Kuei Hung was later said to have written a book of revelations, which did not appear until the first century A.D., when a pretender surnamed Kung-sun appeared, so that this book was probably a forgery.) Liu Hsiang4a had been asked by Emperor Ch'eng to report on the correctness of this revelation. He had memorialized that this doctrine was not classical, and was an attempt to deceive the Emperor and to mislead the crowd. Kan Chung-k'o was imprisoned, tortured, and died; his disciples were dismissed from office. When it was discovered that Emperor Ch'eng had killed his own infant sons, thus leaving himself without a natural heir, and when sundry portents occurred, people came increasingly to feel that the Han dynasty had actually decayed. This opinion was confirmed by the fact that Emperor Ai was continually ill, with some disease like arthritis, and also that he had no natural heir. He was told about Kan Chung-k'o's revelation. The matter was submitted to Liu Hsiang4a's son, Liu Hsin1a, who again condemned the doctrine as unclassical. Other courtiers, however, supported this new teaching, and Emperor Ai summoned Kan Chung-k'o's chief disciples to several audiences. They told the Emperor that he should change the year-period and take a new title, whereby he would secure lengthened life and an heir, as well as freedom from his illness, etc. On July 13, 5 B.C., he followed their advice, taking new, long, and flowery names. A month later, the bearers of the revelation, emboldened by their success, proposed further changes. They now said that the highest ministers should be dismissed, and those courtiers who had supported the revelation should be given the vacant positions. That was too much for the ministers. Emperor Ai's illness had not improved, so that the supporters of the revelation could not point to any verification of their promises. The Emperor was persuaded that the revelation was groundless; he rescinded his edict and committed Kan Chung-k'o's disciples to the officials; these disciples were sentenced for having deceived the Emperor, 8CHAPTER XI an inhuman crime, and were executed. This incident marks the first important influence upon government policies by revelations, which were to play such a large part in the reign of Wang Mang and later times. The popular cult of the Mother Queen of the West The popular excitement in the spring and summer of 3 B.C., connected with the worship of the Mother Queen of the West (Hsi-wang-mu), deserves careful notice. Unfortunately we know little about it; all the relevant passages are to be found in the text and notes under this date. The Mother Queen of the West figures in ancient Chinese legends and grave-sculptures before and after this date. She was then supposed to be an immortal, dwelling in the far western K'un-lun Mountains, in a grotto inside a metal house in a stone city, and to have three green birds who brought her food to this desert place. She had a human body, a leopard's tail, tiger's teeth, which latter were good for whistling, and brilliant white tangled hair, in which she wore a peculiar high jade hair-ornament. She was probably now represented as offering to her devotees a means of escaping death from starvation and becoming as immortal as she was. This incident seems to have been a soteriological religion promising immortality, in many respects similar to the Bacchic religion of ancient Greece. The drought brought it popularity. The present Shantung, where it started, is still susceptible to this sort of ecstatic, revivalistic religious agitation. It did not affect the bureaucracy or court, hence is merely mentioned in the History as a curious incident, a portent requiring explanation. Tung Hsien2a's meteoric rise and fall The rise of Tung Hsien2a shows how far a completely worthless person could go by imperial favor. He was merely a handsome and pliable lad in the Heir-apparent's suite, who was made a Gentleman when Emperor Ai came to the throne, and became the Emperor's catamite. He was promoted from one post to another, all the while continuing in personal attendance upon the Emperor. In the course of ten months, he had accumulated a hundred million cash in grants and rewards. When he did not leave the Palace on the regular days for vacation, the Emperor arranged that Tung Hsien2a's wife might enter the palace inner apartments, with the result that his wife and children lived there. The Emperor took Tung Hsien2a's younger sister as a Brilliant Companion, giving her the rank next to the Empress. Tung Hsien2a, his wife, or his sister were continually in attendance upon the Emperor. His father was made a minister and noble; his father-in-law and brother were given court positions; 9INTRODUCTION a large and splendid residence was built for him just outside the palace portal and a splendid burial place was prepared beside the imperial tomb. Jewels and weapons were given him from the palace workshops, even better ones than those the Emperor secured. By an imperial forgery, he was given a marquisate and an estate. When Wang Chia1a opposed this proposed enfeoffment. he was removed and finally executed. The Emperor's maternal uncle, Ting Ming, was Commander-in-chief, and he too disapproved of Tung Hsien2a. Emperor Ai dismissed this minister and also retired Fu4 Yen, the imperial great-uncle. Thus the Emperor's infatuation with a boy led him to break with both his own maternal clans. He was thus left without any loyal followers in the court except the Tung clan. The latter clan contained no one of ability. It seems not to have been interested in politics except to enrich itself. Tung Hsien2a was finally made Commander-in-chief, the controlling position in the ministry, although he was only in his twenty-second year. His younger brother was given Tung Hsien2a's former position and the whole Tung clan were made Palace Attendants, Division Chiefs, etc., receiving greater favors than had even been bestowed upon the Emperor's maternal clans. The Emperor seems even to have come to believe that the Han dynasty, because of the succession of the elements, must inevitably be soon succeeded by a different dynasty (cf. Ku Chieh-Kang, Ku-shih-pien, V, 465-77). Once, at a feast, the Emperor even calmly talked about resigning the throne to his favorite. Wang Hung, a cousin of Wang Mang, happened to be in attendance. He immediately remonstrated, telling the Emperor that the empire was no plaything, for it had been received from his ancestors and must be transmitted to his descendants, thus invoking the Confucian exaltation of filial piety. Emperor Ai was plainly displeased, at which circumstance the imperial attendants were frightened and Wang Hung left the room. Thus imperial infatuation was carried to the extreme. When Emperor Ai died suddenly without an heir and without having appointed a successor, his mother and grandmother had previously died and his maternal relatives had been deprived of their positions, possibly because the Emperor continued to hope that Tung Hsien2a would inaugurate a new dynasty. But the latter was wholly incapable of doing so, even though he possessed the imperial seals of office. The imperial authority naturally reverted to the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang, the senior of the two surviving Empress Dowagers. During his last years, after Emperor Ai had broken with his maternal clans, he had begun recalling the Confucians whom he had displaced from their positions when he took the throne. At this time Wang Mang had been praised by those 10CHAPTER XI who took the civil service examinations, so that he had been recalled to the capital and had been there during the last year of Emperor Ai's reign, without however being given a post. On the day of the imperial death, the Grand Empress Dowager, who probably had previously been instructed what to do, immediately went to the emperor's palace and collected the imperial seals of state. Thereby she took to herself the imperial authority. She then asked Tung Hsien2a about the regulations for imperial mourning, which he, as the highest minister, would be required to conduct. The young man was distraught and in all likelihood completely ignorant of such matters, so could only beg her pardon. She remarked that Wang Mang had previously conducted the mourning for Emperor Ch'eng and sent a messenger galloping to summon him. Wang Mang, like most of the other courtiers, could not endure Tung Hsien2a. The latter was now impeached for negligence in caring for the Emperor and imprisoned in the palace. He had no influential friends outside of his own clan. Wang Mang then told the Grand Empress Dowager that public opinion disapproved of the favorite. The day after the emperor died, Wang Mang had her order Tung Hsien2a dismissed from his position and sent to his residence. The latter and his relatives were so frightened that, on the same day, both he and his wife committed suicide in order to save the rest of their clan. The two were buried that same night. The whole Tung clan were dismissed from their positions and exiled, and their wealth sold. It amounted to 4,300,000,000 cash. Tung Hsien2a's body was exhumed, stripped, and reburied meanly. Thus the imperial favorite received his reward. The influence of Confucianism During this period, the influence of Confucianism continued unabated. The high officials continued to be Confucians. Learned men were recommended for the highest posts. There came indeed to be two parties in the imperial court: the Fu and Ting clans, who defended their positions and sought wealth and influence, and the Confucians (to whom Wang Mang belonged), who comprised the bulk of the bureaucracy and stood for a strict construction of court proprieties and for moral ideals. In spite of this division, Confucian influence continued to be strong, for the imperial maternal relatives owed their influence to the Confucian teaching of favoring one's relatives, hence, even when they dismissed the Confucians from high office, they continued to cultivate Confucianism and favor those Confucians who would accord with them. There was no thought, on the part of any important personage, of changing from Confucianism to any other philosophy. K'ung Kuang, a lineal descendant of Confucius and one of the great 11INTRODUCTION scholars of the empire, was installed as Lieutenant Chancellor on the day Emperor Ch'eng died; he was dismissed in two years, because he opposed the raising of the Empress Dowager nee Fu's title. Three years later, he was recalled to court when she died, and was soon reappointed to his old post. He had meanwhile learned to be more pliable to the Emperor's wishes, lending his consent to the condemnation of Wang Chia1a and treating Tung Hsien2a deferentially. A very learned Confucian who was at the same time a lineal descendant of Confucius could not be neglected, for such a person would be an ornament to any Chinese court. The post of Commander-in-chief, which actually dominated the government, was, however, except for brief intervals, kept in the hands of imperial relatives or of the imperial favorite, Tung Hsien2a. Through his concurrent position as Intendant of the Affairs of the Masters of Writing, the Commander-in-chief controlled the most important source of imperial information. Under Emperor Ai, this control was not as important as previously, for the Empress Dowager nee Fu and Tung Hsien2a both had direct access of the imperial person. Thus Confucian influence, while important, was partly checked by the imperial maternal relatives and favorite. Confucian influence also showed itself in certain reforms. The practise of mourning for a parent to the third year was revived (cf. App. I). An attempt was made to restrict the amount of land and slaves one person could own (11: 2b, 3a). This edict was however tabled because the imperial maternal relatives and favorite found it inconvenient. At the same time certain imperial ateliers were abolished and a few other humanitarian laws were enacted (11: 3a, b). A new ruler was expected to show his devotion to Confucian principles in his government, and reforms such as these were enacted because Confucians urged them. The Wang clan, not to be outdone, distributed its private fields to the poor people (11: 4a); but this does not mean that they gave up the estates from which their income as marquises was derivedâtheir estates were government, not private fields. Their generosity was probably limited to their lands near the capital, rents from which (at least part of which were paid in grain) would be more convenient for a court official than income from distant estates in the provinces. Wang Mang may have foreseen that he would eventually be exiled from the court; this generous gift aided greatly in inducing people to urge the recall of Wang Mang, four years later. A temporary rectification of high official titles, following classical models The most interesting effect of Confucianism was the change of official titlesâa phenomenon that became pronounced under Wang Mang. A cardinal Confucian principle was the imitation of ancient practises. 12CHAPTER XI About 8 B.C., Ho Wu, who was then Grandee Secretary, memorialized that in ancient times, when life was simple, government business was divided among the three highest ministers (San-kung), whereas now, when there were not available officials who had as great ability as those of ancient times, the duties of the three ancient highest ministers were concentrated in the hands of the Lieutenant Chancellor. He suggested the appointment of the three highest ministers as in ancient times (83: 13b). Emperor Ch'eng asked Chang YÃ¼3a, a retired Lieutenant Chancellor and Confucian, about the matter; the latter agreed, whereupon the title of Grandee Secretary was changed to Grand Minister of Works, and he was given the same salary and rank as the Lieutenant Chancellor and Commander-in-chief. There probably was at the same time also a division of responsibility, so that some of the Lieutenant Chancellor's duties were given to the Grand Minister of Works. But many who discussed the matter said that ancient and present times required different institutions and that the Han official titles, from that of the Emperor down to that of the Accessory Officials, were different from those of ancient times, so that a change in merely the titles and duties of the three highest officials would make no difference in the quality of the government (83: 14a). After the Confucian Ho Wu had been dismissed for lack of filial piety, and Chu Po, an adherent of the Fu clan, became Grand Minister of Works, he memorialized that dynasties do not need to imitate one another, that when Emperor Kao received the Mandate of Heaven to found the Han dynasty, he had established a Grandee Secretary as second in rank to the Lieutenant Chancellor and had given him the duty of correcting the laws and institutes, with the result that the empire had now been calm for two centuries. Hence the change of Grandee Secretary to Grand Minister of Works would not secure the blessing of Heaven. So he recommended that titles be changed back again (83: 14b). Emperor Ai accordingly made the change, and in 5 B.C. installed Chu Po as Grandee Secretary. The Han dynasty had adopted the practise of the Ch'in dynasty in dividing the country into counties (hsien) and grouping these into commanderies (chÃ¼n), each containing about a dozen prefectures or more, over which there was set a Commandery Administrator to act as satrap of the region, usually with the rank of two thousand piculs. In 106 B.C., Emperor Wu had grouped these commanderies into thirteen divisions or provinces (chou), and appointed to each province an Inspector of a Regional Division (Pu-tz'u-shih), with the rank of six hundred piculs, whose business it was to make the circuit of his commanderies and report any irregularities. Feudal kingdoms (which later became smaller than 13INTRODUCTION commanderies) were governed by a Chancellor (Hsiang), who was appointed by the imperial court, so that there had come to be little difference, outside of titles, between the government of commanderies and of kingdoms. Both were supervised by the same Inspectors. In 8 B.C., Ho Wu memorialized that this Han practise was contrary to Confucian classical principles, according to which the superior should govern the inferior, not the reverse. So he had Emperor Ch'eng change the Inspectors to Provincial Shepherds (Chou-mu), a title taken from the Book of History, and rank them at fully two thousand piculs, so that their rank should be higher than that of Administrators. Two years later (6 B.C.), Chu Po however pointed out that when Inspectors ranked lower than Administrators, the former had been stimulated to activity by the hope of being promoted to be one of the 103 Administrators or Chancellors, so that an efficient Inspector had had lively hopes of promotion. But when these officials became Shepherds and were given a high rank, they had available for promotion only the dozen ministerial positions at the imperial court. Consequently they lost their incentive to activity; the better ones merely guarded themselves for fear of committing a fault and sullying their record, while the wicked ones were unrestrained, since there was no one to watch them. Local administrations were consequently left without supervision and government degenerated. So Chu Po recommended the abolition of Shepherds and the restoration of the Inspectors. This change was made in 5 B.C. Thus the practical bureaucrat showed more wisdom than the Confucian. One of the reasons for the inefficiency of Wang Mang's provincial administration was undoubtedly that he reestablished Provincial Shepherds in order to accord with classical Confucian ideas. When an eclipse of the sun happened on a New Year's day (Feb. 5, 2 B.C.), followed within a month by the death of the Empress Dowager nee Fu, Emperor Ai was deeply impressed, and in that very month summoned K'ung Kuang back to court, asking him to explain the portent. The latter said that government matters had not been right and should be reformed (81: 19a-20a). Since the Emperor's grandmother was no longer alive and the Emperor had broken with his maternal clans, while the Tung clan showed no disposition to interfere in government policies, Emperor Ai turned to the Confucians again, recalling those whom he had dismissed at the beginning of his reign. When, a year later, a second solar eclipse occurred, Emperor Ai interpreted it as a warning and, through Confucian influence, restored the arrangement under which government control was divided among the three ancient highest ministers. In the scholastic interest of uniformity, a new title was also given 14CHAPTER XI to the Lieutenant Chancellor, and these three officials were now entitled Ta-szu-t'u (Grand Minister Over the Masses), Ta-szu-ma (Commander-in-chief), and Ta-szu-k'ung (Grand Minister of Works). This arrangement did not last long, for Emperor Ai died within a month and in the next year Wang Mang changed these titles again. The change is however interesting as showing that the tendency to change titles and to adopt ancient phraseology and ancient governmental arrangements was inherent in Han Confucianism, and that Wang Mang merely took it from that powerful current of influence. 15 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter XI THE ELEVENTH [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [Emperor Hsaio]-ai Emperor Hsiao-ai was the grandson of Emperor YÃ¼an by a concubine and the son of King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang1a]. His mother was the Concubine [nee] Ting. When he was in his third year, 22 B.C.1.1 1.1 Cf. HS 14: 23a. he succeeded [his father] and was set up as King. When he grew up, he delighted in words and phrases and in the laws and statutes.1.2 1.2 These phrases (the first one is repeated on 11: 8b) may well refer to the matters discussed by the school of circumstances and names or penological terminology; cf. 9: n. 1.2. In [the period] YÃ¼an-yen, the fourth year, he came 9 B.C. [to Ch'ang-an] to pay court, followed by all [his high officials], his Tutor, his Chancellor, and his Commandant of the Capital. At that time the youngest brother of Emperor Ch'eng, King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], also came to pay court, followed [only] by his Tutor. The Emperor thought it strange, and asked [Liu Hsin5, the future Emperor Ai], about it. The King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu Hsin5] replied, "According to the [imperial] ordinances, when vassal kings come to pay court, they are permitted to be accompanied by the [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs in their kingdoms. The Tutor, Chancellor, and Commandant of the Capital are all [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs in a kingdom, hence I am accompanied by them all." The Emperor ordered him to recite from the Book of Odes, and he understood and was versed in it, and was able to explain it. On another day, [the Emperor] asked the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], in what law or ordinance 16HSIAO-AI 9 B.C. [it was ordered that he should be] accompanied only 11: 1a, b by his tutor, and he was unable to reply. [The Emperor] ordered him to recite from the Book of History, and he broke off [in the middle of his recitation]. Moreover, [at an imperial feast], when he had been granted food in the presence of [the Emperor], he was the last to finish eating; when he arose, his stockings came down, [for] their ties had become 1b* * Light upright numbers indicate the paging in the Ching-yu ed., reprinted in the Commercial Press' Po-na Series of the "Twenty-four Histories". loosened. Because of these [facts], Emperor Ch'eng 1bâ  â  Italic numbers indicate the paging in the Palace ed. or Wu-ying Tien ed., reprinted in the Szu-pu Pei-yao. considered that he was incapable, and esteemed the King of Ting-t'ao, [Liu Hsin5], as capable, often exalting his abilities. At this time the grandmother of the King, the 1bâ¡ â¡ Bold-face numbers indicate the paging in the Wang Hsien-ch'ien's Han-shu Pu-chu, as in previous volumes. Queen Dowager [of Ting-t'ao, nee] Fu, had come with the King to pay court, and privately sent presents to the Brilliant Companion [nee] Chao, whom the Emperor favored, and to the Emperor's maternal uncle, the General of Agile Cavalry and Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-yang, Wang Ken. The Brilliant Companion [nee Chao] and [Wang] Ken saw that the Emperor had no sons, and also wished beforehand to attach themselves [to the coming ruler] by a plan for the distant future, so both in turn praised the King of Ting-t'ao and urged the Emperor to make him his successor. Emperor Ch'eng of his own volition also exalted [Liu Hsin5's] ability, and, after having put the bonnet of virility upon him, sent him 9 B.C. [back to his kingdom]. At that time he had [reached] his seventeenth year. 8 B.C. The next year, [the Emperor] sent the Bearer of Mar. 201.3 1.3 HS 10: 14b; 80: 10a. the Gilded Mace, Jen Hung, as Acting Grand Herald, with credentials, to summon the King of Ting-t'ao to [come and] be established as the Imperial Heir-apparent. [Liu Hsin5 however] excused himself, saying, "Your servant has been favored in being 17HSAIO-AI, Sui-ho II 11: 1b, 2a permitted to succeed his father in charge of a tribu- 8 B.C. tary [kingdom] and to become a vassal king. My ability and nature is inadequate for use as the occupant of the Heir-apparent's palace. Your Majesty is sage and virtuous, generous and benevolent. [Your Majesty] has respectfully succeeded his ancestors and has upheld and been obedient in the care of the gods in heaven and earth. It is proper that your [Majesty] should receive happiness and blessing thru the reward of `thousands and millions of descendants.'1.4 1.4 A quotation from the Book of Odes, III, II, v, 2 (Legge, p. 482). Your servant is willing temporarily to be 2a permitted to remain in the prince's lodge of his kingdom [at the imperial capital], morning and evening to present himself [to your Majesty] to ask [about your Majesty's] health, and to wait until there may be an imperial heir, [whereupon your servant] will return to his kingdom and [remain] in charge of his tributary [state]." When the memorial was presented, the Son of Heaven replied, "[We] have heard it."1.5 1.5 Implying tacit disapproval. Emperor Ch'eng planned to separate the future Emperor Ai from his own family and make him an Imperial Son. Emperor Ai's relatives refused to allow him to be separated from them. More than a month later, [Emperor Ch'eng] Dec.1.6 1.6 HS 10: 15b. established [Liu] Ching3b, a grandson of King Hsiao of Ch'u, [Liu Ao], as King of Ting-t'ao, to uphold the sacrifices to King Kung [of Ting-t'ao, Liu K'ang], in order to encourage and incite the Heir-apparent to apply himself solely to the purpose of being [the 97B: 17a Emperor's] successor. A discussion is in the "Memoir 2a of the [Imperial] Relatives by Marriage." 7 B.C. In [the period] Sui-ho, the second year, the third II month, Emperor Ch'eng died, and in the fourth 2a1.7 1.7 HS 10: 16a. Apr. 17 month, on [the day] ping-wu, the Heir-apparent took May 7 18HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 7 B.C. the imperial throne and presented himself in the 11: 2a Temple of [Emperor] Kao. He honored the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] with the title, Grand August Empress Dowager, and the Empress [nee Chao] with May 172.1 2.1 HS 97 B: 14a. the title, Empress Dowager. He [granted] a general amnesty to the empire, granted one quadriga of horses to each king's son of the imperial house who was enregistered,2.2 2.2 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) explains, "Yu-shu means that his relationship had not been extinguished, so that he was still [of the proper relationship] to wear mourning." In 9: 2b and 10: 2b Emperors YÃ¼an and Ch'eng are each recorded as having at the beginning of their reigns made grants to the members of the imperial house who ; Emperor Ai, in similarily making grants, would hardly have meant anything different from what they did. Then the phrase here is merely an abbreviation for the phrase used in the "Annals of Emperors YÃ¼an" and "Ch'eng." Those who rebelled or were sentenced for crime and their descendants were dropped from the imperial house, cf. 6: 4b. The practise of considering relationship to have lapsed after a certain number of generations is recognized in 12: 3a; cf. n. 3.1. This phrase is also found in 8: 7a. to the officials and common people, noble ranks, to [each] hundred households, an ox and wine, and to the Thrice Venerable, the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, the [Diligent] Cultivators of the Fields, widowers, widows, orphans, and childless, silk. The Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an imperial edict honoring King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang], as Sovereign Kung [of Ting-t'ao]. In June 16 the fifth month, on [the day] ping-hsÃ¼, [the Emperor] established the Empress nee Fu [as Empress]. An imperial edict said, "[According to the principle of] the Spring and Autumn, [in the Kung-yang Commentary] that `a mother becomes honorable because of 2b her son,'2.3 2.3 A quotation from the Kung-yang Commentary (iii cent. B.C.) to the Spring and Autumn, 1: 7b, Dk. Yin, Yr. I. [We] honor the Queen Dowager [nee Fu] of Ting-t'ao with the title, Empress Dowager Kung, and the Concubine [nee] Ting [of Ting-t'ao with the title, Empress Kung, and establish for each an entourage, a Supervisor of the Household, and the 19HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 11: 2a income of an estate, like [the occupants of] the 7 B.C. Ch'ang-hsin Palace and the Inner Palace.2.4 2.4 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) explains, "The mother of Emperor Ch'eng, the Empress Dowager [nee] Wang, lived in the Ch'ang-hsin Palace." "The Ch'ang-hsin Palace" was then an indirect way of referring to this Empress Dowager; the "Inner Palace" was similarily an indirect reference to the Empress; cf. Glossary sub Inner Palace. Li Ch'i (fl. ca. 200) remarks, "The Concubine [nee] Fu was to be [treated] like [the occupant of] the Ch'ang-hsin [Palace] and the Concubine nee Ting like [the occupant of] the Inner Palace." [We] posthumously honor the father of [the Empress Dowager nee] Fu as the Marquis [through Whom the Emperor] Renders Homage to an Ancestor, and the father of [the Empress nee] Ting as the Marquis in Recompense to his Virtue." The maternal uncle [of the Emperor], Ting Ming, had been made the Marquis May 32.5 2.5 According to 18: 24a, b and Shih1 Tan's memorial in 86: 16a, Ting Ming and Fu Yen had been enfeoffed on May 3, four days before Emperor Ai came to the throne; Ting Man and Chao Ch'inb were enfeoffed on June 19 and 22, respectively (18: 24b, 22b). of Yang-an, his maternal uncle's son, [Ting] Man, was made Marquis of Ping-chou, and [Ting] June 192.5 2.5 According to 18: 24a, b and Shih1 Tan's memorial in 86: 16a, Ting Ming and Fu Yen had been enfeoffed on May 3, four days before Emperor Ai came to the throne; Ting Man and Chao Ch'inb were enfeoffed on June 19 and 22, respectively (18: 24b, 22b). Man's father, [Ting] Chung, was posthumously [granted] the posthumous name, Marquis Huai of P'ing-chou. The Empress [nee Fu's] father, [Fu4] Yen, had become the Marquis of K'ung-hsiang, and May 32.5 2.5 According to 18: 24a, b and Shih1 Tan's memorial in 86: 16a, Ting Ming and Fu Yen had been enfeoffed on May 3, four days before Emperor Ai came to the throne; Ting Man and Chao Ch'inb were enfeoffed on June 19 and 22, respectively (18: 24b, 22b). the younger brother of the Empress Dowager [nee Chao], the Palace Attendant and Imperial Household Grandee Chao Ch'inb, became the Marquis of June 222.5 2.5 According to 18: 24a, b and Shih1 Tan's memorial in 86: 16a, Ting Ming and Fu Yen had been enfeoffed on May 3, four days before Emperor Ai came to the throne; Ting Man and Chao Ch'inb were enfeoffed on June 19 and 22, respectively (18: 24b, 22b). Hsin-ch'eng.2.5 2.5 According to 18: 24a, b and Shih1 Tan's memorial in 86: 16a, Ting Ming and Fu Yen had been enfeoffed on May 3, four days before Emperor Ai came to the throne; Ting Man and Chao Ch'inb were enfeoffed on June 19 and 22, respectively (18: 24b, 22b). In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, " `The July melodies of Cheng are licentious'2.6 2.6 A quotation from a saying of Confucius in Analects XV, x, 6. Cf. Legge's "Concluding Note" to his translation of the Book of Odes I, vii, "The Odes of Cheng," p. 149. and bring disorder into music. They were banished by the Sage-kings.2.7 2.7 Another allusion to Analects XV, x, 6 where Confucius directs a disciple to "banish the melodies of Cheng." For this dismissal of 441 out of a total of 829 imperial musicians, cf. 22: 34b-37a; Glossary sub Bureau of Music. 2b Let the Bureau of Music be abolished." For the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-yang, [Wang] Ken, who 20HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 7 B.C. had previously as Commander-in-chief initiated the 11: 2a, b plan for [the dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, [whereby Emperor Ai had been appointed Heir-apparent], there was added to his enfeoffment [the 2b income of] two thousand households, and for the Grand Coachman, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun4b, who had seconded and guided [the Emperor before he was appointed] and had been his former benefactor, there was added to his enfeoffment [the income of] five hundred households. Moreover, for the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, and the Grand Minister of Works, the Marquis of Fan-hsiang, 3a Ho Wu, there was added to each of their enfeoffments [the income of] a thousand households.2.8 2.8 The above paragraph is probably a quotation from the imperial edict making these awards, but, since Pan Ku does not precede it by writing, "An edict also said," he plainly did not mean it to be read as a quotation. An imperial edict said, "The King of Ho-chien, [Liu] Liang, has mourned for his Queen Dowager to the third year and so has become a sign-post to the imperial house.2.9 2.9 Yen Shih-ku says, "Yi1-piao means that he should be a model in the rites and ceremonies (yi1)." But Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) points out that HS 90: 21a, speaking of the "Tyrannical Officials," says "Those who were incorrupt were qualified to be yi1-piao," as showing that Yen Shih-ku's interpretation is inadequate. He continues, "In my opinion, a standing post which directs people was called a yi1 and was also called a piao. The Shuo-wen [(ca. 100) 6A: 4b says], `Yi2 is a plank [laid horizontally as the casing in making an earthen wall. It comes] from the `wood' [radical] and yi4 as the sound.' The classics and the `traditions' (ancient commentaries) interchange [yi2] and yi1. Hence the Erh-ya [(before and during Han times) 2: 7a, says, `Yi1 is a plank.' [Kao Yu (fl. 205-212), in] a note to the LÃ¼-shih Ch'un-ch'iu, Bk. 25, ch. 6[p. 10a, says], `A piao is a post.' [Wilhelm, p. 446, translates piao as "Stange."] Hence when [a person's] virtue and conduct were adequate to serve as a model for people, he was called a sign-post (piao-yi). [The Li-ki (ca. i cent. B.C.)], Bk. XXX, 4 [Legge, II, 353; Couvreur, II, 516, says], `The superior should be careful in what he likes and dislikes, for he is a sign-post (piao) to the common people,' and Cheng [HsÃ¼an, (127200)] comments, `The common people follow their prince as a shadow follows a gnomen (piao).' HsÃ¼n-tzu [ca. 320-235 B.C.] roll VIII, fascicle XII [p. 4a, says], `The prince is the gnomen (yi1). When the gnomen (yi1) is straight, then its shadow is straight.' These [passages] prove that yi1 was the same as piao. Kuan-tzu [iii cent. B.C.] roll 20, fascicle 64 [p. 8b, says], `Rules and laws are the sign-posts (yi1-piao) for the many common people; the rules of proper conduct and moral principles are the sign-posts (yi1-piao) for honorable and humble [persons].' Huai-nan-tzu [d. 122 B.C.], ch. 9 [p. 1a, says], `His words are embroideries and his actions are his sign-posts (yi1-piao).' The Tso-chuan [(iv cent. B.C.), Dk.] Wen, Yr. VI [Legge, 2429, Couvreur I, 471 says], `They proclaimed the standard and model [for tribute], and led them by their examples (piao-yi1).' Then whether it says yi1-piao or piao-yi1, the meaning is the same. [Yen] Shih-ku . . . did not know that a yi1-piao . . . was a standing post, and also did not know that yi1 was a word borrowed for yi2." This phrase is also used in SC 130: 9. Cf. also HFHD, I, p. 244, n. 1. For the implications of this edict upon the practise of mourning to the third year, cf. app. I. Let his enfeoffment be increased 21HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 11: 2b, 3a by ten thousand households." 7 B.C. It also said, " `Frugality in expenditure and caution in action,'2.10 2.10 A phrase from the Classic of Filial Piety 2: 1a, ch. 3, I. Chen's trans., p. 18. in order to prevent extravagance and excess, are the first things in government and the unvarying way of all the [true] kings. [But] the vassal kings, the full marquises, the princesses, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs, together with powerful and rich common people, keep [many] male and female slaves, cultivated fields and residences without limit. They compete with the common people in profitable [enterprises] so the people lose their occupations and suffer severely without enough [to live on]. Let regulations for the restriction [of these matters] be discussed."2.11 2.11 The language of this edict is taken from Shih1 Tan's memorial, quoted in 24A: 20a, b. The high officials memorialized detailed [regulations 3a as follows], "The vassal kings and full marquises are to be permitted to own private cultivated fields in their states; the privately owned cultivated fields in the prefectures or marches of full marquises who [live] in Ch'ang-an and of princesses and the privately owned cultivated fields of Marquises of the Imperial Domain, officials, and common people are 22HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 7 B.C. 3a all not to be allowed to exceed thirty ch'ing.3.1 3.1 Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265) explains, "To own private cultivated land (ming-t'ien [ = `to possess']) in their states [refers to land] within the states from which they received their income. In addition to collecting the land-tax and tax on products, [vassal kings and marquises] were also personally permitted to own three thousand mou of private cultivated land (szu-t'ien ). As to `owning private cultivated land (ming-t'ien) in the prefectures and marches': [according to] the first section in [the dynastic] ordinances, those nobles who [lived] in their states and who owned private cultivated land (ming-t'ien) in other prefectures should be fined [the equivalent of] two taels of gold. [But] now some full marquises had not gone to their states; altho they received the income of the land-tax and tax on produce from their distant states, they were also themselves permitted to have cultivated land (t'ien) in other prefectures or marches. Princesses were similarily treated. [But these lands] were not permitted to exceed three thousand mou." For a discussion of these private lands, cf.; , pub. by Commercial Press, ch. 3. Tung Chung-shu seems to have been the first to suggest limiting the size of private lands, cf. HS 24 A: 17a. Emperor Ai's edict was made as a result of Shih1 Tan's suggestion (HS 24 A: 20a). Wang Hsien-ch'ien states that ming-t'ien is the same as chan-tien , which latter phrase is used in Han-chi 28: 1b. The 11: 3a male and female slaves of the vassal kings [shall be limited to] two hundred persons; those of full marquises 3b and princesses, to a hundred persons; and those of Marquises of the Imperial Domain, officials, and the common people, to thirty persons. Those [slaves] in their sixtieth year and over or in their tenth year and under are not to be counted in this number. No merchants are to be allowed to own private cultivated land or become officials.3.2 3.2 The regulation that those enregistered in market-places and their sons and grandsons were not allowed to be officials dates back to the time of Emperor Kao or earlier. Cf. HS 24 B: 4a11. HS 24 A: 20b also quotes this edict adding, "The period [for final compliance with this edict] shall end with the third year." The passage continues, "[At this] time the price of cultivated fields, residences, and male and female slaves became low. The Ting and Fu [clans] were [however] employed [on important government] matters and Tung Hsien2a became great and honorable, all [of whom found this edict] inconvenient. [So the enforcement of this] edict was temporarily postponed to a latter [time]. Thereupon it was tabled and not put into effect." Those who violate [this order] shall be sentenced according to the Code. Those who [after three years] own private cultivated land or keep male or female slaves more than the [allowed] number, shall all have them 23HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 11: 3a confiscated and delivered over the imperial govern- 7 B.C. ment." [The production of] those articles in the Three Offices for Garments in the Ch'i [Commandery] and in various offices which weave figured silks and [make] embroidery, which are difficult to produce or are injurious to women's work,3.3 3.3 For the Three Offices for Garments in the Ch'i Commandery, cf. Glossary, sub voce The reference to "women's work" is reminiscent of Emperor Ching's edict, where the term is explained. Cf. 5: 9a, HFHD, I, 328, &amp; n. 9.4. The text is ambiguous: Ju Shun interprets it: "Those which are being made and are already completed, and those which are not yet completed shall all be stopped and shall not again be made. All shall be transported to the depot nearest the Office." But Yen Shih-ku writes, "Ju [Shun's] explanation is mistaken. It merely means that those which are not yet completed shall not be made, and those which are already completed shall not be transported." Wang Hsien-ch'ien comments, "The two explanations of Ju [Shun] and Yen [Shih-ku] are [both] mistaken. Hu San-hsing [1230-1287, in a note to the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 33: 7a] says, `The Three Offices for Garments in Ch'i together with the various offices for weaving shall all not make articles difficult to complete in order to transport them [to the capital]." were all stopped and [such goods] were not to be made or transported [to the capital]. The ordinance [concerning] the giving of office to a son3.4 3.4 Ying Shao comments, "[As to] the ordinance [concerning] the giving office to sons, the Comment in the Han-[chiu]-yi [by Wei Hung, (fl. dur. 25-57; this passage has dropped out of that book, much of which has been lost; it has been replaced in its "Appendix" of fragments, A: 3a), says], `Officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs and above, who have attended to [government] affairs for three full years, are permitted to obtain the position of Gentleman for one of [their brothers or half-brothers] of the same father [or these persons' sons], or for a son.' [Such persons however] were not selected for their virtue, hence [the order] was done away with." (Yen Shih-ku, following a comment of Fu Ch'ien (125-195) to HS 36: 6a, interprets as meaning the same as , "guarantee," but Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) replies that in view of the provision in the Han Code, quoted by Ying Shao, guarantors were not necessary.) Tung Chung-shu (56: 13a) and Wang Chi5a (72: 7a) had protested against this practise. Its abolition constituted a strengthening of the examination system. At various times in the Later Han period persons are stated to have been made Gentlemen of the court (lang) because of their close relationship to high officials (HHS, M. 31: 14a, 17b; M. 9: 10b-11a; M. 27: 4a, 6a; M. 35: 6a; M. 51: 13a, b). But in each case this appointment was probably a special act of imperial grace. In A.D. 121, one son, nephew, or younger brother of each one of the highest ministers, high ministers, colonels, and masters of writing was made a Gentleman or Member of the Heir-apparent's Suite. This act was also a special favor; it is listed along with grants of general amnesty to the common people and grants of cash or silk to the Honored Ladies at the imperial tombs, the royal princesses, ministers, and lesser officials (HHS, An. 5: 15a). This grant establishes that the abolition of 7 B.C. was maintained, except for special imperial favors. In A.D. 146 it was however enacted that the sons of officials ranking at 600 piculs and over could enter the Imperial University and that the best ten of these sons should be made Gentlemen of the court or Members of the Heir-apparent's Suite (HHS, An. 6: 17b). Thus the practise of giving office to sons was partially and qualifiedly renewed. was done away with, together with 24HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 7 B.C. the laws about slandering [the government]3.5 3.5 This law had seemingly been ineffectively abolished by Emperor Wen; cf. 4: 10b. and 11: 3a, b 3b calumny. Palace Maids in the Lateral Courts [of the Wei-yang Palace] who were in their thirtieth year and under were sent out [of the harem] and married off; government male and female slaves who were in their fiftieth year and above were freed and made commoners. The prohibition [was made] that the commanderies and kingdoms should not be permitted to present famous wild animals [to the imperial court]. The salaries of officials [ranking at] three hundred piculs3.6 3.6 The Official ed. (1739) carelessly reads for . and under was increased. Officials who were oppressive or tyrannical were investigated in order that from time to time they might be dismissed. The high officials were not permitted to bring up former matters that had happened previous to an amnesty.3.7 3.7 Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1832) remarks, "This edict was probably occasioned by the [Director] of the Retainers, Chieh Kuang, memorializing the deeds of the [Brilliant Companion] nee Chao." It was probably an attempt to protect the life of her sister, the Empress Dowager nee Chao. Cf. HFHD, II, ch. X, Introduction, pp. 369-372; Glossary, sub Brilliant Companion nee Chao. When the fathers or mothers of Erudits or their Disciples died, they were 4a given leave for mourning to the third year.3.8 3.8 Yen Shih-ku explains, "Ning means to dwell at home and wear mourning garments." The Official ed. has the word "previously (ch'ien )" at the beginning of this sentence, before the words for "Erudits" (po-shih), with the note, "The Sung Ch'i [ed., xi or xii cent.] says, `[In the phrase] "Ch'ien po-shih," one text does not have the word "ch'ien." ' " This word was dropped in the Ching-yu ed. (1034-5). On this period of mourning, cf. App. I. Autumn In the autumn, [it was decided that] the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-yang, Wang Ken, and the Marquis of Ch'eng-tu, 25HSIAO-AI, Sui-ho II 11: 3b, 4a Wang K'uang4a, had both committed crimes; 7 B.C. [Wang] Ken went to his estate; [Wang] K'uang4a 3b was dismissed [from his title] and became a commoner, returning to his native commandery.3.9 3.9 HS 18: 19b and 98: 11a report that these two persons were sentenced because, before Emperor Ch'eng's tomb was completed, they had married imperial concubines and had held a feast at which there was singing and dancing, (cf. Glossary, sub Wang, Grand Empress Dowager nee). Hence abstinence from festivities was now required for far more than merely the thirty-six days after an emperor's death stipulated by Emperor Wen. Cf. 4: 20a. Another curious event happened at this time. HS 27 Ca: 21b says, "In the second year of [the period] Sui-ho, the eighth month, on [the day] keng-shen [Huang gives no such day in the eighth month, but if the intercalary month, which he inserts after the seventh month, is changed to come after the eighth month, this date is Sept. 18, 7 B.C.], a man of the T'ung Hamlet in the Cheng [county], Wang Pao, clothed in carmine garments, with a small bonnet, and girt with a two-edged sword, entered thru the Northern Major's Gate and the Eastern Gate of the [Wei-yang Palace] Hall, went up into the Front Hall and entered the Extraordinary Room, loosened the ribbon of a curtain, knotted and girded himself with it, beckoned to the Chief in the offices in the Front Hall, Yeh, and others, saying, `The Lord of Heaven ordered me to live here.' Yeh and the others arrested, bound, and examined him. [Wang] Pao had been a soldier of the [Chief] Grand Questioner to the Major [in Charge of Official Carriages], and was suffering from insanity, so that he himself did not know the circumstances under which he had entered the palace. He was sent to prison and died." An imperial edict said, "Since We have succeeded to the heavy [responsibilities] of the [imperial] ancestral temples, [We] have been trembling and circumspect, fearing that [We] might depart from the will of Heaven. [But] recently the sun and moon have lost their brilliance, the five planets have lost their paths, and the commanderies and kingdoms have frequently [suffered from] movements of the Earth.3.10 3.10 The Official ed. inverts the order of . HS 27 Ca: 9a says, "In the ninth month, on [the day] ping-ch'en [Nov. 13], there was an earthquake. From the capital to the northern borders, in more than thirty commanderies and kingdoms, the inner and outer city walls were ruined. Altogether it killed 415 people." Recently in the Ho-nan and Ying-ch'uan Commanderies, streams have overflowed and have carried away and killed some of the common people, 4a 26HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing I 7, 6 B.C. ruining and demolishing4.1 4.1 The Official ed. inverts the order of . their cottages. [Owing 11: 4a to] Our lack of virtue, the common people have suffered punishment in [Our] place. We have been greatly dismayed and have already sent an Imperial Household Grandee to travel about, inspect, and report [the names] and registration [in which those who have suffered are located], granting for each dead person three thousand cash for a coffin. Let it be ordered that in the counties and towns which have been injured by flood, together with those other commanderies and kingdoms which have suffered four-tenths or more from a [calamitous] visitation, the common people whose property does not [amount to] fully 100,000 [cash] shall all not [be required] to pay this year's land-tax or poll-taxes."4.2 4.2 A hundred thousand cash [which was equivalent to ten catties of gold] was the value of a middle-class family's estate; Cf. 4: 21a. I In [the period] Chien-p'ing, the first year, in the 6 B.C. spring, the first month, an amnesty [was granted] to Feb./Mar. the empire. The Palace Attendant and Colonel of Cavalry, the Marquis of Hsin-ch'eng, Chao Ch'inb, and the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang, Chao Hsin1b, who had both committed crimes, were dismissed [from 4b their titles], made commoners, and exiled to the Liao-hsi [Commandery].4.3 4.3 They were both brothers of the Brilliant Companion nee Chao, who had been responsible for imperial infanticide. Cf. HFHD II, 369-372; Glossary, sub vocibus. The Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an imperial edict that the cultivated fields which had not been [used for] tombs, belonging to the Wang clan who were imperial relatives by marriage, should all be distributed to the poor people.4.4 4.4 HS 27 Cb: 25a says, "In Chien-p'ing I, i, on [the day] ting-wei [Mar. 4], ten meteorites fell in the [Commandery] of Po-ti." Mar./Apr. In the second month, an imperial edict said, "Verily [We] have heard that the Sage-kings, in their government, considered the securing of capable 27HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing I 11: 4a, b persons as the most important [of matters]. Let 6 B.C. [the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, the Grand Minister of Works, Shih1 Tan], with the Commander-in-chief, [Fu Yen], the full Marquises, the generals, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, the Provincial Shepherds, the Administrators, and the Chancellors each recommend one person who is filially pious, fraternally respectful, true and honest, able to speak frankly, who understands government matters, and has arisen4.5 4.5 YÃ¼ YÃ¼eh (1821-1906) declares that yen is a copyist's error for an ancient form of . Without this emendation, as Wang Nien-sun remarks, the clause beginning with yen interrupts the sentence and must have been displaced. According to Yen Shih-ku's comment (A.D. 641), yen was already in his text. Liu Pin (1022-1088) remarks that this edict must have been a command to the Lieutenant Chancellor and Grand Minister of Works as well as to the officials mentioned; their titles have hence been inserted into the translation. from a mean condition, so is able to love the common people." 4b 4a In the third month, [the Emperor] granted to the Apr./May vassal kings, the princesses, the full marquises, the Lieutenant Chancellor, [K'ung Kuang], the generals, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, [officials] in the imperial capital offices, the Gentlemen, and [minor] officials, gold, cash, and silk, to each proportionately.4.6 4.6 HS 27 Cb: 25a says, "In the ninth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en [Oct. 27], two meteorites fell in YÃ¼ [in the kingdom of Liang]." In the winter, the Queen Dowager, [Feng] YÃ¼an, of Winter King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], and her younger brother, the Marquis of Yi-hsiang, Feng Ts'an, who had [been charged with] having committed a crime, both killed themselves.4.7 4.7 The Queen Dowager had been a rival of the Empress Dowager nee Fu for Emperor YÃ¼an's favor, and was hated by her; her younger sister had now been falsely charged with plotting an attempt on the life of Emperor Ai. Cf. Glossary, sub Feng, Brilliant Companion nee. Chou Shou-ch'ang glosses on 11: 4a, "The Ku-chin-chu [ca. 300, (we have been unable to find this passage there) says], `In the first year of Emperor Ai, a fungus of immortality grew on a laurel magnolia tree of the rear slaughter-house.' Chung Chang-t'ung's [180220] Ch'ang-yen [lost; fragments in the YÃ¼-han Shan-fang Chi-yi Shu; this passage is in B: 5b, and is recovered from the Yi-wen Lei-chÃ¼ (vii cent.) ch. 89, and from the T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983), 960: 4a] says, `In the time of Emperor Ai of the Han [dynasty, (the YÃ¼-lan says, "Emperor An")], there were prodigies which grew on an arbor-vitae tree of an eastern gallery (behind the Yen-yÃ¼ stables) in the Ch'ang-lo Palace, and on a mimosa tree at the southern door of the Long Lane. Those who discussed them considered that they were fungi of immortality. The courtiers all congratulated [the Emperor] and received grants.' " 28HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing II 5 B.C. II In the second year, in the spring, the third month, 11: 4b, 5a 5 B.C. [the title of] Grand Minister of Works was abolished, Apr./May and [the former title of] Grandee Secretary was restored.4.8 4.8 Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that this change was the result of a request by Chu Po. The change in the title of Provincial Governors below was also due to his recommendation. Cf. Introduction, p. 13. May/June In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial edict said, "The institutes of the Han dynasty stress the favoring of [imperial] relatives in order to manifest the honoring of those who should be honored. 5a In the title of Sovereign Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang], it is not proper that he should again be called `of Ting-t'ao.' [We] honor the Empress Dowager Kung [nee Fu] with the title, the Emperor's 5a Grand Empress Dowager; she is to be called [the occupant of] the Yung-hsin Palace.5.1 5.1 Cf. 11: 2a &amp; n. 2.4. The Empress Kung [nee Ting] is to be entitled the Emperor's Empress Dowager; she is to be called [the occupant of] the Chung-an Palace. There is to be established a Temple to Sovereign Kung in the [imperial] capital." An amnesty was granted to convicts in the empire. [The Emperor] abolished the [office of] Provincial Shepherds and reestablished [their occupants as] Inspectors. 5.2Book of Odes, I, VI, ix, 3 (Legge, I, 121). July 9 In the sixth month, on [the day] keng-shen, the Emperor's Empress Dowager nee Ting died. The 29HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing II 11: 5a, b Emperor declared, "We have heard that husband 5 B. and wife are one flesh. The Book of Odes says, `When living, we occupy different apartments, But when dead, we shall share the same grave.' Anciently, `When Viscount Wu, Chi-[sun Su], had completed his private apartments, and at the foot of his western steps there was' a corpse `of the Tu clan, [the head of that clan] begged permission to bury [the wife of the deceased] together with [her husband],' and `[Chi-sun Su] permitted it.'5.3 5.3 A quotation (with a variation in two words) from the Li-ki, II, i, i, 3 (Legge, 121; Couvreur, I, 109-110). The right of associating [husband and wife] in burial arose in the Chou [period].5.4 5.4 Cf. Li-ki, ibid. `How complete and elegant was its culture! I follow the Chou [practises].'5.5 5.5 Quoted from a saying of Confucius in Analects III, xiv. A filial son `serves the dead as he served the living.' It is proper that for the Emperor's Empress Dowager there should be raised a tumulus in the funerary of King Kung." She was thereupon buried in [the kingdom of] Ting-t'ao. Fifty thousand persons from Ch'en-liu, Chi-yin, and neighboring commanderies and kingdoms were mobilized to dig and replace the earth. 5.6Quoted from the Doctrine of the Mean, xix, 5 (Legge, p. 403; Couvreur, Li Ki, I 447; Legge, Li Ki, II, 311). 5.7Cf. 99 A: 34b and 11: 6a. On this incident, cf. Introduction, pp. 6-8. The Expectant Appointee Hsia Ho-liang and others spoke of revelations from Ch'ih-ching-tzu that the Han dynasty had come upon [a time of decay in the midst of [the period of time allotted to it] by its destiny, so that it must again receive the Mandate [of Heaven; hence] it was proper that [the Emperor] should change the year-period and alter his title. The imperial edict said, "The Han [dynasty] arose two hundred years [ago], and many times in succession it has begun [new] year-periods. 30HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing II 5 B.C. August Heaven has sent down its aid to [Us] who 11: 5b have no ability, so that the Han [dynasty's] estate should a second time be permitted to have the portents for receiving the Mandate [of Heaven]. Though We are not virtuous, who [are We that We] should dare not to listen [to the will of Heaven]? "Now [that We are to receive] this great Mandate which is the foundation of [all] government, [We] must certainly give [everyone in] the empire [an opportunity to] renew himself. Let a general amnesty [be granted] to the empire. Let the second year of [the period] Chien-p'ing become the first year of [the period] T'ai-ch'u-yÃ¼an-chiang. [Let Our] title be the Sovereign Emperor of Great Peacefulness Who Makes Known the Sageness of the Liu 5a [House].5.8 5.8 This edict is given in greater fullness in 75: 32b, which passage is much clearer. The Official ed. has not "yÃ¼an-chiang," the last two words of the new year-period, and quotes the Sung Ch'i ed. as saying that some editor "did not understand that the name [of the year-period] included four words, so excised the two words `yÃ¼an-chiang', which is an error. Later I obtained a T'ang text [before xi cent.] in which the words `yÃ¼an-chiang' are really preserved." All four words of this name are found in HS 75: 32b and 99 A: 34b. Ch'i Shao-nan remarks that T'ai-ch'u was a year-period in Emperor Wu's reign, and would not be repeated in this reign. "[The Emperor] must have been misled by the sayings of these magicians who invented this name with four words to show that there was a renaissance. Altho [this name of a year-period] was not actually established, nevertheless the names [of year-periods] in later ages which contain four words began with this one." This name may possibly be translated, "The Primordial and Great Grand Beginning." It is almost impossible to be sure about the meaning of a magical title such as that taken by the Emperor, viz., "Ch'en-sheng Liu T'ai-p'ing Huang-ti." Wang Mang took them as a prophecy of his usurpation; cf. 99 A: 34b. Li Fei (prob. iii cent.) says, "Ch'en is to lead. It means that he obtained spiritual leading. The sage is the Liu [house]." Ju Shun however says, "[The rulers of the state of] Ch'en, [the first word in the Emperor's title], were the descendants of Shun. Wang Mang was a descendant of [the rulers of] Ch'en. These were deceptive words which made plain that [Wang] Mang would usurp [the throne] and set himself up [as emperor]. However [Hsia Ho-liang and Emperor Ai] did not know that." Wei Chao (197-273/4) says, "It made known and published (ch'en) the virtue of the sage Liu [house]." Yen Shih-ku adds, "The two explanations of Ju [Shun] and Wei [Chao] are [both] correct," and Hu San-hsing remarks ironically "If Wei [Chao's] explanation is not far from the truth, then Ju [Shun's] explanation is like magic. Since Yen [Shih-ku] considers that both explanations are correct, which one shall we follow?" For the graduations on the clepsydra, 31HSIAO-AI, T'ai-ch'u-yuÃ¤n-chiang I 11: 5b, 6a [let] 120 [graduations per day] be used as the meas- 5 B.C. ure of their size."5.9 5.9 Yen Shih-ku remarks, "Previously in the clepsydra, for a day and night together there were 100 graduations . Now [the Emperor] increased them by twenty." Wang Mang later established 120 graduations; cf. 99 A: 35a. Shen Ch'in-han remarks, "If a hundred graduations are divided equally among twelve [double]-hours, one [double]-hour has 8 graduations and 20 divisions . Now 120 graduations were used, so that one [double]-hour had ten graduations. The Wu-tai Hui-yao [by Wang Po (922-982), 10: 13a, 14a, 13b, says], `In the [Posterior] Chin [dynasty, in the period] T'ien-fu III, [ii Mar., 938], the Director of the Imperial Observatory memorialized, . . . "The various Classics on the Graduations of the Clepsydra [(there were five books by this title listed even as early as the Sui History's "Treatise on Arts and Literature") all consider that in a day and night there are one hundred graduations, which are divided among twelve [double]-hours, so that each [double]-hour has 8 graduations and a third. . . . Sixty divisions make one graduation, so that one [double]-hour has 8 graduations and 20 divisions." The Sui Dynastic History [begun 622], 19: [26a ff, which gives a full account of the apportionment of clepsydra graduations among the various hours and their changes, says], `In 507, Emperor Wu considered that if the hundred graduations [of the clepsydra] in a day and night were divided equally among the twelve double-hours, a double-hour would have 8 graduations and there still would be some excess divisions [of a graduation]. So he considered that a day and night should have 96 graduations, so that one double-hour should have eight whole graduations.' [Other schemes were also tried, by which some double-hours had more graduations that others.] In the present [Ch'ing] dynasty, the imperial almanacs use the arrangement [of Emperor Wu]. Each [double]-hour has 8 equal graduations, and each graduation has 15 divisions, without any distinction between long graduations and short graduations." 6a In the seventh month, on the plain northwest of Aug. Wei-ch'eng, in the Yung-ling Commune section [of 6a the prefecture], there was made the Emperor's tomb, [with the order], "Do not remove the common people from the commanderies and kingdoms [to this place], in order that [the people] may not be disturbed." In the eighth month, an imperial edict said, "The Sept. Expectant6.1 6.1 Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) declares that should be emended to . The Official ed. has the latter reading. It is also found in the version of this edict on HS 75: 32b. Appointee Hsia Ho-ling and others gave advice that [We] should change the year-period, 32HSIAO-AI, T'ai-ch'Ã¼-yÃ¼an-chiang I 5 B.C. alter [Our] title, and increase the [number of] gradu- 11: 6a ations on the clepsydra, whereby [We] could [secure] permanent peace for the clan [ruling] the state. We mistakenly listened to the advice of [Hsia] Ho-liang and the others, hoping to obtain blessings for [all] within the [four] seas. [But] in the end there was no happy verification [of their promises]; they have all gone contrary to the Classics, turned their backs on ancient [practises], and are not in accordance with the needs of the times. The decree of the July 13 sixth month and [the day] chia-tzu, except for the order of an amnesty, is all expunged. [Hsia] Ho-liang and the others have gone contrary to the [right] Way and misled the crowd; they are to be committed [the charge of] the high officials." They all suffered [death] for their crimes. The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Chu] Po, the Grandee Secretary, [Chao] HsÃ¼an2a, and the Marquis of K'ung-hsiang, [Fu4] Yen, had committed crimes; [Chu] Po Sept. 216.2 6.2 HS 19 B: 49a. killed himself, [Chao] HsÃ¼an's death-[penalty] was reduced by three6.3 6.3 The present text and the Han-chi 28: 7b read "two degrees"; but HS 83: 17a4 and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 34: 5b read "three degrees." Hu San-hsing explains, "[Whoever]" has his capital punishment reduced three degrees, becomes a convict servitor or concubine." These three officials had conspired, at the instigation of the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager nee Fu, to have her nephew, Fu Hsi, dismissed. The latter was the most capable member of the Fu clan, but had opposed elevating the title of the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager. Cf. Glossary, sub Chu Po. degrees, and [Fu4] Yen was sentenced to have one-fourth of the households [in his estate] cut off. A discussion is in the "Memoir of 83: 16a-17a [Chu] Po."6.4 6.4 HS 27 Ca: 18b says, "In Chien-p'ing II, in the [Commandery] of Ting-hsiang, a male horse bore a colt with three legs, which followed the herd in drinking and eating." Ibid. 19b says, "In [the period] Chien-p'ing, in the [Commandery] of YÃ¼-chang, there was a boy who metamorphosed and became a girl, was married, became a man's wife, and gave birth to a child." III In the third year, in the spring, the first month, 33HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing III 11: 6a, b [the Emperor] made [Liu] Kuang-hana, the younger 4 B.C. 4 B.C. brother of King Yi of Kuang-tÃª, [Liu YÃ¼n-k'o], the Jan./Feb. King of Kuang-p'ing. 6b 5b 6b On [the day] kuei-mao, there was a fire in the Feb. 17 Main Hall of the Kuei Palace where the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu] lived.6.5 6.5 HS 27 A: 16a says it was in the Hall of Vast Peace in that palace. In the third month, on [the day] chi-yu, the Lieutenant Apr. 24 Chancellor [P'ing] Tang died. A comet appeared in the [constellation] Ho-ku.6.6 6.6 Williams lists this comet as no. 53. In the summer, the sixth month, [the Emperor] July/Aug. established the Marquis of Wu-hsiang, [Liu] Min3a, the son of King Ch'ing of Lu, [Liu Feng1], as King [of Lu]. In the winter, the eleventh month, on [the day] jen-tzu, [the Emperor] reestablished the Altar to the Dec. 23 Supreme [One] at the Kan-ch'Ã¼an [Palace] and the Temple to Sovereign Earth at Fen-yin [as places for regular imperial sacrifices] and disestablished [the places in] the southern and northern suburbs [for the suburban sacrifices].6.7 6.7 These places had been last reestablished by the Empress Dowager nee Wang in Apr., 7 B.C. Cf. 10: 16a. The King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu] YÃ¼n2a, [Liu] YÃ¼n2a's Queen, Yeh, and Fang, the Lady of Marquis Kung of An-ch'eng [Wang Ch'ung2a], had all committed crimes; [Liu] YÃ¼n2a killed himself; Yeh and Fang were publicly executed.6.8 6.8 These women had tried by magical means to bring about the death of Emperor Ai, in order that Liu YÃ¼n2a might become Emperor. Cf. Glossary, sub Liu YÃ¼n2a. HS 27 Bb: 17b says, "In Chien-p'ing III, at P'ing-tu in the [Commandery] of Tung-lai there were produced seven large fish, 80 feet long and 11 feet high, all of whom died." They were probably whales. In the fourth year, in the spring, [the first IV month],6.9 6.9 Wang Nien-sun remarks that HS 27 Ca: 22a, in recounting this matter, prefaces it with "In the first month"; the next event in 11: 6b is prefaced with "in the second month"; the Han-chi 29: 1a also prefaces its account with "in the first month"; hence these words should be in this passage too. This interesting soteriological religion is described in two other passages, which are appended here: HS 27 Ca: 22a says, "In Chien-p'ing IV, the first month, the common people were excited and ran, [each] holding a stalk of straw or of hemp, carrying them on and passing them to one another, saying, `I am transporting the wand of [the goddess's edict].' Those who passed along and met on the roads were as many as thousands. Some let down their hair and walked barefoot. Some at night broke door-bars and some climbed over walls, entering [houses]. Some rode chariots or on horseback, galloping fast, making [themselves] post-messengers to transmit and transport [the wands]. They passed and traveled thru 26 commanderies or kingdoms and came to the imperial capital. "That summer, in the imperial capital, the common people of the commanderies and kingdoms met together in the wards, lanes, and foot-paths, making sacrifices and setting out utensils for tablets [like dice to throw lots, probably for divination], singing and dancing, sacrificing to the Mother Queen of the West. They also transmitted a written message which said, `The Mother informs her people that those who wear this writing will not die. Let those who do not believe my words look below their door hinges, where there will be white hairs.' In the autumn it stopped." HS 26: 59b adds, "In [Chien-p'ing], the fourth year, the first month, the second month, and the third month [Feb.-May], the common people frightened each other, crying out and running, transmitting wands [containing] the edict [of the goddess], and sacrificing to the Mother Queen of the West. They also said, `People with eyes [placed] vertically will come.' " Tu Yeh interpreted this event as portending weakness in the government, because of its domination by the evil Ting and Fu clans. Pan Ku says that the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang and Wang Mang responded to this portent when he destroyed the Ting and Fu clans. Cf. 27 Ca: 22a, b.

East of the 3 B.C. [Han-ku] Pass the common people carried in procession Feb./Mar. 34HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing IV 3 B.C. the wands of the Mother Queen of the West. 11: 6b, 7a They passed thru commanderies and kingdoms and went west thru the [Han-ku] Pass to the imperial capital. The common people [there] also collected and sacrificed to the Mother Queen of the West. Some by night took fire up on top of buildings, beat drums, and cried out, exciting and frightening one another. 7a In the second month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed a Mar./Apr. younger cousin of the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu], the Palace Attendant, Fu Shang, as Marquis of Ju-ch'ang, and the son of a younger [half]-brother of the [Emperor's Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Fu] by the same mother, the Palace 7a Attendant Cheng Yeh, as Marquis of Yang-hsin. In 35HSIAO-AI, Chien-p'ing IV 11: 7a the third month, the Palace Attendant and Chief 3, 2 B.C. Apr. Commandant of Attendant Cavalry, Tung Hsien2a, the Imperial Household Grandee, Hsi-fu Kung, and the [former] Grand Administrator of Nan-yang [Commandery], Sun Ch'ung, were all enfeoffed as full marquises because they had informed on the King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu YÃ¼n2a]. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Tung] Hsien2a." 93: 9a In the summer, the fifth month, [the Emperor] June/ granted noble titles to [officials ranking from] fully two thousand piculs to those of six hundred piculs, also to the males of the empire. In the sixth month, July/. he honored the Emperor's Grand Empress Dowager [nee Fu, with the title,] August Grand Empress Dowager. 6a In the autumn, the eighth month, there was a Sept./ visitation [of fire] to the North Gate of the Funerary Park for Sovereign Kung, [Liu K'ang]. In the winter, an imperial edict [ordered] the Winte generals and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs to recommend those who understood military affairs and who had great plans [for the empire's future].7.1 7.1 This edict is quoted in greater detail in 45: 17a, b. In [the period] YÃ¼an-shou, the first year, in the I spring, the first month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the 2 B.C. first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the Feb. 5 sun.7.2 7.2 Cf. Appendix II for eclipses. This eclipse brought about the downfall of Sun Ch'ung and Hsi-fu Kung (45: 17b, 18a) and served to bring K'ung Kuang and Wang Mang back to the capital (81: 18b, 19a; 99 A: 3b). Pao HsÃ¼an recommended that Tung Hsien2a also be sent away and that Ho Wu, Shih1 Tan, P'eng HsÃ¼an, and Fu Hsi be recalled (72: 24a). The imperial edict said, "We have been permitted to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples, 36HSIAO-AI, YÃ¼an-shou I 2 B.C. and, [altho We are] neither wise nor clever, [We 11: 7a, b have] toiled day and night, taking no leisure for repose. Nevertheless, the Yin and Yang have not been in accord, so that the great multitude do not have enough [to live on]. We have not yet perceived [where lies] the blame for this [state of affairs], and have frequently [ordered Our] ministers to be attentive [to their duties], expecting that [We] might have hopes [of improvement in the government. But] to the present, the high officials, in administering the laws, have not yet attained [Our] goal [of good government]. Some esteem oppressiveness and cruelty and utilize the power [of the government] to obtain fame, while gentle and good, magnanimous and forgiving [people] fall into destruction 7b and extinction. For this reason murderous brigands have increased more and more, while harmony and concord have daily declined, the people are resentful, and have no place to repose themselves. "Recently on the first day of the first month there was an eclipse of the sun. The blame for that [event] is not far [to seek]âit lies upon Ourself. 7b Let the ministers and grandees each do their utmost and make all efforts to lead the officials, taking care to appoint benevolent persons and to degrade and send far away injurious villains, with the purpose of securing tranquillity for the common people. They should make Our faults known and not be silent about anything. Let them, with the generals, the full marquises, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs, each recommend one person who is capable and good, sincere and upright, and able to speak frankly. A general amnesty [is granted to] the empire." 37HSIAO-AI, YÃ¼an-shou I, II 11: 7b, 8a On [the day] ting-szu, the August Grand Empress 2, 1 B.C. Feb. 21 Dowager nee Fu died. In the third month, the Lieutenant Chancellor Apr./May [Wang] Chia1a who had committed a crime, was 6b sent to prison, where he died.7.3 7.3 Wang Chia1a was a capable and loyal official, who prevented Emperor Ai from promoting and enriching his catamite, Tung Hsien2a. After an amnesty, he recommended some officials whom the Emperor had previously dismissed, so he was accused of having misdirected the state and misled the Emperor, which was an inhuman crime. He was sent to prison, where he starved to death. In 4 A.D., Wang Mang had him listed as a faithful minister. This judicial murder was perhaps Emperor Ai's greatest crime. In the autumn, the ninth month, the Commander-in-chief Oct. and General of Agile Cavalry, Ting Ming, was dismissed. The bronze tortoise and snake door-knocker heads on the gate to the Hall in the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-yÃ¼an cried out. In the second year,7.4 7.4 Chang Chao (1691-1745) remarks that the Academy ed. (1124) prefixes "YÃ¼an-shou" to the words "second year," the use of which words is contrary to the practise of the history, hence they are an interpolation. in the spring, the first month, 8a the Shan-yÃ¼ of the Huns and the Greater K'un-mi 1 B.C. of the Wu-sun came to pay court. In the second Feb./Mar. month, they returned to their states. The Shan-yÃ¼ Mar./Apr. was not pleased. A discussion is in the "Memoir of 8a the Huns."8.1 8.1 Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 11a (following HS 94 B: 14b) points out that the Shan-yÃ¼ was not pleased because he had been lodged in the Grape Lodge of the Shang-lin Park in order that the planet Jupiter might repress and overcome the evil influences the Shan-yÃ¼ had brought with him in coming from the north (Yin). Cf. de Groot, Die Hunnen, p. 261, n. 1. 94B: 14b, In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] June 20 jen-hsu,8.2 8.2 The text reads jen-ch'en, but calculation shows that ch'en is an error for hsÃ¼. Cf. App. II, ii. the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. In the fifth month, [the titles of] the three highest June/July ministers were corrected and their duties divided: the Commander-in-chief and General of the Guard, Tung 38HSIAO-AI, YÃ¼an-shou II 1 B.C. Hsien2a, became the Commander-in-chief; the Lieu- 11: 8a, b tenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, became the Grand Minister of the Masses; and the Grandee Secretary, P'eng HsÃ¼an, became the Grand Minister of Works.8.3 8.3 Hu San-hsing, in a note to the Tzu-chih T'ing-chien 35: 11a, explains, "The division of duties was that the Commander-in-chief took charge of military matters, the Grand Minister of the Masses took charge of matters concerning the people, and the Grand Minister of Works took charge of matters concerning the waters and the earth." The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the Chiang-nan text (prob. x-xiii cent.) has before the . [The latter] was enfeoffed as Marquis of Ch'ang-p'ing. The duties of the Director of Uprightness and the Director of the Retainers were to be corrected, and a Minister of Brigands was to be created. Before the matter was settled, in the sixth month, Aug. 15 on [the day] mou-wu, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang 8b Palace. In the autumn, the tenth8.4 8.4 The present text says "ninth month," but Huang lists no jen-yin day in that month. Fu Tsan, in a note, says that from the death to the burial was to the 105th day. Szu-ma Kuang, in his Tzu-chih T'ung-chien K'ao-yi 2, 9b notes that the 105th day after the death was in the tenth month, so emends "ninth" to "tenth." I have adopted that suggestion. Han-chi 29: 13b dates the burial in the ninth month, on the day jen-ch'en, which is also impossible, for Huang also puts that day in the tenth month. month, Nov. 27 on [the day] jen-yin, he was buried in the Yi Tomb. In eulogy we say: When [Emperor] Hsiao-ai was a tributary king and then entered the palace of the Heir-apparent, his vocabulary was large8.5 8.5 A phrase reminiscent of SC 47: 84 (= Mh V, 421), where the Spring and Autumn is said to be "condensed in its language, but extensive in its allusiveness." and intelligent, [so that even when] he was young, he [had 7a already] obtained a good renown. He observed the period of [Emperor] Hsiao-ch'eng, when `blessings left the' imperial `house'8.6 8.6 A quotation from Analects XVI, iii. and [the Emperor's] power was transferred to his maternal [relatives]. For this reason, when [Emperor Ai] attended court, he frequently executed his great officials, seeking to strengthen the might of the ruler and to imitate 8b [Emperors] Wu and HsÃ¼an. In his nature he did 39HSIAO-AI 11: 8b not care for music or women. At times he watched boxing,8.7 8.7 HS 70: 5a says that Kan Yen-shou "was examined in boxing and made an Attendant at the Gate." Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) and Su Lin (fl. 196-227) say that pien or is . archery, and military sports. When he ascended the throne, he had arthritis,8.8 8.8 Ju Shun comments, "The pronunciation of wei is that of the fan-jui cross-bow. The sickness in which one cannot cross his two feet is called wei." Yen Shih-ku says that fan-jui is the name of a cross-bow and means to press with both feet. Shen Ch'in-han adds, "In stretching this cross-bow one has to use the feet, hence it became the name of the cross-bow." These were probably the extremely stout crossbows used by "skilled soldiers." and in his latter years [his arthritis] gradually became worse. He did not long enjoy the rule. How sad!8.9 8.9 A pun; the word for "sad" is ai, the Emperor's posthumous name. 40 APPENDIX I THE CUSTOM OF MOURNING TO THE THIRD YEAR The custom of mourning for parents to the third year was urged by Confucius,1 1 Analects XVII, xxi. seemingly because it reinforced the virtue of filial piety.2 2 Dubs, HsÃ¼ntze, the Moulder, p. 148 ff. It was vehemently attacked by Moh-tzu,3 3 Y. P. Mei, The Works of Motse, ch. 25. and defended by Mencius4 4 Mencius, III, I, ii, 2 (Legge, p. 236). and HsÃ¼n-tzu.5 5 Dubs, The Works of HsÃ¼ntze, p. 239 ff. However, even in the state of Lu at the time of Mencius, it was still an uncommon practise. When he urged it upon the Duke of T'eng, after the death of Duke T'ing, the court advisors memorialized the Duke saying, "None of the former princes of Lu, which kingdom we honor, observed [this practise of mourning to the third year], neither have any of our own former princes observed it."6 6 Mencius, III, I, ii, 3 (Legge, p. 237). In its extreme form, when the son spent his time weeping and in partial fasting, cutting himself off from his usual pursuits, this custom could only have originated among aristocrats, for no one else had the leisure to devote two years and more to such a practise. This custom of mourning to the third year seems to have remained a specifically Confucian practise. Emperor Wen, in his posthumous edict of 157 B.C., condemned it and limited mourning for an emperor to the thirty-sixth day after his burial.7 7 HS 4: 20a; HFHD I, 270, n. 3. That period was thereafter adopted by officials in mourning for their own parents.8 8 HS 84: 4b. Even the famous Confucian bibliophile, Liu TÃª, King Hsien of Ho-chien (d. 130 B.C.), seems not to have followed the custom of mourning to the third year. We have the citation of his deeds by his Commandant of the Capital,9 9 HS 53: 2a, b. and it says nothing about his having mourned to the third year, even though he is said to have cultivated Confucian practises in his rites and robes. Thus the attack of Moh-tzu upon the Confucian mourning rites and Emperor Wen's condemnation of this practise seems to have led the Confucians themselves to dispense with this practise until their doctrine secured an 41chapter xi unchallenged hold upon official China. It remained quite uncommon to the end of the first century B.C., for in 7 B.C. Emperor Ai considered this practise unusual and so meritorious that he rewarded King Hui of Ho-chien, Liu Liang, a descendant of King Hsien, by a complimentary edict and an increase by ten thousand households in the size of his kingdom, for having mourned to the third year for his mother, the Queen Dowager.10 10 HS 11: 2b. In the same year Erudits and their Disciples, who were the teachers in the Confucian Imperial University, were allowed to take leave to the third year to mourn for their parents.11 11 HS 11: 3b. The practise of mourning to the third year seems thus to have first been propagated widely during the latter part of the first century B.C. The Han dynasty stressed filial piety in many ways. The Classic of Filial Piety was a textbook studied by all; the Han Emperors (except the first) were all given the word "hsiao , filially pious" as the first part of their posthumous names. They made occasional grants to Filially Pious people and had persons recommended for the bureaucracy because of their filial piety. Emperor Ai considered a lack of filial conduct as sufficient grounds for dismissing even the highest official.12 12 Cf. Glossary, sub Ho Wu. Hence it is quite natural, when Confucianism came to be well established and an attempt was made to fulfil all its requirements, that the practise of mourning to the third year should have been revived and adopted by those who were careful in their Confucianism and had the leisure to follow this custom. Yet the practise was slow in spreading. It was not until Jan. 1, 117 A.D. that the Empress nee Teng, while ruling for Emperor An, "for the first time permitted high officials, [those ranking at] two thousand piculs, and Inspectors to perform the mourning to the third year,"13 13 HHS, An. 5: 12b. at the end of which time they were returned to their former posts. This provision was confirmed by later emperors. At the suggestion of Ch'en Chung,14 14 HHS, Mem. 36: 13b. on Dec. 25, 120, Emperor An "again decided that high officials [and those ranking at] two thousand piculs and over should wear mourning to the third year."15 15 HHS, An. 5: 16a. The actual period was twenty-five months.16 16 HHS, Mem. 36: 13a. In 154, 42CHAPTER XI Emperor Huan "again permitted Inspectors [and officials ranking at] two thousand piculs to perform the mourning to the third year,"17 17 HHS, An. 7: 6b. and in Apr./May 159 he "again decided that Inspectors [and officials ranking at] two thousand piculs should perform the mourning to the third year."18 18 Ibid., 8b. Thus only at the end of the Later Han period was the mourning to the third year performed by the high officials as an example to the empire. 43 APPENDIX II ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR AI i. In YÃ¼an-shou I, i (the first month), on the day hsin-ch'ou, the first day of the month, an eclipse of the sun is recorded (11: 7a). HS 27 Cb: 16a adds, "It was not total, [but] like a hook, and was 10 degrees in [the constellation] Ying-shih, in the same month and day as that in the seventh year of Emperor Hui." Huang, Concordance des chronologies nÃ©omÃ©niques, gives this date as Feb. 5, 2 B.C., for which day Oppolzer, Canon der Finsternisse, calculates his solar eclipse no. 2879. He charts the path of totality as passing along the Yangtze River. Calculation of this eclipse according to Neugebauer, Astronomische Chronologie, shows that at Ch'ang-an it reached a magnitude (totality = 1.00) of 0.85 at 7:45 a.m. local time, and that the path of totality passed through the present Lhassa, Southern Szechuan, southern Hunan and Foochow. The sun was in longitude 314Â° = 317Â° R.A. The first and principal star in Ying-shih, ?, Pegasi was then in 319Â° R.A. It is interesting that a total eclipse was not reported when it went so far south. In the 10 years between this and the preceding recorded eclipse, no solar eclipses were visible in China. ii. HS 11: 8a states, in YÃ¼an-shou II, "the summer, fourth month, on [the day] jen-ch'en, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun." Han-chi 29: 12b merely states, "In the summer, the fourth month, there was an eclipse of the sun." HS 27 Cb: 16a however states, "In [YÃ¼an-shou] II, the third month, on [the day] jen-ch'en, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun." Huang gives no jen-ch'en day in the fourth month, but makes that day the last day of the third month, May 21, 1 B.C. He gives the last day of the fourth month as a jen-hsÃ¼ day, June 20, 1 B.C., for which day Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2882. He gives none for the other date. Calculation of this partial eclipse by Neugebauer's tables shows that it reached a magnitude of 0.06 at sunset, 5:08 p.m. local time at Ch'ang-an. It is then evident that jen-ch'en is a mistaken reading for jen-hsÃ¼ (a natural error), and that someone who knew that jen-ch'en could not have been the last day of the fourth month corrected the record in ch. 27. Astronomers must have been looking for this eclipse, else they would not have perceived it. In the 16 months between this and the preceding recorded eclipses, no solar eclipses were visible in China.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">44 THE HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY CHAPTER XII EMPEROR HSIAO-P'ING INTRODUCTION Summary of the period The reign of Emperor P'ing (1 B.C.-A.D. 6), is the period during which Wang Mang consolidated his control of the government in such a fashion that he could not later be removed. Emperor P'ing was only in his ninth year when he came to the throne and he died before he was capped (the ceremony marking the attainment of a youth's majority), so that during this whole period Wang Mang actually wielded the imperial authority. He eliminated the influence of any imperial relatives, except his own clan. He raised himself from one honor to another by the ingenious use of Confucian humility. He married his daughter to the Emperor, against the opposition of the Grand Empress Dowager. He secured the loyal cooperation of Confucians, especially the famous Liu Hsin1a. This period was thus one of conspicuous success on the part of Wang Mang. After Emperor P'ing had died, Wang Mang was charged with regicide, but that allegation may have been merely propaganda. These matters will be discussed seriatim. The nature of this "Annals" This chapter, like the other "Imperial Annals," does not pretend to be what we would call a history of the period. It is actually an expanded chronological summary, useful for purposes of convenient reference. The actual history is to be found in the other parts of this large book, especially in the "Memoirs," and most of all in the "Memoir of Wang Mang," a translation of which is appended to this chapter. The part of that "Memoir" devoted to these six years is more than twice as long as are these "Imperial Annals." That "Memoir" should accordingly be read in connection with these "Imperial Annals." Wang Mang's orderly solution of a dynastic crisis This reign began with a dynastic crisis, for at the death of Emperor Ai there was no heir to the throne. Emperor Wen had established the dynastic practice that the reigning Emperor designates one of his sons as his successor by making him Heir-apparent (4: 5b-6b). Emperor Ai 45THE DYNASTIC CRISIS however had no sons and appointed no Heir-apparent. There were, moreover, no living descendants of his predecessor, Emperor Ch'eng. Fortunately such a crisis had occurred twice before in Han Times: at the death of the Empress Dowager nee LÃ¼ and at the death of Emperor Chao. Each time the high officials had deliberated over the matter and had selected the nearest suitable relative of the deceased monarch. Ho Kuang had legitimized his choices of emperors by enacting them in imperial edicts issued by the Empress Dowager. Wang Mang followed this precedent: he selected the grandson and only surviving descendant of Emperor YÃ¼an, Liu Chi-tzu, a first cousin of Emperor Ai, and enthroned him. This boy was only in his ninth year, so could not rule in person; the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang, his step-grandmother, who, as the "mother of the dynasty" and regent, had been ruling for the two months between the death and the enthronement, continued to attend court and decide matters. She entrusted the government to Wang Mang, her grand-nephew, who was now in his forty-fifth year. Wang Mang's revenge upon Emperor Ai's maternal relatives Before the new Emperor was enthroned, Wang Mang began his revenge upon Emperor Ai's maternal relatives, who had previously turned Wang Mang out of power and out of the court. The Empress Dowagers nee Fu and nee Ting had both died; the only lady remaining of their clans was the Empress nee Fu of Emperor Ai. She had had no children, so Wang Mang had the Grand Empress Dowager issue an edict commanding the Empress to retire to another palace, because of the crimes of her elder cousin, the deceased Empress Dowager nee Fu. Some months later she was dismissed from her rank and made a commoner, whereupon she committed suicide. At the death of Emperor Ai, the Fu and Ting clans possessed no male relatives who could intercede with the ruler for them, hence these clans became helpless. Fu Yen, the brother of the Empress Dowager, was dismissed from his marquisate and exiled to Ho-p'u Commandery, in the southernmost peninsula of the present Kuangtung. The members of the Ting clan were sent back to their natal commanderies. The Grand Empress Dowager nee Fu and the Empress Dowager nee Ting were posthumously degraded in their titles and merely entitled the Mother (nee Fu) of King Kung of Ting-t'ao and the [Royal] Concubine nee Ting. In 5 A.D., Wang Mang argued the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang into permitting him to have the tombs of these two ladies opened, their official seals taken away and destroyed, the body of the lady nee Fu transported from the capital to Ting-t'ao, and to have them 46CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION both reburied in simple wooden coffins, like concubines (which had been their original rank). Their tumuli were levelled and thorns were planted at these places. Wang Mang did not forget an injury. The Empress Dowager nee Chao was degraded and removed from the imperial palace at the same time as was the Empress nee Fu. This famous beauty, Chao Fei-yen, was the sister of the Favorite Beauty nee Chao, who had been responsible for Emperor Ch'eng's infanticides. She would have been punished for her sister's crimes when they were discovered at the beginning of Emperor Ai's reign, except for the fact that Emperor Ai was indebted to her. Wang Mang was not so indebted, and had her removed to the palace for dismissed empresses. She was later dismissed from her title, whereupon she too committed suicide. The dynastic principle that there should be only one imperial line of descent Probably Wang Mang's motive in removing these ladies was not merely revenge, but also to eliminate the evil effect of imperial maternal relatives in the court. He was not willing to yield up his power to a new clan. The moral corruption, extravagance, and misuse of the government to enrich themselves on the part of the Wang and Chao clans in the reign of Emperor Ch'eng and of the Fu and Ting clans in the reign of Emperor Ai had convinced many intelligent persons that imperial maternal relatives were injurious to the state. When, at the death of Emperor Ai, the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang asked the ministers to recommend someone to control the government, the General of the Van, Ho Wu, and the General of the Left, Kung-sun Lu, had both become convinced that the government should be in the hands of neither the imperial clan nor of any imperial maternal clan. They therefore independently recommended each other for the post of Commander-in-chief. But this policy was contrary to the Confucian moral principle that people generally (including the ruler) should favor their relatives, and the circumstance that these two ministers recommended each the other proved fatal. The other ministers all recommended Wang Mang, who was accordingly given the position. Wang Mang had Ho Wu and Kung-sun Lu accused of plotting to advance each other; they were dismissed and sent to their homes. Four years later Ho Wu was arrested in connection with the affair of Wang YÃ¼, whereupon Ho Wu committed suicide. Because of his unhappy experience with the Fu and Ting clans, Wang Mang did not even allow the new Emperor's mother, the Concubine nee Wei, nor her relatives to come to the imperial capital. The Wei clan had previously been connected with the imperial court: it had furnished 47ONLY ONE IMPERIAL LINE ALLOWED Emperors HsÃ¼an and YÃ¼an each with a Favorite Beauty, who bore each a child, as well as furnishing a concubine for Emperor Ch'eng's half-brother. This latter girl was the mother of Liu Chi-tzu, Emperor P'ing. Wang Mang evidently feared the power of such a clan, which knew well the customs in the imperial court and had old connections in the capital. Instead of allowing this Wei clan to repeat the exploits of the Fu clan, Wang Mang had its members all kept in the kingdom of Chung-shan, where Liu Chi-tzu had been King. His intention was to establish the principle that there is only one imperial family, and that when, because of the failure of a natural heir, some scion from another branch of the imperial clan was elevated to the throne, this person should become exclusively a member of the imperial family, so that his own close relatives must not be considered close imperial relatives or treated as such. Thus the number of imperial maternal relatives, who might interfere in the government, was to be restricted (and the Wang clan continued in power without any rivals). Emperor Ch'eng had attempted to put this principle in force just before his death (possibly at the instigation of Wang Mang), but Emperor Ai, through the influence of his grandmother, had rejected and acted contrary to it. Wang Mang appointed another scion of the imperial clan as King of Chung-shan to act as the son of Liu Chi-tzu's father, and sent to his mother, the Concubine nee Wei, a royal seal and cord, installing her as the Queen of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, with a whole county as her private estate, from which she received the income. Her uncle and younger brother were both made Marquises of the Imperial Domain, and her three younger sisters were given the title of Baronetess, with an estate of two thousand households. Her first cousin was made Queen to the new King of Chung-shan. But honor and wealth would not make up to her for her absent son. Unlike the Concubine nee Ting, who, without objecting, allowed her son, Emperor Ai, to be taken from her, the Queen nee Wei was said to be disconsolate, weeping day and night for her child, who had no near relative by him to guard or care for him. Wang YÃ¼, Wang Mang's eldest son, disapproved of his father's policy. He was afraid that there would come to be a feud between the Wei and Wang clans, which would be disastrous to the Wang clan when the new Emperor came of age. Wang YÃ¼ secretly communicated with the Wei clan, urging them to ask permission to come to the imperial court. Wang YÃ¼'s clique furthermore attempted to terrify Wang Mang into acceding to their request by playing upon his superstition with false portents (99 A: 16a, b). When the matter was discovered (A.D. 3), Wang Mang had 48CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION his son executed, together with the Wei clan and hundreds of others. Only Liu Chi-tzu's mother was left alive, retaining her title and estate. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, she was dismissed from her title and made a commoner; a year or so later she died. Thus Wang Mang was left unchallenged in control of the imperial court. The nature of Wang Mang's position and power During the reign of Emperor P'ing, Wang Mang was not the legal ruler of the state, but merely its most important minister. He was the Commander-in-chief and Intendant of Affairs of the Masters of Writing, who could be dismissed at will by the actual regent, the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang. By this time, the Commander-in-chief concerned himself little with the army; this official had become the dominating minister in the civil government. He made appointments in the bureaucracy, cited officials for promotion or demotion, proposed governmental policies, and acted as chief consultant to the ruler. The other ministers had become for the most part virtual executive officers to the Commander-in-chief. The latter's authority over the other ministers was exercised by memorializing the throne that they be ordered to execute certain policies, and then advising the throne to consent to the proposal. Since the rejection of an important official's advice in an important matter meant that this official must resign or be dismissed, a great official was consequently often reluctant to offer advice, and, when asked to do so, often allowed less important members of the court to propose the policy he favored. At the same time, this custom made the throne very reluctant to refuse an important minister's advice, since the throne might find it difficult to discover another person who would be as suitable as the dismissed minister. Thus a minister could sometimes compel the throne to accept an unwelcome policy. On the other hand, under an aggressive ruler, ministers could frequently be dismissed and sometimes punished for offering suggestions that were unpleasant to the throne. Thus Wang Mang could wield the imperial power, even though he was not actually the regent. The Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang had no taste for ruling; she was a quiet old lady, who upheld the best traditions of Chinese wifely virtue, being loyal to her husband and her relatives, complaisant to her husband's relatives, going her own quiet way without interfering with others. She had originally supported Wang Mang in 8 B.C. because her brother, Wang Ken, had recommended him as Commander-in-chief. But she was not altogether blind to his faults, and did not trust him completely. 49WANG MANG'S RISE Since she was a woman, she was immured in her palace, and Wang Mang saw to it that only those favorable to him had access to her. Thus she was brought around to accede to his plans. How Wang Mang established himself securely and obtained a following Wang Mang's gradual rise in power and popularity is so well recounted in his "Memoir" that it is unnecessary to repeat it here. It will be sufficient to point out the steps he took and the general principles upon which he operated, stressing nuances that may not be so clear to a casual reader and mentioning facts not found in these two chapters. When Wang Mang was first put into power, he took care to surround himself with people whom he could influence. The pliant K'ung Kuang, a descendant of Confucius, had been Grand Minister Over the Masses and had recommended Wang Mang to the Grand Empress Dowager. Wang Mang treated him respectfully, retained him in office, and promoted his son-in-law, Chen Han, who later became one of Wang Mang's intimate followers. Wang Mang also attached Wang Shun4b to himself, because the latter was loved and trusted by the Grand Empress Dowager. This man was a son of the Grand Empress Dowager's first cousin who had been the Commander-in-chief, Wang Yin. Then Wang Mang proceeded to get rid of his possible opponents. The person whose influence with the Grand Empress Dowager Wang Mang most feared was Wang Li5a, who was own half-brother to her and her closest living relative. There was also her nephew, Wang Jen, a son of Wang T'an2b, another half-brother of the Grand Empress Dowager. Wang Jen bore the same relationship to her that Wang Mang did. Both Wang Li5a and Wang Jen were courageous and plain-speaking; as close relatives they had access to her, so that Wang Mang needed to remove them in order to establish his own power securely. Wang Li5a was perhaps the worst reprobate in the Wang clan, so much so that he had been passed over when, in the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, the post of Commander-in-chief had been passed about among the brothers of the Grand Empress Dowager. Wang Mang prepared a petition to the Grand Empress Dowager, enumerating the crimes of Wang Li5a and Wang Jen, and had Chen Han take it to K'ung Kuang, with the request that he memorialize those matters in his own name. K'ung Kuang was timid and did not like to refuse, so did as he was told. Wang Mang liked to act by indirection; he would hint to his followers what he wanted done and allow them to propose these matters for action. Then he could 50CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION approve or disapprove as the circumstances dictated and yet not seem to have been taking the initiative. When the petition regarding Wang Li5a and Wang Jen reached the Grand Empress Dowager, Wang Mang advised her to assent to it. When she did not want to part with her last independent sources of information, Wang Mang insisted, putting her in the position of either having to reject K'ung Kuang and himself or send away her brother and nephew. She yielded, and thus gave herself into the control of Wang Mang. Three years later, Wang Mang involved Wang Li5a and Wang Jen in the affair of Wang YÃ¼, and compelled them both to commit suicide. Thus Wang Mang, partly by persuasion and partly by a relentless use of the governmental power, eliminated any possible rivals. He filled the court with his own followers, eliminating all who would oppose him. Most of the bureaucracy willingly followed Wang Mang. He was the legal deputy of the imperial power; the custom of delegating the imperial power to the outstanding imperial maternal relative had regularly been practised for half a century, consequently it may be said to have become part of the (unwritten) constitution. The people had been trained to follow the imperial authority, so that any reforms, short of a rebellion, had to be authenticated by the emperor. Power and wealth lay in the giving of Wang Mang, hence few officials were willing to refuse his leadership. Only a very few of the more squeamish officials, in particular the Grand Minister of Works, P'eng HsÃ¼n, and his successor, Wang Ch'ung2b, were willing to sacrifice their careers because of their dislike for the way Wang Mang was doing things. These two in succession asked to resign. They had not actually opposed Wang Mang and were respected by intelligent people, so he had to allow them to go. But he disliked their leaving and refused to bestow upon them the parting gifts customarily given at the resignation of an honored official. They could merely retire from the court to their homes and keep quiet about their opinions. Wang Mang distributed noble titles and positions liberally to his loyal followers and was praised on all sides. How Wang Mang secured unprecedented honors and popularity No sooner had Wang Mang established his followers in the bureaucracy than he proceeded to seek for fame and popular support. The method he employed was an ingenious use of a Confucian principle: the virtue of yielding to others. He induced his followers to demand certain honors for him from the throne and then systematically refused those honors. The custom of first refusing great honors had long been used. Emperor 51WANG MANG'S POPULARITY Kao refused the throne thrice when it was offered to him (Mh II, 380). Emperor Wen refused it five times (HS 4: 4a). Emperor Ai thought it best to refuse at first (11: 1b). Wang Mang excelled them all in humility by refusing, not at merely five times, but firmly and stubbornly. Confucian tradition contained the statement that when the Duke of Chou, so honored by Confucius and his followers, was regent for the infant King Ch'eng, someone from the YÃ¼eh-shang brought a white pheasant as tribute. Wang Mang, who in his youth had made a thorough study of Confucianism and its traditions, had the officials in the southernmost Chinese commandery reminded of this fact, and, at the first New Year's court of the new reign, some persons who called themselves YÃ¼eh-shang accordingly appeared with an albino pheasant. No Chinese or member of the Office for Interpreting (Yi-guan) at the court could understand their language, so that it had to be translated by a succession of interpreters before it could be rendered into Chinese. To such distant regions had Wang Mang's virtue penetrated! It made quite a stir at the court. The Confucians were pleased to recognize this obscure tradition, and the courtiers likened Wang Mang to Ho Kuang, who had so nobly conducted the dynasty through the minority of Emperors Chao and HsÃ¼an, and to the Duke of Chou himself. Thus was confirmed Mencius' statement (IV, B, i, 3) that at intervals of a thousand years, like sages appear. When the Grand Empress Dowager hinted her suspicions, the courtiers had the opportunity of lauding Wang Mang to the skies, and proposed that Wang Mang should be given the title of Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. At that time, the two highest existing noble titles were King and Marquis. The title of king was given only to sons of emperors and their heirs who succeeded them. Outside the Liu clan there were no kings. The Han dynasty had not previously enfeoffed any dukes, so that this title elevated Wang Mang above all the other nobles except the dozen-odd kings. When Wang Mang insistently refused this honor, keeping to his bed in order to avoid it, and the petitioners insisted that it should be granted to him, the Grand Empress Dowager was advised and forced to do as Wang Mang had planned: to grant high honors to Wang Mang's associates, K'ung Kuang, Wang Shun4b, Chen Feng, and Chen Han, and then to grant still higher honors to Wang Mang, before he could be induced to rise and accept his title. He still however refused some of her grants, and advised her instead to bestow titles and grants upon members of the imperial clan and common people. Thus Wang Mang, by the simple device of obdurantly refusing honors, was enabled, without seeming to 52CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION take the initiative, to secure important grants for his followers and also to avoid the jealousy of the imperial clan and people by having additional grants bestowed upon them. A more effective means to popularity could hardly have been found. When this scheme had been so successful, Wang Mang sought for plenary power in the government. He again hinted his desires to his associates. At their suggestions, the Grand Empress Dowager, who did not want to be disturbed by the details of government, easily granted to Wang Mang full authority to decide all except the most important matters, such as enfeoffments to noble titles. She probably thought that this grant would make no practical difference in the government. Thus Wang Mang controlled the whole administration by right as well as in practise. He responded by having the Grand Empress Dowager make a great grant to the poor people and then lauding her extravagantly for it. In order to make himself a close relative of the reigning emperor, thus securing his position in case the Grand Empress Dowager should die, Wang Mang next planned to marry his daughter to the boy Emperor. Again he proceeded by indirection. He first proposed that the Emperor be married, in order that the imperial line be continued. The Grand Empress Dowager agreed, and ordered the presentation of suitable girls. It was the custom that the mother of the Emperor should choose his wife. The Grand Empress Dowager, who was the young Emperor's legal mother, did not approve of her nephew too whole-heartedly; Wang Mang was afraid that she would pass over his own daughter, so called attention to this girl by publicly refusing to offer her under a plea of humility. The Grand Empress Dowager really opposed the match in her heart and seems to have thought it would be a good thing to check his growing power by putting another clan in power, for she issued an edict withdrawing all girls of the Wang clan from the competition. But Wang Mang had become too popular. His daughter was of the right age; he outranked all other nobles in the empire, except those of the Liu clan, whose daughters could not be espoused because they bore the same surname as the Emperor; and he had acquired a great fame through his distribution of favors and grants to the people. It was then the custom that any one could come to the imperial palace and present petitions advising the ruler. Many families of those who hoped to enter the bureaucracy had moved to the capital commanderies, in order to study at the Imperial University or with the many Confucian masters who had congregated there, so that there was probably a larger proportion of literate persons in that region than elsewhere in the empire. These 53WANG MANG'S DAUGHTER MARRIED people hoped to attract the attention of the ministers and so attain office. Since Wang Mang controlled the giving of offices, and the proposal suited them, these people crowded to the portals of the Grand Empress Dowager at the rate of more than a thousand a day, offering petitions which protested that the daughter of Wang Mang was the most suitable person to be made the Empress. The ministers and grandees prostrated themselves in her courts, making similar requests. Wang Mang politely sent his personal attendants to turn them away, but the petitioners naturally paid no attention. Thus popular opinion, mobilized by Wang Mang's refusal, forced the Grand Empress Dowager to discontinue the competition among the girls and select Wang Mang's daughter. The other families were placated by selecting eleven of their girls as imperial concubines. It was an outstanding victory of intrigue, directed by a master mind, in which Wang Mang completely outmaneuvered his great-aunt. There was a Confucian tradition that in Chou times, when the Son of Heaven took a wife from a noble whose state was small, the Son of Heaven augmented that noble's fief to be at least a hundred li square, i.e., nine million mou or over four hundred thousand acres. A sycophant marquis of the Liu clan accordingly memorialized that Wang Mang's fief should be augmented to that size, and the courtiers added that he should be given two hundred million cash as a betrothal present. He declined both presents, accepting only forty million cash, and distributing most of that among the new imperial concubines. Then the courtiers said that he had not received enough, so he was given a further sum, whereupon he distributed part of it among his own poor relatives. After the marriage had been celebrated, the ministers likened Wang Mang to Yi Yin and the Duke of Chou, the two greatest ministers in ancient history, and proposed that Wang Mang be given the same title as they had had, that his sons be ennobled, and he be given honors similar to those the Duke of Chou had received. Wang Mang again refused, the matter was again debated by the ministers, and petitions again poured in from the people. His two remaining sons were made marquises, his mother was made a Baronetess, he was given an official title higher than any other previous minister, and a special seal with the title, "Ruling Governor, Grand Tutor, and Commander-in-chief." The other ministers were ordered to address him in special humble terms. Ten chariots and a host of elite troops and attendants formed his train. Altogether some 487,572 persons signed petitions, urging that he be honored. (This number was likely taken from a memorial to the Grand Empress Dowager, summarizing these documents.) Thus Wang Mang, by a showy Confucian humility 54CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION and generosity, captured the imaginations of the people. No one before his time and few since then have excited so much enthusiasm. How Wang Mang secured the loyalty of Liu Hsin1a Among those whose loyalty he secured was the famous scholar, Liu Hsin1a. Even after Wang Mang usurped the throne and took away imperial and royal honors from the Liu clan, Liu Hsin still remained loyal, until just before Wang Mang's death, when the mounting resentment against Wang Mang, together with an astrological portent and a prophecy, led Liu Hsin finally to head an abortive rebellion (cf. 99 C: 22b-24a). The fact that an outstanding member of the imperial clan and a famous Confucian scholar should have become one of Wang Mang's most loyal supporters and highest officials is so remarkable that it is worth while studying the means by which Wang Mang secured this man's loyalty. During the reign of Emperor Ch'eng (in 28-25 B.C.), Liu Hsin1a had been ordered to assist his father, Liu Hsiang4a, in cataloging the imperial private library. Emissaries were sent about the country to collect ancient manuscripts, and people were encouraged to present their books to the imperial library. Thus there was gathered the magnificent imperial collection, whose catalog, extracted from that published by Liu Hsin, is to be found in HS ch. 30, the "Treatise on Arts and Literature." In the course of this study, Liu Hsin came upon some books that had previously been neglected, particularly the Tso-chuan and some writings in ancient characters said to have been discovered about 150 B.C., when tearing down the wall of Confucius' house. These writings were said to have been presented to Emperor Wu about 100 B.C. by K'ung An-kuo. The ancient writings secured then or at other times included some 39 chapters of the lost Book of Rites (i.e., part of the present Chou-li), and 16 chapters of the Book of History. As a good Confucian, who esteemed everything that came from the ancient Chou period, Liu Hsin was deeply impressed, especially by the Tso-chuan. It was in the form of a commentary upon the Spring and Autumn, which latter was thought to have been compiled by Confucius. (The Tso-chuan, according to Maspero and Karlgren, actually dates from the end of the iv century B.C. It has been dated in Han times, but I see no adequate evidence for that dating. There are however doubtless minor interpolations datable in Han times, such as the data for the ancestry of Emperor Kao; cf. HFHD I, 148, n.1.) Tso Ch'iu-ming, its reputed author, is mentioned in the Analects; Liu Hsin1a argued, with a young man's enthusiasm, that Tso Ch'iu-ming had talked personally with Confucius, so that his commentary 55LIU HSIN'S LOYALTY on the Spring and Autumn should be elevated to a place above those by Kung-yang and Ku-liang, which had previously been the only authorized commentaries, for the latter authors had not known Confucius in person, hence were not so likely to have transmitted his conceptions. Liu Hsin sought out those persons who knew the traditional explanation of the Tso-chuan, studied with them, and made new discoveries by comparing its text with that of the Spring and Autumn. His father, Liu Hsiang, was however an adherent of the orthodox Ku-liang Commentary, and remained unimpressed by Liu Hsin's arguments. In his youth, Wang Mang had known Liu Hsin, as he had known every other person of any consequence in the capital. The two had been associated when they were Gentlemen at the Yellow Gate, and Wang Mang had been impressed by the scholar. When Emperor Ai came to the throne, Wang Mang recommended Liu Hsin to the new Emperor. He was given some honorary positions and asked to complete his father's work in the imperial private library. Liu Hsin now proposed to set up the books he esteemed as authoritative Confucian books for study in the Imperial University, i.e., as authoritative Classics: the Tso-chuan, the Mao text of the Book of Odes (the one now extant), the Chou-li, and the ancient text chapters from the Book of History. When this matter was presented to the Erudits, who were the professors in the Imperial University, they opposed the innovation, and did not even deign to discuss the matter. Liu Hsin felt the cut deeply, and sent a letter to the court, reproaching the Erudits bitterly. They resented his words, one eminent scholar even asking to resign. One of the three highest ministers, a Confucian scholar, was so enraged that Emperor Ai had to intervene in order to protect Liu Hsin. The latter left the court in order to save his life and spent the remainder of Emperor Ai's reign in disgrace as an administrator of distant commanderies. When Wang Mang came to power after the death of Emperor Ai, he recalled Liu Hsin and gave him an honorary position at the capital. Wang Mang then granted what Liu Hsin had been fighting forâthe establishment of the Tso-chuan, the Mao text of the Odes, the Chou-li, and the ancient text of the Book of History as authoritative subjects for study at the Imperial University and for the civil service examinations (88: 25b, 26a). Thus Liu Hsin became attached to Wang Mang through his Confucian loyalties. Wang Mang made him his Hsi-and-Ho, which was Wang Mang's title for the state treasurer, and had him build a Ming-t'ang and a Pi-yung, two Confucian ceremonial buildings. Thereupon he was made a marquis and was put in charge of divination, fixed 56CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION the calendar, and wrote out his famous San-t'ung astronomical theory. He became an influential advisor of Wang Mang, recommending the Confucian precedents that guided Wang Mang's conduct. He fixed the new regulations for officials' marriages, burials, betrothments, etc. Thus Wang Mang really gave Liu Hsin the opportunity to do his life's work and rewarded him with high office and great honors. In addition, the Confucian doctrine of the five elements, which had become accepted in part through the efforts of Liu Hsin's father, plainly pointed to Wang Mang as the next emperor. It is hence not surprising that when Wang Mang usurped the throne, Liu Hsin should have continued to be loyal. Most of the influential Confucians were likewise loyal to Wang Mang, because the latter had shown himself loyal to Confucian principles. He not only erected Confucian ceremonial buildings, he also enlarged the Imperial University, increasing the number of authorized classics and establishing five Erudits for each classic. Ten thousand houses were erected for its students, a thousand students and teachers were appointed, a market-place and government granary were established for this new town. Each year, a hundred of its best graduates were taken into the government service by competitive examination. In A.D. 4, Wang Mang also summoned to the capital all the teachers of the empire who had as many as eleven pupils, all those who could teach and explain ancient books on the classics, astronomy, divination, revelations, music, the calendar, military arts, and philology. Thus he gathered thousands of the most learned men in the empire, collected and supported them at the imperial palace, and made use of their learning. In the previous summer, he had ordered the establishment of public schools in commanderies, prefectures, districts, and even in villages; now he probably sent most of these teachers to the government schools. Thus he gathered thousands of the empire's scholars, collected and supported them at the imperial palace, and then gave them government positions. In this way he attached to himself practically the entire body of learned people in the empire. Wang Mang thus invented the method, used so effectively by the Ch'ing and other dynasties, of reconciling learned people to a new ruler or dynasty by giving them scholarly employment in government enterprises. After Wang Mang took the throne, he continued to honor Liu Hsin, finally making him the State Master, one of the four greatest ministers, and ennobling him as a Duke. Liu Hsin recommended to Wang Mang, as models for government, various practises mentioned in the Chou-li and elsewhere in Confucian tradition, and Wang Mang adopted these Confucian 57EMPEROR P'ING'S DEATH precedents. Many of his famous economic reforms came about in this manner. Wang Mang married his son and heir to Liu Hsin's daughter. In these ways, Wang Mang bound Liu Hsin to him by the greatest honors and the closest possible ties. Only when these ties were broken by Wang Mang himself, did Liu Hsin think of rebelling. Liu Hsin was Wang Mang's guide and advisor in Confucian matters. Liu Hsin thus owed his fame, his opportunity, and his fortune to Wang Mang. Under the circumstances, he could hardly have been otherwise than loyal to such a benefactor. Did Wang Mang murder Emperor P'ing? When Emperor P'ing died on Feb. 3, A.D. 6, he was still a minor. He was born in 9 B.C., so that he may have been fully fourteen years old. When, in Oct., A.D. 7, Chai Yi raised the standard of revolt against Wang Mang, the rebels sent messengers about the country alleging that Wang Mang had poisoned Emperor P'ing. This charge was almost universally believed in Later Han times, but we may well discount the prevalence of that belief, for a sequent Han dynasty would be likely to encourage it. It is of course impossible to determine the truth of such a charge, for we have absolutely no direct evidence on this matter. Events inside the palace could hardly be known except through the testimony of its inmates, most of whom could not leave the place; Wang Mang controlled the palace and its inhabitants for a subsequent period long enough to have silenced any possible witnesses. The absence of any testimony does not thus afford any presumption in either direction. There were reasons enough to have predisposed Wang Mang to such a murder. He was not above committing such a deed. To hush up his son's adultery, he had the commissioner who investigated the matter murdered and buried in the jail (99 C: 11a). He was not slow in demanding the lives of any who opposed him, even of the highest families; he even executed three of Liu Hsin1a's children (99 C: n. 23.2), and did not hesitate to execute his own son together with hundreds of persons in connection with the plot of Wang YÃ¼ (99 A: 16b). Wang Mang showed an utter callousness concerning human affections; he kept Emperor P'ing's mother away from her son, even though she is said to have wept day and night. Wang Mang furthermore had adequate motives for murdering Emperor P'ing. Wang Mang had prevented any of Emperor P'ing's maternal relatives from coming to the imperial capital, and, when the plot of 58CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION Wang YÃ¼ was discovered, he had executed all these relatives, except Emperor P'ing's mother. The young Emperor P'ing hence had a serious grievance against Wang Mang, and may well have expressed his feelings in his adolescent years. Wang Mang might have suspected he would be unable to control the Emperor, once the latter came of age, and that he might even be made to suffer on some trumped-up charge. The capping of the Emperor, which ceremony marked his coming of age, was moreover delayed until after his death. (That circumstance does not however indicate any delinquency on Wang Mang's part. The regular age for capping, according to Confucian principles, was the fifteenth year; in Han times, however, the age of capping varied: Emperor Chao was not capped until his eighteenth year, while Emperor Ho was capped in his thirteenth year.) Wang Mang loved power and may well have planned to continue his power by initiating another regency. There is a circumstantial account of the poisoning (12: n. 10.2), but it was not used by Pan Ku and is intrinsically questionable. (A dose of poison does not act only fourteen days after it was administered.) Thus there is some evidence tending to show that Wang Mang may have committed regicide. There are however certain circumstances that lead us to doubt whether Wang Mang really did murder his lord. He probably realized the grave difficulties that would arise concerning the succession to the throne. Emperor P'ing was the last of Emperor YÃ¼an's living descendants; a successor would have to be picked from among the descendants of Emperor HsÃ¼an, who was Emperor Ch'eng's grandfather, so that the successor would be four or five generations removed from his imperial ancestor (Liu Ying was actually the fifth generation). There was also the danger that further pretended sons of Emperor Ch'eng would appear to claim the throne. Wang Mang's uncle, Wang Li5a, had sponsored one such pretender. Wang Mang may well have furthermore anticipated opposition to an infant successor and a serious rebellion, such as that actually raised by Chai Yi. While the imperial clan had been rendered powerless by the separation of its members, giving them only quite small fiefs, and watching them carefully (long the imperial policy), other officials might nevertheless rebel. The empire had so long been faithful to the Liu clan that its loyalties could not be changed easily. These reasons of state would likely have deterred Wang Mang from attempting an assassination. Confucian tradition, to which Wang Mang was bound, condemned regicide and exalted faithfulness on the part of ministers. Confucius' own model, who had come to be esteemed by all Confucians as an ideal and sage, 59THE DEATH OF EMPEROR P'ING was the Duke of Chou, who had loyally laid down his regency when his lord came of age. Wang Mang had frequently been compared to the Duke of Chou and doubtless aspired for the same high reputation as this ideal figure, who was exalted above kings and emperors. Ho Kuang, who had ruled during the reigns of Emperors Chao and HsÃ¼an, was highly esteemed in recent times. Indeed, if Emperor P'ing had not died, Wang Mang would doubtless have come down in history as the greatest minister of Han times, a model for succeeding ages, a regent like the Duke of Chou, whose fame outshone that of emperors themselves. Thus the death of Emperor P'ing may well have seemed a terrible calamity to Wang Mang and he very likely considered that it deprived him of his opportunity for a great Confucian fame. Wang Mang had attempted to bind Emperor P'ing to himself by secure ties. He married his daughter to the Emperor and in 5 A.D. cut the Tzu-wu Road for the purpose of magically bringing it about that Emperor P'ing should have a son by her. If she had had a son, Wang Mang, as the grandfather of the Heir-apparent and father-in-law of the Emperor, the minister who ruled during the Emperor's minority, would have been secure in his position and untouchable, even by an emperor. Public opinion would have defended against almost any charge a minister with such a high reputation and close relationship. It is somewhat unlikely that Wang Mang actually planned to usurp the throne until some time after the death of Emperor P'ing. The knife-cash were not issued until June/July, A.D. 7; when Wang Mang actually came to the throne and changed the dynasty, he found these knife-cash an embarrassment, for the word "Liu," the surname of the Han dynasty, contains the words "metal" and "knife," so that Wang Mang had to do away with these knife-coins in order to prevent their magical influence from injuring him (24 B: 21b). While such a magical influence of knife-cash upon the dynastic name might possibly have been neglected in A.D. 7, yet a person so concerned with magical influences as Wang Mang would have been likely to have known their magical meaning, and would hardly have issued them if he had any definite plans for changing the dynasty. Pan Ku states that Wang Mang planned to take the throne only after Chai Yi's rebellion had quickly been crushed. There is also the fact that Emperor P'ing had been a sickly child, who had been "continually ill" (98: 11b11), so that he was not at all strong, and could easily have been carried off by illness, just as was Emperor Ai. Wang Mang seems to have done everything that a loyal minister should have done to prevent this death. When, in the winter of A.D. 5/6, 60CHAPTER XII, INTRODUCTION Emperor P'ing was ill, Wang Mang made a vow to the Supreme One, in which he offered his own life for that of the Emperor. The vow was stored in a metal-bound coffer, just as the Duke of Chou had done in a similar case when King Ch'eng was ill. The coffer was not opened until A.D. 23 (99 A: 24b; C: 22b). Wang Mang was superstitious and relied much upon magic, so that he probably took this vow seriously. He furthermore did not kill the succeeding Emperor, the Young Prince, Liu Ying1a. This child grew up, and, after Wang Mang's death, actually ascended the throne for a time. Furthermore when Chai Yi rebelled in A.D. 7 and when the rebels finally entered Kuan-chung in A.D. 23, Wang Mang made a dramatic appeal to Heaven for aid, in the latter case, setting out, at the place for sacrifice to Heaven, his mandates by means of portents, and asking Heaven to strike him dead by a thunderbolt if he had done wrong (99 C: 25a). When a superstitious man acts thus, it is good evidence that his conscience is clear of any such heinous sins as regicide. There is thus much evidence to show that Wang Mang was innocent of the charge that he had poisoned his lord, and that this charge was propaganda on the part of those who rose in rebellion against him. It is of course impossible to be certain, and the evidence is far from conclusive. In the end, one's judgment will depend upon one's estimate of Wang Mang's character. That character was evil enough: he was callous to suffering, impatient of any opposition and ready to execute any subordinates and even his own children and grandchildren who presumed to oppose him or even make awkward suggestions (cf. the execution of Wang Chien4, 98: 14b). But he was a whole-hearted Confucian. Confucianism exalted loyalty and comdemned regicide as a heinous sin. My own opinion is that Wang Mang was too good a Confucian to have murdered Emperor P'ing. 61 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter XII THE TWELFTH [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [Emperor Hsiao]-p'ing Emperor Hsiao-p'ing was the grandson, by a concubine, of Emperor YÃ¼an and the son of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing]. His mother was called the Concubine [nee] Wei. When [Emperor P'ing] was in his third1.1 1.1 Ch'en Ching-yÃ¼n (1670-1747) would emend "third" to "second" because HS 97 B: 21b reports that Emperor P'ing was born in 9 B.C. and was in his second year when his father died, and because HS 12: 1b says he was in his ninth year when he came to the throne. But HS 14: 23b records that his father first became King in 37 B.C. and reigned altogether to the thirtieth year; hence his father died in 8 B.C. Emperor P'ing succeeded his father in 7 B.C. (14: 23b) and became Emperor in 1 B.C., which was the ninth year of his life. So there is no reason to emend the text; Ch'en Ching-yÃ¼n seems not to have understood that in Han times ages were counted by elapsed full years, not by elapsed calendar years as at present; so that a child born just before New Year's was not then considered after New Year's to be in his second (calendar) year, as at present.

(1739) has that emendation. the high officials have frequently brought up in their memorials matters previous to an amnesty, including them [with their present charges, in order to] increase [the severity of peoples'] greater or lesser crimes, [with 63HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shou II 12: 1b, 2a the result that] they have executed or ruined guiltless 1 B.C. [people, which practise] is almost opposite to the intention of emphasizing fidelity and being careful about punishments [and to induce criminals] to purify their hearts and renew themselves. Moreover, 2a in their selections and recommendations [for appointment], if a gentleman has [already] held various offices, has been experienced in [government] affairs, and has acquired a reputation, then [the high officials] consider that [such a person] would be difficult to guarantee, hence, when [such a person has been] dismissed, he is not recommended [again, which practise] is quite contrary to the principle of `pardoning small transgressions and recommending those who are capable and able.'2.1 2.1 A saying of Confucius found in Analects XIII, ii, 1. Emperor Ai had previously issued an order to this same effect: cf. 11: 3b. [In the case of] whoever has taken bribes or [has committed] hidden evils which have not yet become known, if he is recommended for a position, let all [such matters] not be investigated judicially, in order that [such] 2a gentlemen may whet their innermost beings and endeavor to improve themselves, and that small flaws may not hamper great talents. From this time and henceforth, high officials shall not be permitted to present matters previous to an amnesty and put them in a memorial to the Emperor. If anyone acts contrary to this written edict, he is acting against the [imperial] favor, [hence] it shall be judged as an inhuman [deed. Let this order] be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance and be published and made known to the empire to cause it to 2a be clearly known."2.2 2.2 Very probably Wang Mang is thinking of Wang Chia1a, who was done to death by Emperor Ai, because, after an amnesty, he had recommended some persons whom Emperor Ai had previously dismissed on suspicion of crime (cf. Introduction to ch. XI, pp. 5-6; Glossary sub Wang Chia1a). Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) says, "By this [ordinance, Wang] Mang was ensnaring and attracting people who had been rejected, discarded, and despised, by giving them unhoped for extraordinary favors, in order that he might use them for his own purposes." In A.D. 210, (Cf. San-kuo Chih, 1: 28b), Ts'ao Ts'ao, in his famous "Order Requesting Worthy Persons to Come," similarily said, "If one must be an incorrupt person and then only be given position, how could [Duke] Huan of Ch'i have come in his epoch to be Lord Protector?" Ho Ch'uo, after quoting the above passage, remarks sarcastically, "Usurpers and rebels always seek for their own kind." 64HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I A.D. 1 I In [the period] YÃ¼an-shih, the first year, in the 12: 2a, b A.D. 1 spring, the first month, the head of the YÃ¼eh-shang ./Mar. tribe, [whose speech had to be] repeatedly interpreted, presented tribute of one white pheasant and two black pheasants.2.3 2.3 The head of the YÃ¼eh-shang tribe is mentioned in the Bamboo Annals (Legge, Shoo-King, Prolegomena, p. 146). The T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan, 917: 8b quotes the Hsiao-ching YÃ¼an-sheng Ch'i (prob. Former Han period), fragments B: 23a, as saying, "In the time of King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty], the YÃ¼eh-shang presented a white pheasant. They are 30,000 li distant from the capital. When a true king is unsurpassed in his sacrifices and moderate in his repasts and robes, then [these people] appear [with a white pheasant]." Cf. Introduction, p. 51; Glossary sub YÃ¼eh-shang. An imperial edict had the three highest ministers use them for sacrifice in the [imperial] ancestral temples. Various courtiers [thereupon] memorialized, saying, "The merits and virtuous deeds of the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, are equal to those of the Duke of Chou. He should be granted the title, the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty]." His enfeoffment and those of the Grand 2b Master K'ung Kuang and others were all increased. :5a-6b. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Wang] Mang." There was granted, on this special occasion, to the common people of the empire one step in noble rank and to the officials who [then] held positions [ranking at] two hundred piculs and over, the full salary of their rank, like the regular [occupant of that position].2.4 2.4 The implications of this statement have been debated. Ju Shun (fl. dur. 198-265) says, "When the officials in the various offices are first given new positions, they are all tried as acting [occupants of their positions] for a year, and then made regular [occupants of their positions] with their full salary. When Emperor P'ing took the throne, he therefore granted to them to be regular [occupants of their positions]." Shen Ch'in-han (17751832) moreover points out that Ho Hsiu (129-182), in a note to the Kung-yang Commentary, 2: 5b sub Duke Yin, III, Autumn, says, "At that time, altho [a person] was a hereditary grandee, because he had the heart of a filial son, he could not endure at once to take his father's position, hence he followed the ancient [practises] and was first tried [in that position] for a year, and then was given a [regular] mandate [as his father's successor] in his ancestral Temple." Shen Ch'in-han concludes, "The practise of the Han [dynasty], follows from this principle that when [an official] was first given a new position, he was tried as an acting [occupant of that position], and [after] a year he was made the regular [occupant of that position]." But Yen Shih-ku (581-645) writes, "This explanation, [that of Ju Shun], is mistaken. At that time among the various offices there were those who were being tried as acting [occupants of those positions], consequently [the Emperor] specially granted an unusual act of favor and it was merely ordered that they should [be treated] the same as the regular [occupants of those positions]. It was not that all those officials who were given new positions must all be regarded as acting [occupants of those positions] on trial. Yi-ch'ieh [means] `temporarily,' not `regularly'." Yi-ch'ieh is also found in 76: 15a, 16a, where Ju Shun glosses that yi-ch'ieh means "temporarily ." Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) approves of Yen Shih-ku's interpretation that this was a temporary favor on this special occasion, and not a permanent enactment concerning future appointees. Liu Pin however says, "I say that altho the officials' salaries were nominally [a certain number of piculs per year], they all were not [paid] the full [amount of] that number [of piculs]. When Emperor P'ing ascended the throne, favors were extended, hence he granted and ordered that [officials should be paid] the full salary of their rank, for example, that [an official ranking at] two thousand piculs should get double ten hundred [piculs]. Yen [Shih-ku] in a note to HS 19 [A: 1a, concerning] the differences of officials' salaries, speaks of these [circumstances]. His note reads, `[According to] the Han Code, the three highest ministers were nominally [ranked at] ten thousand piculs, [but] the salary of each [one] was 350 hu of grain per month. Those who nominally [ranked at] fully 2000 piculs [received] 180 hu per month. [Those ranked at] 2000 piculs [received] 120 hu, and [those ranked at] equivalent to 2000 piculs [received] 100 hu,' etc. According to the comment in the HHS, [Tr. 28: 14b, from which Yen Shi-ku has taken the above figures], those [whose nominal salaries] were fixed at 1000 piculs or less received a certain proportion of their nominal salary in a year. [But this payment] was added to in the time of [Emperor] Kuang-wu [ruled A.D. 25-57], and was not an old practise of the Former Han [dynasty]." 2b [Liu] K'ai-ming, the Heir-apparent of the 65HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I 12: 2b former King of Tung-p'ing, [Liu] YÃ¼n2a, was estab- A.D. 1 lished as King [of Tung-p'ing. Liu] Ch'eng-tu, the son of the former Marquis Ch'ing of T'ao-hsiang, [Liu HsÃ¼an1d], was made King of Chung-shan [to succeed Emperor P'ing's father]. Thirty-six great-grandsons of Emperor HsÃ¼an, [including Liu] Hsin4g and others, were all made full marquises.2.5 2.5 HS 99 A: 19b notes this last appointment in Jan./Feb., A.D. 5. But HS 15 B: 38a, b, 40a-44a, 53a-55b lists 35 appointments on Apr. 10, A.D. 1, in addition to that of Liu Hsin4 (ibid., 50a), so that ch. 99 is mistaken. All were great-grandsons of Emperor HsÃ¼an; 99 A" 19b states they were , so that jen-sun must here mean "great-grandson." The genealogy of Liu Hsin4 in 15 B: 50a confirms this statement. Cf. HFHD I, 176, n. 3. 2b 66HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I A.D. 1 3a The Grand Coachman, Wang YÃ¼n, and others, 12: 3a twenty-five persons [in all], when previously there had been a discussion about honoring the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu of Ting-t'ao with a [higher] imperial title, had held to classical principles, had not flattered her desires or followed erroneous [principles]; the General of the Right, Sun Chien, was the great official who was [Wang Mang's] military assistant;3.1 3.1 On the phrase, "talons and teeth," cf. 99 A: n. 5.4. the Grand Herald, [Tso] Hsien, had previously discussed [that matter] correctly, had not flattered [the Queen Dowager], later he had been sent, bearing credentials, to go and invite the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Chi-tzu], to come [to take the throne]; also the Superintendant of the Imperial House, Liu Pu-o, the Bearer of the Gilded Mace, Jen Ts'enb, the General of the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace, K'ung Yung, the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, Yao HsÃ¼n, and the Grand Administrator of the P'ei Commandery, Shih HsÃ¼âbecause all these [persons] had previously shared in initiating the plan [whereby Emperor P'ing came to the throne], had gone to the east to invite him to ascend the throne, had been perfectly adept, or had worked diligently and laboriously in performing their duties, they were granted the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain with the income of estates, to each proportionately. Noble ranks were granted to the officials in the prefectures and towns thru which the Emperor passed on his way to assume the throne, [ranking at] two thousand piculs and less, down to the Accessory 3a Officials, to each proportionately. It was also ordered that vassal kings, dukes, full marquises, and marquises of the imperial domain who had no sons but had grandsons, if [any of these nobles] had raised as sons the sons of their full or 67HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I 12: 3a, b half-brothers, they should all be permitted to make A.D. 1 [these nephews] their heirs; and that for heirs of dukes and full marquises who had committed crimes [requiring the punishment] of shaving the whiskers or above, [the officials] should beg [the Emperor's permission] before [such persons were punished]. There were restored to registration those [members of] the imperial house whose registration had not yet lapsed [because they had become too distantly related to the Emperor], but whose [registration] had been cut off because of crimes.3.2 3.2 Hu San-hsing (1280-1287) explains, "It means that those should have their registration restored who were related [so that in mourning] they uncovered an arm and wore the mourning head-dress or were more [closely related], who because of crime had been cut off the register [of the imperial house]." Cf. 11: n. 2.2. Those [members of the imperial house] who were officials were to be recommended [for promotion] as incorrupt persons; [those members of the imperial house] who were Accessory Officials were to be given vacancies [ranking at] four hundred piculs. For officials of the empire who [had 3a the rank of] equivalent to 2000 piculs or above and 3b were aged and retired, their former salary was to be divided in three and one [third] was to be given to them to the end of their life. A Grandee-remonstrant was sent to inspect the three capital commanderies and report the [names and] registrations of the officials and common people who in the time of haste and confusion during the second year of [the period] YÃ¼an-shou [had paid] 1 B.C. the extraordinary taxes and collections. They were to be repaid the value [of what they had paid]. The tombs of the common people at the Yi Tomb which did not interfere with the interior of the Hall [at the Yi Tomb] were not to be opened.3.3 3.3 The Yi Tomb was that of Emperor Ai, the buildings attached to which were probably still being erected, since Emperor Ai had not made preparations for his own demise. Private tombs previously at that locality were not to be disturbed, unless they interfered with the Hall at that Tomb. The officials and common people3.4 3.4 The Official ed. has emended shÃª to min . It quotes the Sung Ch'i ed. as saying that the T'ang text (before xi cent.) does not have the word li . The Ching-yu ed. (1034) has li-min; the Chi-ku Ko ed. (1642) has li-shÃª. Chou Shou-ch'ang (18141884) points out that various texts have li-min, and that Yen Shih-ku (581-645) does not explain li-shÃª, so that his text must also have had li-min. of the empire were not to be 68HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I A.D. 1 3b permitted to lay up productive implements or 12: 3b, 4a articles.3.5 3.5 Yen Shih-ku says, "According to the military law, five men make a pentad (group of five), and two groups of five make a decade, who therefore have their implements and articles in common. Hence [people] generally call productive implements shih-ch'i [i.e., implements belonging to a decade]. It was also like those who today are with the army or do forced service: ten persons constitute a `fire' and share their provisions and arrangements." This term is also found in 12: 6a. Chia Yi, in HS 48: 27a7,8, uses chih -ch'i with a similar meaning, "When people today lay up things (chih-ch'i), if they lay them up (chih) in a safe place, they are safe, [while] if they lay them up (chih) in dangerous places, they are in danger. The affections of the empire are in no way different from things (ch'i)âthey are where the Son of Heaven places (chih) them." Mar./Apr. In the second month, there were established the Office of the Hsi-and-Ho, ranking at two thousand piculs, and the Clerk for the Provinces and the Master of the Houses, [both] ranking at six hundred piculs, to spread the [orthodox] teaching and culture, to prohibit irregular sacrifices, and to banish the songs of Cheng.3.6 3.6 For irregular (or unlawful) sacrifices cf. HS 25 A: 4a; Li-ki 5: 11a (Couvreur I. 100; Legge, I, 116). "Songs of Cheng" denotes licentious music; cf. Analects XV, x, 6. Mar. 20 On [the day] yi-wei, in the funerary chamber at the Yi Tomb [of Emperor Hsiao-ai], the ghost's garments were in their casket, and on the [day] ping- Mar. 21 shen at dawn the garments were outside of it on the 4a bed.3.7 3.7 For a similar incident, cf. 99 C: 8b. The Prefect of the Funerary Chamber reported it as an urgent grievous vicissitude, and a suovetaurilia was sacrificed. In the summer, the June 10 fifth month, on [the day] ting-szu, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.4.1 4.1 For eclipses, cf. App. I. A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire; the ministers, generals, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs were each to recommend one person who was honest and sincere and able to speak 3b frankly. 69HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I 12: 4a In the sixth month, the Junior Tutor4.2 4.2 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that fu4 (Junior Tutor) is in some texts written as fu3 (Privy Treasurer). HS 19 B: 52a writes fu3; 97 B: 22a writes fu4. Chou Shou-ch'ang in a note to this passage, suggests that fu4 should be amended to fu3; Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918), in a note to 19 B: 52a, suggests that fu3 should be emended to fu4. HS 99 A: 6a records that Chen Feng was appointed Junior Tutor, one of the Four Coadjutors, so that fu4 is certainly the correct reading. and Gen- A.D. 1 July/Aug. eral of the Left, [Chen] Feng, was sent to grant to the Emperor's mother, the Concubine [nee Wei] of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu Hsing], a document sealed with the imperial seal, and to install her as the Queen of King Hsiao of Chung-shan. There were granted to the Emperor's maternal uncle, Wei Pao and to [Wei] Pao's younger brother, [Wei] HsÃ¼ana, the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain. There was granted, to all of the Emperor's three4.3 4.3 The text says "four," but 97 B: 22a, in recounting these sisters, says there were three and enumerates their names and titles. HS 99 A: 16a, in recounting the events at this time, does not mention these Baronetesses. Hence "four" should be emended to "three" (Chou Shou-ch'ang). Han-chi 30: 2a follows this passage in writing "four"; Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 17b has emended it to "three." sisters, the title of Baronetess, with the income of an estate of two thousand households for each. Kung-sun Hsiang-ju, a descendant of the Duke of 4a Chou, was made the Marquis in Recompense to [the Duke of] Lu. A descendant of Confucius, K'ung ChÃ¼n, was made Marquis in Recompense for Perfection, to uphold the sacrifices [to Confucius]. Confucius was posthumously given the posthumous name and title, Duke HsÃ¼an-ni in Recompense for Perfection.4.4 4.4 Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that HsÃ¼an-ni as a name for Confucius originated in this enactment. Ming-kuang Palace together with the imperial pathways in the three capital [commanderies] were abolished. The female convicts of the empire who had already been sentenced [were ordered] to return home [and pay]4.5 4.5 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the meaning requires the insertion of before the word . Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 18a has this word. On the term `mountain hire,' Ju Shun says, "In the first section of the [dynastic] ordinances [it was ordained] that women who had committed crimes should work as convicts and to the sixth month should be employed [to work on] the mountains. That [the Emperor] had them `return home' means that they ought to have been cutting trees on the mountains, [but] he permitted them to send [a substitute] and pay cash in hire for the value of their work. Hence it is called `mountain hire." ' Ying Shao (ca. 140206) says, "The ancient punishment of `spiritual firewood' [cf. HFHD, I, p. 177, n. 1] was taking firewood from the mountains for the use of the [imperial] ancestral temples. Now [the ruler] caused female convicts to pay cash to hire [people to cut] firewood, hence it is called `mountain hire'." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Ju [Shun's] explanation comes near [the truth]. It means that the female convicts whose sentences for crime have already been imposed shall all be set free, return to their homes, and not themselves do forced labor; instead he ordered that they should pay three hundred cash per month to hire people. He performed this [act of] grace in order to spread the virtue of the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] and accord her beneficent government to women." Shen Ch'in-han adds, "Since in HS 66: [8b] rich Gentlemen who pay money [to gain holidays] are called `mountain Gentlemen', [the name for] female convicts who pay money are likewise called `mountain hire'. The meaning is similar [to that of the other name]." Cf. Glossary, sub Yang YÃ¼n. three hundred cash per month for 70HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I A.D. 1 4b `mountain hire.' One chaste wife in a district was 12: 4b exempted [from taxes]. There were established one Assistant to the Privy Treasurer [in Charge of] the Seas and one Assistant [in charge of] Fruits,4.6 4.6 Yen Shih-ku explains that they were put in charge of the taxes upon sea [products] and upon fruits, respectively. and [also] thirteen Divisional Assistants to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, [each] one having for his district one province, [with the duty of] encouraging agriculture and sericulture.4.7 4.7 Hu San-hsing explains, "Emperor Wu had Sang Hung-yang establish several tens of Divisional Assistants to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, who separately had for their districts [certain] commanderies and kingdoms, and had control of the Equalization and Transportation and the Salt and Iron [government monopolies]. Now thirteen persons were employed to have charge of the thirteen provinces, [respectively], as their districts." The Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] dispensed with ten prefectures of her private estate from which she received income and confided them to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, who was regularily to keep separate accounts of their land-tax and pay [this sum] out, using it to assist poor people. 71HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih I, II 12: 4b, 5a In the autumn, the ninth month, an amnesty [was A.D. 1, 2 4a granted] to the convicts of the empire. Oct./No The K'u-hsing prefecture in [the kingdom of] Chung-shan was made the private estate of the Queen [nee Wei] of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [Liu 4b Hsing]. In the second year, in the spring, the state of II Huang-chih offered a rhinoceros [in tribute].4.8 4.8 Yen Shih-ku explains, "The rhinoceros has the shape of a water buffalo and a head like a pig, with four legs; it is like an elephant in its black color. It has one horn in front of its forehead, and on its nose has another small horn." For a translation of the passage in the HS describing trading voyages into the Indian Ocean and the location of this place, cf. Glossary sub Huang-chih. Also cf. C. W. Bishop, "Rhinoceros and Wild Ox in Ancient China," China Journal XVII, no. 6 (June 1933), p. 330. Wang Mang had sent a messanger with an order to the king of Huang-chih that he should present a live rhinoceros. Cf. HS 28 Bii: 68a, b; Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 18b. A.D. 2 An imperial edict said, "The two [words in] the Spring personal name of the Emperor are connected with a utensil. Now [We] change [Our] personal name in conformity with the ancient regulations."4.9 4.9 Emperor P'ing's first personal name, Chi-tzu , means `dustpan'; it is found in 14: 23b. His name was changed to K'an , `rejoice,' in conformity with the precedent set by Emperor HsÃ¼an (cf. 8: 13b). This rare word would not be troublesome as a taboo. HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh (148-209), in a note to 12: 1a and Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260), here furnish the latter name. He sent the Grand Master, [K'ung] Kuang, to present a suovetaurilia and give information [of the change] in a sacrifice at the Temple of [Emperor] Kao. In the summer, the fourth month, [Liu] Ju-yib, a May son of a great-great-grandson of King Hsiao of Tai, [Liu Ts'an], was made King of Kuang-tsung; [Liu] 5a Kung1a, a grandson of King Yi of Chiang-tu, [Liu Fei1], and [the son of] the Marquis of HsÃ¼-yi, [Liu Meng-chih], was made King of Kuang-shih;5.1 5.1 HS 14: 14b and 53: 7a both record that Liu Kung was the son of the Marquis of HsÃ¼-yi; hence should be in the text at this point. The text names this kingdom as Kuang-ch'uan , 14: 14b names it Kuang-shih , and 53: 7a names it Kuang-ling . HS 14: 20b lists other kings of Kuang-ling down to the time of Wang Mang's usurpation, so that Kuang-ling is certainly a mistake. Kuang-ch'uan was the name of a kingdom whose name had been changed to Hsin-tua (q.v. in Glossary) and made a kingdom, the king of which at this time was Liu Ching3b. Ch'ien Ta-hsin (1728-1804) remarks that a piece of Liu Ching3b's territory would hardly have been taken a way from him to make a new kingdom of Kuang-ch'uan, as must have been done if that name had been used. Shen Ch'in-han notes that ch'uan and shih might easily have been mistaken for each other, and says that several thousand households might have been taken from Hsin-tua to make the kingdom of Kuang-ch'uan. Han-chi 30: 2b has copied the reading Kuang-ch'uan; so has Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 19a. But the Comment to the Shui-ching 23: 3b, sub the Ying-kou River, says, "The Kuo River also goes east and passes north of the city of Kuang-hsiang . Ch'Ã¼an Ch'eng [fl. dur. 135-220] glosses, `In Hsiang-yi there is the ShÃª-ch'iu Commune, which is the former Kuang-hsiang. It was changed to be Kuang-shih. Emperor Shun of the Later Han [dynasty] in 135 A.D. enfeoffed the Palace Attendant Chih T'ien [not mentioned in the HHS] as the marquis [of this place]. His marquisate was Kuang-hsiang.' " Then the reading in ch. 14, Kuang-shih, is probably correct, and the text should be emended accordingly. The error was probably caused by attraction to the following Kuang-ch'uan. and [Liu] Lun, a great-grandson of King Hui of Kuang-ch'uan, [Liu YÃ¼eh5a], was made King of Kuang-tÃª. 72HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih II A.D. 2 [Ho] Yang, a great-grandson of a paternal cousin of 12: 5a, b the former Commander-in-chief and Marquis of Po-lu, Ho Kuang; [Chang] Ch'ing-chi, a great-great-grandson of the Marquis of HsÃ¼an-p'ing, Chang Ao; [Chou] Kung, a great-great-grandson of the Marquis of Chiang, Chou P'o; and [Fan] Chang, the son of a great-great-grandson of the Marquis of Wu-yang, Fan K'uai, were all enfeoffed as full marquises, so that [these] noble titles were revived. There were granted to Li Ming-yu, the great-great-grandson of the former Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-chou, Li Shang, and to 5a [descendants of] other [former marquises], 113 persons 5b [in all],5.2 5.2 Han-chi 30: 2b reads "130 persons"; Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 35: 19a says "117 persons," including the full marquises. the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain, with the income of estates, to each proportionately. In the commanderies and kingdoms there was a great drought and [plague of] locusts;5.3 5.3 HS 27: Bb: 20b says, "In YÃ¼an-shih II, in the autumn, locusts were everywhere in the empire." in Ch'ing 4b Province it was especially severe, so that its common 73HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih II 12: 5b, 6a people became vagrants. The Duke Who Gives A.D. 2 Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty, Wang Mang], the four Coadjutors [K'ung Kuang, Wang Mang, Wang Shun4b, and Chen Feng], the three highest ministers [Ma Kung, Wang Mang, and Chen Feng], the high ministers, grandees, officials, and common people, 230 persons [in all], presented their fields and residences in behalf of suffering and indigent people,5.4 5.4 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that is omitted after ; the Official ed. has this word. For the Coadjutors, cf. Glossary. For a parallel account, cf. 99 A: 7b. to be distributed among the poor people in accordance with their number. Messengers were sent to catch the locusts; the common people who caught locusts and brought them to the officials received cash in accordance with the [number of] piculs [of weight] or tou [of measure of the locusts]. The common people of the empire whose property was not as much as 20,000 [cash], together with those in the commanderies which suffered from the visitation, [whose property] was not as much as 100,000 [cash], were not to pay the land-tax or poll-taxes. The common people who [suffered from] the epidemic were lodged in the empty [commandery or princes'] lodges and residences, and physicians and medicines were provided for them. Grants were made for the dead: for six corpses or over in one family, five thousand cash for burial; for four corpses or over, three thousand [cash]; and for two corpses or over, two thousand [cash]. Hu-t'o Park in Anting [Commandery] was abolished and made An-ming prefecture. Government offices and buildings, 6a market-places and hamlets were built [there], and poor people were solicited to remove [there]. In the counties where they lodged [as they were moving], they were given food, and when they reached 5b the places to which they were removed, they were granted fields, residences, productive instruments, and were made loans of oxen for plowing, and of seed 74HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih II A.D. 2 and food. Five hamlets were also built within the 12: 6a, b city of Ch'ang-an with two hundred residences, for the poor people to dwell in.5.5 5.5 HS 27 Cb: 25a says, `In YÃ¼an-shih II, vi, (July), two meteorites fell in the ChÃ¼-lu [Commandery]." Autumn In the autumn, [each] commandery recommanded one brave and warlike person possessing self-control, who was intelligent in military methods. [They were ordered] to go to [the office of the Major in Charge of] Official Carriages [to await official appointment]. Nov. 23 In the ninth month, on [the day] mou-shen, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. An amnesty [was granted] to the criminals of the empire. Internuncios and Division Heads of the Commander-in-chief, forty-four persons [in all], bearing credentials, were sent to inspect the border 5a troops. A Captain under the Bearer of the Gilded Mace, Ch'en Mou, was sent, [with the right] to use a bell and drum, who solicited three hundred brave and daring officials and gentlemen from Ju-nan and Nan-yang [Commanderies], who [in turn] remonstrated with and persuaded the robbers on the [Yangtze] River and lakes, Ch'eng Chung, and others, more than two hundred persons, all to come out voluntarily [and present themselves to the officials]. They were sent to the places where their 6b homes were, and were held to do service.6.1 6.1 Yen Shih-Ku explains, "They went to their native counties and towns and performed [the payment of] the land taxes and conscript service." Ho Chuo adds, "Shou-shih is like when at present they are enrolled in the militia of the hamlets as runners." [Ch'eng] Chung was removed to YÃ¼n-yang and was granted public fields and a residence. Winter In the winter, [the officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs were [ordered] yearly to recommend 6a one person who had equitably judged law-cases. III In the third year, in the spring, there was an 75HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih III 12: 6b imperial edict [from the Grand Empress Dowager A.D. 3 A.D. 3 nee Wang] that the high officials should present the Spring proposal [of marriage]6.2 6.2 A phrase from Yi-li 4: 1a (Steele I, 18) and Li-ki XLI, 1 (Legge, II, 428; Couvreur, II, 641). Cf. 99 A: n. 9.4. on behalf of the Emperor to the daughter of the Duke Who Gives Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Wang] Mang." There was 99 A: 8b. also an imperial edict to the Imperial Household 10a Grandee Liu Hsin1a and others that they should fix marriage rites for various [ranks], and that the four Coadjutors, the ministers, grandees, Erudits, Gentlemen, and officials, and [the members of] their households must all be married according to the rites: they must themselves go to fetch [their wives] standing in an small chariot with [a pair of] horses yoked abreast.6.3 6.3 Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) explains, "Yao (a small chariot) . . . is a small chariot in which one rides standing up. Ping-ma, [means] yoked with two horses attached to the same yoke." Cf. also HFHD I, 107, n. 3 for the "small chariot." Yen Shih-ku remarks, "These regulations were [now] newly fixed." The Yi-li (Steele, III, 8a) and Li-chi, ch. 40 (Legge, II, 429; Couvreur II, 624) direct that the groom shall to the bride's house to fetch her; the Yi-li (ibid., 4: 6b) specifies a quadriga ; neither of these classics seem to mention the "small chariot." HS 27 Bb: 7a says, "In YÃ¼an-shih III, i [Feb./Mar.], Heaven rained plants of a sort like that in the period Yung-kuang [42 B.C.]." Cf. 9: n. 9.2. Cf. W. Eberhard, BeitrÃ¤ge zur Kosmologischen Spekulation", p. 27. In the summer, the Duke Who Gives Tranquillity Summer to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], memorialized the regulations for chariots and garments and the [various] classes [into which] officials and people [are divided with respect to] caring for their living [parents], accompanying [their dead] to the last [resting-place,6.4 6.4 An allusion to Mencius IV, ii, xiii (Legge, p. 322). I do not find anywhere an explanation of these sumptuary regulations regarding slaves, fields, etc. It may have been a reenactment of Emperor Ai's law; cf. 11: 3a. conducting] betrothals and marriages, and [possessing] male and female slaves, cultivated fields and residences, vessels and utensils. 5b 76HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih III A.D. 3 Official altars to the gods of the grains were estab- 12: 6b, 7a 7a lished,6.5 6.5 About 205 B.C., Emperor Kao "ordered the prefectures to make public altars to the gods of the soils " (HS 25 A: 18a). HS 25 B: 22a, b says, "[Wang] Mang said, . . . `When the sage Han [dynasty] arose, rites and ceremonies were somewhat fixed, so that there are already official altars to the gods of the soils, [but] there are not yet any official altars to the gods of the grains.' Thereupon behind the official altars to the gods of the soils there were established official altars to the gods of the grains. YÃ¼ of the Hsia [dynasty] was made the coadjutor to receive the offerings together with the official gods of the soils; Prince Millet was made the coadjutor to receive the offerings with the official gods of the grains. [At the] altars to the gods of the grains there were planted paper mulberry trees." (Reference from Ju Shun.) Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) explains that passage as follows, "Emperor Kao did away with the Ch'in [dynasty's] altars to the gods of the soils and grains and established the Han [dynasty's] altars to the gods of the soils and grains [cf. HS 1 A: 30b], which the Book of Rites [IX, i, 20 (Legge, I, 425; Couvreur, I, 586)] calls the Grand Altar to the Gods of the Soils (T'ai-shÃª). At this time there was also established the official altar to the gods of the soils, YÃ¼ of the Hsia [dynasty] being made their coadjutor, which is called [in the Book of Rites XX, 6 (Legge, II, 206; Couvreur, II, 265)] the royal altar to the gods of the soils (Wang-shÃª). Cf. the Han [Dynasty's] Ordinances for Sacrifices [lost]. But official altars to the gods of the grains had not yet been established. At this [time] they were first established. At the Restoration [of the Han dynasty, Emperor] Kuang-wu did not establish official altars to the gods of the grains, which [situation] has been inherited down to the present [time]." There seem thus to have been two sets of altars to the gods of the soils and grains: the Grand Altar, i.e. the altar of the dynasty, and the Royal Altar, i.e. the state altar. Emperor Kao had established a dynastic altar to the gods of the soils and grains and a state altar to the gods of the soils; Wang Mang now added a state altar to the grains, which Emperor Kuang-wu did not reestablish. Yen Shih-ku interprets the passage in ch. 12 to mean that the official altars to the gods of the grains had previously been established at the rear of the altars to the gods of the soils, and that now these altars were changed and set up at another place, not near the altars to the gods of the soils. together with offices for schools: in the commanderies and kingdoms they were called seminaries (hsÃ¼eh), and in the counties, marches, [princesses'] estates, and marquises' states they were called academies (hsiao).7.1 7.1 Li-shih, 5: 3a-4b (by Hung Kua, 1117-1184), quotes a stele to the Chief of the P'iao-yang county, P'an Ch'ien, found in 1143 and dated Dec. 14, 181, in which P'an Ch'ien is praised for having opened a school at this place. In the title of this inscription, the school is called a hsiao-kuan . Shen Ch'in-han says that this inscription proves that county schools were called hsiao. In academies and seminaries 77HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih III, IV 12: 7a there was established one Master of the A.D. 3, 4 Classics. In districts they were called lycea (hsiang), and in the villages they were called palestrae (hsÃ¼). In lycea and palestrae there was established one Master of the Classic of Filial Piety.7.2 7.2 These four names for schools were taken from Mencius III, i, iii, 10 (Legge, p. 242). Wen Tang Weng first established schools in Shu Commandery about 140 B.C. and was so successful in thus developing that region that Emperor Wu shortly afterwards ordered the commanderies and kingdoms to establish seminaries and academies. In 41 B.C., Emperor YÃ¼an ordered the commanderies and kingdoms to establish Retainers for the Classics; cf. 9: n. 9.6. Wei Chao (197-273/4) says, "[Places] smaller than districts (hsiang ) are called chÃ¼ (villages)." HS 24 A: 4b states that in hamlets there were palestrae and in districts there were lycea. Ibid. 4a defines a hamlet as 25 families and a district as 2500 households. 6b At Yang-ling, Jen Heng with others styled himself a general, robbed arms from the arsenal, attacked the offices and buildings, and set free the imprisoned convicts. A Division Head of the Grand Minister over the Masses supervised the pursuit [of these rebels]. They all suffered for their crimes. [Wang] YÃ¼3, the heir of the Duke Who Gives Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], had plotted with the maternal relatives of the Emperor, the Wei clan. [Wang] YÃ¼3 was sent to prison and died; the Wei clan were executed.7.3 7.3 For the incident concerning Wang YÃ¼, cf. 99 A: 16a, b; Introduction, pp. 47-48. T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983) 717: 4b quotes the Ku-chin Chu (ca. 300; this passage is not found in that book today) as saying, "In YÃ¼an-shih III, at the funerary park west of the Yen Tomb, [that of Emperor Ch'eng], the great mirrors in front of the door to the imperial throne inside the funerary chamber of the divinity all [had on them drops of] clear liquid, as if they had the appearance of having perspired." In the fourth year, in the spring, the first month, IV the suburban sacrifice (chiao) was performed to the A.D. 4 Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], making him the Feb./Mar. coadjutor of Heaven, and the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar (tsung) was performed to [Emperor] Hsiao-wen, making him the coadjutor of the Lords on High.7.4 7.4 Cf. HS 25 B: 20a-21a and 99 A: 17a. Wang Mang was imitating the examples of the ancients as recounted in the Classic of Filial Piety, 5: 1b (Legge, ch. IX, p. 477), "Anciently the Duke of Chou made the suburban sacrifice (chiao) to Prince Millet, making him the coadjutor of Heaven, and made the sacrifice to the exemplar (tsung) to King Wen in the Ming-t'ang, making him the coadjutor of the Lord(s) on High." 78HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih IV A.D. 4 [The title of] the Duke Honoring and Continuing 12: 7a [the Ancestral Sacrifices of] the Yin [dynasty, K'ung Ho-ch'i], was changed to be Duke of Sung and [the title of] the Duke Who Succeeds to the Greatness of the Chou [Dynasty, Chi Tang, was changed] to be Duke of Cheng. An imperial edict said, "Verily when [the relations between] husband and wife are correct, then father and son love [each other] and human relationships are stable. Previously an imperial edict ordered the high officials to exempt chaste wives and [permit] female convicts to return home, [by which the Emperor] in truth wished to avoid depravity and to protect chastity and faithfulness. Moreover 6a upon very aged and very young persons,7.5 7.5 Yen Shih-ku says, "[Persons aged] eighty are called mao . Those in their seventh year are called tao . Mao is an appellation for the aged, referring to their dim sight; the tao are those persons who have not yet become men, and for whose death it is proper to sorrow and feel saddened (tao)." For the classical definition, cf. Li-ki I, i, i, 27 (Couvreur I, 9; Legge, I, 66). punishments are not employed. [This is] what the sage-kings have instituted. "Harsh and oppressive officials however frequently arrest and imprison the family and relatives of those who violate the law, their wives and daughters, their aged and weak, causing them to be resentful and injuring [the imperial] cultural influence. The people [have suffered] bitterness on this account. Let it be clearly ordered to all the officials that 7a women, unless they have themselves violated the law, and males in their eightieth year or above or in their seventh year or under, unless someone in their household has been sentenced for inhumanity or [unless] they have been ordered in an imperial edict by name to be arrested, in all other cases all [such persons] 79HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih IV 12: 7b shall not be permitted to be imprisoned,7.6 7.6 Li-ki I, i, i, 27 (Couvreur, I, 9; Legge, I, 66) contains the provision that persons in their seventh year and under or in their eightieth year and over were not to undergo (mutilating) punishments. In 195 B.C., Emperor Hui exempted the aged and very young from the mutilating punishments (HS 2: 3a). In 141 B.C., those in their eightieth year and over and in the eighth (or seventh) year and younger, together with suckling babes, blind musicians, and dwarfs, were not to be shackled in prison. In 62 B.C., those over 80 were exempted from all punishments, except for heinous crimes. In 20 A.D. Emperor Ch'eng ordered that capital sentences for children in their seventh year or under must be reported to the Commandant of Justice, and that they should be allowed to ransom themselves (23: 19a, b). Now it was ordered that women and men under seven or over eighty should not be imprisoned, except for heinous crimes. (References from YÃ¼ YÃ¼eh.) This enactment was modelled on the principle in the Chou-li 36: 2a (Biot, II, 356) sub the Szu-tz'u, that the young and weak, the aged, and the stupid should be pardoned. The Han laws thus gradually approached Confucian ideals. and let A.D. 4 7b those who must be examined be immediately examined and questioned.7.7 7.7 Yen Shih-ku explains, "They should go to the place where they live to question them," but Chou Shou-ch'ang replies that Yen Shih-ku is probably explaining this ordinance by that of Emperor Kuang-wu in 27 A.D. (HHS, An. 1 A: 22b, 23a), which repeats this order, but uses chiu instead of chi . These two words are different and cannot be used to explain each other. Han-chi (by HsÃ¼n YÃ¼Ã«h, 148-209) 30: 4b, writes tsÃª , which Wang Hsien-ch'ien states was anciently a synonym of chi. Let this be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance." In the second month, on [the day] ting-wei, the Ma Empress nee Wang was established [as Empress] and a general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. The Grand Coachman, Wang YÃ¼n, and others, eight persons [in all], were sent out. [For them] were established Associates, to whom they lent their credentials,7.8 7.8 The principals "bore" credentials, which they "lent" to their associates (Hu San-hsing). These credentials enabled them to wield, temporarily and for a specific purpose, the imperial authority. [which Associates were sent] to travel about the empire separately, to examine and observe [the people's] customs.7.9 7.9 For the report of these eight messengers, cf. 99 A: 23b; for their names, cf. 12: n. 9.4. There were granted to the nine high ministers and those [ranking] lower, [down] to [those ranking at] six hundred piculs, and to the [members of] the imperial house who were 80HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih IV A.D. 4 enregistered, noble ranks, from [the rank] of Fifth 12: 7b, 8a Rank Grandee and above, to each proportionately. There were granted to the common people of the empire one step in noble rank, and to widowers, widows, orphans, childless, and aged, silk. In the Summer summer, the Empress [nee Wang] was presented in the Temple of [Emperor] Kao. There was added to the Duke Who Gives Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], the title of Ruling Governor, and there was granted to the Lady Dowager of the Duke, [the mother of Wang Mang], the title, the 8a Baronetess of Apparent Merits. The Duke's sons, [Wang] An1a and [Wang] Lin1a were both enfeoffed as full marquises. The Duke Who Gives Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], memorialized [the plans for] and set up the Ming-t'ang and the Pi-yung.8.1 8.1 Cf. HS 99 A: 18b. 6b 7b The Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsÃ¼an was honored and made that of the Central Exemplar; the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-yÃ¼an became that of the Eminent Exemplar;8.2 8.2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that Wang Mang honored Emperor YÃ¼an in order to please the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang, who was the wife of Emperor YÃ¼an. the Son of Heaven was to make offerings and sacrifices [at these temples] from generation to generation. 8.3 8.3 The Official ed. has at this point the word for "in the winter." It quotes the Sung Ch'i ed. as saying that the new edition (unknown) drops the word for "winter." The Ching-yu ed. (1034) has that word; the Chi-ku Ko ed. (1642) has excised it. Chou Shou-ch'ang adds that since the word for "in the winter" is found below (12: 8b), that word should be dropped here. For the incident of the Hsi-hai Commandery, cf. 99 A: 23b-24b. Hsi-hai Commandery was established, and those in the empire who had violated the prohibitions were exiled to inhabit it. The King of Liang, [Liu] Li5a, who had committed crimes, killed himself.8.4 8.4 Liu Li5a had committed incest and many murders, but had avoided punishment; he was finally sentenced to dismissal and exile for having had communication with the Wei clan, whereupon he was forced to commit suicide. His death may have occurred in the preceding year. Cf. Glossary, sub voce. 81HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih IV, V 12: 8a, b The imperial capital was divided and there were A.D. 4, 5 established the two commanderies of the Displayer of Splendor in the South and the Successor to the Magnificence in the North. The official titles and rankings of the ministers, grandees, and eighty-one First Officers were changed, together with the names, 8b divisions, boundaries, and the commanderies and kingdoms which belonged [to each] of the twelve provinces. The abolitions, establishings, changes, and alterations in the empire made so much work that the officials could not record them.8.5 8.5 The only change in official titles I have found recorded for this time is from Superintendent of the Imperial House to Elder of the Imperial House (19 B: 52b). Probably these other titles were later changed again, so that historians did not trouble to record such short-lived alterations. In the winter, a great gale blew off almost all of Winter the tiles from the buildings at the eastern gates of the city-wall of Ch'ang-an. In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, the V hsia ancestral sacrifice to all the ancestors together A.D. 5 was performed in the Ming-t'ang;8.6 8.6 Ying Shao remarks, "According to the rites, [every] five years there should be two grand sacrifices, one ti [a common offering to all the ancestors in the fifth year] and one hsia [a similar offering in the third year]. At the hsia [sacrifice], those shrines which have been removed to the temple of the first ancestor, together with the tablets of those shrines which have not yet been removed, are all jointly given offerings in [the shrine of] the first ancestor." This remark is based on Kung-yang Commentary 13: 3b, 4a (Dk. Wen, II, viii). Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, pp. 249-250. twenty-eight Jan./Feb. vassal kings,8.7 8.7 Ch'ien Ta-hsin finds that only 22 vassal kings were reigning at this time: the King of Ch'eng-yang, Liu Li4 (14: 6b), the King of Tzu-ch'uan, Liu Yung3b (14: 7b), the King of Ho-chien, Liu Shang4b (14: 13b), the King of Lu, Liu Min3a (14: 14b), the King of Chao, Liu Yin6a (14: 15a), the King of Ch'ang-sha, Liu Lu-jen (14: 16a), the King of Kuang-p'ing, Liu Kuang-han (14: 16b), the King of Chiao-tung, Liu Yin2 (14: 18a), the King of Liu-an, Liu YÃ¼5a (14: 18b), the King of Chen-ting, Liu Yang (14: 19a), the King of Szu-shui, Liu Ching5 (14: 19b), the King of Kuang-yang, Liu Chia1b (14: 20a), the King of Kuang-ling, Liu Shou3a (14: 20b), the King of Kao-mi, Liu Shen (14: 21a), the King of Huai-yang, Liu Yin4b (14: 21b), the King of Tung-p'ing, Liu K'ai-ming (14: 21b), the King of Chung-shan, Liu Ch'eng-tu (20: 22a), the King of Ch'u, Liu YÃ¼1a (20: 22b), the King of Hsin-tua, Liu Ching3b (14: 22b), the King of Kuang-tsung, Liu Ju-yib (14: 13a), the King of Kuang-shih, Liu Kung1a (14: 14b), and the King of Kuang-tÃª, Liu Lun (14: 18a). The King of Liang, Liu Yin1b (14: 12a), was not appointed until the second or the intercalary month of this year, so is not included. one hundred twenty full marquises 82HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih V A.D. 5 and more than nine hundred scions of the imperial 12: 8b, 9a house were summoned to assist in the sacrifices. When the rites were ended, all [had a certain number 8a of] households added [to their estates] or they were granted noble ranks, and [they were granted] money and silk or their official ranks were increased or they were given vacancies as officials, to each proportionately. An imperial edict [from the Grand Empress Dowager] said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when the [ancient] lords and kings governed the common people by their virtue, their next [principle] was to favor their relatives, in order that [their influence might thereby] reach to others.8.8 8.8 Alluding to Mencius I, i, vii, 12 (Legge, p. 143). Anciently Yao harmonized his nine [classes of] kindred8.9 8.9 An allusion to Book of History I, i, 2 (Legge, p. 17; Couvreur, p. 2). and Shun 7a generously promoted [his kindred].8.10 8.10 An allusion to ibid. II, iii, 1 (Legge, p. 69; Couvreur, p. 44). Karlgren, BMFED, 20, 106f, gl. 1297, does not express the full force of "giving thin proper order to" a king's kindred. Because of the Emperor's youth, We have temporarily been 9a directing the government of the state. [We] have reflected that the scions of the imperial house are all descendants of the Grand Founder, Emperor Kao, or of his brothers, [King] Ch'ing of Wu, [Liu Chung, and King] YÃ¼an of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao]; that, since the beginning of the Han [dynasty] to the present, [they have multiplied and have become] more than a hundred thousand persons; and that altho they are related to [such persons as] kings and marquises, they have been unable mutually to control each other, and so some have fallen into punishment for crime. The cause [for this situation is that the imperial] teaching and instruction has not reached them. Does not the Memoir say, `When princes are generous 83HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih V 12: 9a, b to their relatives, then the common people are stirred A.D. 5 to mutual kindnesses'?9.1 9.1 Analects VIII, ii, 2 (Soothill, p. 383). "For the imperial house [which has descended] 8b from the Grand Emperor, the clan, each [member of which] has inherited his surname [of Liu], let Masters to the Imperial Clan be established in the commanderies and kingdoms in order to control them and bring [the imperial] teaching and instruction to them. Let [the officials who rank at] two thousand piculs select those who are virtuous and well-principled to be the Masters to the Imperial Clan. They should examine and investigate those who do not follow [the imperial] teaching and ordinances and those who have suffered injustice and lost their positions. Masters of the Imperial Clan are permitted to take advantage of the postal stations in writing letters to ask the Elder of the Imperial House to make requests [of Us] in order that [We] may hear of it. Regularily every year in the first month, the 7b Masters of the Imperial Clan shall each be granted ten bolts of silk."9.2 9.2 Ho Ch'uo remarks, "At that time the vassal kings were all like ordinary common people, not worth being afraid of. Yet because [the imperial clan] was a multitude of more than a hundred thousand [persons, Wang Mang] thought that [the members of] the Liu [clan] might join together and start trouble. Hence he secretly appointed those of them who were closely leagued with the Wang clan and would injure the imperial house, in order secretly to restrain and repress the imperial clan, not to teach and instruct them." Such comments appear to be unsupported suspicions. The Hsi-and-Ho, Liu Hsin1a, and others, four persons [in all],9.3 9.3 These four were Liu Hsin1a, P'ing Yen, K'uang Yung, and Sun Ch'ien, according to HS 18: 29a, b. who had been sent to prepare the Ming-t'ang and Pi-yung, had brought it about that the Han [dynasty] had happy presages similar to those of King Wen [when he built] his Spiritual 9b Tower and to those of the Duke of Chou [when he built the city of] Lo; the Grand Coachman, Wang YÃ¼n, and others, eight persons [in all], who had been 84HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih V A.D. 5 sent to investigate [the people's] customs, had propa- 12: 9b gated [the imperial] virtue and culture, so that all the kingdoms had become harmonious;9.4 9.4 These eight were Wang YÃ¼n, Yen Ch'ien, Ch'en Ch'ung, Li Hsi, Ho Tang, Hsieh Yin, Lu P'u, and Ch'en Feng, according to HS 19: 30a-31b. This passage is probably composed of quotations from the imperial edicts making these enfeoffments. all [these June 299.5 9.5 Cf. HS 18: 29a-31b. twelve persons] were enfeoffed as full marquises. The [following sorts of persons] were summoned to the place where [the Emperor] was: those in the empire who comprehended and understood the lost classics, the ancient records, astrological phenomena, astronomical calculations, the musical tubes, philology, Shih [Chou's] Fascicles, the magical and technical arts, materia medica, together with those who taught the Five Classics, the Analects, the Classic of Filial Piety, and the Erh-ya. For these there were yoked small chariots with singly sealed 9a [passports]9.6 9.6 HS 99 A: 19a dates the summoning of these persons in A.D. 4. The dating A.D. 5 here probably is that of their arrival. Ju Shun remarks, "[According to] the Code, those who are required [to ride] riding quadrigae (sheng chuan ) together with those who [ride] equipages [specially] sent out [for them] (fa-chia ) or post-quadrigae (chih-chuan ) [cf. HFHD I, 107, n. 3 for these types of chariots] must all hold wooden passport credentials (mu-chuan-hsin ), [cf. I, 252, n. 2] one foot five inches [long], sealed with the seal of the Grandee Secretary. Those who [ride] riding quadrigae have [their passports] sealed thrice. When there is a set convocation, the two ends [of the passports] are repeatedly sealed, each end having two seals, [making] altogether four seals. For riding post quadrigae (chih -chuan) and galloping quadrigae (ch'ih-chuan ) there are five seals: each of the two ends has two [seals] and in the center there is one [seal]. For small chariots (yao-chuan ) with two horses, [passports] are sealed twice; for [small chariots] with one horse, [passports] are sealed once." Han Chiu-yi A: 6b (by Wei Hung, fl. dur. 25-57) says, "For those who in accordance with an imperial edict are sent to dispose of some matter, the [Grandee] Secretary has yoked [a small carriage and their passports are sealed with] one seal; [for those who] transmit an ordinance of amnesty, he has yoked [a small carriage and their passports are sealed with] two seals." (Reference from Shen Ch'in-han.) Yao Nai (1732-1815) suggests that "equipages [specially] sent out" may be equipages like the comfortable carriage (an-ch'e ) sent for his excellency Shen, to bring him to the capital, who was accompanied by two disciples riding small chariots (cf. 88: 16a). "Shih Chou's Fascicles" is the famous word list attributed, in Han times, to a clerk of the eighth century B.C., cf. HS 30: 22b. For Han materia medica cf. HS 25 B; 15a, 92: 7b. The latter passage mentions a work containing several hundred thousand words. to send them to the capital. Those who arrived [numbered] several thousand persons. 85HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih V 12: 10a In the intercalary month, [Liu] Yin1b, a great- A.D. 5, 6 10a great-grandson of a great-grandson of King Hsiao of June/July Liang, [Liu Wu3], was made King [of Liang].10.1 10.1 HS 14: 12a dates this appointment in the second month on the day ting-yu (Mar. 1). HS 27 A: 16a says, "In YÃ¼an-shih V, vii, on chi-hai [Aug. 30], there was a visitation [of fire] to the doors of the Hall in the Second Temple of Emperor Kao, and they were reduced to ashes." In the winter, the twelfth month, on [the day] ping-tzu,10.2 10.2 The text reads ping-wu, but Hoang places no such day in that twelfth month. HS 99 A: 24b also reads "twelfth month." Han-chi 30: 6b reads, "the twelfth month, [the day] ping-tzu," which seems to be correct, for that day occurred in that month. Yen Shih-ku comments, "A Han commentator says, `When the Emperor became older and grew up, he had a grudge on account of his mother, the Queen Dowager [nee] Wei, [who had wept day and night for her son, but was nevertheless not allowed to come to the imperial capital to care her child, and all of whose relatives had been killed by Wang Mang], and was unhappy. [Wang] Mang himself knew that [the Emperor] was becoming increasingly estranged from him, and [Wang Mang's] plot to usurp [the throne] and kill [the Emperor] arose from this circumstance. Hence when the la day [which that year was Jan. 20, A.D. 6] arrived, [Wang Mang] presented to the Emperor the peppered wine, and put poison into the wine.' Hence Chai Yi sent about a message which said, `[Wang] Mang assassinated Emperor Hsiao-p'ing by poison.' " HS 84: 11a records that when in A.D. 7 Chai Yi rebelled against Wang Mang, he sent urgent messages thru the empire with the foresaid words. Wang Ch'ung (Lun-heng, Forke's trans., I, 485) repeats this charge. Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks, "[Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing was poisoned by [Wang] Mang, [but a historian] does not record an assassination, [according to] the principle of the Spring and Autumn, that one should keep silent about great evils [that occur] within [the court. Pan Ku] merely did not record the day of the burial, in order to point out that it was to be classed with grievous vicissitudes." Kung-yang Commentary 3: 8b (Dk. Yin, X, vi) says, "Great evils within [the court] are not mentioned; small evils are recorded"; cf. ibid. 2: 2a (Dk. Yin, II, v). The HS records the dates of burial for all the rulers except for those of Emperor P'ing and the Empress nee LÃ¼. For the latter it is not even mentioned that she was buried. For a discussion of the evidence for this poisoning, cf. Introduction to this chapter, pp. 57-60. the Emperor died in the Wei-yang A.D. 6 Palace. A general amnesty was granted to the empire. Feb. 3 The high officials discussed and said, "[According to] the rites, `Subjects do not treat their lord as if he had died before he reached maturity.'10.3 10.3 Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh (1813) 1250: 27b quotes the Wu-ching Yi-yi by HsÃ¼ Shen (d. 121; a lost book; fragments collected by Ch'en Feng-ch'i, 1771-1834), as saying, "In accordance with the rites, Mr. HsÃ¼ said, `Subjects do not treat their lord as if he had died before he had reached maturity (the twentieth year); a son does not treat his father as if he had died before he had reached maturity. When a lord dies without children and no temple is established for him, this [act] is contrary to moral principles and disdainful of the rules of proper conduct, the greatest of crimes.' " 86HSIAO-P'ING, YÃ¼an-shih V A.D. 6 8a The Emperor was in his fourteenth year. It is proper 12: 10a, b that, according to the rites, when he is enshrouded, the bonnet of virility should be put upon him." The memorial was approved. He was buried in the K'ang Tomb. An imperial edict [from the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang] said, "The Emperor was benevolent and kindly, and there was nothing that he did not consider or feel distressed about. [But] whenever he became ill, his breath was blocked from coming out, which kept him from speaking.10.4 10.4 Asthma? Hence he did not get to prepare a testamentory edict.

[on the earth] below, [Wang] Mang was however unable to cover them up. 87 CHAPTER XII APPENDIX ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR P'ING i. An solar eclipse is recorded in YÃ¼an-shih I, v (the fifth month), on the day ting-szu, the first day of the month (12: 4a). Hoang equates this day with June 10, 1 A.D., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2885. According to calculation, at Ch'ang-an the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.75 (sun's diameter = 1.00) at 10:44 a.m. local time, so that it was conspicuous. The sun's longitude was 76Â° = 75Â° R.A. HS 27 Cb: 16a says that the eclipse was "in [the constellation] Tung-ching," whose first star, ? Gem, was then in 66Â° R.A. This constellation extends for some 33Â°. In the year between this and preceding recorded eclipse, no solar eclipses were visible in China. ii. A second solar eclipse is recorded in YÃ¼an-shih II, ix, mou-shen, the last day of the month (12: 6a). HS 27 Cb: 16 adds that it was total. Hoang equates this day with Nov. 23, 2 A.D., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2888. Calculation shows that at Ch'ang-an the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.88, and that the path of totality passed thru the present Ning-hsia, northern Shensi, K'ai-feng, and Shanghai, so that reports of totality could easily be brought to the capital. It is curious that the totality should be reported in the "Treatise," and not in the Annals; twice previously (ch. II, eclipse ii; ch. X, eclipse ii) differences between the accounts in the "Annals" and "Treatise" showed that the "Treatise" represents observations in the capital. But after 28 B.C., (except for the eclipse of 2 B.C.) the account in the "Treatise" does not as previously give the precise positions of eclipses in the heavens, only stating what constellation it was in and not always that; possibly the detailed account of eclipses, which was made at the capital and was used by Pan Ku as the source for his Treatise, ended with the eclipse of 28 B.C. In the seventeen months between this and the preceding recorded eclipse, no solar eclipses were visible in China.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">88 THE HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY CHAPTER XCIX WANG MANG INTRODUCTION Reason for presentation of this chapter here The "Annals" in the History of the Former Han Dynasty recount events only until the death of Emperor P'ing on Feb. 3, A.D. 6. There was no legal Han emperor from that date until Aug. 5, A.D. 25, when Emperor Kuang-wu of the Later Han dynasty took the throne. During the first three of these years, Wang Mang, a maternal first cousin of Emperor Ch'eng (the latter of whom was Emperor P'ing's adoptive father), ruled as Regent and Acting Emperor, with Liu Ying, a descendant of Emperor HsÃ¼an, as Heir-apparent and Young Prince, (Ju-tzu, an ancient title, given to King Ch'eng of the Chou dynasty). On Jan. 10, A.D. 9, Wang Mang took the throne as actual Emperor, and ruled until his death on Oct. 6, A.D. 23. Seven months previously, a scion of the House of Han had been set up as Emperor by a group of generals (called, from his reign-period, the Keng-shih Emperor), and, between that time and until Emperor Kuang-wu was seated firmly on the throne, about a dozen other persons were set up or set themselves up as Emperor (cf. Glossary, sub Kuang-wu, Emperor). The events in the first part of this period, from A.D. 6 to A.D. 23, are related fully only in this chapter of the History of the Former Han Dynasty. These seventeen years belong properly to the Former Han period. The period of Wang Mang's reign is extremely interesting. Its events result from the tendencies that had previously been operating. The "Annals" in the HS constitute a summary of the history during the reigns of the Han emperors; in order to continue that account until the beginning of the Later Han period, there is presented here a translation of the "Memoir of Wang Mang," which is the only extensive primary source for that period. It really constitutes an appendix to the "Annals of Emperor P'ing." The form of this Memoir In its form, the "Memoir of Wang Mang" is that of a sequent memoir (chuan); its latter portion, since it is the only extensive account in the HS of these seventeen years, is also an annals for those years. A typical memoir states first the given name and courtesy name of the 89ITS FORM person treated, then recounts his native place and ancestry, including a notice of those ancestors who were important. If, however, his father or some antecedent relative has been given a separate memoir, the notice of his native place and ancestry is omitted in such a sequent memoir. This section is followed by an account of his education, how he secured office, what offices he held, his distinguished deeds, his titles, etc. Samples of his writings are quoted, if they were important or interesting. Somewhere in the account there is a description of his character (and possibly of his appearance), preceded by the words, "As a man, ...". The notice of his death is followed by a similar account of his descendants, if they were important, and sometimes of other relatives. In general, events are related chronologically, but there are occasional deviations from that chronological order, as when an earlier event is recounted in order to explain or lead up to a later one. (Sometimes in the text there is no indication of a deviation from the chronological order; it is surprising how often a proper understanding of the chronology requires the use of the pluperfect tense). The account is thoroughly objective; the historian's feelings are rarely allowed to appear until the end of the chapter, where there is appended a "eulogy (tsan)", giving the historian's judgment upon the person or persons considered in the chapter. This eulogy is usually a highly polished statement, sententious and pregnant. (Later historians, such as HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh, have not been content with exercising so much self-restraint, and, while keeping the objective form of the account, they have introduced at various places in the text a "discussion (lun)" of the events, criticizing or approving the person or deed under consideration, sometimes at considerable length. The term "eulogy" is then reserved for a final polished literary summary.) A typical annals opens with a brief introductory section, in which are discussed matters concerning the ruler's childhood and the way he came to be selected for the throne. The chapter then relates the events during his reign, by years and months. These recordings are confined to matters of governmental concern; circumstances concerning the private life of even the ruler are relegated to the memoirs of the non-imperial individuals most concerned. Only rarely is there mentioned a matter not of governmental concern, and then only when it is of great importance. Thus Pan Ku did not even mention in his "Annals" the famous poet, Szu-ma Hsiang-ju, although he greatly admired this genius. Matters concerning legal developments are usually summarized briefly, sometimes with a reference to the "Treatise on Punishments and Laws." Matters that can be discussed better in other treatises (chih) or memoirs are similarly dealt with. Typical and important imperial edicts are quoted. After recounting 90INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX the death and burial of the ruler, there is a eulogy, similar to that in a memoir. The "Memoir of Wang Mang" is preceded by that of his aunt, the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang (ch. 98), in which there is given an extended account of the Wang clan's ancestry and of the other members of that important clan. (An abstract of that memoir will be found in the Glossary.) Consequently, matters concerning Wang Mang's ancestry and predecessors are to be found in that memoir. His memoir is thus a sequent one, and omits the features with which a typical memoir begins. Since it is a memoir, not an annals, Pan Ku does not confine himself to governmental concerns, and introduces memorials written by Wang Mang and others. He also relates fully the antecedents of events. The part of this memoir devoted to the reign of Emperor P'ing is more than twice as long as the "Annals" of that Emperor. Pan Ku's problem was how to include properly an account of Wang Mang's reign in a history of the Han period. Before he wrote the Han-shu, Pan Ku had prepared an annals for the first of the Later Han emperors, so that he knew where a history of the Later Han dynasty must begin. He did not wish to leave unrecorded the two decades between these two periods. If Wang Mang had been a legitimate emperor, Pan Ku could have written an annals for his reign, with additional memoirs treating of his important officials. Since Wang Mang was a usurper, Pan Ku could not do so. But Wang Mang was a minister to the last emperor of the Former Han line. So Pan Ku could legitimately write a memoir for him and could continue this account down to the beginning of the Later Han period. Thus he cleverly included this interregnal period in his History of the Former Han Dynasty. Since this chapter is a memoir, the accounts of Wang Mang's officials are also included in it and they are not given separate accounts. Thus this chapter contains almost all the information in the History about Wang Mang. In addition to what we have here, there is elsewhere material about this usurper in the "Annals of Emperor P'ing" (with brief mentions in those of Emperors Ch'eng and Ai), an important section concerning Wang Mang's economic policies in the "Treatise on Food and Goods" (translated in Appendix I), and a very short notice of his religious activities in the "Treatise on the Suburban and Other Sacrifices." The rebellion of Chai Yi is furthermore treated in detail in this person's memoir (abstracted in the glossary). Thus this account of Wang Mang is more rounded than that in other memoirs, in dealing with which it is necessary, in order to obtain a complete account, to read also the memoirs of the several participants in the series of events, and supplement them by the chronology to be found in the imperial annals and the tables, 91ITS SOURCES especially that in part B to the "Table of the Many Offices" (ch. 19). Hence this chapter dealing with Wang Mang is much longer than an annals or an ordinary memoir would beâand also much more satisfying. Because there is no annals for the reign of Wang Mang, the later portion of this chapter is both an annals and a memoir. A memoir regularly proceeds chronologically, so that Pan Ku could easily combine these two forms. Since this chapter also contains the only account of Wang Mang's officials, Pan Ku found that he could not end it with the death of the usurper, for he needed to relate the fate of those officials. Then he also summarized the subsequent history down to the accession of Emperor Kuang-wu. This chapter is complicated in its form. Its division into three parts was probably the work of either Ying Shao or Yen Shih-ku, who made the divisions in the chapters of the HS. This division is logical and deserves to stand. Part A deals with the rise of Wang Mang down to his assumption of the throne in A.D. 9. Part B pictures him at the height of his power. It relates his extensive changes in rites and titles and the beginning of his decline. Part C deals with the collapse of his rule, from A.D. 17 to the end. The chapter is so long that these divisions have proved useful as well as logical. Its sources Concerning the sources of this and other chapters, I shall have something to say in the volume of "Prolegomena" to this series. In the main, the sources here are the same as elsewhere: imperial messages and edicts, stenographical reports of imperial conversations (cf. 99 A: 27a), some official annals kept at the palace, memorials to the throne, with their very varied contents, such as even testimony at trials and the reports given by informers. In addition, Pan Ku used the political pamphlets of the day, which probably also formed part of the memorials to the throne, sometimes being presented to the throne by the author of the pamphlet, and sometimes (in the case of those attacking Wang Mang) forming part of the evidence memorialized to justify a condemnation. The material that might have come from the above sources may well account for practically the whole of this chapter. In this chapter, the amount of direct and extended quotation from primary sources is noteworthy. In Part A, these explicit quotations form 68% of the whole; in Part B, 53%; and in Part C, 41% (exclusive of the eulogy); an average of 55% for the chapter. Pan Ku was himself a poet and literary artist of the first rank, and plainly admired the Confucian literary products of Wang Mang's time, including Wang Mang's own edicts, hence was led to quote them as examples of the age's literary 92INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX products. The two memorials written by Chang Sung (99 A: 10a-16a; 27b-29a) alone account for 27% of the direct quotations in Part A. In addition to the direct quotations, there is a very large amount of information that must have come from written documents, such as official appointments, enfeoffments, summaries of official orders concerning economic matters, concerning the redistricting of territory, concerning military expeditions, etc. Much of this material is probably fragmentary direct quotation. Since there is no difference in Chinese style between direct and indirect discourse (except for the personal pronouns, the phrase "your servant," and a few such phrases), a clever compiler, such as Pan Ku shows himself to be, could more easily piece together phrases from earlier documents to produce his own account than himself compose the whole account anew. The peculiar description of the bandits in 99 C: 14b, which makes them out to be beggars going about asking for food, blaming the fighting upon the government officials who come out and get hurt, was very likely part of the report sent in by the Higher Subordinate Official of the Commander-in-chief mentioned immediately afterwards, who was captured by the bandits and freed, probably because he promised to plead for them. Pan Ku used it as his own account of the bandits (without mention of his source), since it came from a man who could speak at first hand about them. Another noteworthy feature of the age was the number of extensive political documents, chiefly propaganda, that are mentioned in this chapter. Evidently it was an age when there was a large reading public, who eagerly perused such documents and passed them from hand to hand. In A.D. 5, 487,572 persons (probably by groups) turned in memorials at the capital concerning Wang Mang (99 A: 19b). We hear of a work on filial piety written by Wang Mang in eight fascicles (99 A: 17a), of a report by the eight commissioners concerning the people's customs, praising Wang Mang, in 30,000 words (99 A: 23b), of a piece of propaganda, entitled "The Mandate of Heaven Given Through Portents," in 42 fascicles (99 B: 9a), of a remonstrance to Wang Mang written by his general, Chuang Yu, in three fascicles (99 C: 5b), of a book of revelations written by Wang K'uang4b attacking Wang Mang, in over 100,000 words (99 C: 12b), and of Wang Mang's own apologia, in more than a thousand words (99 C: 25a). In addition there are mentioned other political documents that must have been extensive, but about whose length we are given no information: Chai Yi's message attacking Wang Mang, sent about the country at the outset of his rebellion (99 A: 30a; 84: 11a); Liu Yin4a Po-sheng's messages (99 C: 20a), and Wei Hsiao's message (HHS, Mem. 3: 2a-4a), all attacking Wang Mang. There must have been many more, in addition to the government documents and constant 93ITS SOURCES propaganda. Pan Piao's "Discussion of the Mandate to True Kings" (quoted in HS 100 A: 7b-11b) was probably a pamphlet passed about the country in support of Emperor Kuang-wu. Stange (in Die Monographie Ã¼ber Wang Mang, p. xxiv) states that this chapter contains many matters which could only have come from oral tradition or court gossip. There are, of course, some matters that did come from oral tradition, such as the opinion about Wang Mang's music (99 C: 4b), which might indeed have come from Pan Chih, Pan Ku's grandfather. But such matters that are traceable to no written sources are very much fewer than one might think, and Stange's own examples are all chosen unfortunately. Whenever a capital sentence was imposed, the facts upon which that sentence was based were summarized in the form of a memorial and sent to the emperor for his approval before the sentence was carried out. These memorials then formed part of the government records, were preserved, and were available to Pan Ku for the compilation of his History. The government archives from Former Han times must have been very extensive. The most surprising case is that in a memorial of A.D. 9 (99 A: 34b), Wang Mang mentions a book of revelation by Kan Chung-k'o as being extant and stored in the Orchid Terrace (the imperial archives). Now this remarkable work (in twelve rolls) had been written some time in the reign of Emperor Ch'eng. It contained a prophecy that the Han dynasty had come to the end of its period and must receive a renewed mandate from Heaven. The famous Liu Hsiang had memorialized that the matter was a fabrication to impose upon the vulgar, and Kan Chung-k'o died in prison. In 5 B.C., a disciple, Hsia Ho-liang, memorialized this book to Emperor Ai, who was impressed by it and changed his own title and year-period in order to conform with this prophecy. (It was evidently this copy that Wang Mang read.) A few months later, when his illness did not improve, Emperor Ai abrogated his change and turned Hsia Ho-liang over to his officials, who decided that he had maliciously deceived the Emperor, which was an inhuman crime; he and his associates were executed. Now if this repudiated prophetic book, forming part of a memorial from a man who was executed for one of the most serious crimes in the code, was preserved in the imperial archives for a period of fourteen years, during three reigns, it is likely that memorials to the throne were generally preserved. Such memorials contained information and advice about all sorts of matters; they must have been an extensive source of information for anyone who had access to them. Pan Ku occasionally quotes such memorials, for example, Chuang Yu's advice about the expedition against the Huns, which advice was rejected (found in 94 B: 19a-b = de Groot, Die Hunnen, pp. 273-275). 94INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX Now let us examine the examples of supposedly oral tradition mentioned by Stange. The first one, the intrigue of Wang Mang against Shun-yu Chang (99 A: 2a), resulted in the death of Shun-yu Chang, the execution of his family and several dozen other persons, including a former Empress, and the promotion of Wang Mang, so that there must have been official documents recounting the testimony of those examined, requesting the execution of these persons, detailing the culprit's crimes, and indicating the person who reported them (cf. Glossary sub Shun-yu Chang). Pan Ku's information about this incident was very likely based upon these written documents. The account of Wang Mang's wife's economy (99 A: 2a, b) also probably came from a documentary source; some among the hundreds of thousands of memorials praising Wang Mang probably contained this detail, as well as many other details of Wang Mang's early life. A similar memorial was probably the source for his interview with K'ung Hsiu (99 A: 3b-4a). It is even more probable that the statement made by Liu Ch'ung to his Chancellor, Chang Shao (99 A: 27a, b), was taken from a documentary source, either from the report of the magistrate about this rebellion or from a memorial to Wang Mang by Chang Shao's cousin, Chang Sung, excusing himself. In the case of Chao Ming's message to Chai Yi (99 A: 30b), it is quite possible that this message might have been found in Chai Yi's camp after his defeat or in the city of YÃ¼, to which he fled and which was taken by storm. It is not asserted that these conversations actually occurred, any more than that the Higher Subordinate Official's account of the bandits was true; it is merely pointed out that these conversations, etc., found in the HS, could in most cases have been found by Pan Ku in some documentary source, and that he used them as representing what very likely had happened. There are many cases, especially in the HS memoirs, in which a conversation would have enlivened the account and in which no conversations are recounted. Hence it is most probable that Pan Ku did not invent the conversations he recounts. He may be criticized for using other people's invented conversations, but it seems rarely the case that he himself invented matters which were not found in documents. We have considered each of the cases Stange brings forward as supposed instances of oral tradition, and note that, as Pan Ku used them, they were all probably found by him in written form. The accounts of conversations, etc., found in the HS are different in their nature from the ones in the SC that have been so correctly suspected of having been fabricated by Szu-ma Ch'ien. The latter writer has been known for his lively accounts of events. Pan Ku's History has been criticized as being inferior in its literary characterâthe difference is probably that Pan Ku 95THE SOURCES FOR WANG MANG'S LAST DAYS refused to invent conversations and events to enliven his writings, unless he found them in his sources. Hence the reliability of each case must be judged upon its own merits and any general suspicion of Pan Ku's reliability must be laid aside. The sources for the account of Wang Mang's last days The account of Wang Mang's death is extremely interesting because of the abundant details recounted and their vividness. The number of intimate details are so extraordinary that this account must have come from an eye-witness who had close access to the Emperor. It tells what happened on each day of the siege; how Wang Mang changed the guard at the city gates; how Chang2 Han was killed as he was making the rounds of the gates; how Wang Mang was robed and where he sat in the throne-room, in the direction of the handle to the Great Dipper, performing divination while the Palace was burning (99 C: 27a). We are told by what steps he left the throne-room buildingâa staircase seemingly not mentioned elsewhere in ancient literature (a detail that would hardly have been invented by a forger)âand that his driver on his final journey was Wang Yi6, a person only mentioned here and among the list of those who died with Wang Mang. At the tower where Wang Mang's followers made their last stand, we are told how Wang Mu, the son of Wang Mang's Heir-apparent, Wang Yi5, was taking off his court robes, preparing to flee, when his father arrived, who made him don them again and stay to die with Wang Mang. Thus part of the account plainly comes from an intimate companion of Wang Mang. Other features are written from the viewpoint of the attackers. We are told in some detail how Teng Yi and YÃ¼ K'uang arose, whom they first attacked, how they effected entrance through the Wu Pass, how Teng Yi marched around the Han-ku Passâby an obscure path not mentioned elsewhere by Chinese geographersâand how he defeated the Nine Tiger Generals, bottled the remainder of them up in the Capital Granary, left them, and began preparing siege implements. Then we are told by what gate the attackers entered the palace, what important courtiers died defending the entrance to the Tower Bathed by Water, and which ones died with Wang Mang in the room on top of the Tower; exactly who killed Wang Mang and took his imperial seals and cords; who recognized the cords, evidently by their distinctive color, identified the corpse and took its head; and how Wang Hsien4 lived like an emperor after the death of Wang Mang. Where did all these details come from? They are too circumstantial to have been invented by a romancer. The "Memoir" gives us two details that seem to solve the problem. In the first place, it says that after 96INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX the death of Wang Mang, Shen-t'u Ch'ien, a Han general, directed Liu Tz'u4b, the Lieutenant Chancellor of the Keng-shih Emperor, to have Ts'ui Fa beheaded, because the latter had written an account of Wang Mang (99 C: 28b). Liu Tz'u4b came to Ch'ang-an before the Keng-shih Emperor arrived, to look over the situation and prepare a residence for the new Emperor, at which time this sentence was probably passed. Ts'ui Fa was an important personage, one of Wang Mang's advisors; a request for his execution would very probably have been prepared in accordance with the regular court procedureâa dossier of the evidence accompanied the request. In this case, most of the evidence was probably Ts'ui Fa's written account. The Keng-shih Emperor made Ch'ang-an his capital, so that the whole document found its way into the imperial archives. Thus we can trace back to Ts'ui Fa an important part of the material concerning the death of Wang Mang. Ts'ui Fa was in a position to know these events, for he belonged to the innermost circle about Wang Mang. Ts'ui Fa appears again and again in the account of Wang Mang's reign, giving successful advice upon various superstitious practises, such as the very interesting wailing at the Altar to Heaven and the wailing in the city of Ch'ang-an to keep off invaders. Ts'ui Fa seems, after his surrender to Shen-t'u Ch'ien, to have written an apologia, recounting his influence over Wang Mang and relating the details of the last days in his master's life. Perhaps he was with Wang Mang in the Tower and, as Wang Mu began to do, he took off his court robes, mixed with the ignorant soldiers who did not even recognize Wang Mang, and escaped. Ts'ui Fa seems to have been the sort of man who would do such a thing, and afterwards attempt to gain glory by writing an account of what had transpired. We know that this apologia was preserved, for it is stated that Emperor Kuang-wu had Yin Min rebut "a comparison written in behalf of Wang Mang by Ts'ui Fa" (HHS, Mem. 69 A: 10a), which contained prophecies and revelations. Other features of Pan Ku's account came from separate sources. Someone undoubtedly wrote an account of the capture of Ch'ang-an as a report to the Keng-shih Emperor. We are not told who it was; the account did not come from Wang Hsien4; it is too unfavorable to him. I suspect that Teng Yi was the author of this account, if there were not many such accountsâmany of the details in the HS are connected with Teng Yi's expedition. Kung-pin Chiu, who secured Wang Mang's head, moreover carried this trophy to the Keng-shih Emperor at YÃ¼an and received a marquisate for his deed. He undoubtedly had someone prepare an account of his exploit for presentation to the Emperorâpossibly he wrote it himself. This account might naturally contain a list stating where 97THE SOURCES FOR WANG MANG'S LAST DAYS each of Wang Mang's officials died, for Kung-pin Chiu was familiar with the court and could identify them. The curious literary addition that several tens of soldiers killed each other in hacking Wang Mang's body to pieces may also come from his account. This incident is strikingly like the occurrence at the death of Hsiang YÃ¼, when several tens of soldiers killed each other in the struggle for his body (Mh II, 320); indeed, exactly the same Chinese words are used. In that case, a reward was given to each person who finally secured a member; in the case of Wang Mang, we hear of nothing except the reward to Kung-pin Chiu; indeed, no reward seems actually to have previously been offered for Wang Mang's head, although everyone doubtless expected a reward. This incident looks like a literary embellishment to the account of Wang Mang's death, and might very likely have been added by Kung-pin Chiu in order to make an impression. If it was found in the written report of an eye-witness, we can hardly blame Pan Ku for utilizing it. The foregoing analysis may indicate something of the nature of the sources used by Pan Ku. Of course, this analysis is wholly hypothetical; Pan Ku left no detailed account of the sources he used. But we know that he had free access to the imperial archives, and we can determine, from a knowledge of Han practises, about what sort of material must have been in those archives. Since Pan Ku spent twenty years working on his History while he was an official of the imperial private library and had access to the archives, he would naturally have culled out the material we find in this chapter. Then it is almost entirely a skilful piecing together of documentary material. Pan Piao's part in this chapter It is difficult to determine whether most of this chapter was written by Pan Ku or by his father, Pan Piao. Stange (ibid., xii) thinks that a large part came from the experiences of Pan Piao. But Pan Piao was born in A.D. 3 (HHS, Mem. 30 A: 5a), so that he was only twenty years of age when Wang Mang was killed. His father, Pan Chih, was living in retirement as a Gentleman at the tomb of Emperor Ch'eng, because of his tacit opposition to Wang Mang, so that Pan Piao would hardly have been acquainted in court circles. It would thus seem that only a negligible part of this chapter could have come from Pan Piao's own experiences. In a work made up largely of piecemeal quotations from documentary sources, we would hardly expect any differences in style between father and son. Pan Piao became later only a minor official in some of the capital offices; he was sent out to hold office in a city of the 98INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX present Anhui and later to one in Hopei, so that he hardly had access to the numerous sources available to Pan Ku. The HHS says that Pan Ku considered his father's account not to have been sufficiently detailed (HHS, Mem. 30 A: 7b), and, in his own preface, Pan Ku does not mention his father's work. I suspect that Pan Piao did not have much to do with the "Memoir of Wang Mang," although it is impossible to prove such a statement. The reliability of this account Pan Ku has often been suspected of bias against Wang Mang. He indeed condemns Wang Mang in the severest termsâhis eulogy (99 C: 29a-30a) could hardly have been more drastic. His family, too, suffered from Wang Mang. In the reign of Emperor Ch'eng (during ca. 32-18 B.C.), Pan Ku's clan had for a time been very close to the throne, enjoying an eminence that was said to have shaken the empire (100 A: 6a). About 1 B.C., however, Pan Ku's grandfather had been accused of a capital crime by Wang Mang's associates and compelled to retire from official life (100 A: 5b). Hence the Pan clan was not in sympathy with Wang Mang, although it took no part in the rebellions against him. In the disorder after the death of Wang Mang, Pan Piao fled to the present Kansu, where he finally joined Emperor Kuang-wu's forces, and later returned to the capital with them. Pan Ku was moreover a loyal adherent of the Later Han dynasty; he was highly honored by and intimate with its second emperor (HHS, Mem. 30 A: 8b). He thus had ample reason to be prejudiced against Wang Mang. There is, however, little or no evidence that he actually distorted his History because of any such prejudice. In the first place, his method of writing history by extensively quoting sources was itself a safeguard. If there had been any considerable distortion of the facts on his part, the large amount of quotation from contemporary documents would enable us to discover such distortion. The high literary quality of Wang Mang's edicts and of his courtiers' memorials indeed probably caused Pan Ku to admire them greatly and to quote them extensively. He was actually attracted to this age, because of its Confucian spirit. Yin Min, with whom Pan Ku worked on "The Fundamental Annals of the Epochal Exemplar, [Emperor Kuang-wu]," (HHS, Mem. 30 A: 8a), found it impossible to rebut Ts'ui Fa's apologia for Wang Mang, probably because it was so thoroughly Confucian in its spirit and sayings. All he could say was that the sages had written no prophetic writings and that the dissection of characters to derive meanings from them was almost the same as vulgarity (HHS, Mem. 69 A: 10a). Wang Mang's portents were so Confucian and were 99ITS RELIABILITY presented with so much Confucian learning that probably the only possible refutation was that offered tacitly by Pan Kuâthat they were fabrications. In the second place, Pan Ku seems personally to have cherished a high ideal of historical accuracy. He does not tell good stories for their own sake, as did Szu-ma Ch'ien. His literary style may have suffered thereby; the ambitious Szu-ma Ch'ien seems to have told dramatic stories, whereas Pan Ku clung to what he conceived to be the truth. Pan Ku's spirit was that of the fifty-odd Confucians whom Emperor Wu asked (ca. 110 B.C.) to determine the ancient ceremonies for the imperial sacrifices feng and shan, which that Emperor proposed to reestablish. Failing to discover any detailed account of these rites, they replied that they could not determine them, and the Emperor himself fixed these rites (HS 58: 12a, b). This spirit of historical accuracy was nourished by the famous story in the Tso-chuan (Dk. Hsiang, XXV; Legge, p. 514), concerning the historiographers in the state of Ch'i. When, in 548 B.C., Ts'ui Chu's followers killed Duke Chuang, who had illegally entered the former's house, the Grand Clerk is said to have written on his records, "Ts'ui Chu assassinated his prince." Ts'ui Chu had the clerk put to death, but his younger brother, who succeeded to the position, made the same record. (Official posts were hereditary in the clans of their occupants.) Ts'ui Chu had this brother in turn put to death, but the third brother, on succeeding to the position, made the same record. So Ts'ui Chu forgave the last brother and let the record stand. Meanwhile the Clerk For the South, hearing that the clan of the Grand Clerk had been extinguished, had taken his writing tablets and started for the court, evidently intending to make the same record when he would succeed to the post of Grand Clerk. Upon hearing that the record had been made, he however returned home. This story, whether true or not, must have been a powerful stimulus in ancient times to a correct recording of history, since it was the picture of the ideal clerk. One of the accusations made against Liu Hsin1a was that he had "done away with the traditions about the classics handed down from generation to generation by his teachers"âhe seems to have merely changed the principles of portent-interpretation (Cf. 99 C: 14b &amp; n. 14.6). There was thus in certain strains of Confucianism a strong tradition of fidelity to the facts of history. Pan Ku, a thorough-going Confucian, had this strong incentive to give an unprejudiced picture of even a ruler whom he reprobated deeply. In the third place, the Pan clan had not actually been harmed by Wang Mang, and had good reason to be attached to his aunt, the Grand Empress 100INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX Dowager nee Wang. Pan Ku's own great-aunt had become a favorite of Emperor Ch'eng and came to be entitled the Favorite Beauty nee Pan. She retired from the imperial court in 18 B.C., when she became unwillingly involved in an intrigue. She then devoted herself to the care of the Grand Empress Dowager, who became fond of her (100 A: 5b). Wang Mang belonged to the same social group as Pan Ku's grandfather and great-uncles. Wang Mang indeed treated them as his own brothers and wore mourning for Pan Ku's great-uncle (before 1 B.C.; 100 A: 5b). Pan Ku's grandfather, Pan Chih, who was a commandery official during the reign of Emperor P'ing, was impeached by Wang Mang's associates for having failed to forward to the throne a laudatory report, which he probably knew was false. Through the intercession of the Grand Empress Dowager, he was not punished, and retired from active life with his former salary to the funerary park of Emperor Ch'eng. Thus Pan Ku's clan was able to remain unmolested in safe obscurity during the reign of Wang Mang and had no reason for any active animosity towards Wang Mang. The family income came from Wang Mang's treasury. In the fourth place, the popular reaction against Wang Mang was so thorough that the Later Han dynasty did not need to encourage propaganda against him, so that a prejudiced account was not expected. Pan Ku was moreover born nine years after Wang Mang died, so that he came of a generation which was able to view Wang Mang dispassionately. He wrote half a century after Wang Mang's age, when active resentment had had time to die down. In the fifth place, Pan Ku seems to have clung to a historian's objective valuation of events, and refused to over-value events in order to make an impression. For example, he did not record all the early revolts on the part of the Liu clan against Wang Mang, which he might have done in order to exalt the Han dynasty. He tells merely of Liu Ch'ung (99 A: 27a) and of Liu K'uai (99 B: 7b, 8a); it is only through an incidental mention in a memorial by Sun Chien that we learn of Liu Ts'eng and Liu Kuei, who also revolted (99 B: 13b). Probably these latter two revolts were so ineffective that Pan Ku did not consider them worth recounting. He even gives an outline of Wang Mang's book of propaganda and quotes its conclusion at length (99 B: 9a-11a), without attempting any rebuttal. The coincidences and analogies he quotes are quite adequate to convince a superstitiously inclined person of Wang Mang's legitimacy. Pan Ku does thus seem to try to give a fair view of Wang Mang and to be objective in his presentation of the evidence. I began my study of this chapter with a decided prejudice against Pan Ku (expecting him to be prejudiced) and in favor of Wang Mang, but the weight of the primary sources quoted by Pan Ku and the facts he recounts forced me to reverse my opinion 101ITS LITERARY QUALITY and to agree with Pan Ku in condemning Wang Mang. There is every evidence that Pan Ku really tried and largely succeeded in giving an objective and reliable account of Wang Mang. The literary quality of this chapter The "Memoir of Wang Mang" is a literary masterpiece, in which the author largely succeeds in giving the reader the impression that Wang Mang left upon his contemporaries. Upon first reading it, Wang Mang appears at the outset as an unusually able and upright person, ambitious perhaps, but of uncommon high-mindedness. He outdoes his age in scrupulous morality, and his few off-color deeds, such as his purchase of a slave-girl and the supplanting of Shun-yÃ¼ Chang, appear as quite excusable in such an unusual person. Even the execution of his son, Huo, appears as sheer uprightness, not ruthlessness. His handling of the crisis at the death of Emperor Ai is magnificent, and the clever way he afterwards disposed of those who might thwart him brings applause. His steady humility and princely generosity fill one with admiration, just as they did the public of his time. As clever intrigues, one after another, bring success and he is praised, rewarded, and raised to heights never before known in Chinese history, a casual reader may well feel approval of this hero, although the approval may not be so whole-hearted when one remembers his ruthless crushing of his oldest son, of the Wei clan, and their associates, and the cruel way he secured settlers for the new Hsi-hai Commandery. (It is not until one has read through the whole account to the end and recognizes Wang Mang's character in its full depth of ruthless self-centeredness and shrewd deception, that these early events take on a sinister, not a benignant aspect. This masterly effect is achieved by the simple expedient of relating facts objectively and leaving their interpretation for the most part to the reader. [Exceptions to this entire objectivity are confined to adjectives and phrases, the condemnatory nature of which are deliberately hightened in the translation, in order to indicate the author's inner attitude. Cf. 99 A: 1b, 4b, 6b, 8b.] It is not, for example, until Wang Mang's last legitimate son has died that we are informed of the four children he begat in his three years of retirement at his estate, just as his public did not know of this fact until that time. Then we realize that he was no high-minded monogamist, but an iron-willed hypocrite, ready to conceal anything from the public.) As portent follows portent with ever increasing impressiveness, and as rebellions are crushed, we are filled with admiration for this able statesman, and realize that his public approved of his taking the throne. When he attains the height of his power and ascends the throne with seeming reluctance, we feel that he has secured his just deserts. He appears as 102INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX the conscientious Confucian, bent on obedience to the examples of the ancient sage-kings, determined to perfect his state in all particulars. Then, as unwise and oppressive measures follow one after another, as he crushes ruthlessly his old followers, Chen Feng and his party, we realize the tremendous force for evil that he incarnated, and we begin to guess something of the tortures in store for the country. When the people are driven to banditry, when his own grandson and his son plot against his life, and when finally even his three highest officials plot to abduct him, we feel that he is getting only his just deserts. When however the collapse comes, and Wang Mang appears as a tired old man, sleeping only on his stool (99 C: 24a), wearing himself out to the end in an iron determination to vanquish even hopeless circumstances, using every means except the right ones, our indignation turns to pity, and the final massacre becomes not merely the inevitable result of his deeds, but a real tragedy, for the whole account constitutes a masterly portrayal of overweening ambition and its inevitable result. Pan Ku has moreover achieved this wonderful effect, not by a free composition, but by piecing together documents in the right order, clinging to the facts as he found themâa work of extraordinary artistry. Sometimes the machinery does creak, as when we are given the long list of appointments and enactments made when Wang Mang ascended the throne, but such things are inevitable in a history that attempts to be complete. When the edicts and memorials drag out their weary length and the flowery parallels are repeated again and again, we begin to get weary, until we realize that we are being treated to samples of the age's literature. It is rather surprising that the whole account is not dull and long-winded from beginning to end. A lesser artist would have made it so. Pan Ku saw his opportunity for producing an unusually artistic history out of dry-as-dust materials and solved the problem of doing so. Such an achievement is nothing less than a work of genius. Historical problems connected with Wang Mang Because this chapter is not accompanied by memoirs that elaborate the dry facts given in its chronological outline, as was the case with the "Imperial Annals," but is itself a historical unit, it is not necessary in this introduction to present matters omitted from this chapter, as was done previously. The only important matters not presented fully in this chapter are the economic measures adopted by Wang Mang, and they are discussed fully in the appendices. The important problems concerning Wang Mang up to the time of Emperor P'ing's death have been discussed in the introduction to that Emperor's "Annals." It remains here to discuss two further matters: 103REASONS FOR APPROVAL OF WANG MANG'S USURPATION Why was there so little opposition to Wang Mang's seizure of the throne? and, What were the reasons for his fall? How Wang Mang secured general approval for his usurpation As was pointed out previously, Wang Mang gained his honors by espousing thoroughly the Confucian faith and utilizing its traditions. After Emperor P'ing's death, Confucian principles were used to exalt Wang Mang by persons who believed they would be benefited by his elevation. Thereby they raised him to the throne. Confucianism has had a curiously ambivalent attitude towards existing rulers. Confucius was himself a legitimist; he tried to strengthen the power of the ruler in his own state of Lu against the noble clans who were usurping that power. The Spring and Autumn has been interpreted, from ancient times, as indicating an attempt on the part of Confucius to exalt the position of the Son of Heaven (the Chou King) against the feudal nobles who were usurping that power. Thus Confucianism has stood for loyalty to the titular ruler of the state and the exaltation of his power against other claimants for power. This fact is, I think, the ultimate reason that China has never had any successful line of nobles, such as the Shoguns, who ruled for a succession of faineant emperors. On the other hand, Confucianism has included the splendid doctrine of Heaven's Mandate, by virtue of whose possession a dynasty rules, but which may be lost by wicked or incapable rulers. This doctrine has been of inestimable ethical benefit to China and has probably been responsible for the generally good character of Chinese rule. The teaching that "Heaven's mandate is not constant" (Book of Odes, III, i, i, 5; Legge, p. 430) was dinned into the ears of Chinese heir-apparents by their Confucian tutors and ministers, so that rulers were induced to attempt being models for the empire, for the sake of keeping themselves on the throne and of perpetuating their dynastic lines. In Former Han times at least, the character of the emperors was generally higher than that of their brothers and cousins, who were petty kings. Confucianism has both supported existing dynasties and also, when a dynasty has shown itself feeble, has helped to bring about its fall. By the end of Former Han times, Confucianism had absorbed and modified the teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school and the school of the Five Powers. The latter school asserted that the coming of each dynasty had been heralded by portents. This belief was accepted by Han Confucianism. The heralding of great rulers by supernatural portents is a widespread ancient belief; it could be justified in Han China by many ancient myths concerning the founders of the Chou dynasty and others, which myths were accordingly incorporated into the Confucian tradition. 104INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX Wang Mang's many portents were quite Confucian. In Chou times, divination and magical practises were part of the state religion, and many examples of both are to be found in the Tso-chuan, so that the acceptance of magical performances of many sorts became part of the Confucian imitation of ancient practises. The famous HsÃ¼n-tzu, whose interpretation of Confucian theory dominated Han Confucianism, had indeed attacked superstition of all sorts, even denying the existence of any spirits whatever, but the anti-superstitious phase of his teaching was not adopted by Han thinkers. Wang Mang's extensive use of magic, especially in the closing phase of his reign, was quite Confucian. His use of the divining-board when the Palace was being attacked (99 C: 27a) was copied directly from the account of the Grand Astrologer in the Chou-li. The magical sacrifices, by which he expected to attain immortality, were probably also considered to be Confucian. They were suggested by Su Yo, who is entitled a magician (fang-shih; 25 B: 22b). Magic was then probably considered a Confucian practise, for the Chou-li includes among the imperial officials such magical offices as the Grand Augur (Biot, II, 69), the Master of Augury (Pu-shih; ibid. 74), Diviners (Chan-jen; ibid. 78), the Interpreter of Dreams (Chan-meng; ibid. 82), the Grand Intercessor (T'ai-chu; ibid. 85), the Imprecator (Tsu-chu; ibid. 101), the Chief of the Shamans (Szu-wu; ibid. 102), the Male and Female Shamans (Nan-, NÃ¼-wu; ibid. 103, 104), the Hereditary Magical Chancellor (Fang-hsiang-shih; ibid. 225), and the Shaman for Horses (Wu-ma; ibid. 259). Indeed, many practises which later became specifically Taoist seem to have been considered Confucian in Former Han times; Liu Hsiang4a, one of the outstanding Confucians, spent much time and money, in his younger days, in attempting to make alchemistic gold. Since Confucianism stressed the imitation of ancient practises, magic, alchemy, and superstition entered this stream of thought with little hindrance. They seem only later to have been cast out, especially in Sung times. Wang Mang was such a convinced Confucian that he accepted its superstition and magic, and may never have doubted, even in his last hours, that the careful use of Confucian magic would eventually bring successâat least that is Ts'ui Fa's picture of him. Yet he was so worried during the last few days that he could not eat (99 C: 27a). Confucians could later explain the failure of this magic in the case of Wang Mang by alleging that magic does not work for a usurper. Literary noble titles The use of literary titles for nobles, rather than titles drawn from their fiefs, seems also to have been a specifically Confucian practise. Emperor 105LITERARY NOBLE TITLES Kao gave a few such literary titles before he acquired any secure territory, such as that of Baronet Enlarging Our Territory, given to Li Yi-chi. Li Yi-chi was the first Confucian whom Emperor Kao was able to endure. When this emperor later took the throne, with characteristic common sense, he gave only titles taken from some fief. There were a few other literary titles, all of which were similarly unimportant. The first important and permanent literary title in Han times was Emperor Wu's title for the noble he enfeoffed to carry on the sacrifices to the Chou dynasty, the Baronet Baron Descendant of the Chou Dynasty. The practise of enfeoffing a descendant of a supplanted dynasty to carry on the ancestral sacrifices of that dynasty is itself Confucian and this practise is recorded in the Confucian Classics as having been performed by the founders of the Chou dynasty. In the course of time, as Confucian influence became stronger, more and more literary titles appeared. When Emperor YÃ¼an took the throne, he appointed K'ung Pa, a descendant of Confucius who had been this Emperor's teacher, as Baronet in Recompense for [Confucius'] Perfection (81: 15a). He also raised the title for the descendant of the Chou dynasty to be that of marquis. Emperor Ch'eng furthermore appointed a Marquis Continuing and Honoring the Ancestral Sacrifices of the Yin Dynasty, and then raised both these last two marquises to the rank of duke. Wang Mang at first continued this practise of giving literary titles only to those nobles continuing ancient lines. In A.D. 1, Confucius was posthumously made Duke HsÃ¼an-ni as Recompense for Perfection. As time went on, the Confucian literary flavor of such titles attracted him more and more, and the magical properties of such names made them important. Confucius was said to have emphasized the "rectification of names". That statement was now taken to imply the giving of magically effective titles. After he came to the throne, Wang Mang used almost none but literary titles for his nobles, his officials, and his generals. I have attempted the difficult and dubious task of translating them, in order to indicate their literary and magical flavor. Wang Mang changed the titles of his officials to phrases found in the Confucian classics. These titles are sometimes curious, but always literary. Since it takes at least two words to make an unmistakable title, and since, in a speech of Shun, the Book of History contains the phrase "my forester," Wang Mang entitled one of his officials, the My Forester. The Chinese phrase, because of the cryptic nature of Chinese words, does not openly convey the nonsensical connotation of the English, but the meaning is exactly as I have translated it. In the titles of his generals, magical connotations seem to have overbalanced purely literary ones; Wang Mang seems indeed to have relied largely upon his 106INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX literary-magical titles for military success. That was a legitimate conclusion from the strain of Confucianism he had imbibed. Towards the end of his reign, the grandiose tendency of literary titles resulted in the multiplication of generalissimos and commanders-in-chief, a tendency continued in the early days of the Later Han dynasty. Indeed, Wang Mang's literary titles made such an impression on his age that the rebels against him imitated his titles. They were in good Confucian tradition. The doctrine of the Five Powers Two historical circumstances were responsible for convincing intelligent people that Wang Mang should take the throne. These were the philosophical doctrine of the five elements and certain historical events that led people to believe the Han dynasty must inevitably end. This philosophical theory was not the creation of a single person or age, but changed radically during Han times. Its various forms each influenced history, so it deserves careful study. A cyclical theory of history is natural in any early philosophy. Greece too, in the philosophies of Empedocles and others, possessed such cyclical theories. The five Chinese elements, earth, wood, metal, fire, and water, seem to have come from popular thought. Tsou Yen, in the first half of the third century B.C., made them into a cyclical succession which constituted a philsophy of history. As one element or power becomes victorious over another, the dynasty upheld by that power conquers its predecessor dynasty. Each power has its color, its appropriate month for its New Year's day, its number, its note, etc. The victory of a new power exhibits itself by supernatural portents, so that the dominant power can be determined by historical events. HsÃ¼n-tzu had interpreted the Confucian supreme deity, Heaven, as an impersonal Nature; the succession of the elements came to be considered a law of Nature. It explained the succession of dynasties and, like natural laws today, was thought to enable the prediction of future eventsâin this case, the next dynasty. This doctrine soon became popular and was taught instead of the earlier Confucian doctrine that a dynasty falls because of its moral inadequacies. In a period of constant civil war, this earlier Confucian theory had little empirical confirmation. In Han times, Tsou Yen's theory was taken into Confucian thought and secured wide acceptance. The Chou dynasty, because of the red crow that appeared to King Wu (Book of History, Legge, II, 298) was considered to have had the virtue of fire, hence the Ch'in First Emperor adopted the virtue of water, for water conquers (quenches) fire. He adopted the corresponding month for his New Year's. But the Ch'in dynasty ruled China for only fifteen 107THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIVE POWERS years, a time much too brief for the period a power rules, if the Chou period is taken as typical. The Han dynasty located its capital near the destroyed Ch'in capital; the last Ch'in ruler surrendered his insignia and authority to the Eminent Founder of the Han dynasty; the latter accordingly assumed that he took over the Ch'in dynasty's power of water, whose color is black. He established a temple to the Black Lord, thus increasing the number of Lords on High to five (25 A: 17b). Down to the end of the Former Han period, Palace Attendants wore black sables (98: 15a). Until the time of Emperor Wen, this theory held the field. It was championed by Emperor Kao's paladin, who became Emperor Wen's learned Lieutenant Chancellor, Chang Ts'ang. Some other learned men were not however satisfied. A change in the dynasty indicates a change in the ruling power; earth conquers (dykes) water just as the Han dynasty conquered the Ch'in. Hence the Han dynasty should change its New Year's day, the colors of court robes, etc., to those corresponding to earth. So reasoned Chia Yi. Kung-sun Ch'en even predicted that a yellow dragon would appear to manifest what was the dynasty's virtue. Earth is yellow. In 165 B.C., a yellow dragon did appearâChang Ts'ang was accordingly dismissed and Kung-sun Ch'en was made an Erudit. He however fell into disgrace through being connected with the charlatan, Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing, and his proposed change in the dynastic institutions was dropped. Only in 104 B.C. did Emperor Wu officially adopt the color yellow and the power earth as Han imperial institutions (6:31b). Meanwhile there had been other developments in this cyclical philosophy of history. Tung Chung-shu (ca. 175 â ca. 105 B.C.) proposed a tripartite succession (san-t'ung) of red, black, and white, which three were supposed to succeed each other concomitantly with the five powers. Emperor Wu's New Year's day was fixed in the first month in accordance with this theory. During the peaceful decades in the early part of the Han period, Confucians moreover came to give more attention to the ancient legendary lords, Fu-hsi, Sheng-nung, the Yellow Lord, Chuan-hsÃ¼, K'u Yao, and Shun. These lords did not succeed each other by conquest. Each one was said to have resigned the throne to his successor. A cyclical theory that the powers conquer each other does not fit a history which includes such peaceful changes of dynasties. Tung Chung-shu accordingly suggested a theory by which the five powers each produces its successor: wood produces fire, that produces earth (ashes), that produces (mines) metal, that produces (melts into) water (liquid), that produces (nourishes) wood (vegetation), and so on. His Ch'un-ch'iu Fan-lu contains both this theory and the earlier one that each power conquers its predecessor, but 108INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX he himself plainly favored the other theory of production. Through his influence it came to be accepted widely. It found a place in the "Explanation of the Trigrams (Shuo-kua)" (Legge, Yi King, App. V), which was "discovered" during 73-49 B.C. Thus it was given classical confirmation. Liu Hsiang4a developed it and gave it the weight of his great influence, so that it came to be the only one given serious consideration during the latter part of the Former Han period. The Han dynasty was now given the virtue of fire, which was supported by the story of the Eminent Founder being the son of the Red Lord (1 A: 7a). Down to 91 B.C., the imperial credentials were pure red (66: 3b), possibly because Liu Chi, when he first arose, anointed his drums with blood (1 A: 9b). Since the Ch'in dynasty had ruled for such a short period, this dynasty was considered to have achieved its conquest without securing the Mandate of Heaven and without the assistance of a power in the regular cycle. The Ch'in dynasty then constituted an intercalary period. The Han dynasty was considered to have succeeded the Chou dynasty, to the latter of which was now given the virtue of wood. The ancient lords and the three ancient dynasties were each given their appropriate power in the cyclical succession and ancient history was explained thereby. In this way, the succession of dynasties was made to appear as inevitable and natural as the succession of the seasons (cf. Ku Chieh-kang, Ku-shih-pien, V, 404-617). Liu Hsiang4a was a loyal member of the imperial clan. He opposed the influence of the Wang clan so strongly that he was never given high office. This theory of dynastic succession was then not originally intended to aid Wang Mang. It however aided mightily in bringing him to the throne. This theory made intelligent people think that a change in the dynasty was inevitable. The succession of the powers moreover made them think it would be possible to predict the next dynasty. Fire produces earth. The Wang clan claimed descent from the Yellow Lord, who had the virtue of earth. This genealogy almost certainly antedated Wang Mang; it seems to have been merely a noble clan's attempt to exalt itself by claiming divine descent. There were other clans also claiming descent from this mythical ruler. The Wang clan however dominated the government for over three decades, so that it became only natural for people to point to this clan when they talked about the next dynasty. Astrology and prognostication also played a part in this speculation. Generations before the Wang clan ever appeared at court, Lu Wen-shu's (fl. 73 B.C.) great-uncle had calculated by astrology that after a period of three times seven decades of years, the Han dynasty would end (cf. 99 A: n. 34.5). During the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, Ku Yung, a 109HEAVEN BELIEVED TO END THE HAN DYNASTY famous exponent of the Book of Changes and interpreter of portents revived this prediction. This period of 210 years would end in A.D. 4. When, in 12 B.C., there was an eclipse of the sun on New Year's day, followed by thunder without clouds in May and the appearance of Halley's comet in the autumn, the court became greatly exercised. Shun-yÃ¼ Chang, an imperial maternal relative, was sent to secure Ku Yung's interpretation. The latter replied that the number of portents during the last twenty years was greater than in the Spring and Autumn period or during the regins of all the preceding Han emperors; the period of three sevens of decades was coming to an end; and the lot indicated by the hexagram wu-wang (then meaning "hopelessness") was coming up. He went on to intimate that the essence of the power earth was being born (85: 15b-16b). His memorial made a deep impression in the court. Thus in 12 B.C., there was already a general belief among intelligent persons that the Han dynasty's period was coming to an end. When moreover Emperors Ch'eng, Ai, and P'ing died without natural heirs, people naturally saw in this extraordinary circumstance Heaven's plain intention to end the dynasty. There could indeed be hardly any surer manifestation that the supernatural powers intended to end a dynasty than that three of its rulers should in succession all have left no heir. The death of Emperor P'ing at the end of the Chinese year beginning in A.D. 5 was naturally interpreted as a confirmation of Lu Wen-shu's great-uncle's prophecy. The count of years in Emperor Kao's reign had been begun before he had even become a king (1 A: 26b); it could easily be maintained that he began one year too early. If so, Emperor P'ing died at precisely the end of the dynasty's two hundred and tenth year. People naturally concluded that the virtue of fire had expired and the virtue of earth was arising by the inexorable operation of Heaven's cyclical natural law. Yao and Shun had each resigned the throne to his greatest minister. Wang Mang came from a clan that had now controlled the government for many decades; he himself had been raised to previously unprecedented honors. He was descended from the Yellow Lord and possessed the virtue of earth. He had done all he could to maintain the Han dynasty on the throne, but nevertheless all these events had happened. He had not been responsible for the succession of coincidences that had occurred or the philosophical theory by which they were interpreted. History runs in cycles. The laws of Heaven cannot be evaded. People naturally drew the conclusion that history was repeating itself and that Heaven had destined Wang Mang to inaugurate a new dynasty under the rule of the power earth. 110INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX The depth and sincerity of this political consequence drawn from philosophical principles is shown by the fact that it was shared by members of the Liu imperial clan itself, especially after Wang Mang's victory over Chai Yi's formidable rebellion had given apparent empirical confirmation to the belief that Wang Mang possessed the mandate of Heaven. The famous Liu Hsin1a, who was a descendant of Liu Chiao, Emperor Kao's younger brother, actively assisted Wang Mang to take the throne. Liu Ching4b, a descendant of Emperor Wu, presented one of the crucial portents, urging Wang Mang to take the throne (99 A: 34a, b). Liu Kung2, a first cousin of Liu Hsin1a, also presented a portent (99 B: 14a). When Liu K'uai rebelled against Wang Mang, his brother, Liu Yin2, a descendant of Emperor Ching, resisted and defeated the insurrection (99 B: 7b, 8a). Altogether some thirty-two members of the Han imperial clan either presented portents to Wang Mang, offered congratulatory sayings, or arrested and informed on rebels against him. These persons and their families were granted the new imperial surname, Wang, so that they were continued in their nobilities (99 B: 14a). Some of these persons were, of course, mere sycophants, seeking continued enjoyment of their fiefs, but there were honest persons among them. If then even members of the Han imperial clan were convinced, it is not surprising that intelligent persons generally accepted Wang Mang's legitimacy. The famous writers of the day all accepted Wang Mang. Huan T'an assisted Wang Mang at the time of Chai Yi's rebellion, by publishing abroad Wang Mang's apologia, and in reward was enfeoffed as a Vassal (84: 17a). The philosopher, Yang Hsiung2, who cared not for fame or disciples and spent his energy solely in elaborating his philosophy, wrote mandates through portents for Wang Mang (87 B: 22b). Most of the Confucians seem to have approved of Wang Mang's succession, for this seemed to be Heaven's will. Once there was such a general expectation of Wang Mang's succession to the throne and once portents of that event were expected, it was only natural that those individuals who were bolder than others should have manufactured what was required. The first portent came in the same month that Emperor P'ing died and was offered by an official ranking next to the high ministers (99 A: 25a). After Chai Yi had been defeated, portents began to appear more frequently, until at last there were more than a dozen (99 B: 9a-10b), whereupon Wang Mang finally ascended the throne. I do not think that Wang Mang instigated any of these portents in even as indirect a manner as he instigated the coming of the white pheasant in A.D. 1. My chief reason is that it would have been quite unnecessary for him to have done so. He had carefully weeded out of 111SPONTANEOUS PORTENTS his court all those who might oppose him. His courtiers were sensitive to his feelings. They knew he was intensely ambitious and they had helped him by indirect means to secure his unusual honors, being amply rewarded for doing so. After he controlled the government and had attained his unusual titles, there was only one honor really greater than those he had received, so that when the opportunity offered itself, his courtiers, as previously, spontaneously continued to flatter his ambition. It is furthermore worthy of note that Ai Chang's portent, which was the decisive one, upset Wang Mang's plans considerably. On Jan. 6, A.D. 9, upon the receipt of some portents, he memorialized the Grand Empress Dowager, asking to be entitled Acting Emperor and to change the year-period to Ch'u-shih, saying that he would rear the Young Prince of the Han dynasty, Liu Ying, and return the government to him when he was grown (99 A: 34a-35a). Two days later, on Jan. 8, Ai Chang's portent arrived, and it was accepted on Jan. 9 or 10 (99 A: 35b &amp; n. 35.12), whereupon Wang Mang took the throne. Ai Chang's portent completely upset the whole situation, so that it can hardly have been planned by Wang Mang. We have no means of knowing Wang Mang's own attitude to these portents, whether he actively welcomed them or whether he was surprised. At least he was not displeased. If he had been a doggedly faithful servant of the Han dynasty, he would have arrested and executed Hsieh Hsiao and Meng T'ung, who presented the first portent (99 A: 25a), as he had treated Tung Hung (99 A: 2b), and there would have been no more portents. When, instead, he had the portent reported to the Grand Empress Dowager, probably without any comment of his own, he let it be known to the court that he was not displeased and gave his courtiers time to make up their minds about such matters. The general opinion in the court undoubtedly became favorable to Wang Mang's advancement, so that other persons were naturally stimulated to present their portents. They knew they had nothing to lose by so doing, and might secure boundless rewards. It is quite possible that Wang Mang did not at first really want to take the throne. He waited three full years from the time of the first portent until he finally accepted the post those portents declared was his. Confucian sentiment honored the capable minister far more than the prince; Wang Mang had been promoted to the status of a Duke of Chou, the person whom Confucius had taken as his ideal character. If Wang Mang had finally refused the throne and maintained his position as a minister, he might well have come down in history as the greatest of ancient statesman, a man who outshone even Kao-yao, Yi Yin, and the Duke of Chou. But he loved power and knew what it was to have that 112INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX power completely shorn from him and to be sent away to his estate in the provinces, with no prospects of further advancement. His lack of honors in his youth had made him intensely ambitious. And so, when his courtiers kept urging him, by renewed portents, to take the throne, he at last yielded to their proddings and accepted the dangerous honor. Thus his delay of three years in accepting the throne may have represented, not merely the proper Confucian modesty, but a real hesitation on his own part. Pan Ku says that in the autumn of A.D. 8 he at last plotted to secure the throne; that judgment may well be correct. Ts'ao Ts'ao (155-220 A.D.), in similar circumstances, benefited by Wang Mang's experience and never actually took the throne, although he wielded the imperial power. Wang Mang was a Confucian minister who put his minions into office and allowed them to persuade him, when the opportunity patently offered itself, to take the throne. Reasons for Wang Mang's fall It remains to discuss the reasons for Wang Mang's fall. Undoubtedly the most important cause was the weather. Wang Mang seems to have come upon a period of severe droughts, which were quite as bad as those in 1876-9. The resultant social confusion, brought to fruition by failure in government, caused widespread unrest, rebellion, and his fall. (1) Wang Mang's whole reign seems to have been a time of poor harvests. In an edict of A.D. 20, he says that since he ascended the throne, there had several times been withering droughts, plagues of locusts and caterpillars, and the harvests of grain had been sparse and lacking, so that the people had suffered from famine (C: 8a). In A.D. 11, there was a famine at the northwestern borders (94 B: 19a). In A.D. 14, there was another famine at the borders, so severe that people took to cannibalism (99 B: 26a). The most severe droughts occurred in the years A.D. 18-22, the years immediately preceding Wang Mang's fall. In A.D. 18, there was a famine in Lang-yeh Commandery (southeastern Shantung), at which time the Red Eyebrows arose (99 C: 4b). This famine continued for several years. By A.D. 20, there was already considerable vagabondage: "In Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ Provinces [present Shantung and Kiangsu], many of the common people left their villages and hamlets and wandered about as vagabonds. The aged and weak died on the roads and paths, and the vigorous entered the robber bands" (99 C: 5b). In that year, there was a prolonged rain for sixty days at the capital (99 C: 9b), but in A.D. 21, there was a great famine in Honan and east China (99 C: 12b). In that year, east of Lo-yang, grain was 2000 cash per picul, about twenty-five times its normal price (99 C: 16a). In the spring of A.D. 22, east of Shensi, there was cannibalism (99 C: 17a). In 113REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL that summer, the locusts even invaded Ch'ang-an, where they crawled about the palaces (99 C: 18a). Several hundred thousand refugges came to Shensi from the east, but famine relief in Shensi itself was inadequate and mismanaged, so that 70% to 80% of these refugees starved (99 C: 18a). At the same time, there was a famine in the middle Yangtze valley (Nan-yang Commandery; HHS, An. 1 A: 2a). Thus the climatic cycle made Wang Mang's later years a period of extreme stress and strain. Had there been consistently good seasons in Wang Mang's reign, as there were during the reign of Emperor HsÃ¼an, he might have kept his throne and successfully founded another dynasty. At the same time there was famine in the capital region itself (Kuan-chung, central Shensi). The plain in central Shensi north of the Wei River had been irrigated by some famous canals, the first of which was dug by the engineer Cheng Kuo in 237 B.C. This first canal had its intake in the ancient Ku-k'ou prefecture, not far from the place where the Ching River emerges from the mountains. North of that place, the river runs through a gorge cut in limestone; south of it the river runs through soft deep loess. This canal was planned to irrigate a region of 40,000 ch'ing (186,000 acres, 300 sq. miles), but it is doubtful if the canal was originally built on as large a scale. In 111 B.C., six subsidiary canals were dug, and in 95 B.C. at the suggestion of a Mr. Po (or Pai ), another canal was dug nearly 200 li in length. This canal irrigated an additional 4500-odd ch'ing (20,925 acres).1 1 Cf. SC 29: 6-8 - Mh III, 523-525; Bodde, China's First Unifier, 59-60; Ch'ao-ting Chi, Key Economic Areas in Chinese History, 75-77, 83-84, 87-89; HS 29: 11b-12b; M.S. Bates, "Problems of Rivers and Canals," JAOS, 55 (1935): 304-305; S. Eliassen and O. J. Todd, "The Wei Irrigation Project in Shensi Province", China Journal, 17(1932): 170-180; Shui-ching-chu 16: 32b-33a; 19: 30a-31a, 46a; W.C. Lowdermilk &amp; D.R. Wickes, "Ancient Irrigation in China Brought Up to Date", Scientific Monthly, 55 (Sept., 1942), 209-225. These canals were responsible for the strength of the Ch'in state and for the economic importance of Ch'ang-an in Former Han times. It was the one region in northern China where there were no droughts or famines. The grain in the Great Granary at Ch'ang-an was untouched for over a century, so that it became rotten and could not be eaten (HS 24 A: 15b). The Ching River, after it leaves the mountains, flows through soft loess to the place where it joins the Wei River. It has a considerable gradient. Erosion dug the bed of this River deeper and deeper, until the intake of these canals finally drew less and less. At first, they drew an inadequate amount of water or none at all except in times of flood, and finally they drew no water at all. At present the original intake of 114INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX these canals is about sixty feet above the river level.2 2 Lodermilk &amp; Wickes, op. cit., p. 211, 215. The intake for the canal of 95 B.C. was placed somewhat higher up the river than the original intake. But continued erosion caused this intake, too, to become useless. We are not told when these canals ceased operating. Li Tao-yÃ¼an (vi cent.), in his Shui-ching-chu, says they were then dry. In all probability, they ceased to draw an adequate supply of water in Wang Mang's time. On June 2, A.D. 16, the banks of the Ching River collapsed at the Ch'ang-p'ing Lodge (99 B: 29b), which was located about half-way between the intake of the canals and the Wei River. (In 35 B.C., an earthquake had previously caused these banks to collapse [9: 12a], and on May 7, 25 B.C., the high bank of this River had collapsed in Ch'ang-ling Prefecture [10: 6a], not far from the junction of this River with the Wei.) At this time, erosion had already dug the bed of the River so deep that its sides caved inâin all probability, the canals were then already useless except when there was a flood on the Ching River. Only forty miles from its junction with the Wei, the Ching River flows through the mountains in a deep gorge cut into the rock, so that the intake of any irrigation canals could not be moved further upstream with the means of digging then available. The result was bound to be famine in the capital area itself. Hence the Ch'ang-an area became economically less important than the Yellow River area in northern Honan, and Wang Mang talked of moving his capital to Lo-yang (where Emperor Kuang-wu later actually located his capital). Already at the time of Chai Yi's rebellion (A.D. 7), there were robbers in Kuan-chung; in A.D. 21 there was so much trouble in that region that special officers had to be appointed to deal with the robbers (99 C: 12b), and in the summer of A.D. 22, there was famine even in Ch'ang-an itself (99 C: 18a). The failure of this canal, and the impossibility of relocating it, was another cause for Wang Mang's fall. In A.D. 11, the Yellow River caused a great flood and changed its course; because it seemed to have found an easier outlet to the ocean, no attempt was made to check it (99 B: 18a), especially because Wang Mang's own ancestral area was thus protected from further floods. The climatic cycle and failure in irrigation was the most important factor in Wang Mang's fall. H. Bielenstein, The Restoration of the Han Dynasty, pp. 145-153, argues that Wang Mang's fall was ultimately caused by this change in the course of the Yellow River. He has established the importance of this factor. But other factors were equally and more important. 115REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL (2) North China is a region of recurrent droughts; it was recognized in ancient times that a drought was to be expected every six or seven years on an average, and the government maintained granaries for such occurrences. Hence ordinary famines would not cause widespread suffering unless at the same time the government was inefficient. A famine year was really a time when the competence of the government was tested. The real cause for Wang Mang's fall was the failure of his government to meet the strains put upon it. It should not be thought that Wang Mang's time was a period of general decay. There are signs that just the opposite was the case. Indeed, some circumstances seem to indicate that the period of cultural advance during Former Han times was coming to flower in an age of unusual progress. We are told that the study of anatomy was being pushed to the extent of human dissection (99 B: 30b), and that geometrical proportion was used in architectural design (99 C: 9a). Most interesting of all is the brief and cryptic account of an attempt at aviation in A.D. 19 âthe earliest account in human history of an actual flight that was not mythology (99 C: 5a). The carriage with flowery baldachins (99 C: 13b, 14a) was an outstanding mechanical achievement. It may well be the case that Wang Mang's Nine Ancestral Temples were more magnificent than anything previously erected (99 C: 9b). But Wang Mang's government exhibited many signs of widespread corruption. During the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, when his uncles controlled the government, corruption was rife. Wang Mang came to the throne by fraudulent portents, and so needed officials who would countenance fraud, with the result that they countenanced fraudulent reports on the part of their subordinates (99 C: 15b), and the government became permeated with corruption (99 B: 27a). Wang Mang himself publicly confessed that some officials would extort ransoms from innocent persons by illegally condemning them as slaves and removing the sentence upon payment of a bribe. Yet he was powerless to stop this practise (99 B: 17b). That the outrageous T'ang Tsun should have become his minister is only natural. (3) Wang Mang enacted some very unwise administrative measures. Emperor Wu had established Inspectors of Regional Divisions, ranking at only 600 piculs, who were really spies of the central government, traveling about the commanderies, reporting upon the rule of the Administrators for those commanderies (who ranked at 2000 piculs). The Confucians did not like this unhierarchical arrangement, by which a lower-ranking official supervised a higher-ranking one; in 7 B.C., when 116INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX Wang Mang first came to power, the title and rank of these Inspectors were changed to that of Provincial Shepherd (an ancient name), so that names should correspond to reality. Emperor Ai changed these officials' titles back again to Inspector; in 1 B.C., Wang Mang again entitled them Shepherds, ranking them the same as the highest ministers. But now these Shepherds lost much of their incentive for careful supervision of their provinces. Inspectors had previously hoped that they might be promoted to the post of Administrator, if they did careful and honest work; the Shepherds could now be promoted only to one of the ministerial offices, among which there were very few openings. The result was that they were content to do little and merely held their positions (99 C: 10b). Consequently, in A.D. 21, Wang Mang was driven by the inefficiency of the provincial governments to appoint Shepherd's Superintendents and Associate Shepherds, who were to do the work previously done by the Inspectors. But it was now too late to reform a corrupt government. Wang Mang knew how subordinates could thwart their superior, he had detailed ideas about what should be done in government, and he was suspicious of his associates. Consequently he did not give his ministers the power to decide matters themselves, but had every decision referred to himself. Since the ministers thus found themselves merely executive officers, they ceased to feel any responsibility for their offices and merely transmitted business to Wang Mang, awaiting his orders. He was especially suspicious of his private secretaries, the Masters of Writing, who could control the government by withholding the information which came to the throne in the form of memorials. Hence he permitted eunuchs and members of his entourage to open and read memorials to the throne, with the result that memorials sometimes never even reached the Masters of Writing and were not dealt with in proper fashion. The most important feature in government, according to Confucius' supposed teaching, was the rectification of names; if that were done, all governmental difficulties would automatically be solved. Wang Mang hence deliberated long and profoundly on geographical arrangements, rites, and music, endeavoring to make them accord with classical precedents. From dawn to dark, he discussed these matters with his ministers. He himself was a learned Confucian, the first such literatus to be on the throne; he surrounded himself with the best scholars he could find. But the classical precedents were by no means unambiguous, many matters were treated only implicitly in the Classics, and there were good arguments both for and against most decisions. Wang Mang was not like Emperor Wu, a dilettante who could blithely decide out of his own consciousness such a weighty matter as the proper rites for the important 117REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL imperial sacrifices feng and shan. Wang Mang was a thoroughly conscientious man, who felt the importance of properly determining each matter. Hence his discussions with his ministers and advisors were interminable. Since no one else could make the final decision about precisely how classical precedents should be applied, Wang Mang had to decide these matters himself. After he had decided, he would change his mind again and again. In the case of some place-names, in his anxiety to get them exactly right, he changed them as much as five times, finally returning to the original name! (99 B: 25a, b) In addition, he had himself to decide on the multifarious details of an autocratic government. He worked all night at his documents, but even then he was unable to keep up with the government business. The result was, as Pan Ku says (99 B: 26b-27b), that, since Wang Mang had little leisure to examine matters conscientiously, and yet was determined to do so, law-cases were not decided for years, prisoners were not released from prison except when there was an amnesty, vacancies in the government were not filled with permanent occupants for years, and the government in general could do little except routine work. Corruption could not be checked and things went from bad to worse. The ruler was too conscientious and too suspicious to delegate power and the governmental duties were too multifarious for him to manage. As a result of such an eager concern about general principles, Wang Mang was led to make serious mistakes in particular matters. When the famine in the east was at its hight and the bandits were even capturing cities, Wang Mang decided that they must be put down at all costs. The man he had put over the Shepherds of that region protested (99 C: 16a), but nevertheless, in A.D. 22, Wang Mang sent 100,000 troops into the famine regions. The granaries were empty and could not feed them, so the troops foraged among the people, with dire results. It is not surprising that the people found the troops a greater calamity than the bandits, for the soldiers, under the guise of protecting the people, took what little food was left. The curious verse quoted in 99 C: 17b probably represents a mild version of what the people felt. Wang Mang furthermore enacted into a systematized law the procedure, begun by Emperor HsÃ¼an, of reducing official salaries at a time of drought or calamity. He made the various officials of the central court and the provinces each guarantors for a certain region. At the end of the year, when the yearly reports from the commanderies were presented, the amount of damage to the crops in each part of the empire was to be reported in percentages, and the number of dishes on the imperial table was to be reduced in proportion. At the same time, the officials guaranteeing the various sections in which there were calamities 118INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX were to have their salaries reduced in proportion to the suffering in their region (99 B: 28a-29b). It was an idealistic proposal, but the result was that officials could not anticipate the amount of their salaries and income, so that they exacted fees and presents to support themselves. So bribery and corruption became general. Wang Mang furthermore imitated a practise of Chou times, when official positions were largely hereditary. In A.D. 14, he made all his important provincial offices hereditary in the clans of his nobles (99 B: 24a). Thus he eliminated the incentive to efficient government that had been introduced by the Ch'in dynasty and continued by the Han dynasty, which regimes gave office for merit, not for family connections. Wang Mang probably thought he was doing away with another of the corruptions inherited from the Ch'in regime (6: 39a), but a more unwise measure could hardly have been conceived. As a result, he had to dismiss a noble from his title in order to get rid of a corrupt provincial official, and promotions for merit from one grade to another in the provincial government were made impossible. Wang Mang seems to have removed most of the stimuli to good government that the Ch'in and Han dynasties had laboriously set up. It is not surprising that the government in the provinces degenerated badly. He furthermore exhibited the conceit that sometimes comes to self-made men. He did not like to listen to admonitions, and became angry when his proposals were opposed, even for the wisest reasons. Hence the people who had the best interests of the country at heart came to avoid him and he failed to learn the truth about things. He dismissed those who explained that undue taxation had produced banditry (99 C: 2b). He removed Feng Ch'ang, his Communicator (the state treasurer), because the latter protested against the state monopolies (99 C: 2a), and he dismissed a newly appointed Shepherd of the central Yangtze region, Fei Hsing, who had plans for reducing banditry by lightening the pressure of these monopolies upon his people (99 C: 3a). He even removed his best general, Chuang Yu, when the latter remonstrated against his unwise plans (99 C: 5b). As a consequence, the eunuchs, such as Wang Yeh, merely flattered Wang Mang and deceived him about the condition of the people (99 C: 18b). (4) Wang Mang seems to have been personally stingy and publicly extravagant with government funds. He hoarded the gold he secured, and would not expend it even in an emergency (99 C: 25b). He liked to give noble titles, and at first did not give fiefs to his nobles, on the pretext that the country's geographical arrangements had not yet been settled, with the result that some of his nobles had to work for a living (99 B: 19b). Within noble estates he set up "reserved fields," nominally 119REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL later to be used as fiefs for vassals, but really to economize on the incomes paid to the nobles and to reward or punish them by decreasing or increasing these reserved areas (99 B: 25a). Wang Mang seems to have furthermore established quite a number of sinecure positions in the court. The Han dynasty had three highest ministers (kung) and nine high ministers (ch'ing); Wang Mang established four Coadjutors, three highest ministers, and four generals, making eleven officials who ranked as highest ministers (kung). The number of important subordinates to the high ministers (ch'ing) was also increased. The Han dynasty had only a few such, depending on the amount of business in each office. Such an unsymmetrical arrangement did not however suit literary Confucian ideals; Wang Mang appointed three grandees and nine Officers of the First Rank to each one of the nine highest ministers, making 27 and 81 respectively of these two grades. He also instituted seven grandees whose duty it was to admonish the emperor (99 B: 4a), Directors of Mandates from the Five Majestic Principles, whose duty it was to spread propaganda, and four Masters, four Companions and nine Libation Officers to the Heir-apparent, all of whom ranked the same as the highest of the high ministers. These additional salaries must have been quite expensive. Outside the capital, Wang Mang increased the number of commanderies from 103 to 125 and the number of prefectures from 1314 to 2203 (28 Bii: 48b; 99 B: 25a), with a corresponding increase in the number of administrative officials and in the cost of administration. He frequently sent out commissioners and others to supervise the administration. In A.D. 11, he sent out 55 Generals of the Gentlemen-at-the Palace and 55 Administrators of the Laws Clad in Embroidered Garments to control the large commanderies along the border (99 B: 17a). His commissioners followed each other on the roads, one after another, sometimes ten chariots-full a day; when the public granaries and post-stations could no longer supply their needs, these commissioners forcibly took horses, carriages, and supplies from the people along the road (99 C: 7a). Wang Mang also greatly expanded his nobility. In the time of Emperor Wu, before the great purge, there had been some twenty kings and about two hundred marquises (HFHD, ch. vi, app. III); in A.D. 12, Wang Mang had already appointed 796 nobles of the first five ranks (who corresponded to the kings and marquises of Han times). In addition there were Baronesses and Vassals (99 B: 19b). Thus Wang Mang's nobility must have been a great drain upon the empire, even though he did not give his nobles the full amount of their allowances. (5) Perhaps Wang Mang's greatest extravagance was his military expeditions. Emperor Wu had flailed the Huns until, after his death, 120INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX they were glad to submit and make peace with the Chinese; he had attacked the barbarians in all directions, so that eventually the border peoples recognized the might of the Chinese and kept the peace. Wang Mang upset this peace in the interests of a Confucian imitation of ancient practises. The Han rulers followed the Ch'in practise of calling themselves emperors, consequently they could entitle the rulers of neighboring vassal states kings, just as their own greatest vassals were entitled kings. But, at the beginning of the Chou period, the ruler had entitled himself king and his greatest nobles were only dukes, so Wang Mang followed the Confucian precept, "Heaven has not two suns nor has Earth two kings" (Mencius V, i, iv, 1 attributes this saying to Confucius), and degraded all his highest nobles to be dukes. They accepted the change of title without a murmur, for they knew it was a change in name only. When however Wang Mang came to change similarly the titles of his barbarian vassals, trouble ensued. They did not understand the necessity of conforming to Confucian principles, became suspicious, and felt insulted. Eventually the Huns, the Kao-chÃ¼-li in the present Manchuria, the petty states in the Western Frontier Regions, and those in Szechuan and YÃ¼nnan all revolted, and Wang Mang had to face border raids and war in all directions. The worst trouble was with the Huns. When Shan-yÃ¼ Hu-han-hsieh had come to submit to Emperor HsÃ¼an, the latter had treated him as a guest, had ranked him above all the Chinese nobles, and had given him an imperial seal as his sign of office, with the word hsi (denoting an imperial seal) in its inscription. Emperor HsÃ¼an was not Confucian enough to esteem correct terminology above the establishment of friendly relations with a neighboring state. Wang Mang's envoys carried to the Shan-yÃ¼ a new seal bearing the Hsin dynasty's name, with the word chang (which was used for a noble or official seal) in its inscription. The Shan-yÃ¼ unsuspectingly made the exchange; afterwards, when the seal was read to him, he thought the Emperor's intention was to degrade him to be a mere noble, ranking below the Chinese vassal kings, and asked to have his old seal back. But the senior Lieutenant to the Chinese envoy had thoughtfully smashed the old seal. As a result of this deed and some other disagreements, the Huns raided the Chinese borders, capturing countless prisoners (to be sold as slaves) and animals, welcomed and shielded Chinese rebels against Wang Mang, and the Shan-yÃ¼ announced that he owed allegiance to the Han dynasty, not to the Hsin dynasty. Wang Mang now declared war and planned a grandiose attack, which would send twelve armies by different routes simultaneously into Hun territory, numbering altogether 300,000 men, carrying provisions for 121REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL 300 days. He would overthrow this Shan-yÃ¼ and divide his territory among fifteen Shan-yÃ¼. But General Chuang Yu replied, with the carefulness of a staff officer, that 300 days' provisions would require 18 hu (10 bushels or 36 liters) of grain per man, which amount could only be transported by oxen; that the border commanderies could not furnish so much grain, so that it would take more than a year to collect and transport it from the parts of the empire from which it could be secured; that an ox would need 20 hu more grain; that, since Hun territory was lacking in water and grass, experience had shown that within 100 days all the oxen would be dead, while the balance of the provision could not be carried by men, so that it would be best to send a light expedition in order to come up with the rapidly moving Huns. Wang Mang would not heed, and in A.D. 10, he ordered the expedition to be formed. The result was that large numbers of men collected at the borders, where they waited for their provisions. Having inadequate shelter and provisions, they foraged among the Chinese of those regions. But there had been a famine and scarcity in the northwestern borders (94 B: 19a); the result was that the farmers of the borders left their homes and scattered. The armies never started out and the men merely encamped at the border. Wang Mang had to maintain some 200,000 guards at the borders, who tyrannized over the people, with the result that the farmers turned robbers and raided neighboring commanderies. It took more than a year to put down these robbers and by that time the border commanderies were practically empty (99 B: 27b). In A.D. 19, he summoned an army and levied taxes for another expedition against the Huns, planning to put HsÃ¼-pu Tang on the Hun throne. Chuang Yu's sound arguments led to the army not being sent out, and Wang Mang had to content himself with dismissing Chuang Yu (99 C: 4b-5b). In A.D. 21, Wang Mang had grain and currency worth millions of cash transported to the borders to prepare for an expedition against the Huns. But the expedition never started out (99 C: 12b). Wang Mang squandered his people's livelihood and lives in an attempt to secure an empty fame. A similar result eventuated on the southwestern borders, with even greater wastage of men and wealth. By A.D. 16, all the border dependencies had broken from their allegiance to the Chinese. Wang Mang showed the typical learned Confucian's inability to understand peoples who possess a different cultural tradition and he was not sufficiently teachable to learn how to employ military force efficiently. (6) Like all rulers who think of themselves as great, Wang Mang entertained grandiose plans of various sorts. In A.D. 12, he planned a grand tour to the east, and an order was dispatched that 450,000 rolls of silk 122INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX should be collected to defray its cost. Only half of this amount arrived, so the expedition was put off (99 B: 21b). Wang Mang believed he had succeeded to the throne by virtue of the power earth, which was equated, not with one of the four directions, but with the center, so he concluded that he should make his capital at the center of the earth, and fixed upon Lo-yang, the ancient capital of the Chou dynasty. In A.D. 14, he proposed to make four less expensive tours in the four directions, and afterwards go to Lo-yang (99 B: 22a, b). He was again dissuaded from making these tours, and put off the change of the capital to a date seven years later. Meanwhile he sent two ministers to build palaces, temples, and altars at Lo-yang. In A.D. 20, he also spent some ten billions of cash in building his Nine Ancestral Temples near Ch'ang-an (99 C: 10a). In A.D. 23, when rebellion became serious, he exhibited his nonchalance by marrying a second time, sending the bride's family as betrothal presents the sum of 30,000 catties of actual gold (235,347 troy oz. or 7,320,000 g.; 99 C: 20a). (7) With such heavy and unusual expenses, it is not surprising that Wang Mang should have resorted to depreciating the currency, making government monopolies out of especially profitable enterprises, and increasing the taxes. These and other economic measures are discussed elsewhere (cf. App. II). In so far as they were not soon rescinded, they represented increased burdens upon the people. Wang Mang seems to have drained the country's wealth. The suffering drove great hordes of people to banditry and rebellion, until even the people of the capital hated him so much that they were anxious to kill him and restore the Han dynasty to the throne. (8) Wang Mang mistreated his own relatives and followers, so that he did not secure the permanent and unchallengeable loyalty of any group. He did not execute his Lieutenant Chancellors, as Emperor Wu had done, but he remained severe towards all, so that no one could permanently count on his favor and he could trust no one completely. In his own family, he seems to have been the stern and strict father, who sacrifices his family to his own ambition. He executed three of his four legitimate sons: his eldest, YÃ¼, because of an intrigue that opposed his own plans (99 A: 16b); his second, Huo, because he murdered a slave (99 A: 3b); and the third, Lin1, because an unfortunate liaison had put him in the position where the son was afraid he would be executed if he did not first assassinate his father (99 C: 11a, b). The fourth son, An, was not quite right in his mind and died before his father (99 C: 11b). People naturally thought this series of deaths was Heaven's judgment upon Wang Mang. Wang Mang was equally severe upon his relatives. He executed his 123REASONS FOR WANG MANG'S FALL own nephew, Kuang, because the latter had been responsible for a judicial murder (99 A: 33b). He also executed a grandson and a grand-daughter Tsung and Fang, because the first had in a silly fashion anticipated coming to the throne, by having a picture painted of himself in imperial garb and preparing other imperial paraphernalia (99 C: 3a, b), and the latter had performed black magical ceremonies against her mother-in-law and had murdered a slave to hide the matter (99 C: 3b). In his younger days, Wang Mang, in his intrigues for power, had not spared his relatives. Shun-yÃ¼ Chang was his first cousin, and seemed likely to inherit the power Wang Mang wanted; the latter thereupon had no scruples about informing on his cousin's crimes and getting him executed (99 A: 2a). Wang Mang sent away from the court and later executed his own uncle and another first cousin, Wang Li5 and Wang Jen, because he feared their influence with the Grand Empress Dowager (99 A: 4b, 16b). Chen Han and his son, Feng, were Wang Mang's closest intimates, and had assisted most actively in securing for Wang Mang his unusual honors as a minister. When however Wang Mang advanced to the throne, they were not entirely pleased and were a little frightened at the prospect, for they were not overweeningly ambitious. Chen Han died in office; when Chen Feng's son, HsÃ¼n, ambitiously presented a portent ordering him to marry Wang Mang's daughter, the latter decided it was time to show his power and overawe the court. He executed Chen Feng and Chen HsÃ¼n, together with their associates, who included two sons of the famous Liu Hsin1a and his own first cousin, Wang Ch'i, a brother of the Wang Yi5 whom he later made his Heir-apparent (99 B: 16a). A daughter of Liu Hsin1a, Yin3, who was the wife of Wang Mang's third son, was executed with her husband. Thus Wang Mang executed three of Liu Hsin's children. Wang Mang in this way antagonized his own clan. While he gave them wealth and high noble rank, yet none felt secure, for they knew not when the imperial power might uproot and destroy them. His closest officials felt equally insecure. Consequently he could trust no one and was constantly suspicious, which made matters worse. Because he feared a revolt, he would not allow even his provincial Shepherds to maintain armies for bandit suppression. When he sent his generals to gather troops for use against the bandits he would not allow them to make a move without first consulting the throne. Thus the bandits and rebels could gain a firm foothold before the imperial forces were allowed to attack them. It is hence not so surprising that in A.D. 23 another imperial first cousin, Wang ShÃª, should have been persuaded by astrology that Wang 124INTRODUCTION TO CHAPTER XCIX Mang would inevitably fall, and should have headed a conspiracy to remove the Hsin Emperor and put the Han dynasty back on the throne. He secured the cooperation of Wang Mang's Commander-in-chief and of Liu Hsin1a. Only the fortunate disclosure of the plot and the pusillanimity of the Commander-in-chief prevented its success. Wang ShÃª had gone to the extreme of making out that Wang Mang was a bastard (99 C: 22b-23b). The plotters were all executed without trouble, but this plot was a severe shock to Wang Mang. Thereafter he could not eat properly nor sleep comfortably. His severity had recoiled upon his own head. The greatest suffering of the country came, not directly from Wang Mang, but from the robber bands that came into being as an indirect result of the famine and of his rule. They went through the country, looting, pillaging, and burning. The Red Eyebrows were merely the largest of these many illiterate robber armies. They swept over North China, defeating imperial armies and capturing cities by storm, destroying as they went. At the death of Wang Mang, only the Wei-yang Palace was burnt; the rest of Ch'ang-an was undamaged. In A.D. 25, after the Keng-shih Emperor had established himself in Ch'ang-an, the Red Eyebrows arrived, plundering along their route. They had set up another Emperor; they defeated the Keng-shih Emperor's general, captured Ch'ang-an, and plundered it. The people fled the city; the Red Eyebrows had to leave when the food in the city was exhausted. Then they burnt the remainder of the city, went west and north, digging into the imperial tombs and pillaging the cities. The snow drove them back to Ch'ang-an, where at last they were defeated by a ruse. A great famine now raged in the capital region; Ch'ang-an was itself empty and waste. No one dared to show himself alone for fear of being robbed; honest men gathered in camps and cities, which they defended desperately, so that the Red Eyebrows could secure little. In the winter of 26/27, famine drove them eastwards out of Kuang-chung. Meanwhile, Emperor Kuang-wu had been putting down robbers and rebels in eastern China. He met the remnants of the Red Eyebrows with his great army, overawing them, and they meekly surrendered, transmitting to him the Han dynastic imperial seals. Pan Ku states that the population of the empire had been reduced by half (24 B: 27a). So terrible were the forces that Wang Mang let loose upon his land. 125 THE HISTORY OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] [Chapter] XCIX THE SIXTY-NINTH [MEMOIR] The Memoir of Wang Mang PART A Wang Mang, whose courtesy given name was ChÃ¼-chÃ¼n, was the son of [Wang Wan], a younger [half]brother of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] Hsiao-yÃ¼an. The father, [Wang Chin], and the His clan. [living] elder and younger brothers of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] YÃ¼an were all enfeoffed as marquises during the reigns of [Emperors] YÃ¼an and Ch'eng. They occupied [high] positions and had important influence in the government. In the clan there were nine marquises and five Commanders-in-chief.1.1 1.1 HS 98: 15b says "ten marquises," but that passage includes Shun-yÃ¼ Chang in its enumeration. He was merely a relative of the Wang clan on the distaff side. A discussion is in the "Memoir of the Empress [nee Wang of Emperor] YÃ¼an." Ch. 98. Only [Wang] Mang's father, [Wang] Wan, who had died young, was not made a marquis. The various elder and younger cousins of [Wang] Mang were all the sons of Generals or of the Five Marquises,1.2 1.2 For these Five Marquises (Wang T'an2b, Wang Shang1a Wang Li5, Wang Ken, and Wang Feng-shih) and similar terms, cf. Glossary sub vocibus. so they took advantage of their opportunities and were extravagant. In their equipages and horses, music and women, idleness and gadding1.3 1.3 "Yi-yu idleness and gadding" is a phrase from Analects XVI, v. they competed with one another. [Wang] Mang alone was an orphan and in humble circumstances, hence he humbled himself and made himself courteous and temperate.1.4 1.4 Kung-chien is a phrase from Analects I, x, 2. In studying the 126WANG MANG Classic of Rites [the Yi-li], he rendered to Ch'en 99 A: 1a, b Ts'an, [a man] from P'ei Commandery,1.5 1.5 HS 88: 25b states that Ch'en Ts'an's younger brother, Ch'en Ch'in, taught Wang Mang the Tso-chuan (cf. also HHS, Mem. 26: 9b); HsÃ¼ HsÃ¼an taught him the Book of Changes, cf. HHS, Mem. 34: 4b. (From Yang Shu-ta.) The Classic of Rites (Li-Ching) is listed in HS 30: 10a. the services due to a teacher. [Wang Mang] fatigued himself and studied extensively, wearing garments like the Confucian masters. He served his mother and the widow of his elder brother, [Wang Yung], and reared [Wang Kuang], the orphaned son of his elder brother. Thus his conduct was quite perfect. Moreover, outside [his clan] he associated with eminent persons, 1b* * Bold-face type numbers indicate the paging in Wang Hsien-ch'ien's Han-shu Pu-chu, as in previous volumes. and within [his clan] he served his various uncles, 1bâ  â  Light upright numbers indicate the paging in the Ching-yu ed., reprinted in the "Po-na" Series, pub. by the Commercial Press. paying minute attention to the spirit of the rules of proper conduct. 24-21 B.C. During [the period] Yang-so, when his paternal First uncle who was the heir of his grandfather, the 1bâ¡ â¡ Italic numbers indicate the paging in the Palace ed. or Wu-ying Tien ed., pub. in the "Szu-pu Pei-yao Collecteana." General-in-chief, [Wang] Feng, became ill, [Wang] Positions Mang waited upon him in his illness, himself tasting the medicine [before administering it]. For successive months, [Wang Mang's] hair was disordered, his face uncleansed, and he did not [even] loosen the girdle to his garments. When [Wang] Feng was Oct. 4, 221.6 1.6 HS 19 B: 43b. about to die, he therefore confided [Wang Mang] to the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] and Emperor [Ch'eng]. He was installed as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate and was promoted to be Colonel of the Archers Who Shoot By Sound. Ennoblement After a long time, his paternal uncle who was younger than [Wang Mang's] father, the Marquis of Ch'eng-tub, [Wang] Shang1b, memorialized that he 127WANG MANG 99 A: 1b wished to divide the households of his estate in order to enfeoff [Wang Mang]. Moreover, the Privy Treasurer of the Ch'ang-lo [Palace], Tai Ch'ung, the Palace Attendant, Chin ShÃª, the Colonel of Northern Barbarian Cavalry, Chi Hung, the Chief Commandant of Shang-ku [Commandery], Yang Ping, and the Gentleman-of-the-Household, Ch'en T'ang, who were all gentlemen well-known in that age, all spoke in behalf of [Wang] Mang. Because of that, the Emperor esteemed [Wang] Mang. In the first year of [the period] Yung-shih, he enfeoffed [Wang] June 12, Mang as Marquis of Hsin-tuc with an estate of fifteen 161.7 1.7 HS 18: 21a. hundred households in the Tu District of Hsin-yeh [County] in Nan-yang [Commandery]. He was promoted to be Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Imperial Household Grandee, and Palace Attendant, and was careful as [an imperial] guard. As his noble rank and position became more and His Treatment of Others. more honorable, his conduct became more and more humble. He distributed equipages and horses, clothes, and fur garments, and bestowed them upon his guests, so that in his household there was no surplus [wealth]. He received and succored well-known gentlemen. He associated with a very large number of generals, chancellors, ministers, and grandees, hence those who occupied official positions in turn recommended him. Travelers talked about 2a him; his empty fame flourished and spread, so that it overwhelmed that of his various uncles. He dared to do affected deeds which created a stir and performed them without shame. [Wang] Mang's elder brother, [Wang] Yung3, had Care for his Nephew been a Department Head. He had died young and had had a son, [Wang] Kuang1. [Wang] Mang sent him to study at the gates of the Erudits. When [Wang] Mang took his leave, [usually once each five 128WANG MANG days], he led out and arranged his chariots and horse- 99 A: 1b, 2a men and brought sheep and wine to recompense and offer to [Wang Kuang1's] teachers; his favor was [also] shown to all of [Wang Kuang1's] fellow-students, so 2a that the masters all stared at him and the elders admired him. [Altho Wang] Kuang1 was younger than [Wang] 2a Mang's son, [Wang] YÃ¼3, [Wang] Mang had them [both] married on the same day. [At the wedding feast], when the guests had filled his halls, in a moment a man told him that his Lady Dowager [mother] was suffering from a certain pain and must drink a certain medicine. Up to [the time] when the guests left, he had [thus] arisen several times. He Refuses to Have any Concubines He once2.1 2.1 For , the Ching-yu ed. (1035) reads . Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) states that the Official edition (1739) and the Southern Academy ed. (1531) also read thus. privately purchased a waiting-maid. Some of his cousins came to know something about it. Because of that, [Wang] Mang said, "The General of the Rear, Chu [Po] Tzu-yÃ¼an, has no sons. I, Mang, heard that this girl's line is fruitful in bearing sons, so I purchased her for him." The same day he presented the slave-girl to [Chu Po] Tzu-yÃ¼an. In the foregoing manner he hid his desires and sought for fame. 2b At this time, Shun-yÃ¼ Chang, the son of an elder [half]-sister of the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], He Supplants Shun-yÃ¼ Chang. had, because of his ability, become one of the nine high ministers. He was senior to and ahead of [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang secretly2.2 2.2 The Official ed. erroneously reads for the read by the Ching-yu and other editions. sought out [Shun-yÃ¼ Chang's] crimes. [Wang Mang] took advantage of [this information and informed] the Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-yang, [Wang] Ken, who had him speak [to the Empress Dowager Dec., nee Wang and the Emperor. Thereupon, Shun-yÃ¼] 8 B.C.2.3 2.3 HS 10: 15b = HFHD II, 416 dates Shun-yÃ¼ Chang's death in the eleventh month, which began on Dec. 3. Pan Ku is anticipating events.

From this [deed, Wang] 129WANG MANG 99 A: 2a, b Mang obtained [a reputation] for straightforward- 8 B.C. ness. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Shun-yÃ¼] Chang." [Wang] Ken then begged to retire and 93: 7a-8 recommended [Wang] Mang to take his place. The Emperor thereupon selected him to be the Commander-in-chief. Nov. 28 This year was the first year of [the 8 B.C.2.4 2.4 HS 19 B: 48a dates this event in the xi month, on the day ping-yin.

When [Wang] Mang had surpassed his equals and His Self-Denial succeeded his four uncles, [Wang Feng, Wang Shang1a, Wang Yin, and Wang Ken], as chief assistant in the government, he wished to make his fame and reputation surpass that of his predecessors, hence he denied himself2.6 2.6 An allusion to Analects XII, i (Soothill, p. 115). tirelessly and invited2.7 2.7 The Sung Ch'i ed.

When his mother was ill, the ministers and full His Wife's Economy. marquises sent their Ladies to ask after her illness. When [Wang] Mang's wife received them, her clothes 2b did not trail on the ground [and she wore] a linen apron.2.8 2.8 The Fang-yen (attributed to Yang Hsiung2, 53 B.C.-A.D. 18; annotated, possibly restored by Kuo P'o, 276-324) 4: 1b, 2a says, "The pi1-hsi [translated `apron', lit., `covering for the knees'], in the region of the Yangtze and Huai [Rivers], is called hui . Some call it fu [more exactly ]; in the region of Weih, Sung, and Southern Ch'u, it is called the large napkin ; from [the region] east of the [Han-ku] Pass and westwards it is called pi-hsi. In the countryside of Ch'i and Lu it is called jan ." The Erh-ya (before and during the Han period) 5: 7a says, "Clothes that cover (pi) the front are called ch'an (aprons)," and Kuo P'o glosses, "They are the present pi-hsi." The Shih-ming (ca. iii cent. A.D.; attributed to Liu Hsi [fl. dur. Han period]) ch. 16, 5: 1b, 2a says, "The pi2 is a cover (pi1); it is the means whereby one covers his knees (pi1-hsi) and front. Women's pi1-hsi are also of this sort. The people of Ch'i call them great napkins . When the wives and daughters of people who work in the fields go out to the fields and wilds, they use them to cover their heads. Hence because of that they give them their name. They are also called kneeling aprons . When they kneel down, [this apron] covers them and is spread out." A discussion of this garment is to be found in Nieh Ch'ung-yi's San-li-t'u (presented 962) 8: 10a, b, also in Ch'en Hsiang-tao's (1053-1093) Li-shu 23: 1a-6b, in which it is pointed out that this article was used in ceremonial dress, even by the Son of Heaven. (References from Shen Ch'in-han.) Legge, Li Ki, II, SBE, XXVIII, p. 14, n. 1, reproduces pictures of it, but the Chinese phrase pi1-hsi led him and Couvreur to translate it as "knee-covers." The dimensions given in the text should have warned them that this translation is inappropriate. Those who saw her, thought she was a 2b 130WANG MANG servant, and sent someone to ask [who she was]. 99 A: 2b When they learned that she was the Lady, they were all astonished. 7 B.C. [Wang Mang] had been chief assistant in the Apr. 172.9 2.9 The date of Emperor Ch'eng's death is from 10: 16a. It was only four and a half months after Wang Mang had been made Commander-in-chief. Pan Ku seems to have been careless about this dateâhe did not compile the "Table" from which the date of Wang Mang's appointment was taken. government for more than a year when Emperor Ch'eng died. When Emperor Ai ascended the May 72.10 2.10 HS 11: 2a. throne, he honored the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] and made her the Grand Empress Dowager. The [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang] issued an 3a imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, [ordering him] to go to his residence and leave [his position vacant for some of] the Emperor's maternal relatives.2.11 2.11 A willingness to retire from office at the proper moment exhibited, on Wang Mang's part, the Confucian virtue of "declining and yielding". Such a virtuous act should properly be met by a similar "declining and yielding," i.e., a refusal of the resignation. The Grand Empress Dowager's edict was very likely instigated by Wang Mang himself, for the purpose of securing from the new Emperor a confirmation of his position as the dominant minister. Ho Kuang had similarly resigned (8: 4a = HFHD II, 207). [Wang] Mang [hence] presented to the Emperor a request His Resignation Refused. begging to retire. Emperor Ai [however] sent his Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [T'ang Lin], with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "The late Emperor entrusted the government to 131WANG MANG 99 A: 2b you, sir, whereupon he departed from his subjects. 7 B.C. We have obtained [the opportunity] to uphold the [imperial] ancestral temples and will in truth consider [Ourself] fortunate to be of the same mind and similar opinions with you, sir. Now you, sir, have sent [Us a letter saying that you] are ill and ask to retire. Thereby you make known that We are not able to uphold or follow the intentions of the late Emperor. We are greatly saddened. [We] have already issued an imperial edict to the Masters of Writing to await your memorials, sir, about [government] business." [The Emperor] also sent the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, the Grand Minister of Works, Ho Wu, the General of the Left, Shih1 Tan, and the Commandant of the Palace Guard, Fu Hsi, to speak to the [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang], saying, "The Emperor has heard of the Empress Dowager's imperial edict and is much saddened. If the Commander-in-chief [Wang Mang] does not arise, the Emperor will then not presume to attend to the government." The [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang thereupon] again ordered [Wang] Mang to attend to the [government] business. At that time, the grandmother of Emperor Ai, the He Opposes the Elevation of the Fu and Ting Clans. Queen Dowager [nee] Fu of Ting-t'ao, and his mother, the Concubine nee Ting [of the deceased King of Ting-t'ao], were alive, so the Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, presented to the throne a letter saying, "According to the principles of the Spring and Autumn [in the Kung-yang Commentary], a mother becomes honorable because of her son, so that the Concubine [nee] Ting should be presented with the imperial title [of Empress Dowager]."2.12 2.12 Cf. 11: n. 2.3; Glossary, sub Fu, Brilliant Companion nee. [Wang] Mang together with Shih1 Tan impeached [Tung] Hung for misleading the court, which constituted 132WANG MANG 7 B.C. inhumanity. A discussion is in the "Memoir 99 A: 2b, 3a 86: 17a of [Shih1] Tan." 3b At a later date, there was a banquet in Wei-yang He Demotes Palace. The Prefect of the Flunkies spread the canopy and seat for the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu at 3a the side of the seat for the Grand Empress Dowager 3a [nee Wang. Wang] Mang investigated and reproached the Queen Dowager nee Fu. the Prefect of the Flunkies, saying, "The Queen Dowager of [the kingdom of] Ting-t'ao is a concubine from a tributary [kingdom]. How could she he permitted to be honored equally with the most honorable [lady in the palace]? Take it away and put the seat [of the Queen Dowager of Ting-t'ao] at a different [place]." He Resigns Again. When the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu heard of it, she was furious and refused to attend [the banquet. She thereupon held] a great hatred against [Wang] Aug. 27, Mang. [Hence Wang] Mang again begged to retire. 7 B.C.3.1 3.1 HS 19 B: 48b says, sub the year Sui-ho II, "In month xi, ting-mao, the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, was granted gold, a comfortable chariot, a quadriga of horses, and was dismissed. On keng-wu, the General of the Left, Shih1 Tan, became Commander-in-chief. In iv, he was moved [to another office]." On the same page, it says, "In month x, kuei-yu [Dec. 30, 7 B.C.], the Commander-in-chief, [Shih1] Tan, became the Grand Minister of Works. Within the year, he was dismissed." Now there were no ting-mao or keng-wu days in Sui-ho II, xi. If Shih Tan's appointment as Grand Minister of Works happened in month x and in the fourth month before Wang Mang was dismissed, the dismissal could not have happened in month xi. Szu-ma Kuang suggests that "month xi" is an error for "month vii" ( and were written almost alike in the li style), hence Wang Mang's dismissal occurred on Aug. 27 and Shih1 Tan's appointment as Commander-in-chief on Aug. 30. Emperor Ai granted [Wang] Mang five hundred catties of actual gold, a comfortable carriage and a quadriga of horses, dismissed him [from his position], and sent him to his residence. Most of the ministers and grandees praised him, so the Emperor added his grace and favor, and established, as [regular] messenger to his home, a Palace [Attendant Within] the Yellow Gate to grant him a meal [from the imperial cuisine] once every ten days. [The Emperor] sent 133WANG MANG 99 A: 3a to his subordinates an imperial edict which said, 7 B.C. "The Marquis of Hsin-tuc, [Wang] Mang, has worried and toiled for the state and has firmly held to his fealty. We hoped with him to produce a good government, [but] the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] has issued an imperial edict that [Wang] Mang should go to his residence, for which We are very sorry. Let [Wang Mang]3.2 3.2 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that other editions and the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) lack the word for "Mang."

When [the Emperor rides] his chariot of 4a state, [Wang Mang] may follow in the [imperial cortege] riding a green chariot.3.3 3.3 Chin Shao, in a note to 68: 21b, says, "[According to] a Han commentator, `Green chariot ' designated the chariot of an Imperial Grandson; if the Heir-apparent has a son, [the son] rides in this [sort of a chariot] when following [in the train of the emperor]." This equipage is described in HHS, Tr. 29: 10a. Yen Shih-ku explains, "When the Son of Heaven rode out, he ordered that [Wang] Mang [should be permitted] to ride this [sort of a chariot] in following him, thereby [granting him] his favor." 5 B.C., The second year afterwards, when the Queen Dowager May/ [nee] Fu and the Concubine [nee] Ting had both June3.4 3.4 HS 11: 4b. been given the imperial titles [of Emperor's Great He is Sent Away From the Court. Empress Dowager and the Emperor's Empress Dowager, respectively], the Lieutenant Chancellor Chu Po memorialized, "[Wang] Mang has not previously applied broadly [enough] the principle of honoring those [deserving of] honor3.5 3.5 A phrase from Li-chi XIV, 3 (Couvreur, I, 777; Legge, II, 61). but has humbled and degraded those who should be honored with an imperial title, [thereby] injuring the doctrine of filial piety, so that he ought 134WANG MANG 5 B.C. to suffer public execution. Fortunately [for him], he 99 A: 3a, b has received [the advantage of a general] ordinance 3b of amnesty, [yet] it is not proper that he should 3b possess a noble title or land. I beg that he be dismissed [from his titles] and made a commoner." The Emperor said, "Because [Wang] Mang is related to the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang], let him not be dismissed [from his noble titles], but be sent away to his estate." Summer3.6 3.6 Chu Po was Lieutenant Chancellor from May 9 to Sept. 21, 5 B.C., so that Wang Mang's dismissal from the court occurred between those dates; cf. 19 B: 49a. While [Wang] Mang had closed his gates and was He Executes His Son. keeping to himself, [Wang] Huob,3.7 3.7 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) states that some texts write this given name as , which he says is "a vulgar change." his son who was neither his eldest nor his youngest, murdered a slave. [Wang] Mang bitterly reproached [Wang] Huob and caused him to commit suicide. Popular Opinion Leads to (2 B.C., Feb. 53.9 3.9 HS 11: 7a. ) His Recall. While he had been at his estate to the third year, officials3.8 3.8 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that after the word there should be the word . The Ching-yu ed. does not read this character. by the hundreds sent letters to the Emperor grieving and pleading for [Wang] Mang. In the first year of [the period] YÃ¼an-shou, when there was an eclipse of the sun, [some persons who had been recommended as] Capable and Good, Chou Huo, Sung Ch'ung, and others, in their written replies to the examination, praised highly [Wang] Mang's achievements and virtue. The Emperor therefore summoned [Wang] Mang [to come to court]. His Advances to an Unimportant Official. When [Wang] Mang had first gone to his estate, because [Wang] Mang was an honorable and important [personage], the Grand Administrator of Nan-yang [Commandery] selected a Division Head from his office, K'ung Hsiu, [a man of] YÃ¼an, to be the acting Chancellor of Hsin-tuc, [Wang Mang's marquisate. When K'ung] Hsiu went to pay a 135WANG MANG 99 A: 3b, 4a visit to [Wang] Mang, [Wang] Mang [treated K'ung 5 B.C. 4b Hsiu] with all possible formalities and in person welcomed him [at the door]. [K'ung] Hsiu had also heard of [Wang Mang's] fame and responded to him in like manner. Later, when [Wang] Mang was ill, [K'ung] Hsiu attended upon him. Because of his gracious intent, [Wang] Mang presented him with his [own] precious sword having jade furnishings, desiring to make [K'ung Hsiu] a good friend. [But K'ung] Hsiu refused to receive it. [Wang] Mang said therefore, "I verily see that on your face, sir, there is a scar. A fine jade can extinguish a scar. I merely wanted to present you with the ring on the hilt of the sword."3.10 3.10 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that should be excised. The Ching-yu ed. does not read it. Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) states that chuan is pronounced the same as wei . Su Lin (ca. 160-ca. 240) states that it is the ring at the end of the hilt on a two-edged sword. Yen Shih-ku hence infers that the text originally read chih (which has also the pronunciation wei and, with another meaning, is pronounced chuan) and that it was later mistakenly altered, for chuan means merely "engraved (with raised figures)." Shuo-wen 1 A: 4b says that chih means the jade ring at the end of the hilt on a sword, using the same words as Su Lin. Cf. Chavannes, Documents chinois decouverts, p. 19, no. 39. It is still believed that a fine jade made into powder and put upon a scar will extinguish the scar. He immediately loosed its [jade] sword-ring. When [K'ung] Hsiu again excused himself and refused, [Wang] Mang said, "Do you, sir, dislike [to receive it] because of its [high] value?" Then he pounded it to pieces, himself tied it up, and thereupon 4a 4a presented it to [K'ung] Hsiu. [K'ung] Hsiu then received it. When [Wang] Mang was summoned [to the court and was about to] leave, he wanted to see [K'ung] Hsiu, [but K'ung] Hsiu pronounced himself ill and did not present himself. More than a year after [Wang] Mang returned to Aug. 15 the imperial capital, Emperor Ai died. He had no 1 B.C.4.1 4.1 HS 11: 8b. 136WANG MANG 1 B.C., August He is Put in Control of the Government. children and both the [August Grand] Empress 99 A: 4a Dowager [nee Fu] and the [Emperor's] Empress Dowager [nee] Ting had died previously. On the same day [as the death], the Grand August Empress Dowager [nee Wang] rode a quadriga to the Wei-yang Palace, where she secured the imperial seals with their seal-cords.4.2 4.2 Emperor Ai had given his imperial seals and authority to Tung Hsien2a before he died; Wang Hung took them away from Tung Hsien2a and gave them to the Grand Empress Dowager. Cf. Glossary sub Wang Hung. She sent a messenger galloping to summon [Wang] Mang. She issued an imperial edict to the Masters of Writing, [declaring] that the various insignia and credentials for mobilizing troops, the matters memorialized by the various officials, and the troops of the Palace Attendants Within the 5a Yellow Gate and of the Attendants at the Gates should all be under the control of [Wang] Mang. Demotion of Tung Hsien. [Wang] Mang advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] that the Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Kao-an, Tung Hsien2a, was too young and [that his Aug. 164.3 4.3 HS 19 B: 51a records Tung Hsien2a's dismissal on YÃ¼an-shou III (an error for YÃ¼an-shou II), vi, yi-wei, which is impossible. Emperor Ai died on vi, mou-wu, a day before the day chi-wei, so that Tung Hsien's dismissal occurred on vi, chi-wei, Aug. 16; cf. 99 A: 21b. Chi and yi are frequently mistaken for each other. This emendation is confirmed by the date for Wang Mang's appointment to succeed Tung Hsien, which is vi, keng-shen, the day after chi-wei. occupying that position] did not accord with public opinion, [so that she should] take [away] his [official and noble] seals and cords. On the same day, [Tung] Hsien2a committed suicide. Wang Mang is made Commander-in-chief. The [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang] in an imperial edict ordered the ministers to recommend persons who might become the Commander-in-chief. The Grand Minister Over the Masses, K'ung Kuang, and the Grand Minister of Works, P'eng HsÃ¼an, recommended [Wang] Mang. The General of the 137WANG MANG 99 A: 4a, b Van, Ho Wu, and the General of the Rear,4.4 4.4 HS 19 B: 49b (under the date 4 B.C.) and 86: 4b (in recounting the same incident) list Kung-sun Lu as General of the Left, so that "Rear" is probably an error. (Noted by Ch'ien Ta-hsin.) Kung- 1 B.C., August sun Lu, recommended each other. The [Grand] Empress Dowager installed [Wang] Mang as Commander-in-chief Aug. 174.5 4.5 HS 19 B: 51a. and discussed with him the establishment of an heir [to the throne]. The Marquis of An-yang, Wang Shun4b, was a He Summons Emperor P'ing to the Throne. second cousin of [Wang] Mang, was cultivated and self-controlled4.6 4.6 Yen Shih-ku remarks that should be read the same as , which means . in his person, and was trusted and beloved by the [Grand] Empress Dowager. [Wang] Mang advised her to make [Wang] Shun4b the General of Chariots and Cavalry and send him to invite the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Chi-tzu], to carry on the posterity of Emperor Ch'eng. This was Emperor Hsiao-p'ing. He is Entrusted With the Government. The Fu and Chao Empress Dowagers Executed. The Emperor was in his ninth year, so the [Grand] Empress Dowager attended court and pronounced [that she issued the imperial] decrees.4.7 4.7 Cf. HFHD, I, p. 192, n. 1. She entrusted the government to [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang advised her that [the lady] nee Chao had previously killed some imperial sons4.8 4.8 Cf. 10: 14a; HFHD II, 411; Glossary, sub Chao, Brilliant Companion nee. and that [the lady] nee Fu had been proud and arrogant, so she thereupon dismissed the Empress [nee] Chao of [Emperor] Hsiao-ch'eng and the Empress [nee] Fu of [Emperor] Hsiao-ai [from their titles]. Both were 97 B: ordered to commit suicide. A discussion is in the 15b, 16a, "Memoir of the [Imperial] Relatives by Marriage." 20a. Because the Grand Minister Over the Masses, 4b K'ung Kuang, was a famous scholar, had acted as 4b chancellor to three lords [of men], was respected by He gets the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and the whole empire 5b trusted him, [Wang] Mang therefore honored Rid of His Opponents. [K'ung] Kuang greatly and served him. [Wang 138WANG MANG 1 B.C. Mang] introduced [to the court K'ung] Kuang's son- 99 A: 4b in-law, Chen Han, and made him a Palace Attendant and the Chief Commandant of the Imperial Equipages. [Wang] Mang attributed crimes to all the various maternal relatives of Emperor Ai, together with [those of] his great officials and those who held office whom [Wang] Mang had disliked, and prepared [unsigned] memorials begging [that they be punished]. He had [Chen] Han take them to [K'ung] Kuang. [K'ung] Kuang was habitually timid and cautious, so did not dare to refuse to send in these memorials [as his own]. Each time [they were received, Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to assent to these memorials. In this way, the General of the Van, Ho Wu, and the General of the Rear, Kung-sun Lu, were sentenced for having recommended each other and were dismissed. The relatives of the Ting and Fu [clans], together with [those of] Tung Hsien2a were all dismissed from their positions and from their noble titles and were exiled to distant regions. Wang Li Sent Away from the Court. The Marquis of Hung-yang, [Wang] Li5a, was a younger [half]-brother of the [Grand] Empress Dowager. Although he did not occupy any [official] position, yet because he was one of his uncles who was respected within [the Palace, Wang Mang] dreaded him. He feared [Wang] Li5a might casually say something to the [Grand] Empress Dowager which would bring it about that [Wang Mang] would not be permitted to follow his own intentions. So [Wang Mang] had [K'ung] Kuang also memorialize [Wang] Li5a's former evil deeds: that he had previously known that the Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yÃ¼ Chang, had committed the crime of rebellion and he had [nevertheless] received from him a large bribe and 139WANG MANG 99 A: 4b, 5a had falsely4.9 4.9 Li Tz'u-ming (1829-1894), Han-shu Cha-chi 7: 14b, says that should be read as . spoken for him, [thus] misleading the 1 B.C. court. Later he had advised that a secret son of a government woman, Yang Chi, [allegedly by Emperor Ch'eng], should be made an Imperial Son, [a 6a possible heir to the throne. But] the common opinion [in the court was, "It is a case of] the reappearance of the Young Emperor of the LÃ¼ clan.4.10 4.10 The "Young Emperor" was LÃ¼ Hung; cf. HS 3: 3b, 8a; HFHD, I, 198, 209. Prof. Duyvendak interprets differently, inserting after the , noting that the succession of King Ch'eng, as an infant, to King Wu, and his being presented by the Duke of Chou to the feudal lords is the classical and often mentioned case of a child on the throne, which is later on frequently cited in this Memoir. He translates: "Later he had proposed that a private son of a government slave, Yang Chi, be set up as an Imperial son. The unanimous opinion [of the Ministers] was that a recurrence of the case of the young Emperor from the LÃ¼ clan would in a most disturbing way arouse the suspicion of the empire so that it would be difficult to show to later generations the [same] good results [which had been obtained by setting up King] Ch'eng in swaddling-clothes. They begged therefore that [Wang] Li be sent back to his state." It is most disturbing. It would be suspicious to the empire, so that it would be difficult to establish [such a babe's legitimacy] to later generations or to achieve anything creditable in behalf of [such a babe] in swaddling clothes." [The memorial] begged that [Wang] Li5a should be sent back to his state. When the [Grand] Empress Dowager would not listen to it, [Wang] Mang said to her, "Now the Han dynasty has decayed and has been without [natural] heirs [to the throne] for successive generations. You alone, [Grand] Empress Dowager, can take the place of the young lord in directing the government. It is sincerely to be dreaded that, even 5a if you strive hard to use justice and uprightness in leading the empire, it is yet to be feared that [the empire] will not follow [you. But] now if for the sake of your private affection you go contrary to the advice of your highest officials, in this way your 5a many subordinates will become dangerous and evil; 140WANG MANG 1 B.C. disorder will arise because of this [event]. It is 99 A: 5a proper to approve [this petition], temporarily send [Wang Li5a] to his state, and, after the situation has become more tranquil, to summon him back." The [Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative, so sent [Wang] Li5a to his state. The [methods] by which [Wang] Mang compelled and controlled his superiors and inferiors were all of the foregoing sort. His Clique. In this way, those who attached themselves to him and accorded with him were promoted and those who opposed or disliked him were exterminated. Wang Shun4b and Wang Yi5 became his intimate advisers. Chen Feng and Chen Han had charge of making decisions5.1 5.1 Han-chi 30: 1a writes chÃ¼eh-tuan instead of -tuan. I have followed its reading. , P'ing Yen had charge of delicate matters5.2 5.2 Chi-shih is a phrase from Book of Changes, App. III, I, 47 (Legge, p. 363). , Liu Hsin1a5.3 5.3 Li Tz'u-ming, ibid., remarks that, in A.D. 6, Liu Hsin1a had changed his personal name to Hsiu (cf. Glossary, sub voce); but Pan Ku still used Hsin to avoid the taboo on the personal name of Emperor Kuang-wu, which was also Hsiu. took care of [classical] literature, Sun Chien was his military assistant.5.4 5.4 The phrase in the text, "talons and teeth, chao-ya ," is used in Book of Odes, no. 185; II, iv, i, 1 (Legge, p. 298) as a figure for the king's soldiers. This phrase came to have various meanings. Ku Yung writes (HS 70: 14a, b), "A general who is victorious in battle is the talons and teeth of the state ." Sun Chien served Wang Mang as a general. This phrase also signified the subordinates who execute their superior's plans. HS 90: 7b states that Wang Wen-shu controlled the commandery of Kuang-p'ing by selecting some ten-odd braves as his "talons and teeth," hiding their crimes, and sending them to search out the commandery's thieves and robbers. Prof. Duyvendak suggests that "talons and teeth" denoted the secret police. H. O. H. Stange, Die Monographie Ã¼ber Wang Mang, p. 15, 1.5, translates this phrase as "Leibgardist," but the technical term for body-guard was su-wei (HS 38: 3b12). [Chen] Feng's son, [Chen] HsÃ¼n, [Liu] Hsin1a's son, [Liu] Fen, Ts'ui Fa from Cho Commandery, and Ch'en Ch'ung from Nan-yang [Commandery] were all 6b favored by [Wang] Mang because of their ability. His Procedure. [Wang] Mang's appearance was severe and his speech was blunt.5.5 5.5 The Official ed. reads chih for fang , and quotes the Sung Ch'i ed. as saying that chih should be fang. Wang Hsien-ch'ien adds that the Southern Academy ed. (1531) reads fang. The Ching-yu ed. reads likewise. When he wanted to have something 141WANG MANG 99 A: 5a, b done, he subtly indicated it in his bearing; his 1 B.C. clique took up his intentions and manifested them in a memorial, [whereupon Wang] Mang bent his head to the earth with tears in his eyes, and firmly declined. On the one hand, he thereby misled the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and on the other, he thereby exhibited faithfulness to the mass of commoners. First, he had hinted that [the Governor of] Yi Province should induce the barbarians outside the barrier to present a white pheasant,5.6 5.6 Cf. 12: 2a; Glossary sub YÃ¼eh-shang. and, in the A.D. 1, first year of [the period] YÃ¼an-shih, in the first month, Feb./Mar. [Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager The White Pheasant From the YÃ¼eh-shang. to issue an imperial edict that the white pheasant should be offered in the [imperial] ancestral temples. The many courtiers therefore memorialized, saying, "The [Grand] Empress Dowager entrusted to the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, the duty of planning the imperial enthronement that gave peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples. When the former 5b Commander-in-chief Ho Kuang had the merit of 5b [similarly] having given peace to the [imperial] ancestral He is Likened to Ho Kuang. temples, his enfeoffment was increased by thirty thousand households, the noble title and estate [of his posterity was ordered] to be the same [as that of the founder of their house,5.7 5.7 Cf. HS 8: n. 7.9. and he was ranked] the same as the [former] Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho]. It would be proper for [Wang] Mang to be [treated] as [Ho] Kuang was formerly [treated]."5.8 5.8 Cf. 8: 7b. The [Grand] Empress Dowager questioned5.9 5.9 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that before the word there should be the word . the ministers, saying, "Is it really that, because the Commander-in-chief, [Wang Mang], has achieved 142WANG MANG A.D. 1, Feb./Mar. great merit, he ought to be given [high] honors? Or 99 A: 5b it is because he is of [Our] flesh and blood that you have wanted to distinguish him?" Thereupon various courtiers produced long expositions, [saying, "Wang] Mang's achievements and 7a virtuous conduct have brought about the auspicious He is Likened to the Duke of Chou. presage of a white pheasant [as at the time the Duke of] Chou [was minister to King] Ch'eng. That in a thousand years there are similarities is a law of the sage-kings.5.10 5.10 The "law" is found in Mencius IV, ii, i, 3 (Legge, p. 316). Cf. HS 12: n. 2.3. These YÃ¼eh-shang are also mentioned in Lu Chia's Hsin-yÃ¼ (196 B.C.), cf. MSOS v. 33, p. 32. The Han-shih Wai-chuan 5: 7a declares that their language must be translated by "nine [successive interpreters]." When a subject has great achievements, in his lifetime he should have a laudable title. Hence the Duke of Chou, during his lifetime, was given5.11 5.11 The Official ed. has for the t'o of Wang Hsien-ch'ien's text; he notes that the Southern Academy ed. has t'o. The Ching-yu ed. reads likewise. a title with [the name of] the Chou [dynasty in it. Wang] Mang has the great achievement of having given stability to the state and of having given tranquillity to the Han dynasty, so that it is proper He is Given a Laudatory Title. that he should be granted the title, `The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty],' that the [number of] households [in his noble estate] should be increased, and [his posterity should be given] the same noble title and estate [as the founder of their house]. On the one hand, [this appointment] will be in accordance with ancient principles, and on the other hand, it will take as its model past situations. Thereby it will accord with the mind of Heaven." He Refuses It. When the [Grand] Empress Dowager, in an imperial edict, ordered a Master of Writing to prepare [an edict for] this matter, [Wang] Mang presented a letter which said, "Your servant planned the enthronement [of Emperor P'ing] together with K'ung Kuang, Wang Shun4b, Chen Feng, and Chen Han. Now I wish that the achievements and rewards of 143WANG MANG 99 A: 5b, 6a [K'ung] Kuang and the others should alone be listed A.D. 1 and that [any rewards for] your servant, Mang, should be abandoned and set aside. Do not list me with them." Chen Han advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, which said, " `Without deflection and without partiality, Great is the way of [true] Kings.'5.12 5.12 A quotation from Book of History V, iv, 14 (Legge, p. 331); but cf. Karlgren in BMFEA 20, p. 237, Gl. 1539. Although a relative should be loved, [yet We] should not be partial to him. [But] you, sir, have achieved the merit of having given tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [We] cannot set aside [your merits] and not exalt them just because you are of [Our] flesh and blood. You, sir, must not refuse." When [Wang] Mang again presented a letter excusing himself, the [Grand] Empress Dowager by an imperial edict ordered an Internuncio to lead [Wang] Mang to await [investiture] in the Eastern Wing of the [Palace] Hall. [But Wang] Mang pronounced 6a himself ill and would not enter [the Palace Hall, so the Grand] Empress Dowager sent the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [Yao] HsÃ¼n, with an imperial 7b edict to [Wang Mang], saying, "Because you, sir, 6a are humble,6.1 6.1 Li Tz'u-ming, ibid., 7: 15a, says that should be read as , with which it was anciently interchanged. you have refused on account of illness. Your position, sir, is important, and may not be left vacant. Arise promptly at this time." When [Wang] Mang completely and firmly refused, the [Grand] Empress Dowager again sent the Grand Coachman at the Ch'ang-hsin [Palace, Wang] Hung, with an imperial decree summoning [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang [however] insistently pronounced himself ill. Her entourage advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager that it was proper not to force [Wang] Mang's will, and merely to list K'ung Kuang and the 144WANG MANG A.D. 1, April others, whereupon [Wang] Mang would be willing to 99 A: 6a arise. Apr. 106.2 6.2 HS 19 B: 51b supplies this date for the appointing of three Coadjutors, including Wang Mang. The latter declares (99 A: 18a) that on this date he was appointed Grand Tutor, but 99 A: 6a states that when the others had been appointed, Wang Mang had not yet arisen to receive his appointment. Wang Mang hence received his appointment later on in the same day as the othersâcourt was held early in the morning. The [Grand] Empress Dowager [thereupon] issued His Followers Honored First. to her subordinates an imperial edict, saying, "The Grand Tutor, the Marquis of Po-shan, [K'ung] Kuang, has guarded [the throne] for four reigns and from reign to reign has been tutor or chancellor. He is loyal, filial, benevolent, and sincere; his conduct and his fealty have been outstanding. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [K'ung] Kuang shall become the Grand Master, participating in a government by Four Coadjutors. "The General of Chariots and Cavalry, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun4b, has repeatedly and continually been benevolent and filial; he was sent to invite the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Chi-tzu, to ascend the throne] and he has `repulsed [by diplomacy] the attacks of [the enemy at a distance of] ten thousand li.'6.3 6.3 A quotation from a saying of Confucius in Han-shih Wai-chuan 8: 11b, sect. 18, "Without leaving the sacrifical vases or tables, Yen-tzu repulsed the attack [of the enemy] at a distance of a thousand li," denoting a diplomatic victory. This saying is in turn taken from Yen-tzu Ch'un-ch'iu 5: 14a, sect. 16. A comparison of these two sources shows, in an illuminating fashion, how certain sayings attributed to Confucius arose. His achievements and virtuous conduct are abundant and brilliant. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [Wang] Shun4b shall become the Grand Guardian. "The General of the Left and Superintendent of the Imperial Household, [Chen] Feng, has guarded [the throne] for three reigns. He is loyal, trustworthy, 145WANG MANG 99 A: 6a, b benevolent, and sincere. He was sent to A.D. 1, April invite the King of Chung-shan [to ascend the throne] and has assisted and guided him and supplied his needs, thereby giving tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [Chen] Feng shall be enfeoffed 8a as Marquis of Kuang-yang with the income of a state of 5000 households. [Chen] Feng shall become the Junior Tutor. "Upon all [these persons] there shall be conferred the position [of being included among] the Four Coadjutors. Their noble ranks and estates shall be the same [for their descendants as for the founders of their houses] and to each shall be given one residence. "The Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Imperial Equipages, [Chen] Han, has guarded the throne and toiled diligently. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. [Chen] Han shall be enfeoffed as the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang 6b with the income of an estate of two6.4 6.4 The Official ed. misprints for . The latter reading is confirmed in 18: 28a. thousand four hundred households." When these four persons had received rewards and [Wang] Mang had not even yet arisen, various courtiers again presented [a memorial to the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], saying, "Although [Wang] Mang is able to yield [to others,6.5 6.5 A phrase from Book of History, I, i, 1 (Legge, p. 15), where Yao is said to have been "able to yield to others." yet] he is one whom the court should properly make illustrious and to whom should be given at [this appropriate] time [suitable] rewards, [thereby] making well-known and important one who has achieved great merits and [thereby] not causing the hopes of the many officials or of the great multitude to be disappointed."6.6 6.6 Note the rimes: . 6b The [Grand] Empress Dowager thereupon issued an imperial edict, saying, "The Commander-in-chief, 146WANG MANG A.D. 1, April He is Awarded High Honors. the Marquis of Hsin-tuo, [Wang] Mang, has been one 99 A: 6b of the three highest ministers for three reigns and has performed the [same] duties [as those performed by] the Duke of Chou.

Thereupon [Wang] Mang hypocritically6.12 6.12 Su YÃ¼ (fl. 1913) remarks that and were interchanged. I read the latter. feared His Charter. that he had no alternative and so he arose and received his charter [of appointment]. The charter said, "The Han [dynasty] was in danger because there was no heir, and your excellency stabilized it. As to the positions of the Four Coadjutors and the responsibilities of the three highest ministers, your excellency controls them. As to the various officials and the many positions, your excellency rules them. Your merits and virtue are abundant and brilliant. Thereby the [imperial] ancestral temples are tranquil. Verily, the auspicious presage of the white pheasant is symbolical of [the way the Duke of] Chou [acted as minister to King] Ch'eng. Hence [We] grant you the auspicious title of the Duke Giving Tranquillity 7a to the Han Dynasty. When you are the Coadjutor and protector of the Emperor, do you aim at bringing about [a condition of the utmost] tranquillity. Do not disappoint Our intentions." [Wang] Mang received the titles of Grand Tutor He Refuses Some Grants. and Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [but] he yielded up and returned the matter of his increase in enfeoffment and his noble rank and estate being the same [for his descendants as for himself], saying, "I wish to wait until the people6.13 6.13 H. O. H. Stange, Die Monographie Ã¼ber Wang Mang, 22, n. 1 follows the Tz'u-yÃ¼an in interpreting po-hsing as denoting the families of officials, stating that this term was first democratized gradually in Han times. I believe that this process had already been completed. The meaning here is explained later (7a), when Wang Mang says that "benefits should be granted to gentlemen and common people and to widowers and widows . . . to everyone." That the "families of officials" should be favored moreover implies an aristocratic age, in which descent, rather than ability, brought official position. This was the fact in Spring and Autumn times, but the Han dynasty ushered in a period when not family, but ability was supposed to bring position; the founder of this dynasty and his paladins were commoners; their advent marks the final breakdown of a true hereditary aristocracy (cf. HFHD, I, 13-15). Han Confucianism, with the examination system opening even the highest positions to able persons, regardless of their descent, took an attitude to aristocracy quite different from that of Chou times, when, until its last centuries, official positions were hereditary in certain families. The Tz'u-hai, sub po-hsing, shows that this phrase, even when referring to the most ancient times, in addition to the meaning, "the officials," also meant "the common people." Stange himself is sometimes forced to translate po-hsing as "Volk" (p. 25, 1. 4). have a 148WANG MANG A.D. 1 sufficiency in their households and then only should 99 A: 6b, 7a I be given any rewards." The other highest ministers again argued with him. The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "You, Duke, of your own accord aim at the people having a sufficiency in their households, because of which [We] listen to 7a you. Let it be ordered that your salary, Duke, and the rewards granted to the members of your suite7.1 7.1 Yen Shih-ku remarks, "The members of his suite were the regularly authorized number of officials in his own yamen ." 9a shall all be double what they were previously, and when the people have a sufficiency in their households so that personally they have enough, the Grand Minister over the Multitude, [K'ung Kuang], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Ch'ung], shall report [the fact] in order that [you may thereupon be granted the full amount of your reward]." He has Others Honored. [Wang] Mang again refused and would not receive [these honors] and proposed that it would be proper to set up descendants of the vassal kings [as kings] and to enfeoff the descendants of the more important of the meritorious courtiers of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and his successors, as marquises or to grant them the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain with the income of estates; and thereafter those in office should each have his [full] rank, [so that there may be] a government making grants to every one, in which on the one hand, the [imperial] ancestral temples are honored7.2 7.2 Ho Ch'uo states that the honoring of an imperial ancestral temple refers to the giving to the Temple of Emperor YÃ¼an the name of the Temple of the Eminent Exemplar; cf. 12: 8a. But this title was not given until A.D. 4, so that Ho Ch'uo is very likely mistaken. , by augmenting the 149WANG MANG 99 A: 7a rites and music [employed therein] and on the other A.D. 1 hand, gentlemen and commoners are shown kindness and widowers and widows [are given] grace and bounty. A discussion is in the "Annals of 12: 2b, [Emperor Hsiao]-p'ing." 4b-6a. When [Wang] Mang had pleased the mass of commoners,7.3 7.3 Ch'ien Ta-chao states that the Southern Academy ed. (1531) and the Fukien ed. (1549) read for ; the Official ed. reads likewise. The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter word. I follow it. He is Given Plenary Power. he also wanted the right to decide matters on his own authority. He knew that the [Grand] Empress Dowager had no taste for governing, so he gave a hint to the ministers. They memorialized her, saying, "In the past, officials have been promoted in accordance with the order of their merits to [positions ranking as] two thousand piculs. They, together with minor officials who have been recommended from the provincial divisions as being Abundant Talents of Unusual Degree, are for the most part not worthy [of their positions, so that] it would be proper that they should all interview the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang]. It is also not proper that the [Grand] Empress Dowager should in person supervise unimportant matters." [Thus they] caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Since the Emperor is young in years, We are temporarily directing 7b the government until he puts on the bonnet of virility.7.4 7.4 The Sung Ch'i ed. said that after the word there should be the word . The Ching-yu ed. does not have it. Now most matters are complicated and detailed, while Our years are many and [Our] bodily 9b vigor is insufficient. [If We attend to these matters], there is danger that [We] may not have the means of keeping [Our] body in health or of caring for the Emperor. Hence [We] have selected loyal and capable persons and have set up the Four Coadjutors, 150WANG MANG A.D. 1 so that [Our] many inferiors should be urged to do 99 A: 7a, b their duty and there should perpetually be prosperity and peace. 7b "Confucius `said, "How sublime the way Shun and YÃ¼ held possession of the country and yet remained indifferent to [the details of government]!"

We cannot always expect perfect Chinese style, even in imperial edicts. for enfeoffments of noble titles, which shall nevertheless be reported [to Us], in all other matters, the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty and the Four Coadjutors shall judge and decide. As to Provincial Shepherds, [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs, together with minor officials [who are recommended as being] Abundant Talents, when they are [considered] for their first appointment [to office] and when they memorialize matters, they shall each time be led into an office near [the palace] to answer questions; the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], shall examine into their former offices and ask about their new duties, in order that he may know whether they are worthy or not." Thereupon [Wang] Mang received and questioned each one [of the officials], conveyed to them his secret gracious intentions, and bestowed upon them rich parting gifts, while he brought out memorials concerning those who did not suit his purposes and The Grand Empress Dowager Imitates His Humility. dismissed them, so that his power was equal to that of the lord of men. [Wang] Mang wanted to delight the [Grand] Empress Dowager with vain reputation, so advised her in conversation that since she had herself succeeded to the extravagance of the Ting and Fu [clans 151WANG MANG 99 A: 7b related to] the deceased [Emperor] Hsiao-ai, while A.D. 2, Summer most of the people did not have enough [to live on],7.7 7.7 Reminiscent of Mencius I, i, vii, 22 (Legge, p. 148). it would be proper for the [Grand] Empress Dowager temporarily to wear coarse plain silk,7.8 7.8 Yen Shih-ku says, "Tseng-lien means silk without markings ." and to reduce considerably [the expense of] her cuisine, in order to show [her economical spirit] to the empire. 10a [Wang] Mang thereupon presented a letter, stating A.D. 2, that he would pay a million cash and offer thirty Summer7.10 7.10 Cf. HS 12: 5b. ch'ing7.9 7.9 An area totaling about 340 acres or 136 hectares; cf. n. 9.7. of cultivated fields, to be paid to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, for assistance and gifts to A Great Charity. the poor people.7.10 7.10 Cf. HS 12: 5b. Thereupon the ministers all admired and imitated him. 8a [Wang] Mang led the various courtiers in a memorial, He Lauds the Grand Empress Dowager. saying, "Your Majesty is of an honorable age, [yet] you have for a long time worn heavy plain white silk and have reduced your imperial cuisine, which verily is not the way to sustain your bodily vigor, to care for the Emperor, or to give tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. Your subject, Mang, has several times knocked his head to the ground at the door to your Inner Apartments and has advised and argued with you [concerning this practise, but my request that this practise be discontinued] has not yet been approved. Now, thanks to your Majesty's virtue and beneficence, the wind and rain have recently been timely, sweet dew has descended, the supernatural fungus of immortality has grown, the calendar plant and the red herb,7.11 7.11 The calendar plant grew in Yao's courts, a new leaf growing each of the fifteen days in the first half of a month and a leaf dropping each of the remaining days in a month. In the Ta-Tai Li, "Ming-t'ang," 8: 12a, ch. 67 (not in Wilhelm's trans.) the red herb is described in the same terms as the calendar plant is described elsewhere. auspicious cereals and [other] favorable signs have all appeared simultaneously. 152WANG MANG A.D. 2 "Your servant Mang and the others are not cap- 99 A: 7b, 8a able of overcoming their great hopes: we wish that 8a your Majesty would have compassion upon your energy, rest your spirit, relax your thoughts, conform to the regular imperial robes, and restore the legal cuisine of the Grand8.1 8.1 The Official ed. reads for this .

We hope that you will sympathetically scrutinize [our request]." The Regency Will Terminate when the Emperor [Wang] Mang also caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily, [We] have heard that [according to] the moral principles for the mother of a ruler, her thoughts should not go outside the threshold of the door.8.2 8.2 Liu Hsiang4's Lieh-nÃ¼ Chuan 1: 17a says, Women "should have their cares inside the women's apartments and should have no thoughts outside that region." (Reference from Shen Ch'in-han.) He is probably quoting from the Meng-tzu Wai-shu 1: 5b. The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the Academy ed. (1005) does not have the word . Since the state has not received [Heaven's] 10b blessing and the Emperor is of the age when he is in Comes of Age. swaddling-clothes and is not yet capable of governing in person, [We] have trembled with apprehension and [guarded Ourself] for fear that the [imperial] ancestral temples would not be tranquil. Except for Us, who can control the general policies of the state? "It was for such reasons that Confucius interviewed Nan-tzu and that the Duke of Chou acted as regent, which was probably an expedient suited to the time.8.3 8.3 For Nan-tzu, cf. Analects VI, xxvi; Tso-chuan, Dk. Ting, XV (Legge, 788). Both she and the Duke of Chou controlled the government. [We] have fatigued [Ourself] and have pondered to the utmost [degree], have toiled and worried, and have not yet become tranquil. Hence `if the state is prodigal, then [a sage] gives it an example of economy,'8.4 8.4 A quotation from the Li-chi, II, ii, ii, 4 (Legge, I, 175; Couvreur, I, 213). and `in straightening a 153WANG MANG 99 A: 8a, b curved [piece of wood, it may be spoiled by being A.D. 2 bent backwards] beyond a straight [line,'8.5 8.5 A saying attributed to Mencius, found in the Meng-tzu Wai-shu 3: 5b. so We may have gone too far in economizing], yet if We 8b do not personally lead [the empire back to correctness], what will [We be able] to say to the empire? "[We] have hoped morning and night that the five [kinds of] grains should be harvested in abundance and the peoples' households should have a sufficiency. When the Emperor dons the cap of virility, [We] shall entrust the government to him and transfer it to him. "[We] now verily have had no leisure for light and delicate [clothing] or for perfectly flavored [food] and hope that together with the many officials [We] may achieve [a good government]. Let [us all] make [great] efforts towards this [end]." Every time there was a flood or drought, [Wang] He Suffers with the People. Mang would eat plain food.8.6 8.6 The Grand Empress Dowager's edict shows that "su-shih, , plain food," in Han times, meant vegetables without meat. Cf. also HS 68: 7a. When her entourage advised her of it, the [Grand] Empress Dowager sent a messenger with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "[We] have heard that you, Duke, have been eating [only] vegetables. Your solicitude for the common people is indeed deep. Since in this autumn there has fortunately been a good harvest, and you, Duke, are so diligent in your duties, at this time you should eat meat and care for your body for the sake of the state." 8b 11a [Wang] Mang pondered that the Middle States The Shan-yÃ¼ Takes a Single Personal Name. were already tranquil, and only the barbarians of the four [quarters] were still the same as [before]. So he sent an envoy to give actual gold and valuable silks, as heavy bribes, to the Hun Shan-yÃ¼, in order to have him send a letter to the Emperor, which said, "I have heard that in the Middle States a 154WANG MANG A.D. 2 double personal name is criticized.8.7 8.7 For this incident, cf. HS 94 B: 16a = de Groot, Die Hunnen, p. 264. Kung-yang Commentary 26: 1a, Dk. Ting VI, says, "They criticized a double personal name. A double personal name is contrary to the rites." Ho Hsiu (129-182) explains, "Because it is difficult to taboo." (Reference from Shen Ch'in-han.) From late Chou times onwards, double personal names were unpopular, especially among rulers, whom names had to be tabooed. But in the V cent. and later, double personal names, even for rulers, appear again. Emperor Kao, the Grand Founder of the Southern Ch'i dynasty, had the given name , but his successors took single personal names. Cf. Ch'en Yuan's Shih-hui ChÃ¼-li, 48b, 49a. My former 99 A: 8b personal name has been Nang-chih-ya-szu. Now I change my personal name to Chih, in admiration of and conformity to the regulations of the sages." He also sent [LÃ¼an-ti YÃ¼n], the Hun Princess [who had married] HsÃ¼-pu [Tang] and who was the daughter of Wang [Ch'iang] Chao-chÃ¼n, to enter [the court] and wait upon [the Grand Empress Dowager. Wang Mang thus used] myriads of methods and stratagems to dazzle deceptively and serve flatteringly the [Grand] Empress Dowager and her inferiors down to her Chief Chamberlain who was at her side. The Emperor to be Married. When [Wang] Mang had become an important personage, he wanted to mate his daughter to the Emperor, making her the Empress, in order to make his power secure. [So] he memorialized, saying, "The Emperor has been on the throne to the third year, [yet the occupant of] the Ch'ang-ch'iu Palace, [the Empress], has not yet been established and [the positions of] concubines in the Lateral1 1 Yen Shih-ku remarks that and have the same pronunciation and were interchanged. Courts have not yet been filled. Recently, the difficulties of the dynasty have originated from heirs being lacking and from [imperial] marriages and takings [of concubines] having been incorrect. I beg that the Five Classics be investigated and discussed in order to establish rites for [the imperial] marriage 155WANG MANG 99 A: 8b and to fix the principle of [the Emperor's] twelve A.D. 2 9a women,2 2 In a comment to Chou-li 7: 7a, sub the Nei-tsai, Cheng Chung [ca. 5 B.C.-A.D. 83] says, "The consorts (fei ) of the king [numbered] 120 persons. There was one queen (hou ), three ladies (fu-jen ), nine spouses (p'in ), 27 women destined to provide descendants (shih-fu ) and 81 female attendants (nÃ¼-yÃ¼ )." These same titles are found in the Book of Rites, I, ii, ii, 1 (Legge, I, 109; Couvreur, I, 86 f); ibid. XLI, 11 (Legge, II, 432; Couvreur II, 648). When Wang Mang married a second time, his concubines were of this number; cf. 99 C: 20a, b. In a comment to Li-chi 7: 1b, 2a (to Legge's verse 29 in II, i, i), Cheng HsÃ¼an (127-200) says, "The Lord, K'u, established four consorts [for himself], which typify the four stars of the Empress and Consorts [a constellation in Scorpio and another in Ursa Minor], of which the brightest one is the principal consort, and the other three small ones are the secondary consorts. The Lord, Yao, followed [his example]. Shun did not inform [his parents] when he married, so did not establish a principal consort, and merely had three consorts, calling them the three Ladies. . . . The Sovereign of the Hsia dynasty, [YÃ¼], increased them by three threes, which is nine, so that altogether there were twelve women. The explanation in the Spring and Autumn [unidentified] says, `The Son of Heaven marries twelve [women]', which [speaks of] the regulations of the Hsia [dynasty]. . . . Then the members of the Yin [dynasty] again increased them by three nines, which is twenty-seven, altogether 39 women. The members of the Chou [dynasty] imitated the Lord, K'u, and established a principal spouse and also increased [the King's concubines] by three twenty-sevens, making eighty-one women, altogether 121 women." Shen Ch'in-han remarks that, according to the Lieh-nÃ¼ Chuan, the Son of Heaven had twelve [concubines], nobles had nine, grandees had three, and gentlemen had two. Cf. also T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 135: 1b ff. Po-hu-t'ung 9: 5b explains that "twelve women" is "to imitate Heaven, who has twelve months [in a year]." Cf. M. Granet, La Polygnie Sororale, p. 67, n. 1. in order to increase his posterity, and that there be a wide selection [for his harem] from the daughters of the principal wives of the descendants from the two [immediately preceding dynasties of true] kings, [the Shang and Chou dynasties], the posterity of the Duke of Chou and of Confucius, and the marquises in Ch'ang-an." The matter was referred to the high officials and Wang Mang Withholds they presented [to the Grand Empress Dowager] the names of a multitude of girls. The girls of the Wang clan were the most numerous of those selected [as 11b candidates for becoming the Empress. Wang] Mang His Own Daughter. feared that they would compete with his own daughter,1.1 1.1 HS 97 B: 23a states that Wang Mang wanted, like Ho Kuang, to have his daughter become the Empress, but "the [Grand] Empress Dowager did not wish it." so he immediately presented [a letter] saying, 156WANG MANG A.D. 2 "I personally am without virtue and my child's 99 A: 8b, 9a abilities are of a low [order], so that it would not be proper for her to be put with the multitude of girls [from whom the Empress] is to be chosen." The [Grand] Empress Dowager thought that he was completely sincere, so issued an imperial edict [for the Emperor], saying, "The girls of the Wang clan are Our maternal relatives. Let them not be selected [for the imperial harem]." 9a The many common people, the [Confucian] masters, The People Memorialize That His Daughter Should Become the Empress. the Gentlemen, the lower officials, and [those holding] higher positions, who [thereupon came to] wait at the [Palace] Portals to present letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager, numbered] more than a thousand daily; some of the ministers and grandees went to the middle of the [principal] court and some prostrated themselves outside the doors of the Inner [Apartments]. All said, "The sage virtue of your enlightened edict is as sublime as" that, [or] "The abundant and glorious services of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty are as magnificent as" this, [or], "Now that an Empress is to be established, why should the daughter of the Duke be specially excluded? Where would the destiny of the empire be [better] placed? We wish to secure the daughter of the Duke as the mother of the empire." [Wang] Mang sent his Chief Clerk and subordinates by divisions to instruct and stop the ministers and the [Confucian] masters, but those who presented letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager] were even greater [in number than before, so the Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative but to listen to the ministers and select the daughter of Wang] Mang [to be the Empress]. [When Wang] Mang again himself advised her 157WANG MANG 99 A: 9a that it would be proper to select widely from among A.D. 3, Spring the host of [suitable] girls, the ministers contested with him, saying, "It is not proper to select other girls and thereby alter the proper line of succession, [which can only come through the daughter of the Duke]." [Wang] Mang [accordingly] advised [the Grand A.D. 3. Empress Dowager] that he was willing to have his Spring1.2 1.2 Cf. HS 12: 6b. daughter interviewed. The [Grand] Empress Dowager 12a sent the Privy Treasurer of Ch'ang-lo [Palace, She is Selected. Hsia-hou Fan1.3 1.3 From HS 97 B: 23a, which states that the Privy Treasurer, Tsung-po Feng, was also sent. ], the Superintendent of the Imperial House, [Liu Hung3b], and the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [P'ing Yen1.4 1.4 From HS 97 B: 23a, which states that the Privy Treasurer, Tsung-po Feng, was also sent. ], to present the proposal [of marriage]1.5 1.5 Na-ts'ai was the first of the five preliminary rites in a marriage. It was the ancient technical term for proposing an engagement, from Yi-li 4: 1a (Steele, I, 18), "When the [prospective] bride's [parents] have made known [their willingness], in presenting (na) [the announcement that the girl] had been chosen (ts'ai), a wild goose is employed." Cheng HsÃ¼an comments, "After the girl's family has agreed, [the boy's parents] send a person to present (na) the rites of her choosing and selection (ts'ai-tse ), using a wild goose as an offering." Chia Kung-yen (fl. 640-655) adds, "Na (to present) means that the person who is doing the presenting, [the representative of the boy's parents], fears that the girl's family will not accept [the announcement], similar to the principle of nei and na [to present a lady to a noble's harem] in the Spring and Autumn, when, if [the noble] approves, she is presented. Ts'ai (to select) means that the person who is doing the presenting, because [the girl] is newly chosen and selected (ts'ai-tse), fears that the girl's family will not agree to [the engagement]. Hence he calls it a na (presentation)." The five preliminary rites in marriage were: (1) "the presentation of the choice [to the girl's parents] (na-ts'ai), (2) the request for the [girl's] given name (ch'ing-ming), (3) the presentation of the lucky [divination concerning the marriage] (na-chi), (4) the presentation of the betrothal presents (na-cheng), and (5) the request to fix a date [for the marriage] (ch'ing-ch'i)" Legge, Li Ki, II, 428; Couvreur, Li Ki, II, 641-42. The sixth and final rite was "the [groom] in person fetching [the bride, bringing her to his ancestral home] (ch'in-ying)," cf. Steele, op. cit., I, 18ff; Po-hu-t'ung 9: 2b-3b. and to interview the girl. They returned and memorialized, saying, "The daughter 9b of the Duke has been imbued with virtue and culture and has a beautiful and fascinating appearance, so 158WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring that it would be proper for her to continue the 99 A: heavenly* * Wang Hsien-ch'ien states that the Official ed. is correct in emending to . The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. succession and uphold the [imperial] sacrifices." There was an imperial edict sending the Grand Master Over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen Feng], to inform in an official document [the imperial ancestors in the imperial] ancestral temples and in various ways to perform divination by the tortoise-shell and by the stalks. They reported unanimously, "The cracks upon the tortoise-shell which occurred were [a prognostic] that metal and water will flourish and assist. The diagram formed by the stalks which occurred was that the father and mother will occupy [their due] positions,â  â  Fu Ch'ien says, "[According to] the rules for the cracks upon the tortoise-shell, crosswise ones are earth; vertical ones are wood; slanting ones in the direction of the grain are metal; [slanting ones] across [the grain] are fire; those that accomodate themselves to the tortoise-shell and are slightly curved are water." (Quoted by Ch'ien Ta-chao). Wang2 should here be read as wang4 ; these words were interchanged. In his comment on Mencius II, ii, i, 1, (Legge, p. 208), "Heaven's times are not as good as Earth's advantages," Chao Ch'i (108-201 A.D.) says, " `Heaven's times' means the time and the day when the branches and stems and five elements wang-hsiang (flourish and assist), or are absent in that ten-day week or are the two middle days of a ten-day week." (The phrase wang-hsiang is also found in Lun-heng 1: 12b, ch. 3 [Forke, I, 148] where it is applied to people. For an explanation of ku-hsÃ¼ , cf. P'ei Yin's comment on these words in SC 128: 29.) The Meng-tzu Cheng-yi (quoted in Meng-tzu Chu-su 4 A: 1b), attributed to Sun Shih (compiled before the xii cent.) explains that the element metal flourishes (wang4) for the branches szu, wu, wei, shen, and yu and the element water flourishes (wang4) for the branches shen, yu, hsÃ¼, hai, and tzu. Hence the prognostication was shen and yu, for these branches are in both lists. Yet the marriage was performed on the day (A: 17a), so that there must have been a separate divination to determine the day of marriage. Chang Yen says, " `Father and mother' means hexagram [no. 11], t'ai (), [which has the trigram] ch'ien [male, heaven, etc.] below and [the hexagram] k'un [female, earth, etc.] above. Heaven is lower than Earthâthis is the hexagram for mating and enjoying." Lin Pin however ridicules this interpretation, "I say that it nevertheless means `[Her] father and mother [shall] obtain [high] position.' How could he know that this was the hexagram t'ai?" Perhaps Chang Yen understood divination better than Liu Pin did. which may be said to be a response [presaging] prosperity and security, a portent of great good fortune." 159WANG MANG 99 A: 9b The Marquis of Hsin-hsiang, [Liu] T'ung2b, pre- A.D. 3, Spring 9b sented [to the throne a memorial], saying, "[According Confucian Tradition Awards Him Great Grants. to] the Spring and Autumn, when the Son of Heaven was about to take [a bride from the state of] Chi6, he rewarded the Viscount of Chi with the title of Marquis.â¡ â¡ In the Spring and Autumn, Dk. Yin, II (721 B.C.), (Legge, p. 8), there is mentioned a "Tzu-po of Chi6 ." In a note to Tso-chuan 2: 17a, Tu YÃ¼ (221-284) declares, "Tzu-po is the style of Lieh-hsÃ¼ [a grandee of Chi6, mentioned in the same chapter of the Tso-chuan]." But the Kung-yang Commentary (iii cent. B.C.) 2: 3b, commenting upon the same passage, says, "Who was Tzu-po of Chi6? It has not been reported." According to the Ku-liang Commentary 1: 6b, the phrase in the Spring and Autumn, "Chi Tzu-po," was sometimes interpreted as "The Viscount of Chi treated [the Viscount of LÃ¼] as his elder." This latter interpretation underlies the passage in the HS. The Spring and Autumn, Dk. Huan II, vii, (710 B.C.), (Legge, p. 39) mentions "the Marquis of Chi," and Ying Shao, in a note to HS 18: 1b, explains, "[The ruler of the state of] Chi had originally the title of Viscount, hence [the Son of Heaven] previously rewarded him and made him a marquis. It means that [true] kings do not take a bride from small states." In a note to the Kung-yang Commentary 4: 5a, explaining the latter passage of the Spring and Autumn, Ho Hsiu (129-182) glosses, "That he is entitled a marquis is [because], when the Son of Heaven was about to take [a bride from the state of] Chi, he gave [this title to its Viscount] since with her he would uphold his ancestral temple [sacrifices] and transmit them without end, than which nothing is greater. Hence he was enfeoffed [with a territory] of a hundred li [square]." There were thus two interpretations of the phase Chi Tzu-po. The estate of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], is not yet conformable to [this] ancient regulation." The matter was referred to the high officials, and all advised, "Anciently, the Son of Heaven enfeoffed the father of his Empress [with a fief] a hundred li [square]; he honored [his father-in-law] and did not treat him as his subject, in order to give importance to his ancestral temple. It was the extreme of filial piety. [Liu] T'ung's advice is in conformity with the rites and may be approved. We beg that [Wang] 160WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring 12b Mang be additionally enfeoffed with the 25,600 99 A: 9b ch'ing of cultivated fields in [the county of] Hsin-yeh, [in order that he may have] a full hundred li."1.6 1.6 HS 24 A: 2b declares that six feet made a pu (double pace) and a hundred pu made a mou , i.e., an area 1 pu wide and 100 pu long. This was probably the ancient mou and the Han pu. Teng Chang (fl. ca. 208), in a note to HS 24 A: 18a remarks, "Anciently [cf. also Li Hsien's note to HHS, Mem. 39: 17a], a hundred pu made a mou, [but] in Han times 240 pu made a mou. 1200 ancient mou then made five present [Han] ch'ing ," i.e., if the ancient and Han foot were of the same length, 1200 ancient mou were equal to 500 Han mou, since the Han ch'ing contained 100 mou. Since the Han foot was 9.09 in. (Eng. meas.) long, and the Han mou was one Han pu wide and 240 Han pu long, a Han mou contained 0.114 acre or 4.61 ar. A ch'ing was then 11.4 acres or 4.61 hectares. The fields of Hsin-yeh, 25,600 ch'ing, were then 291,840 acres or 118,016 ha. "A full hundred li [square]" thus refers to the whole of his holdings. The Han li does not seem to have been based on the Han mou, but on the pu. Anciently, the li was the length of one side of a ching , i.e., 300 pu; the Han li was 300 Han pu long. HS 24 A: 2b states that an [ancient] ching was one li square and contained 900 [ancient] mou. The same passage states that a mou was one pu wide and a hundred pu long, so that a ching was 300 pu square. Li-chi III, v, 19 (Legge, I, 244; Couvreur I, 320) and Han-shih Wai-chuan 4: 7b (from which HS 24 A: 2b probably took its information) declare directly that a ching was 300 pu square. The latter and the HS assert that a pu was six feet long. Since the Han foot was 9.094 inches (Eng. measure) long (cf. HFHD, I, ch. IV, app. II, p. 279), the li was 1364 feet Eng. measure or 415.8 meters long. This length can be confirmed from a study by Ch'ou Tsai-lu in the Chinese Historical Geography Magazine (YÃ¼-kung), Sept. 16, 1935, vol. 4, no. 2, p. 12, in which he points out that the HS states the distance from Yarkhand (Sha-ch'Ãª) to Guma (P'i-shan) to be 380 li, while it is measured at 155 km.; from Guma to Yotkan (YÃ¼-tien) is 380 li, which is 150 km., so that a li must have been 408 or 400 m. Thus our deduction from HS 24 A concerning the li is confirmed; that conclusion also confirms our figure for the size of a mou. Cf. W. Eberhard, "Zur Landwirtschaft der Han-Zeit," MSOS, v. 35 (1932), p. 98, and his "Bemerkungen zu statistischen Angaben der Han-Zeit," T'oung Pao, 36 (1940), 2-4. This conclusion concerning the size of the mou and li applies only to Han times, more exactly, to Wang Mang's time. According to Li-chi III, v, 21 (Legge I, 246; Couvreur, I, 323), in Chou times the pu contained eight feet, so that writers, assuming a foot of the Han length, calculated the Chou mou and li to have been larger than in Han times; but such need not actually to have been the case. He Returns Hsin-yeh. [Wang] Mang excused himself, saying, "Your subject Mang's daughter is really not fit to be mated to the most honorable person [i.e., the Emperor]. I furthermore have heard about the discussions of the 161WANG MANG 99 A: 9b many [officials concerning] an increase in my en- A.D. 3, Spring feoffment. I, your subject Mang, myself humbly meditate that I have been permitted to rely upon [the fact that I am] a distant relative [of the throne]1.7 1.7 Wang Nien-sun, in a note to HS 36: 17a, states that both the words fei1-fu1 mean bark (or shavings, splinters). Shuo-wen 6 A: 3b defines p'o as bark (or shavings) , and ibid. 7b defines fei2 as a scraped wooden writing block. Wang Nien-sun asserts that fei1 is borrowed for fei2 (giving examples); that , fu2 and p'o (also pronounced pu), all of which are used as the second word of this phrase, are close in pronunciation; and that fu1 is used for fu2. The phrase fei-fu "means that he considered himself as an unimportant relative of the imperial house, just as bark is a part of a tree (or the shavings were part of a wooden writing block)." Liu Hsiang uses this phrase of himself in 36: 17a; in 36: 29b he speaks of himself as "having fortunately been permitted to attach himself as one of the least of [the imperial] relatives," which passage is parallel to this expression. This phrase fei-fu is also used in ch. 52: 5a and SC 107: 10 sub T'ien Fen; HS ch. 53 sub King Ching of Chung-shan; ch. 55 sub Wei Ch'ing; ch. 80; ch. 86 sub Shih1 Tan; SC 19: 3 (MH III, 148); HHS, Mem. 2 sub Lu Fang. The foregoing interpretation follows that of Szu-ma Cheng in SC 19: 3, who takes it from Yen Chih-t'ui's (531-ca. 591) Yen-shih Chia-hsÃ¼n B: 23a, b; ch. 17 (q.v.). It is strongly attacked by Chang Shou-chieh in a note to SC 107: 10, where he follows an ancient interpretation quoted by Yen Shih-ku in HS 36: 17a and 52: 5a, which states, " `Fei1-fu1' means that the liver and lungs are close to each other, as if one said, `heart and spine'. " He quotes Ku Yeh-wang (519-581) "Fei1-fu1 [means the same as] belly and heart." In a note to SC 19: 3, Takigawa states that it was an expression peculiar to Han times, not seen in the Books of Odes, of History, the Tso-chuan or the Kuo-yÃ¼, and was used to denote close relatives. Cf. Tz'u-tung, I, 1313-1314. But this latter interpretation, which makes Wang Mang boast that he is a close relative, is not at all humble. According to Han Confucian theory, close imperial relatives ought to be given high office (HFHD, II, 292). Wang Mang is not claiming a right, but humbly mentioning the favors granted him. Wang Nien-sun must be correct in this case. and have [thus] attained noble rank and lands. If my daughter is really capable of supporting and according with your sage virtue, the estate of your subject Mang is [yet] sufficient to make offerings 10a for the tribute at the court; it is not necessary again to give me the favor of added territory. I wish to return what was to be added." The [Grand] Empress Dowager approved it. The high officials memorialized that, [according to] ancient practises, an empress was betrothed [with a 162WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring He Distributes gift of] twenty thousand catties of actual gold,2.1 2.1 Han-chiu-yi B: 2a declares, "The Emperor bethroths his Empress with ten thousand catties of actual gold." HHS, An, 10 B: 6a says, "Thereupon altogether according to the former practice of the presents for an Empress [in the case of] the Empress [nee Chang of Emperor] Hsiao-hui, she was betrothed with twenty thousand catties of actual gold." Sung-shu 14: 4a states that in A.D. 287, a Master of Writing, Chu Cheng, asserted "According to the regulation of the Empress of [Emperor] Kao of the Han dynasty, an empress is betrothed with two hundred catties of actual gold and twelve horses and Ladies with fifty catties of gold and four horses." Shen Ch'in-han notes this statement and adds that the Sung-shu is correct. 99 A: 9b, 10a which would be two hundred million cash. [Wang] Mang declined it and asked strongly that it be given 10a to others, [but] received forty million [cash] and gave the Dowry Money Among the Families of the Imperial Concubines-elect. He is Given Additional Sums. Chang thirty-three million [cash] of that [sum] to the families of [the Emperor's] eleven concubines, [who were to accompany the Empress]. Various courtiers again said, "Now the betrothal presents received for the Empress barely surpass those for the various concubines." [So] there was an imperial edict again increasing [the gift to Wang Mang] by twenty-three million [cash, making it] altogether thirty million [cash. Wang] Mang again used ten million [cash] of that [sum] to divide among the poor persons in his nine [sets of] relatives. Ch'en Ch'ung was at that time Director of Justice to the Grand Minister over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and was good friends with Chang Ch'ang's grandson, 13a [Chang] Sung. [Chang] Sung was a gentlemen of Sung's Laudatory Memorial for Ch'en Ch'ung. wide learning, and drafted for [Ch'en] Ch'ung a memorial praising the achievements and virtuous conduct of [Wang] Mang, which [Ch'en] Ch'ung memorialized. It said, "[According to] the opinion of your unworthy servant, from the time that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty first `brought his bundle of dried flesh [and began studying],'2.2 2.2 A phrase from Analects VII, vii. he has been placed in an age when customs have been highly 163WANG MANG 99 A: 10a, b extravagent and luxurious, has had the high favor A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. (1) His Self-discipline. of being allied in flesh and blood to [the occupants of] two palaces, [Emperor Ch'eng and the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], and has been covered with the illustrious brilliance of his various uncles. His wealth has been great and his power abundant, so that his will was unopposed. "Yet he has humbled himself, lived a life of kindness and goodness, vanquished his desires, and walked in the path of proper conduct, resisting the age and correcting its customs, standing firmly alone, [wearing] poor clothes and [eating] poor food, with a shabby carriage and sorry horses, with one consort and no other [woman]. No one of the multitude has 10b failed to hear of [the wonderful conditions] within the doors of his inner apartments and of his virtues of filial piety and friendliness. He is quiescent, rejoicing in the Way, gentle and good, and associating with worthy inferiors. He is kindly to his old friends and servitors and faithful to his teachers and associates. Confucius said, `No [one] is as good as the man who is poor and yet happy, rich and yet loves the rules of proper conduct,'2.3 2.3 Analects I, xv, 1. which indeed applies to the Duke. "When he was a Palace Attendant and the former (2) His Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yn Chang, committed 10b the crime of treason, the Duke did not presume to Impartial keep it to himself [but] advocated that [his cousin] 13b should be punished.

Glossary, sub these names. which [precedent] indeed denotes that the Duke [is like these sages]. "For this reason, Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng gave the Duke a mandate to be his Commander-in-chief, entrusting him with the government of the state. 164WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. (3) His Opposition to the Advancement of Natural Imperial Maternal Relatives. When [Emperor] Hsiao-ai ascended the throne, the 99 A: 10b Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, divined the desires [of the Concubine nee Ting] and sought for her approbation [by suggesting that the Emperor's natural mother, this Concubine nee Ting, should be given the title belonging to his imperial mother, instead of recognizing that Emperor Ai was the adopted son of his predecessor, hence his natural mother could not be his imperial mother. Tung Hung thus actually proposed] creating two lines of [imperial] descent. [But] the Duke in person impeached [Tung Hung] and thereby established a fundamental principle [of government]. He advocated that it was not proper for the Queen Dowager [nee Fu] of Ting-t'ao to have [her canopy and seat beside] the imperial2.5 2.5 Ts'ai Yung, in his Tu-tuan, A: 2b, explains that sheng-yÃ¼ and ch'e-chia came to mean merely "imperial" or "Emperor." canopy and seat [of the Grand Empress Dowager],2.6 2.6 Cf. 99 A: 2b, 3a. in order to make plain the constitution of the state. The Book of Odes says, `The weak he did not devour And the powerful he did not eject; He did not insult widowers or widows Nor fear the strong or resistful,'2.7 2.7 Book of Odes, 260; III, iii, vi, 5 (Legge, p. 544). The Mao text reads for the HS's . Two other variations are merely substitute characters. The Sung Ch'i ed. remarks that the Academy ed. (1005) and the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) omit the third line. which indeed applies to the Duke. (4) His Unjust Dismissal. "He firmly held to humility and expressed his sincerity in yielding his position. When the Queen Dowager [nee Fu] of Ting-t'ao wanted to secure for herself the usurped title [of Empress Dowager], she feared his sense of duty which [made him] rebuke her to her face [for placing] her canopy and seat [next to that of the Grand Empress Dowager]. Flattering 165WANG MANG 99 A: 10b, 11a and misleading braves, [such as] Chu Po and his A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. sort, were restrained by the other fact that [Wang Mang] had in person impeached [Shun-yÃ¼] Chang and [Tung] Hung. [Hence] superiors and inferiors were united in calumniating, injuring, and causing 11a confusion, so that they violated and perverted the regulations, and [the Queen Dowager] succeeded in usurping the title [of Grand Empress Dowager]. They drove away [men of] stable benevolence and executed [the imperial] relatives by marriage [who were related to the preceding emperor, so that] the Duke suffered the calumny [undergone by Wu YÃ¼an Tzu]-hsÃ¼ and [Ch'Ã¼] YÃ¼an, and was 14a caused to go far away to his state [of Hsin-tuc]. The court and the government were collapsing in ruins, the main and subordinate [dynastic] principles were going to pieces, and the calamity of the overthrow [of the dynasty] remained suspended by no more than a hair. The Book of Odes says, `When [capable] men flee, The state is exhausted and at the point of ruin,'2.8 2.8 Book of Odes, #264; III, iii, x, 5 (Legge, p. 563). One character there is written differently from in the Mao text. which applies indeed to the Duke. 11a "At this time, [when Emperor Ai had died], there (5) His Crushing of Imperial Favorites. was no heir in the [imperial] palaces; Tung Hsien2a occupied the most important [position], added to which the Fu clan had the assistance of their daughter, [who was the Empress]. They all themselves knew that they had offended the country and had a feud with [the royal family in the kingdom of] Chung-shan, so that it would have been necessary for [the Fu and Ting clans] to be `one in' their worries, protect each other by [the power which enables a person] to `shatter metal [bars]',2.9 2.9 Phrases from the Book of Changes, App. III, Sect. 1, ch. 8, 43 (Legge, p. 362), "When two men are one in heart Their power shatters metal [bars]." utilize a forged 166WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. testamentary edict [of Emperor Ai], make frequent 99 A: 11a, b use of rewards and punishments, first eliminate those whom they dreaded and hastily introduce [to office] those who were attached [to them], then make false accusations against [those against whom they had] long standing grudges, [i.e., the clan of Emperor P'ing], and furthermore repress [even] distant [imperial] relatives. If the circumstances had developed and occurred [after this manner], it would not have been difficult [for the Fu and Ting clans to seize the power of the government].2.10 2.10 The Sung Ch'i ed. asserted that should be , after there should be the word , and the should be excised. The Ching-yu ed. has the first of these changes. "Thanks to the Duke, who at once entered [the court, Tung] Hsien2a was immediately made to retire, together with his clique and relatives. At this time, the Duke acted by his own brilliant insight and 14b 11b wielded an unprecedented majesty. He lifted his eyebrows with a stern air and disseminated a martial ardor. Taking advantage of the fact that [Tung Hsien2a] was not secure [in his position], he crushed him before he could move. Like a thunderbolt he set in motion the mechanism [of government] and his enemies were broken. Even if [Meng] Pen or [Hsia] YÃ¼ had been [there], they would not have [had time] to take up [their weapons] and touch him; even if Shu-li [Chi] had been [there], he would not have had time to use his wits; even if [the Master of] the Demon Valley had been [there], he would have been unequal to such rapid [action]. For this reason Tung Hsien2a lost his spirit and committed suicide by strangling. People did not [have time] to turn 11b around, the sun did not [have time to] move on the sun-dial, when suddenly on all [sides, the conspirators] were eliminated, [things were] changed and it became a peaceful court. "Without your Majesty, [Grand Empress Dowager], 167WANG MANG 99 A: 11b no one could have presented [for appointment] A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. and given [office] to the Duke; without the Duke no one could have vanquished this calamity. The Book of Odes says, `Verily, the [Grand] Master was Shang-fu, [LÃ¼ Shang]. He was an eagle, a hawk, Assisting King Wu;2.11 2.11 Book of Odes, #236; III, i, ii, 8 (Legge, p. 436). and Confucius said, `With promptness you will have (6) His Selection of success;'2.12 2.12 Analects XVII, vi. which indeed apply to the Duke. "Hence the Duke thereupon advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] to receive the former Chancellor 15a of [the kingdom of] Szu-shui, [Chen] Feng, and the Capable Subordinates. Prefect of T'ai, [Chen] Han, together with the Grand Minister over the Masses, [K'ung] Kuang, and the General of Chariots and Cavalry, [Wang] Shun4b, [and have them] propose and plan [the enthronement of the Emperor who should care for the dynasty's] altars to the gods of the soils and grains, go eastwards, bearing credentials, and invite [the present Emperor to ascend the throne]. All of them received enfeoffment or additional territory because of their achievements and virtuous conduct and became famous officials of the state. The Book of History says, `One who knows people is wise,'3.1 3.1 Book of History, II, iii, ii, 2 (Legge, p. 70). which applies to 12a the Duke. "The ministers all sighed after the Duke's virtue (7) His Refusal of Honors. and all honored the Duke's signal services, [saying that] they were equal to those of the Duke of Chou, so that it would be proper to grant him the title of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty and to increase his enfeoffment by two counties, [but] the Duke would not accept any of them. A book 168WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. says, `Shen Pao-hsÃ¼ would not receive the reward for 99 A: 11b, 12a having preserved [the state of] Ch'u,'3.2 3.2 For this event, cf. Tso-chuan, Dk. Ting, V, (Legge, p. 760). We have not been able to find this quotation. and `Yen [Ying] P'ing-chung would not receive the enfeoffment for having acted as [chief] assistant [in the 12a government of the state of] Ch'i.'3.3 3.3 Yen-tzu Ch'un-ch'iu 6: 17b, sect. 19, states that when the Duke of Ch'i wanted to enfeoff Master Yen, the latter replied, " `From [the time of the Foreseen] Grand Duke, [LÃ¼ Shang], to your own [time], Duke, there have been several tens of Dukes. If people were able to obtain [noble] estates [merely] by delighting their princes, they would not have waited until your [time], Duke, to hasten to Ch'i and strive [with each other] in seeking promotion and lands [in such great numbers that] it would have been impossible for them to get a foothold or lodging there.' . . . Thereupon he did not accept [the enfeoffment]." Perhaps the foregoing is the passage that is loosely quoted here. Confucius said, `If [a prince] is able to rule his state in accordance with the rules of proper conduct and yielding [to others], what [difficulty] will he have?',3.4 3.4 Analects IV, xiii. which apply to the Duke. (8) His Preliminary Refusal to Let his Daughter Become Empress. "When they were about to determine upon and establish an Empress-consort for the Emperor, the high officials sent up [to the Grand Empress Dowager] the names [of suitable girls], the first of whom was the daughter of the Duke, [and] the Duke declined it strongly and asked that it be given to others. He was constrained and had no resource, and then only did he accept the imperial edict [ordering his daughter to be Empress]. The love between father 15b and child is a Heaven-[endowed quality of human] nature and spontaneous; [a father] desires glory and honor for his [child] much more than for himself. The honor of being Empress is equal to that of being the Son of Heaven. The opportunity [offered to his daughter] at that time is rare [even] in a thousand years. Yet the Duke thought of the great principles of the state and yielded up the favor of the greatest blessing. In all matters he was humble, and, [whatever 169WANG MANG 99 A: 12a, b was done, he firmly refused [honors]. The Book A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. of History says, `Shun [wished to] yield to someone more virtuous, and was not delighted [at the prospect of taking the throne],'3.5 3.5 Book of History, II, i, iii, 3 (Legge, 32). Wang Nien-sun declares that the text should read yi2 or instead of szu . Yen Shih-ku explains szu. The ancient text of the Book of History read szu and the modern text read yi2. The HS regularly quotes the modern text. SC 1:32 (Mh I, 56) quotes this verse from the Book of History with the word yi5 (which means the same as yi2), and HsÃ¼ Kuang (ca. 352-425) glosses, "The modern text Book of History reads yi2. Yi2 is yi5." Szu-ma Cheng (fl. 713-742) adds, "The ancient text reads szu; the modern text reads yi2." SC 130: 30 also quotes this passage with yi2. HHS, Mem. 30 B: 11a and the Wen-hsÃ¼an 48: 24b, in Pan Ku's "Tien-yin," quote this verse with yi2; Li Shan (vii cent.), in his comment, quotes the same verse with szu and adds, "Wei Chao (197-273/4) says, `[According to] the ancient text, yi2 is szu.' " In a note to HHS, Mem. 30 B: 11a, b, Li Hsien (651-684) glosses that in the HS this verse is written with yi2 and the HS Yin-yi (probably the one written by Wei Chao) states that yi2 is to be read as szu. Wang Nien-sun concludes that according to the above evidence, the HS text which both Li Shan and Li Hsien saw read yi2 and Yen Shih-ku altered it to szu to agree with the ancient text of the Book of History, explaining the meaning accordingly. Cf. also Karlgren BMFEA 20, 76, Gl. 1253. which applies indeed to the Duke. "From the time that the Duke received his charter3.6 3.6 Cf. 99 A: 6b. down to the present, he has been indefatigable and orderly, daily renewing his virtue. He 12b has added to and cultivated his whole life, so that (9) His Personal Economy. he might issue the [proper] commands to the nobles; he has followed3.7 3.7 "Issue commands to the nobles" is a reminiscence of Book of Odes IV, iii, v, 4, line 5 (Legge, p. 645; his translation is unsatisfactory). The Tz'u-hai defines hsia-kuo as "the feudal nobles." Yen Shih-ku asserts that ch'Ã¼n means to retire, but Wang Yin-chih (1766-1834) replies that because of the parallelism Yen Shih-ku's interpretation is mistaken; ch'Ã¼n should be read as tsun (follow); anciently ch'Ã¼n and tsun were interchanged; the Erh-ya 1: 6a interprets tsun by hsÃ¼n and the Fang-yen 2: 6b interprets ch'Ã¼n by hsÃ¼n. Sun Hsing-yen (1743-1818) in his Yen-tzu Ch'un-ch'iu Yin-yi B: 34b, sub ch. 7, states that tsun-hsÃ¼n means ch'Ã¼n-, identifying ch'Ã¼n and tsun. economy and exalted moderation, so that he might correct the customs of the age. He 12b has diminished his wealth and disparaged his family, so that he might lead his many subordinates; he has humbled himself and held firmly to equity, so that he might influence the ministers. He has taught children and has honored scholarship, so that he 170WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. might raise the development of the state. His 99 A: 12b slaves have worn plain cloth3.8 3.8 The Official ed. emends by interchanging and reads pu-yi . Wang Wen-pin (xix cent.) however points out that this phrase is from Tso-chuan, Dk. Ch'eng, XVI (Legge, p. 3947, 399b), which states that Viscount Wen of Chi, Chi-sun Hang-fu, "has had no concubines who wore silk (yi-po) nor horses who ate grain"; hence, because of parallelism, the phrase should be yi-pu, not pu-yi. and his horses have not been fed grain, and the expense for his food and drink has not surpassed that of ordinary people. The Book of Odes says, `One must be mild and humble As if perched upon trees;'3.9 3.9 Book of Odes, #196; II, v, ii, 6 (Legge, p. 335). Yen Shih-ku repeats the Mao interpretation of this couplet, so I have adopted it as the Han interpretation, although Karlgren's rendering (BMFEA, 16, p. 106) is better. and Confucius said, `In his food he should not seek for satiety and in his dwelling he should not seek for 16a comfort;'3.10 3.10 Analects, I, xiv. which indeed apply to the Duke. (10) His Generosity "He has denied his person and was himself frugal, buying food [only] to the point of what has been necessary. For all articles he has depended upon the market-place, daily emptying [his bins] and keeping no stores.4.1 4.1 Yen Shih-ku explains, "He did not engage in the production of [food or goods], so that he did not take their profits away from the merchants." In this respect, he imitated Tou Tzu-wen; cf. n. 12.11. He furthermore sent a letter to the throne [asking to be permitted] to return the estate with which Emperor Hsiao-ai had additionally enfeoffed him and to pay4.2 4.2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that the Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. (1530) have chin after the . But the Ching-yu ed. does not have the chin. The reference is to 99 A: 7b, where only cash and no gold or equivalent of gold (chin) is mentioned. cash [to the government] and to offer his cultivated fields. He entirely exhausted his former possessions in order to lead the many [officials in making contributions]. Thereupon 171WANG MANG 99 A: 12b, 13a small and great [turned] towards him in A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudator Memorial harmony, accepting his influence and following his example; outside [the court], kings, the highest ministers,4.3 4.3 That kung here means the three highest ministers is shown by the expression in the similar list in 84: 12a. and the full marquises, and within [the court, the occupants of the imperial] canopies and the imperial attendants, harmoniously and at the same time, each exhausted his possessions. Some paid gold and cash and some offered cultivated fields and acres to assist the impoverished and exhausted and to provide for and support those who had not sufficient [to live on]. Anciently, what the Chief Governor [Tou] Tzu-wen had in the morning did not last until night,4.4 4.4 In Kuo-yÃ¼ 18: 7a, Tou Ch'ieh says, "Anciently Tou Tzu-wen three times resigned [the position of] Chief Governor. He did not have one day's supplies, because he pitied the common people. King Ch'eng [of Ch'u] heard that what [Tou] Tzu-wen had in the morning did not last until night. Therefore every morning he had prepared one bundle of dried flesh and one basket of parched grain, in order to nourish [Tou] Tzu-wen. Down to the present, the Chief Governor has it for his salary."

Ch'eng Ta-ch'ang however declares, "Anciently there were regulations concerning [the color of] palace buildings. Officials were not under those requirements, so their buildings exposed the natural [color] of their materials, for it was not necessary to add any colors or ornaments. These were the `plain houses.' When [Yen] Shih-ku says that white quitch-grass covered the building, he is in error." He has frequently inspected court affairs, has controlled all the administration, and has 16b himself interviewed the [Provincial] Governors and [Commandery] Administrators and those of lower [rank], investigating their whole life, until he had 172WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. made plain those to be promoted and demoted.

The use of Ta-lu in HS 99 B: 6b shows that in Wang Mang's time the K'ung An-kuo interpretation of that phrase (which Legge rejects, cf. his trans., p. 32, note, also Karlgren BMFEA 20, 75, Gl. 1251) was accepted. Yen Shih-ku prefers it in his comment. which indeed refers to the Duke. "All the foregoing have been rare in very ancient times and would be difficult, [even] for YÃ¼ and 13b [Prince] Millet, yet the Duke encompassed its entirety, `containing the one pervading principle.'13.6 13.6 Said by Confucius of himself in Analects IV, xv, 1.

For such a [reason] Prince `YÃ¼ was presented a dark-colored jade tablet'13.8 13.8 Presented by Yao to YÃ¼ at the completion of the latter's work upon the waters (according to the K'ung An-kuo interpretation); Book of History III, i, ii, 23 (Legge, p. 150; Couvreur, p. 89). and the Duke of Chou received [the privilege of] being sacrificed to [after his death] with the suburban sacrifice.13.9 13.9 Li-chi XII, 6-9 (Legge, II, 32; Couvreur, I, 729) states that King Ch'eng granted to the Duke of Chou to be sacrificed to with the ceremonies and songs reserved to the Son of Heaven. Verily, since [these rulers] reported [to Heaven the great deeds of those] sent by Heaven, they did not presume to arrogate to themselves the merit [that came from] Heaven. "When we estimate the upright character of the Duke, it is a model for the empire, and when we look at the achievements of the Duke, they are a foundation for ten thousand generations. If a foundation has been laid and the reward is not appropriate to it, and if a model has been established and the recompense is not in accord, [such a condition] is verily not the way to help the state or to obey the will of Heaven. "Emperor Kao rewarded and recompensed [those Precedents for Rewarding Government Servants: Hsiao Ho persons who had performed] the greatest services. His Chancellor of State, Hsiao Ho, both [was given] twice [as many] households for his estate [as others had] and also received special ritual privileges: of not [needing to use] his personal name in memorializing matters and of not [being required to] hasten 174WANG MANG A.D. 3, Spring Chang Sung's Laudatory Memorial. in entering the [Palace] Hall.13.10 13.10 Cf. HS 39: 4b. More than ten of 99 A: 13b, 14a his relatives by marriage were enfeoffed. Since [Emperor Kao] rejoiced without satiation in goodness, the recompenses he made were not parsimonious. If [a person propounded] one [good] plan, [Emperor Kao] invariably [gave that person] noble rank. For this reason, [although] the position of 17b Kung-sun Jung was [merely] that of a Gentleman, Kung-sun Jung he was selected from [among] the standard-bearers when he had once explained [the conduct] of Fan 14a K'uai, and was enfeoffed [with the income of] two thousand households.14.1 14.1 Cf.

Emperor Wei Ch'ing Hsiao-wu favored and recorded military achievements, so allocated thirty thousand households wherewith to enfeoff Wei Ch'ing; [Wei] Ch'ing's three sons, some of whom were in swaddling clothes, Ho Kuang all became full marquises. Emperor Hsiao-hsÃ¼an made Ho Kuang distinguished and brilliant, adding to the households [of his estate] and commanding [that his descendants should have] the same [rank and estate as the founder of the house]; three persons [in his clan] were enfeoffed, [enfeoffments] being extended to the grandsons of his elder [half]-brother [Ho Ch'Ã¼-ping].14.2 14.2 The three enfeoffments in honor of Ho Kuang were: his son, Ho YÃ¼, as Marquis of Po-lu, on Apr. 27, 68 (HS 18: 11a); Ho Shan, grandson of Ho Ch'u-ping, as Marquis of Lo-ping on May 14, 68 (18: 9a), at the special request of Ho Kuang, in order to continue the ancestral sacrifices of a noble to Ho Ch'Ã¼-ping (68: 11a); and Ho YÃ¼n, elder brother of Ho Shan, as Marquis of Kuan-yang, on Apr. 24, 67 (18: 9b).

Yet he suffered the embarrassment 14b of not being discerning in making his plans by erroneously summoning [the King of Ch'ang-yi, Liu Ho, to the throne]. "As to [Wei] Ch'ing and [Kung-sun] Jung, [the one gained distinction] at the point of his sword,14.5 14.5 Fu Ch'ien explains, "P'iao has the pronunciation of the p'iao of the tip of a sword"; Shen Ch'in-han points out that in Huai-nan Tzu, 19: 8b, "Hsiu-wu-shun," Kao Yu (fl. 205-212) also declares, "P'iao should be read as the p'iao of a sword," and concludes that in Han times the point of a sword was called p'iao. Hence p'iao is borrowed for or , meaning the point of a sword (or the ornament at the tip of a scabbard). Cf. the use of this word in HHS, Tr. 30: 12b9; HsÃ¼n-tzu, 18: 16a6, ch. 26; and in Ho Hsiu's comment to the Kung-yang Commentary, 7: 9b6, Dk.

His eldest son, Po-ch'in, in addition, succeeded his father as Duke of Lu. Cf. Mh IV, 100, n. 2.

"When we consider matters done in more recent Other Precedents [times], there is the oath of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], that except for [members of] the Liu clan, no [one] should be made a king. Yet the Baronet of P'o, [Wu Jui], was permitted to be King of Ch'ang-sha and [Emperor Kao] promulgated an imperial edict praising him as loyal, establishing and publishing [his position as a permanent] ordinance,15.10 15.10 Cf.

"[According to] the Spring and Autumn [in Mr. Tso's Commentary], Duke Tao of Chin employed the plan of Wei Chiang and all of China served and followed him; when the prince of Cheng presented [to Duke Tao] musical [instruments and musicians], Duke Tao thereupon granted half of them to [Wei Chiang.

Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XI, ix (Legge, p. 453). The Spring and Autumn [in Mr. Tso's Commentary] praises him.

[But] just when the various highest 16a ministers were discussing this matter, it happened that the affair of LÃ¼ K'uan arose. 20a Previously, [Wang] Mang had wanted to arrogate 180WANG MANG A.D. 3 Wang Mang Had Denied Emperor P'ing's Natural Relative a Place at Court. the [imperial] power to himself, so had said to the 99 A: 16a [Grand] Empress Dowager, "Previously, when Emperor Ai was set up [as Emperor] and went contrary to the favor and beneficence [shown him by you, Grand Empress Dowager, the Emperor] himself raised his maternal relatives, the Ting and Fu [clans], to high rank, who troubled the state, so that they almost destroyed the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, [almost overthrowing the dynasty]. Now, since the Emperor is young and is again upholding the main line [of the dynasty] as the [adopted] child of Emperor Ch'eng, it is proper to make plain the principle of [only] a single line of [imperial] descent, in order to ward off [such a] situation as had previously [arisen] and to make [the new arrangement] a model for later generations."

Thereupon she had sent Chen Feng, bearing a A.D. 116.3 16.3 HS 12: 4a. kingly seal and cord, who had gone to the Emperor's mother, the Concubine [nee] Wei, had installed her as the Queen of King Hsiao of Chung-shan, [the deceased Liu Hsing], and had granted to the Emperor's maternal uncles, Wei Pao and [Wei] Pao's younger brother, [Wei] HsÃ¼an, the noble rank of Marquises of the Imperial Domain. All of them were detained in [the kingdom of] Chung-shan and were not permitted to go the imperial capital. Wang YÃ¼ Intrigues With Them. [Wang] Mang's son, [Wang] YÃ¼3, disapproved [of the fact] that [Wang] Mang had separated the Wei clan [from the Emperor] and feared that when the Emperor grew up, enmity would later appear [between the Wei and Wang clans. Wang] YÃ¼3 hence sent a man privately to give letters to [Wei] Pao and the others, instructing the Emperor's mother to send a letter to the throne, asking [that she be permitted] 97 B: to enter [the imperial palace]. A discussion is in the 21b-22b. "Memoir of the Queen [nee] Wei." 181WANG MANG 99 A: 16a, b [Wang] Mang did not listen [to this request, so A.D. 3 Wang] YÃ¼3 and his teacher, Wu Chang, together with Wang Mang to be his own wife's elder brother, LÃ¼ K'uan, discussed the circumstances. [Wu] Chang considered that [Wang] Mang could not be admonished, but, since he was 16b fond of spiritual beings, they should make some Superstitiously Terrified. grevious vicissitudes or portentous happenings,16.4 16.4 For these technical terms, cf. Glossary, sub portents. in order to terrify him. [Wu] Chang would thereupon explain them by citing parallel [instances from history] and so would cause him to give the government to the Wei clan. [Wang] YÃ¼3 then had [LÃ¼] K'uan 20b carry blood at night and sprinkle it at the door of [Wang] Mang's residence. When the officials discovered the [plot], [Wang] Mang had [Wang] YÃ¼3 Wang YÃ¼ Executed.16.5 16.5 HS 12: 7a. seized and sent to prison, where he drank poison and died. [Wang] YÃ¼3's wife, [LÃ¼] Yen, who was with child, was held in prison until she gave birth to the child; when it had been [born], she was killed. [Wang] Mang memorialized, saying, "[Wang] YÃ¼3 has been led into error by LÃ¼ K'uan and others, who spread groundless rumors to mislead the crowd, which 16b is16.6 16.6 The Sung Ch'i ed. notes that the YÃ¼eh ed.

The King's Uncles of Kuan and of Ts'ai also spread rumors; cf. Book of History V, vi, 12 (Legge, p. 357); Glossary, s.v. a crime similar to that of the [King's Uncles of] Kuan and of Ts'ai. Your servant does not dare to hide [the fact that] he has been executed." Chen Han and others advised the [Grand] Empress Wang Mang Praised for his Freedom From Partiality. Dowager to issue an imperial edict saying, "Verily, T'ang Yao had, [as his son], Tan-chu and King Wen of the Chou [dynasty] had, [as sons, Hsien and Tu, who were known as the King's Uncles of] Kuan and of Ts'ai. These [two rulers] were both sages of the highest [degree], yet they could not 182WANG MANG A.D. 3 prevent their sons from being of the lowest [degree] 99 A: 16b of stupidity. Why? Because their own [good] natures could not be transplanted [into the hearts of these others]. You, Duke, occupy the position of the Duke of Chou and assist your lord [as he assisted] King Ch'eng. You have also executed [your son as he executed the King's Uncles of] Kuan and of Ts'ai, and have not [allowed] your love for your relatives to injure the honor [due to] those who are honorable, [i.e., the imperial family]. We approve of it most highly. "Anciently, after the Duke of Chou had executed the descendants of the four states,16.7 16.7 Yen Shih-ku explains that these four were those of the three Overseers (including the King's Uncles of Kuan and of Ts'ai) and the wild tribes of the Huai region.

Do you, Duke, concentrate on attending to the state and aim at bringing about the [utmost] transquillity." Hundreds More Executed. Taking advantage of this [edict, Wang] Mang exterminated the Wei clan and examined exhaustively the case of LÃ¼ K'uan. [Wang Mang] involved [in this case] the prominent persons of the commanderies and kingdoms who had in the past criticized him in 21a memorials, and within [the imperial court] even [implicated] the Princess of Ching-wu, the King of Liang, [Liu] Li5a, the Marquis of Hung-yang, [Wang] Li5a, and the Marquis of P'ing-o, [Wang] Jen. Messengers tortured or guarded them, and they all committed suicide. Those who died were numbered by the hundreds, so that [all] within [the four] seas trembled at it. The Commissioner Over the Army [subordinate to] 183WANG MANG 99 A: 16b, 17a the Commander-in-chief, Pao1b, memorialized, say- A.D. 3 Wang Mang's Book Added to the ing, "The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], has suffered from the fact that his son, [Wang] YÃ¼3, has fallen into the [same] crimes [as the King's Uncles of] Kuan and of Ts'ai; his love for his son was very deep, [but], for the sake 17a of the imperial house, [Wang Mang] has not presumed Official Curriculum. to consider his private [interests. Since], however, [Wang] YÃ¼3 has suffered for his crime, [Wang Mang] has sighed and has been deeply moved, so he has composed a writing in eight fascicles, in order to warn posterity. It would be proper to publish it in the commanderies and kingdoms and order the school officials to teach it." The matter was referred to the various highest ministers, who begged that it should be ordered that the officials of the empire who were able to recite and explain the Duke's warning should therefore be recorded on the official registers [of meritorious persons preferred for official positions], just as those [who recite and explain] the Classic of Filial Piety.17.1 17.1 Yen Shih-ku glosses, "Chu kuan-pu means that it was used in securing [persons who] were selected and recommended [to the central government as candidates for official position]." Chou Shou-ch'ang adds (in his HS-chu Chiao-su 55: 16a), "[Emperor] Hsiao-wen had an Erudit for the Classic of Filial Piety and the imperial capital commanderies had Masters for the Classic of Filial Piety [12: 7a], which was recording the Classic of Filial Piety on the official registers [as a regular study].

A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire and the Director of Justice to the Grand Minister over the Masses, Ch'en Ch'ung, and others, eight persons [in all], were sent to travel separately about the empire, to observe and see [the people's] customs.17.4 17.4 According to 18: 30a-31b these eight persons were Wang YÃ¼n, Yen Ch'ien, Ch'en Ch'ung, Li Hsi, Ho Tang, Hsieh Yin, Lu P'u, and Ch'en Feng. He should Be Honored Further. The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun4b, and others memorialized, saying, "[According to] the principles of grading achievements and meritorious conduct in the Spring and Autumn [in Mr. Tso's Commentary], 21b `The highest [degree of celebrity] is to establish [an example of] meritorious conduct, the next [degree] is to establish [a name for] successful achievements, and the next [degree] is to establish [wise] sayings.17.5 17.5 Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XXIV (Legge, p. 507; Couvreur, II, 408). Verily, those of extreme meritorious conduct or of great excellence are alone able to do this. Such persons, if they were courtiers, thereupon [during] their lifetime received great recompenses and [after] their death became [known as] exemplary subjects;17.6 17.6 Yen Shih-ku, in a note to HS 39: 13b, says of tsung-ch'en , "It means that they are those whom later generations honor and look up to." Chang Yen (iii cent. A.D.), in a note to 99 A: 21a, states, "A tsung subject has performed signal services and becomes a duke of the first class, whom the state takes as an exemplar ." This ancient usage justifies the translation of tsung in imperial temple names by the word "exemplar." Yi Yin in the Yin [dynasty] and the Duke 185WANG MANG 99 A: 17a, b of Chou in the Chou [dynasty] were such [persons]." A.D. 4 The common people who presented [similar] letters to the Emperor moreover [numbered] more than eight thousand persons. They all said, "Yi Yin became the Supporting Governor and the Duke of Chou became the Grand Ruler. The Duke of Chou enjoyed [the honor of] having his seven sons enfeoffed and had recompenses greater than the highest rank of the highest ministers. It is proper that [it should be done] as Ch'en Ch'ung has said." Their memorials were referred to the high officials, A New Title. and the high officials begged that [Wang Mang] be returned the two counties [of Shao-ling and Hsin-hsi, with which his enfeoffment] had previously been increased, [and which he had returned to the government], together with Huang-yu Village and the cultivated fields in Hsin-yeh [County, which he had previously held]; that there be selected [a term] from [each of] the titles of Yi Yin, [Supporting Governor], and the Duke of Chou, [Grand Ruler], so that the Duke should be given the title of Ruling Governor, with his rank in the highest rank of the highest ministers; his division head clerks should be ranked at six hundred piculs; the three highest ministers, 17b when speaking to him of [government] business, should say that they `presume to speak of it;'17.7 17.7 Parallel to the expression used to the emperor, "foolishly risking the commission of a crime worthy of death." Cf. HFHD, I, 99, n. 2; Ts'ai Yung's Tu-tuan, p. 5b. Yang Shu-ta quotes the Lun-heng as saying, "When [the officials of] commanderies speak of matters to the two yamens, they say, `We presume to speak of it.' " the various [lower] officials should not be permitted to have the same personal name as the Duke; when he goes out he should be followed by twenty Attendants at the Gates, thirty [members of] the Winged Forest, and that before and after him there should be ten great chariots. The Duke's Lady Dowager, [his mother], should be granted the title, the Baronetess of Apparent Merits, with the income of an estate of 186WANG MANG A.D. 4, June 1 two thousand households, a golden seal and a red 99 A: 17b 17b seal-ribbon; the Duke's two sons should be enfeoffed: 22a [Wang] An1a as Marquis in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu], (Pao-hsin), and [Wang] Lin1a as Marquis in Reward to [the Marquis of Hsin]-tu (Shang-tu); and thirty seven million [cash] should be added to the betrothal present of the Empress, [making it] altogether a hundred million [cash],17.8 17.8 Wang Mang had previously received 40 million cash (of which he gave 33 million to the families of Emperor P'ing's concubines), then he was additionally granted 23 million cash (99 A: 10a); now he was given 37 million more, making a total of 100 million cash. in order to glorify the great rites [of imperial marriage]. June 117.9 17.9 Cf. HS 99 A: 18a. The [Grand] Empress Dowager went to the Front He Refuses Most of the Honors. Hall [of the Palace] in person to enfeoff [the Duke and his sons]. The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty was first installed, and his two sons were later installed, as [had happened] in the former case of the Duke of Chou. [But Wang] Mang repeatedly bent his head to the ground, declining and asking that [these honors] be given to others. When he had gone out, he memorialized [the Empress Dowager] concerning these enfeoffments, [declaring that] he wished only to accept the title for his mother and [wished] to return the seals and [ceremonial] aprons of [Wang] An1a and [Wang] Lin1a, together with their titles, positions, and the households in their estates. The matter was referred to the Grand Master, [K'ung] Kuang, and others, who all said, "These rewards are not adequate for the achievements [of him to whom they have been given]. Humility, self-restraint, retiringness, and yielding are the constant moderation of the Duke. [His request] should not be eventually accepted." [Wang] Mang asked for an audience and firmly declined [these honors, so the Grand] Empress Dowager 187WANG MANG 99 A: 17b, 18a issued an imperial edict which said, "Every time A.D. 4, June 1 that the Duke has an audience, he kowtows with tears falling, as he firmly refuses [his honors]. Now he has sent [Us] a communication [informing Us] that he is ill. Should [We] indeed accede to his yielding so that [We] may order him to attend to his business? Or should [We] indeed put into effect his recompenses and send him home to his residence?"17.10 17.10 To "send a minister to his residence" meant dismissing him from his position and from the court. Evidently the Grand Empress Dowager had become tired of Wang Mang's posing. [K'ung] Kuang and the others replied, "[Wang] He is Not to be Allowed to Refuse Everything. An and [Wang] Lin1 have in person received their seals and aprons, their charters and titles, and it has been communicated to Heaven, so that the justice [of their appointments] is patent. The cultivated fields of Huang-yu, Shao-ling, and Hsin-yeh are extraordinarily great in their income. [Their disposal] altogether rests with the Duke. If the Duke wishes to diminish himself in order to bring about a [moral] transformation in the state, it is proper that [his request to yield up these fields] be approved and 22b acceded to, and it is to be expected that the [moral] transformation [which will bring about a condition of] good government and peace will accordingly be achieved in [due] time. "[But] the office of Ruling Governor cannot be attained by [his heirs in the next] generation, [so that he should not be permitted to refuse it]. The cash [used] in the betrothal presents17.11 17.11 The "presentation of the betrothal presents" was the fourth of the rites preliminary to a marriage; cf. n. 9.3. It made the betrothal binding. [of his daughter] was moreover to honor her as the [future] Empress, and not for the Duke's sake. The households [in 18a the estate] of the Baronetess of Apparent Merits will lapse with her [death] and not be transmitted [to her descendants]. The two estates of Pao-hsin and Shang-tu together [amount only to] three thousand 188WANG MANG A.D. 4, June households, which is indeed very little. [According 99 A: 18a to] the conduct of a loyal official, it is moreover 18a proper that he should humble his own [will] in order to show his fealty to his lord. "It would be proper to send the Grand Minister over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen Feng], with credentials, bearing your edict of decree that the Duke must quickly enter [the court] and attend to business, and give an edict to the Masters of Writing not again to receive a memorial from the Duke which yields up [his honors]." The memorial was approved. [Wang] June 1 Mang thereupon arose and attended to business. He presented a letter saying, "Your servant, as the 1 B.C. Marquis of Hsin-tuc, in [the year-period] YÃ¼an-shou, Aug. 15 the second year, the sixth month, on [the day] mou-wu, in a night of haste and confusion, as Marquis of Hsin-tuc, was led into the Wei-yang Palace. On Aug. 17 [the day] keng-shen, I was installed as Commander-in-chief and occupied the position of [one of] the three A.D. 1, highest ministers. In [the year-period] YÃ¼an-shih, Apr. 10. the first year, the second18.1 18.1 The text reads "first month," but Hoang does not list a ping-ch'en day in that month; HS 19 B: 51b reads "second month," which checks; I emend the text accordingly. Cf. also n. 6.2. month, on [the day] ping-ch'en, I was installed as Grand Tutor, granted the title of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, and merely acted as [one of] the Four Coadjutors. A.D. 4, In the present year, the fourth month, on June 1. [the day] chia-tzu, I was again installed as Ruling Governor, being ranked in the highest class of the He Reviews highest ministers. I, your servant Mang, myself think humbly that my noble rank is Marquis of 23a Hsin-tuc, my title is Duke Giving Tranquillity to the His Honors. Han Dynasty, my offices are those of Ruling Governor, Grand Tutor, and Commander-in-chief, so that 189WANG MANG 99 A: 18a, b my noble rank is [too] high, my title is [too] honor- A.D. 4, June able, and my offices are [too] weighty for a single person. That I should have received [these] five great favors, is indeed beyond your humble servant's merits. "Since in the third year of [the period] YÃ¼an-shih, A.D. 3. the empire had a good harvest, it is proper that those official subordinate positions which have been abolished should all be [now] reestablished. "The Ku-liang Commentary says, `The [Grand] He Requests a Seal of Office. Ruler of the Son of Heaven should be acquainted with [all within] the four seas.'18.2 18.2 Ku-liang Commentary 8: 2b; Dk. Hsi, IX, summer. Your servant stupidly considers that the office of Ruling Governor has for its duties the correcting of all the officials and the tranquillizing of [all] within [the four] seas. Yet it has no seal or sign, so that its name does not correspond to its reality. [Although] your servant Mang does not have the ability to [hold many] offices concurrently, since now you, the sage court, have through an error and mistake employed me, your servant begs that the Attendant Secretaries should have a seal engraved for the Ruling Governor with the inscription, `Ruling Governor, Grand Tutor, and Commander-in-chief,' 18b and, when the seal is completed, 18b transmit it to your servant Mang, who will [then] return the seals of the Grand Tutor and of the Commander-in-chief." The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "It is approved. His [ceremonial] apron18.3 18.3 For the apron (fu1 ) as an article of ceremonial attire, cf. 99 A: n. 2.8. Wang Mang seems to have first made it part of a noble's or official's insignia of office, for it is first mentioned in the reign of Emperor P'ing. Its use was in imitation of classical practisesâit is mentioned in Li-chi, XI, ii, 21-27 and XII, 29 (Legge, II, 14-16, 38; Couvreur, I, 700-702, 740). Cf. also Po-hu-t'ung 10: 1a, b. Yen Shih-ku, both here and in his notes to 14: 4b, 99 B: 1a, and 99 C: 5b, glosses, "The fu1 is also called a tsu ," which latter article was the cord by which seals were suspended from the wearer's girdle. The use of fu1 with the word for seal (e.g. 99 B: 23a) makes this interpretation plausible. The word fu1 was moreover interchanged with fu2 , which latter word later denoted the seal-ribbon. This interchange between fu1 and fu2 has probably misled Yen Shih-ku. Ch'en Hsiang-tao (1053-1093), in his Li-shu 23: 6b, states that from the Wei and Chin periods (iii cent. A.D.) onwards, the fu1, instead of being made of leather, was made of silk gauze, hence the word was sometimes written fu2 (with the silk radical. Such may have been the case already in Pan Ku's time; cf. 99 B: n. 1.1). As a result, people would be likely to confuse fu1 and fu2 and think mistakenly that the fu1 denoted a seal-ribbonâ which statement was evidently current in T'ang times and is to be found in the dictionaries today. But Ch'en Hsiang-tao takes his information, according to a note, from HsÃ¼ Kuang's (ca. 352-425) "Rites and Institutes Concerning Carriages and Robes " (probably the same as his , listed in the Sui-shu bibliography 2: 14a, the Old T'ang-shu bibliography 1: 34b, and the New T'ang-shu bibliography 2: 21b; the book is now lost), so that this information dates from two centuries before the time of Yen Shih-ku. Until Wang Mang came into power, the term used along with the word for seal in shou , seal-ribbon (8: 22b, 12: 1a, 99 A: 4a). During the time Wang Mang controlled the government, the fu1 is however occasionally mentioned along with the seal as the insignia of noble or bureaucratic rank (14: 4b, 99 A: 18b, 22b, 26b; 99 B: 1a, 23a). In Wang Mang's time, the term shou also on occasions accompanies the word for seal (98: 13b, 99 B: 11a, 12b, 18a; 99 C: 27b). The Later Han dynasty also used the shou (HHS, Tr. 30: 13b-15a). The fu1 (apron) was the first of the nine distinctions (99 A: 22b), so that it was only natural for Wang Mang to have used it as one of his insignia for a high office. Such an article of attire was plainly convenient at a court where the kowtow was common. The fu1 is mentioned under circumstances in which it can only mean "apron" (99 B: 22b, 26b); it would be very strange to have the same word used to denote two very different articles of apparel without any explanation on the part of the author. Yen Shih-ku's change in the meaning of fu1 is unacceptable. shall be like that of the Chancellor of State. We will Ourself attend [court] to transmit it to him." 190WANG MANG A.D. 4, June A Great Gift. [Wang] Mang thereupon again took ten million 99 A: 18b cash of what had been added to the betrothal present [for his daughter] and left it with the Chief Chamberlain at the Ch'ang-lo [Palace], who had charge of providing for [the Grand Empress Dowager]. 23b The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun4b, memorialized, saying, "The empire has heard that the Duke would not accept a territory [that would furnish] a thousand chariots, has refused a present of [the equivalent of] ten thousand [catties of] gold,18.4 18.4 A catty of gold was equivalent to ten thousand cash; ten thousand catties of gold were then equivalent to a hundred million cash. This was the amount of the dowry; cf. 99 A: 17b. has 191WANG MANG 99 A: 18b distributed his wealth and has given it away by the A.D. 4 ten-millions, so that no one fails to reform himself. A man of Shu Commandery, Lu Chien, and others have stopped their litigation, blushing for shame, and retired. Although King Wen [of the Chou dynasty caused the rulers of the states of] YÃ¼2a and Jui to cease [their quarrels],18.5 18.5 For this story, cf. Glossary, sub YÃ¼2a. how could it be more than [what Wang Mang has accomplished]? It would be proper to inform the empire [of the foregoing facts]." The memorial was approved. When the Ruling Governor, [Wang Mang], went His Train. out, he was both preceded and followed by ten large chariots, with a Specially Serving Master of Writing, Gentlemen, Attending Secretaries, Internuncios, Palace Attendants Within the Yellow Gate, Attendants at the Gates, and [members of] the Winged Forest. The Ruling Governor regularily bore his credentials. When he stopped [anywhere], an Internuncio held them for him. The division head clerks of the Ruling Governor were ranked at six hundred piculs. The three highest ministers, [in speaking to him] said He Enlarges the that they "presumed to speak of [their business]."18.6 18.6 Liu Pin (1022-1088) remarks that this last sentence is repeated from 99 A: 17b, and declares that it should be excised here; but this whole paragraph seems to be a summary of the ritual, etc. connected with the office of Ruling Governor in the spirit of HS, ch. 19 A, in which case this sentence is pertinent here. In this year, [Wang] Mang memorialized [the plans for] and built a Ming-t'ang, a Pi-yung, and a 19a Spiritual Tower, and for the students [in the Imperial Imperial University. University] he erected ten thousand houses and had made a Market and a Regularly Full Granary.18.7 18.7 Li T'zu-ming, op. cit., 7: 15a, states that the Ch'u-hsÃ¼eh Chi (viii cent.; I cannot find this passage) quotes the San-fu Huang-t'u (iii to vii cent.) as saying that in 4 A.D. Wang Mang "built the Ming-t'ang, Pi-yung, made 30 residences for the Erudits, and made a market-place for meeting," and also, "Seven li east of the city he made a Regularly Full Granary. North of the Granary he made the Huai Market-place. The various Huai trees were in several hundred rows and the students would meet and hold market [there] on the first and fifteenth days of the month." This passage is not now in the San-fu Huang-t'u, which has suffered losses. Cf. Glossary sub Imperial University. Li T'zu-ming accordingly says that in the HS text, before the word there has dropped out the word , reading, "a market-place for meeting." 192WANG MANG A.D. 4 19a His institutions were very grand. He established 99 A: 19a the Classic of Music19.1 19.1 This Classic of Music has been lost. Wang Ch'un, in his Lun-heng 13: 16a, 29: 9b (Forke, II, 297, I, 88) says twice, "Yang-ch'eng [Heng] Tzu-chang composed the Classic of Music." Huan T'an (ca. 40 B.C.-A.D. 29), in his Hsin-lun (lost, quoted in T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 815: 11b), says, "Yang-ch'eng Tzu-chang's personal name was Heng and he was a man from Shu Commandery. When Wang Weng and I were both Libationers Expounding the Classic of Music and [Yang-ch'eng Heng] was in bed ill, we purchased ahead of time inner and outer coffins [for him]." Wang Weng took part in the rebellion of Chai Yi and was burnt to death by Wang Mang in A.D. 7 (cf. HHS, Mem. 35: 10b); the Libationers were not however appointed until A.D. 11 (HS 99 B: 18a), so that Huan T'an's memory must have been at fault about his title at that time. Yang-ch'eng Heng's death then probably occurred some time during Wang Mang's reign. The T'ung-chih, ch. 29 (Com. Pr. ed.), p. 479c, sub double surnames quotes the Feng-su-t'ung as stating that in Han times there was a Grandee Remonstrant and Consultant, excellency Yang-ch'eng Heng. The Classic of Music established as canonical by Wang Mang was then written by Yang-ch'eng Heng and this is probably the one mentioned in the Chin History. (From Ma Kuo-han's [fl. 1832-1852] "Introduction" to the Yo-ching in his "YÃ¼-han Shan-fang Chi-yi-shu"). Sui-shu ch. 32, "Treatise on the Classics and Literature" 1: 21a, lists a "Classic of Music in four rolls." But this book is not mentioned in later bibliographies. What the relation was of this book to the "Yo-chi (Record of Music)," now ch. 17 in the Book of Rites, is unknown. Cf. Szu-k'u Ch'Ã¼an-shu Tsung-mu T'i-yao 38: 1a (Com. Pr. ed. p. 789). [as an imperially approved classic], and increased the regular number of the 24a Erudits, having five for each Classic. He summoned those from the empire who were versed in one classic and were teaching eleven persons or more,19.2 19.2 HS 12: 9b dates this summons in A.D. 5; probably that date represents the time these persons mostly arrived. together with those who possessed the lost [chapters of] the Rites, the ancient [text of] the Book of History,19.3 19.3 "The lost [chapters of] the Rites" denotes the 39 fascicles (chapters) of the Book of Rites in ancient characters said by Liu Hsin1a to have been found by King Kung of Lu, Liu YÃ¼2 (d. 129 B.C.), in the wall of Confucius' house and presented to the imperial throne by K'ung An-kuo after 100 B.C. (HS 36: 33a). These chapters were not the Chou-li (mentioned separately), which is said to have been secured about the same time by King Hsien of Ho-chien, Liu TÃª (HS 53: 1b). "The ancient [text of] the Book of History" denotes the 16 fascicles (chapters) of that Book in ancient characters, said by Liu Hsin1a to have been found along with the lost Rites and also to have been presented to the throne by K'ung An-kuo (HS 36: 33a). HS 36: 31b states that Liu Hsin1a "wanted to have made authoritative Mr. Tso's [Commentary on] the Spring and Autumn [i.e., the Tso-chuan], the Mao [text of the Book of] Odes, the lost [chapters of] the Rites, and the ancient [text of the Book of] History." Hence this order of Wang Mang was instigated by Liu Hsin and constituted a step towards making these classics authoritative, i.e., placed on the curriculum of the government schools and used for government examinations. 193WANG MANG 99 A: 19a the Mao [text of] the Book of Odes, the Chou Offices A.D. 4 He Gathers the Learned and Establishes New Classics. [the Chou-li],19.4 19.4 The "Mao [text of the Book of] Odes" is the one at present current. It was made authoritative by Wang Mang during the reign of Emperor P'ing (Legge, Chin. Clas. IV, I, p. 11]). Liu Hsin1a also worked on the Chou-li and eventually Wang Mang made it authoritative. During the reign of Wang Mang, all the books here listed, from the lost Book of Rites to the Erh-ya, were probably made authoritative. the Erh-ya, [books on] astronomy, divinations and revelations, the musical tubes, the "Ordinances for the Months,"19.5 19.5 "Ordinances for the Months, YÃ¼eh-ling " is the title of the present chap. IV in the Li-chi (Legge, I, pp. 249-310; Couvreur, I, 330-410), which chapter consists of excerpts from chaps. I-XII of the LÃ¼-shih Ch'un-ch'iu (Wilhelm's trans. pp. 1-156). Besides this document, there were probably other writings on this popular subject. military methods,19.6 19.6 "The Art of War, Ping-fa ," is the title of the military treatise attributed to Sun-tzu and translated by L. Giles, Sun Tzu on the Art of War. Giles (p. xvii) however points out that the title, "Sun-tzu in 82 fascicles, with diagrams in 9 rolls" listed in HS 30: 59a, shows that in Han times there were other apocryphal works on this subject, not included in the 13 books of Sun-tzu that we have at present. Wang Mang's call was probably for more than just this one book, for in 99 C: 21b he is said to have employed military men of all the 63 schools mentioned in HS 30: 64a (cf. 99 C: n. 21.3). The Han dynasty had its own military methods , set forth by Han Hsin (HS 1 B: 24b; HFHD, I, 146 &amp; n. 4). Wang Mang seems to have intended to accumulate the country's learning at the imperial capital and use it for the imperial benefit. the written characters in Shih [Chou's] Fascicles,19.7 19.7 Shih Chou's Fascicles was the earliest Chinese lexicographical work. It seems to have been a word list of correct forms; cf. D. Bodde, China's First Unifier, ch. VIII. This book is listed in HS 30: 22b. Ibid, 26a, b says, "In [the period] YÃ¼an-shih, [Wang Mang] summoned from the [whole] empire those who were versed in philology. [They arrived] by the hundreds, and each one was ordered to record words in the [Palace] courts. Yang Hsiung2 took those [writings] that were of use and composed from them his HsÃ¼n-tsuan P'ien . He followed the Tsang Chieh and also altered the duplicating words in the Tsang Chieh. It was in 89 paragraphs." and who were versed in and understood 194WANG MANG A.D. 4 their meaning. All went to the [office of the Major 99 A: 19a in Charge of] Official Carriages, [so that Wang Mang] ensnared and collected [all] the gentlemen of uncommon ability in the empire. Those who came, at former and later [times], were numbered by the thousands. All were ordered to write out their explanations [of the Classics] in his courts, with the intention of making them correct their discrepancies and errors and unify differing explanations. Various courtiers memorialized, saying, "Anciently, when the Duke of Chou upheld the heir who succeeded his father, although he possessed the honor of being in the highest rank of the highest ministers, yet only in the seventh year were the institutions fixed.19.8 19.8 A reference to Li-chi XII, 7 (Legge, II, 31), where the Duke of Chou is said to have resigned in the seventh year. Cf. infra, n. 20.1. Verily, the Ming-t'ang and Pi-yung have fallen into ruins and have been abolished for a thousand years and no one has been able to revive them. Now the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty has arisen from a great family and has assisted and protected your Majesty for four years down to the present. His achievements and virtuous conduct are brilliant. "The Duke, in the eighth month, when the moon Sept. 5 began to wax, on [the day] keng-tzu,19.9 19.9 Wang Mang's action in laying the foundations "when the moon began to wax" was in imitation of the foundation of the city of Lo by the Duke of Chou. The phrase, "when the moon began to wax, tsai1-sheng-p'o2 " is a quotation from the account of that foundation in Book of History, V, ix, 1 (Legge, p. 381). (That Book writes tsai2 for tsai1. These words were interchangeable; so were p'o1 and p'o2.) The meaning of the phrase, tsai-sheng-p'o, seems to have suffered a complete reversal due to an inexact writing of the word p'o. The correct word was p'o1 . HsÃ¼ Sheng, in his Shuo-wen 7 A: 4a, defines p'o1 as follows: "When the moon is first born, it is like a p'o1 (new moon). When [in the calendar, we receive] a long month, [the p'o1] is on the second day [of the month; when we] receive a short month, it is on the third day." (In China, months have begun with the new moon, or, more exactly, the day of the moon's conjunction with the sun, when the moon is invisible). Since p'o1 is written with the word for "moon," this is probably the fundamental meaning of the character. Shuo-wen 9 A: 7a defines p'o2 quite differently, as "A yin spirit." Since tsai1 (and tsai2) means "beginning," tsai-sheng-p'o then originally meant "When the new moon appears," and denoted the second or third day of the (lunar) month. This interpretation is confirmed by Li-chi XLII, i, 4 (Legge, II, 436; Couvreur, II, 655), "Like the third day of the moon, when it produces its p'o (new moon), ," and ibid. 20 (Legge, II, 445; Couvreur II, 667), "The moon, when it is in the third day [of the month] produces its p'o ." In a note to the above passage from the Book of History, ("Shih-san Ching Chu-su," Shu-ching 14: 1b), Ma Jung (79-166) moreover glosses, "P'o2 is the new moon . It means that in the third day [of the month] the moon first brings to birth the form of its new moon and its name is called p'o2." Wang Mang used this interpretation, for this date was the second day of a short month, according to Hoang. (Chen YÃ¼an's Comparative Daily Calendar is probably in error, for it makes this date the first day of the month). This meaning of p'o seems to have suffered reversal because it was the ancient practise to interchange many words with their homonyms. Thus p'o1 came to be written p'o2, with the resultant interpretation of p'o2 (which ordinarily means the vital principle of the body, the material soul) to mean "the substance of the moon ," i.e. the unilluminated part of the moon, which appears when the moon begins to wane. Hence tsai-sheng-p'o came to mean, "when the dark part of the moon is first born," i.e., a day after full moon, the sixteenth day of the month and after. This interpretation appears in the K'ung An-kuo gloss to the above passage in the Book of History, ibid., "The Duke of Chou established his government in the seventh year, third month, when the p'o (dark part of the moon) was first born, on the sixteenth day of the [lunar] month, when the full moon was waning and the dark part of the moon (p'o) was born." To justify his chronological calculations, Liu Hsin1a adopted this interpretation; HS 21 B: 60b quotes his San-t'ung-li as follows: "When the dark of the moon (p'o) dies, it is the day of new moon; when the dark of the moon (p'o) is born, it is the day of full moon. ." Meng K'ang, in a note to HS 21 B: 60a, interprets likewise, "In the second day of the month and onwards, the moon is born and its dark (p'o) dies." K'ung Ying-ta consequently took this interpretation of p'o. In a note to Book of History V, iii, 3 (Ibid. 11: 11b), he explains, "The places in which the circle of the moon have no light are called p'o. After the day of new moon, its ming (its brilliance or spiritual substance) is born and its p'o (its dark or material substance) dies. After the day of full moon, its ming dies and its p'o is born." Here is the pretty conceit that the moon has two souls, like man, which die and are born as the moon waxes and wanes. This interpretation was adopted by Legge (cf. his Book of History, p. 307) and Couvreur (Dict. Class., III ed. sub p'o2), so that it influences their translations of the classics, sometimes with curious consequences. It is interesting that in this case Wang Mang's courtiers deliberately departed from the interpretation given to a passage of the classic by his greatest authority, Liu Hsin1a. Wang Mang's court contained other authorities who disagreed with Liu Hsin, and these scholars preserved the correct interpretation of p'o. (Cf. T'zu-hai, sub p'o1, p'o2, tsai2- sheng-p'o; Wang Kuo-wei, Kuan-t'ang-chi-lin, I:1a-5b.) received the 195WANG MANG 99 A: 19a A.D. 4 196WANG MANG A.D. 4 19b message [authorizing him to] employ [people] for 99 A: 19b the purposes of the court,19.10 19.10 Meng K'ang (fl. 220-240) explains, "It is the message taxing [the people] for corvÃ©e service ." and he himself attended to the required service and the work of construction. 24b And on the next day, [the day] hsin-ch'ou, the various Sept. 6 masters and common people assembled in great harmony; a great crowd of a hundred thousand [persons] joined together, working with vigor19.11 19.11 Yen Shih-ku suggests that p'ing might be emended to p'ei . Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) quotes Book of History, V, xii, 7, (Legge, p. 424) which contains the phrase p'ei-tso , to substantiate this emendation. Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) adds that this passage imitates Book of History, V, xiii, which uses the unusual word p'ei twice, and calls attention to the fact that, in the ancient official form of writing, p'ing and p'ei were written similarly and were sometimes confused. for twenty [days], when the great work was all completed. 19b When T'ang [Yao] and YÃ¼ [Shun] did [great] things or when at Ch'eng-chou [the Duke of Chou] founded the dynasty's [capital], they verily did no better. "It is proper that the rank of the Ruling Governor should be above that of the vassal kings, that he should be granted bundles of silk to which are affixed jade circlets, one chariot of state [like that for] a large kingdom, one comfortable carriage, and two quadrigae of black horses." The imperial edict said, "It is approved. Let rules for the nine distinctions be discussed." Winter In the winter, a great wind blew off almost all the roof-tiles on [the buildings at] the eastern gates of the city wall of Ch'ang-an.19.12 19.12 This sentence is also found in 12: 8b. The next sentence is also found in that passage, q.v. for annotations. A.D. 5, In the fifth year, in the first month, the hsia ancestral Jan./Fab. sacrifice to all the ancestors together was performed in the Ming-t'ang; twenty-eight vassal kings, one hundred twenty full marquises, and more than nine hundred scions of the imperial house were 197WANG MANG 99 A: 19b, 20a summoned to assist in the sacrifices.19.13 19.13 The Sung Ch'i ed. said that the Shun-hua ed. (997) had the word szu after the . In a loose quotation of this passage in HHS, Mem. 4: 10a1, the szu is omitted. Stange, Die Monographie Ã¼ber Wang Mang, 62, n. 9, declares that Wang Hsien-ch'ien's ed. reads erroneously "1900 members of the imperial house." My copy (purchased at Ch'ang-sha, hence probably the original ed.) does not have this error. It likewise does not have the variant noticed in ibid., 63, n. 1. After the A.D. 5 He Distributes Honors to the Imperial Clan. rites were ended, thirty-six great-grandsons of [Emperor] Hsiao-hsÃ¼an, [Liu] Hsin4g and others, were enfeoffed as full marquises.19.14 19.14 HS 12: 2b dates this enfeoffment in Mar., A.D. 1. Cf. 12: n. 2.5. The other [persons who assisted in the sacrifices] all had households added [to their estates] or were granted noble ranks and rewards of money and silk, to each a definite amount. At this time, because [Wang] Mang had not accepted The People Memorialize that he the cultivated fields of Hsin-yeh, the officials and common people who sent letters to the Emperor, [including] previous and later [times, numbered] 487,572 persons. Moreover, the vassal kings, the 25a highest ministers, the full marquises, and [the members should be Rewarded. of] the imperial house, when they had audience, all kowtowed, saying that it would be proper immediately to give rewards to the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. Thereupon [Wang] Mang presented a letter to 20a the throne, saying, "Because I, your servant, am your He will Rule Like the Duke of Chou, Aided by the Others in the Government. maternal relative, I have overleaped my [due] sequence and occupy my [present] post, [but] I have not yet been able to be worthy of my position. I humbly reflect that your sage virtue is pure and abundant, you have received [the mandate] of Heaven and have followed ancient [practises], you have instituted rites in order to govern the common people, and you have composed music20.1 20.1 The phrase "instituting rites and composing music " is an allusion to the activity of the Duke of Chou, who, when he was acting as regent for the young King Ch'eng, is said to have "instituted rites and composed music" (Li-chi XII, 6; Legge's trans. II, 31). On 99 A: 19a, the courtiers, in a memorial, compare Wang Mang to the Duke of Chou and allude to this passage from the Book of Rites, saying that the Duke of Chou fixed "his institutions" to the seventh year; on p. 20a, Wang Mang takes up this phrase, stating that the Empress Dowager has "instituted rites . . . and . . . composed music" (through his own instrumentality, of course), and now (p. 20b) he declares that he wishes to use his whole time in "instituting rites and composing music," i.e., in ruling in behalf of the young emperor and, in establishing truly Confucian institutes and government, and, when this task is complete, like the Duke of Chou, he will return to private life. The phrase "instituting rites and composing music" thus implied "ruling for the minor sovereign in the spirit of the Duke of Chou." It occurs frequently in subsequent passages. Since the Duke of Chou was one of the greatest Confucian sages, these rites and music were of course understood to designate Confucian practises. in order to 198WANG MANG A.D. 5 improve their customs, so that [all within] the four 99 A: 20a seas have run and hastened to obey you, [even] the many barbarians have all come to you, and on the days when they had to take leave and go, none have 20a failed to drop tears. If they had not been sincere, how could this [situation] have been gratuitously brought about? "From the vassal kings on down to the lower officials and common people, all know that your servant Mang on the one hand and your Majesty on the other are related as closely as the pellicle inside a reed is to the reed. Moreover, [now] that I have been permitted to exercise an [important] charge, those who attribute merits and rank virtuous conduct always have some superfluous words about me, your servant Mang, so that when I, your servant, have an audience and the nobles of the imperial house themselves speak of business before me, I never fail to break out in perspiration and be mortified. Although my nature is stupid and rustic, I myself know most sincerely that while my virtue is small and my position honorable, my strength is too little and my duties are too great. Day and night I am fearful and circumspect, continually being afraid that 25b I will sully and disgrace your sage court. "Now the empire is well-governed and at peace, the [people's] customs are uniform, the many barbarians 199WANG MANG 99 A: 20a, b obey and have submitted, all of which A.D. 5 [comes] from your Majesty's sage virtue and what you yourself [have done]. The Grand Master, [K'ung] Kuang, and the Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun4b, and others assist you in the government and aid in ruling. None of the various ministers and grandees have failed to be sincere and good, hence it has been possible, in the time of five years, to attain this extreme achievement. "I, your servant Mang, have really had no wonderful plans or extraordinary projects. When I have received the sage edicts of the [Grand] Empress Dowager and have promulgated them to your subjects, I have not been able to attain one-tenth [of the sageness contained therein]; when I received plans from various capable [persons] and reported them to the throne, I have not been able to attain five-tenths [of the virtue contained therein], so that I ought to suffer for the crime of being of no benefit [to the empire]. The reason that I temporarily presume to protect my head and neck for the moment is in reality because on the one hand I have reposed upon your Majesty's superabundant glory and [because] on the other hand I have relied upon my old friends, the highest ministers. "Your Majesty could not bear [to refuse] the 20b words of the crowd, so their writings were each time referred to [the officials] for discussion. Your servant 20b Mang previously sought immediately to memorialize and stop [their proposals], but I feared that you thereupon would not be willing to stop the matter. "Now that the great rites have already been performed and the assistants at the sacrifices have all left, I cannot repress my greatest wish. It is my wish that the various writings which have been referred to those who are to discuss [these matters] should all be laid aside and not reported to the throne, [thereby] causing your servant Mang to be 200WANG MANG A.D. 5 able to use all his efforts in completing the business 99 A: 20b 26a of instituting [Confucian] rites and composing [Confucian] music.20.1 20.1 The phrase "instituting rites and composing music " is an allusion to the activity of the Duke of Chou, who, when he was acting as regent for the young King Ch'eng, is said to have "instituted rites and composed music" (Li-chi XII, 6; Legge's trans. II, 31). On 99 A: 19a, the courtiers, in a memorial, compare Wang Mang to the Duke of Chou and allude to this passage from the Book of Rites, saying that the Duke of Chou fixed "his institutions" to the seventh year; on p. 20a, Wang Mang takes up this phrase, stating that the Empress Dowager has "instituted rites . . . and . . . composed music" (through his own instrumentality, of course), and now (p. 20b) he declares that he wishes to use his whole time in "instituting rites and composing music," i.e., in ruling in behalf of the young emperor and, in establishing truly Confucian institutes and government, and, when this task is complete, like the Duke of Chou, he will return to private life. The phrase "instituting rites and composing music" thus implied "ruling for the minor sovereign in the spirit of the Duke of Chou." It occurs frequently in subsequent passages. Since the Duke of Chou was one of the greatest Confucian sages, these rites and music were of course understood to designate Confucian practises. When these matters are completed, I will then transmit and show them to the empire and give them to [all] within the [four] seas to criticize. Supposing that they contain anything traitorous20.2 20.2 For this meaning of chien, cf. SC 29: 7 and Mh III, 5243. or evil, your servant Mang ought accordingly to suffer for the crime of having misled the Emperor and of having deceived the court. If I do not undergo any other impeachments, to be permitted to preserve my life, to be granted to ransom my person and return home, and to make way for a worthier person will be the private wish of your servant. I only hope that your Majesty would have compassion and pity and favor me somewhat."20.3 20.3 Yen Shih-ku asserts that ts'ai1 is the same as "ts'ai2 , to select," but Wang Nien-sun, in a note to HS 48: 34a, states that this interpretation does not fit the phrase ts'ai1-hsing . He declares that ts'ai means "shao , somewhat," and that the meaning of this phrase is similar to the expression in 48: 35a10, "I wish that your Majesty would pay some attention to it ." He also quotes similar cases of the phrase ts'ai-hsing from HS 77: 5b7 sub Chu-ko Feng, ch. 93, ch. 49 sub Ch'ao Ts'o (thrice), 72: 6b10 sub Wang Chi, ch. 59 sub Chang An-shih, 75: 31a3 sub Li HsÃ¼n, and 86: 19b4 sub Shih1 Tan. In a note to 54: 14a11, Yen Shih-ku, seemingly following an ancient comment, declares that ts'ai means "chin4 , somewhat"; the Kuang-ya interprets chin3 as shao; these two words chin are interchanged. In a note to HS 4: 9b (cf. HFHD I, 242, n. 4) Yen Shih-ku himself asserts that ts'ai means shao. Cf. also HFHD II, 387, n. 6.4. Ts'ai1, ts'ai2, and ts'ai3 are given the same archaic pronunciation in Karlgren, Grammatica Serica, #943 h, ?, a, and were interchanged with ts'ai4 , which latter character seems not to have occurred in Chou literature, but is used in HS 49: 13b11 and 51: 5b4. Chen Han and others advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict saying, "It is permitted. Verily, Duke, your achievements and virtuous conduct are [the most] brilliant in the empire. For this reason the vassal kings, the highest ministers, the full marquises, [the members of] the imperial house, the various masters, the lower officials, and the common people were of one accord and 201WANG MANG 99 A: 20, 21 said the same things. They continually waited at A.D. 5 the gate towers and the great court, hence their writings were referred [by the throne to the proper officials]. On the day when the nobles and the members of the imperial house took their leave and left, they again presented their previously emphasized proposals.20.4 20.4 The Sung Ch'i ed. said that the word chung should be changed to come after the , following the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.). Since the Ching-yu ed. agrees with the present text, I have not adopted the YÃ¼eh ed.'s emendation. Yen Shih-ku reads chung with the present fourth tone, meaning "emphasis". Although they were plainly instructed to be dismissed and sent off, [yet they acted] as if they were unwilling to leave. When [we] informed them that in the first month of summer your rewards would be put into effect, no one failed to rejoice and be pleased. They called out, `Long life,' and left. "Now every time that you, Duke, have an audience, you always drop tears and kowtow, saying that you wish not to receive a reward and that if a reward is given you, you will not presume to occupy your position. Just now [the rites and music] that are being instituted and composed have not yet been fixed upon, so that those matters need you, Duke, to decide upon them, hence for the time being [We] accede to you, Duke. When what is being instituted and composed is all completed, the highest ministers 26b will report it and investigate into the previous proposal [of the nobles, etc.]. Let the ceremonial for 21a the nine distinctions be promptly memorialized [to Us]." Thereupon the ministers, grandees, erudits, gentlement-consultants, 21a and the full marquis,21.1 21.1 At this point, the text contains the words for "the Marquis of Fu-p'ing," necessitating the translation, "erudits, gentlemen-consultants, full marquises, and the Marquis of Fu-p'ing, Chang Shun." The Sung Ch'i ed. however reports that the YÃ¼eh ed. lacks the words for "the Marquis of Fu-p'ing," and the Ching-yu ed. also lacks them. I have followed their reading. It is quite peculiar that one grade of the nobility should be specifically mentioned as all being concerned in a Confucian ritual, along with the erudits and learned persons at the court. The insertion of Chang Shun's marquisate was almost surely a scribal interpolation. Chang 202WANG MANG A.D. 5 The Nine Distinctions to be Conferred Upon him. Shun, and others, nine hundred two persons [alto- 99 A: 21a gether], all said, "When the sage lords and glorious kings beckoned to the capable and urged the able [to come to them], those whose virtuous conduct was abundant [were given] high positions and those whose achievements were great [were given] rich rewards. Hence when an exemplary subject possessed the honor of being a `high duke with the nine conferments,'21.2 21.2 For these conferments, cf. Li-chi III, ii, 8 (Legge, I, 215; Couvreur, I, 273), Book of History V, viii, 4 (Legge, 379). The phrase, "a high duke (shang-kung) with the nine conferments" is quoted from Chou-li 21: 1a (Biot, II, 1). The conferments (ming ) as rewards given by the Son of Heaven are seemingly first mentioned in Book of Odes, II, vii, viii, 3; Legge, p. 403. Chou-li 18: 10b-12b (Biot, I, 428-430), sub the Ta-tsung-po, says, "He uses the conferments in the nine rituals to correct the rankings of states. The first conferment is investiture with office, the second conferment is investiture with robes, the third conferment is investiture with rank, the fourth conferment is investiture with [sacrificial] utensils, the fifth conferment is the granting of a tsÃª (cf. 99 B: n. 19.5), the sixth conferment is the granting of [subordinate] officials, the seventh conferment is granting him a [noble] estate, the eighth conferment is making him a Shepherd (mu), and the ninth conferment is making him a Chief (po) [of a quarter of the country]." Chang Yen (iii cent. A.D.) says, "The nine conferments (ming) are the nine distinctions (hsi )." In the Spring and Autumn, Dk. Chuang, I, 6; Dk. Wen, I, 5; Dk. Ch'eng, VIII, 7 (Legge, pp. 72, 227, 229, 366), hsi is used as a verb, "to impart," in the phrase, "impart (hsi) the conferments (ming)." But in the HS text here both hsi and ming are used as nouns. Very likely in Wang Mang's time ming denoted the nine "conferments" mentioned in the Chou-li passage quoted above, whereas hsi denoted the "distinctions" enumerated in n. 23.3. Chou-li 21: 1a (Biot, II, 1), sub the Tien-ming (Officer in Charge of the Conferments) says "High Dukes (shang-kung ) have the nine conferments (ming) and become Chiefs [of quarters of the country]. Their states and households (kuo-chia ), their palaces and residences, their chariots and banners, their garments and robes, and their rites and usages all use nine as the limit. Marquises and earls have seven conferments. Their states and households (kuo-chia), their palaces and residences, their chariots and banners, their garments and robes, and their rites and usages all use seven as the limit. Viscounts and barons have five conferments. Their states and households (kuo-chia), their palaces and residences, their chariots and banners, their garments and robes, and their rites and usages all use five as the limit." Cheng HsÃ¼an explains (not too accurately), "The high dukes (shang-kung) are the three highest ministers (san-kung ) of the king, [who have only eight conferments; cf. n. 21.3]. To those who possess virtue, there is added a conferment and they become the two Chiefs (po). The descendants of the two dynasties, [Hsia and Yin], were also high dukes (shang-kung)." In Wang Mang's time the Shang-kung were the Four Coadjutors, who ranked above the San-kung. In Chou times, office was hereditary, so that the highest ministers were nobles; whereas in Han times such feudalism had disappeared and kung no longer always denoted a noble. Cheng HsÃ¼an continues, "Their state and households (kuo-chia) is where the prince and his followers dwell . It means the square which is their [capital] city. The [capital] city of a duke was probably nine li square and his palace was nine hundred paces square. The [capital] city of a marquis or earl was probably seven li square and his palace seven hundred paces square. The [capital] city of a viscount or baron was probably five li square, and his palace five hundred paces square." This scholastic architectonic does not, of course, represent the facts of history. he [also] possessed the favor of having 203WANG MANG 99 A: 21a been promoted `[an additional] step,'21.3 21.3 Chou-li 21: 2a (Biot, II, 2) says, "The three highest ministers (san-kung) have eight conferments. . . . When they are sent out [of the court] and enfeoffed [as feudal nobles with fiefs, going to rule them], one [more] step [in conferments] is added." This passage is referred to in the phrase, "promoted [an additional] step." with A.D. 5 the nine distinctions. "Now `the nine [classes of the imperial] kindred are affectionately harmonius' and `the official class' is already `honored,' `the myriad states' are `harmonized and united,' and `the many people have then become harmonious.'21.4 21.4 This sentence uses phrases from the Book of History, I, 2 (Legge, p. 17; translated in HFHD II, 215, n. 7.6), which passage describes the virtue of Yao. In this passage of the HS, as in the Book of History, po-hsing means "official class," cf. n. 6.13. The word pang in the Book of History, which was Emperor Kao's given name, is tabooed here and kuo is used instead. Pang was not however always tabooed. It is used in the Shuo-wen (A.D. 100). The auspicious presages of sageness have all arrived and the great peace has become universal. Of the greatest lords, none were greater than T'ang [Yao] and YÃ¼ [Shun], yet your Majesty is worthy [of occupying their positions]. Of loyal ministers who had abundant achievements, none were more outstanding than Yi [Yin and the Duke of] Chou, yet the Ruling Governor, [Wang Mang], is equal to them. It is what might be called a revival [of ancient glories] at a different time, `[and is as similar to those great days] as the matching of [the two halves] of a tally.'21.5 21.5 A quotation from Mencius IV, ii, i, 3 (Legge, p. 317). 204WANG MANG A.D. 5, June 22 "We have carefully taken the universal principles 99A: 21a, b of the six canons and what is found in the text of the Classics, [especially] in the Chou Offices and the Record of Proprieties (Li-chi), and is suitable to the present [time], and have made the distinctions for the nine 27a conferments. Your servants beg [your approval of] the distinctions for the conferments." The memorial was approved. A.D. 5, [Wang Mang's] charter said, "Verily, in the fifth June 22. year of [the period] YÃ¼an-shih, the fifth month, on His Charter. [the day] keng-yin, the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] came to the Front Hall [of the Palace, had Wang Mang] conducted and [ordered to] mount [the steps to the throne], and in person21.6 21.6 Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1832) declares that should be . The Ching-yu ed. and the Official ed. read the latter word. Wang Hsien-ch'ien says however that the Southern Academy ed. reads as he does. commanded him by this imperial edict, which said, " `Let the Duke approach, empty himself,21.7 21.7 The connotation of "empty oneself (hsÃ¼-chi )," a phrase frequently used in imperial charters to officials (cf. HFHD I, 334), is "pay close attention." The Tz'u-hai, sub this phrase, quotes the Han-shih Wai-chuan (by Han Ying, fl. 179-141 B.C.; I have not been able to find this passage), "A superior man who has the highest degree of virtue is yet humble, [so that] he will empty himself and receive [the instructions of] others." and 21b 21b listen to Our words. Previously you, Duke, have guarded the throne [from the time of] Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng [now] to the sixteenth year. You have presented your plans and have been completely loyal. You advised [the Emperor] to execute the former Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yÃ¼ Chang, in order to repress his rebellion and reveal the evil-doers. You mounted to [the position of] Commander-in-chief and your duties were to assist [the Emperor] at the court. " `When Emperor Hsiao-ai ascended the throne, while the proud concubine, [the Queen Dowager nee Fu] watched him furtively [for a chance] to work her will and while his wicked courtiers hatched rebellion, 205WANG MANG 99 A: 21b you, Duke, yourself impeached the Marquis of Kao- A.D. 5, June 22 The Charter Bestowing the Nine Distinctions. ch'ang, Tung Hung, and [at an imperial banquet] changed and corrected the usurped seat of the now deceased [Queen Dowager nee Fu], the mother of King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang]. From that time on, when the officials of the court discussed [matters], no one failed to accord with the Classics. " `When you had resigned your position on account of illness and returned to your great house, you were endangered by brigand-like officials, [but] after you had gone to your estate, Emperor Hsiao-ai awakened [to a comprehension of his error] and again returned you, Duke, to Ch'ang-an. When he became ill and [his illness] became increasingly severe, he still did not forget you, Duke, and again especially advanced your rank. " `That night, in [a time of] haste and confusion, the state was without a presumptive heir and wicked 27b courtiers filled the court, so that the peril was indeed great. We reflected that no one was more fitting than you, Duke, [to make] a plan for giving tranquillity to the state, [so We] had you inducted into the court. That same day [We] dismissed the Marquis of Kao-an, Tung Hsien2a, and within the interval of a turn of the clepsydra, your loyal plans were immediately established and the main and subordinate [dynastic] principles were all set forth in detail. " `[During the year-periods] Sui-ho and YÃ¼an-shou, 8-7 B.C. when you twice happened upon the death of 2-1 B.C. an emperor, you carried out all things perfectly, so that civil disturbances did not take place. You have assisted Us to the fifth year, [during which time] you have corrected fundamental matters of human relationships and have fixed the altars of Heaven and Earth.21.8 21.8 Chang Yen (iii cent.) explains that these two clauses refer to "the rites for capping and marriage and the moving of the Southern and Northern [Altars for] the suburban sacrifices." You have carefully served the gods in 206WANG MANG A.D. 5, June 22 The Charter Bestowing the Nine Distinctions. heaven and earth and have disposed of [matters in 99 A: 21b, 22a all] the four seasons. You have restored what had been abolished for a thousand years and straightened out the mistakes of a hundred generations.21.9 21.9 Chang Yen explains, "He had enfeoffed the descendants of the previous dynasties, established [as official] the ancient text of the Classics, and fixed the rites of successively removing [the shrines of remote ancestors to the shrine of the most ancient ancestor]." For the latter rite, cf. Glossary sub Wei HsÃ¼an-ch'eng. [People from all over] the empire have met in harmony and a great crowd has collected together.

You have restored and established the rites for the suburban sacrifice to the most prominent ancestor of the line anterior to the founder of the house (chiao), the sacrifice to the most ancient ancestor of the line (ti), and for the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar of the house (tsung),22.2 22.2 This sacrificial canon was a scholastic adoption of the ancient Chou sacrificial custom as recorded in the Kuo-yÃ¼ and the Li-chi XX, 1 (Legge, II, 201-202). There were four ancestral sacrifices: the ti sacrifice to the most ancient ancestor of the line, the chiao (suburban) sacrifice to the most prominent ancestor of the line anterior to the founder of the house, the tsu sacrifice to the founder of the house, i.e., the ancestor who was responsible for the house securing its royal or imperial standing, and the tsung sacrifice to the greatest ruler subsequent to the founder of the house, i.e., the greatest exemplar (for tsung as denoting an exemplar, cf. n. 17.6). On these sacrifices, cf. B. Karlgren, "Legends and Cults in Ancient China," Bull. of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, no. 18, p. 215. The previously established imperial ancestral sacrifice to Emperor Kao was evidently considered as the tsu sacrifice, so that only the three others are mentioned. By the device of making these ancestors the coadjutors (pei ) of high gods, as on p. 17a, i.e., making them the introducers of the worshipper to, intercessors with, and transmitters of the sacrifice to these high gods, these ancestral sacrifices became at the same time the worship of the highest deities. HS 25 B: 21a, b does not mention the sacrificial canon referred to in this passage, merely saying, "In the course of [Wang Mang's] more than thirty years [of rule], the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth underwent five changes." in order to make glorious the great 207WANG MANG 99 A: 22a [principle of] filial piety. For this reason [all within] 99 A: 22a, b The Charter Bestowing the Nine Distinctions. the four seas are concordant, all countries incline towards correct principles, and the barbarians, who have different customs [from the Chinese], have of their own accord come [to the imperial court] without being summoned and are gradually progressing [in civilization] and have corrected their ceremonial bonnets and bring their treasures to assist at the [imperial] sacrifices. " `You have searched for old [precedents and have based [yourself] on the [correct] Way [of action], you have obeyed the [Confucian] canons and honored ancient [practices, so that] whenever you acted, you have been successful, and in everything you have attained the mean. Your extreme virtue and essential principles have become known to the gods; the imperial ancestors have esteemed you and rejoiced, so that lights have shone brightly and happy portents from Heaven have arrived repeatedly. The grand [cosmological] principles are universally concordant [and there have been] more than seven hundred auspicious presages of unicorns, phoenixes, tortoises, and dragons.22.3 22.3 Pan Ku thus omitted all but a very few of Wang Mang's portents. This fact speaks well of Pan Ku's judgment of historical values. The Lun-heng (Forke, I, 366) mentions a bird as large as a horse with variegated colors, which roosted in P'ei Commandery. You are accordingly instituting 208WANG MANG A.D. 5, June 22 The Charter Bestowing the Nine Distinctions. rites and composing music, so that you will 99 A: 22a, b have the great merit of having restored peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples and the [imperial] gods of the soils and grains.

" `[We] now add [to your honors] the distinctions for the nine conferments. Let them be used in assisting at the [imperial] sacrifices and in performing your civil and military duties. [Their favor] shall moreover be conferred upon your [deceased] ancestors. 22 Oh! How can that fail to be good!' " 22b Thereupon [Wang] Mang bent his head to the The Nine Distinctions. ground, and, bowing repeatedly, received [1] a green apron,22.5 22.5 For this garment, cf. n. 2.8. a tunic embroidered with dragons and other figures and a mortar-board hat, a short tunic and 28b robe, a fine gold mouth for a scabbard and a fine gold tip for a scabbard,22.6 22.6 Meng K'ang glosses, "Tang1 is the name of a jade. Of the ornaments for the scabbard of a sword, [the one] on the top [of the scabbard] is called a peng and [the one] on the bottom is called a pi . The Book of Odes [# 213; II, vi, ix, 2 (Legge, p. 383)] says, `His scabbard has a gem mouth and a gem tip,' which is this [meaning]." The word here written tang1 is not the exactly correct form of the word intended in the text. Meng K'ang seems moreover to have been in part mistaken in his interpretation of its meaning. The Ching-yu ed. and the Official ed. read for tang the word (which I do not find in the K'ang-hsi Dictionary), and the latter quotes Liu Pin as declaring that tang1 should have the phonetic yi , with which the Sung Ch'i ed. agrees. But Su YÃ¼ (fl. 1913) notes that Shuo-wen 1 A: 4b defines the word here pronounced as tang1 as "a jade tablet one foot two inches [long], with a spoon, which is used in the sacrifices in the [imperial] ancestral temples. It comes from [the radical for] jade and yang [which latter gives] its pronunciation, [at present pronounced ch'ang]." Su YÃ¼ points out that the ch'ang is accordingly not an ornament for a scabbard, but the same as the libation tablet , the description of which in the Chou-li 41: 2b, sub the YÃ¼-jen (Biot, II, 523), is in precisely the same words as that for tang1 in the Shuo-wen, and of the ch'ang-kuei in Kuo-yÃ¼ 4: 4a. This word thus has the pronunciation ch'ang and should be written with the phonetic yang, not yi; hence the Sung Ch'i ed. was mistaken. Su YÃ¼ asserts that tang1 is here probably used for tang2 . Shuo-wen 1 A: 6a defines tang2 as "the [most] beautiful [kind of] gold, which has the same color as jade. It comes from [the radical for] jade and t'ang [which latter gives] its pronunciation. For the scabbards of their ceremonial swords, the nobles have tang2 mouths and gem [more probably liu (fine gold)] tips." Erh-ya 5: 9b says, "Gold is called tang2; the [most] beautiful [kind] of it is called liu ." In a note to the passage of the Book of Odes quoted above (in Shih-san Ching Chu-su 14 ii: 2a), the Mao interpretation (ii cent. B.C.; describing ancient practices) says, "The Son of Heaven has a jade mouth to his scabbard and a mother-of-pearl tip to his scabbard. Nobles have tang2 mouths to their scabbards and gem [more probably liu (fine gold)] tips to their scabbards. Grandees have fine silver mouths to their scabbards and liu (fine gold) tips to their scabbards. Gentlemen have shell mouths to their scabbards and shell tips to their scabbards." Shuo-wen 1 A: 4b, sub peng, however says, "The ornament for the tip of a scabbard. The Son of Heaven uses jade and the nobles use metal (gold)." HHS, Tr. 30: 12b states moreover that both the Emperor and the vassal kings used gold in their scabbards. Hence tang1 cannot here be the name for a kind of jade and this word should be read as tang2. and ornamented shoes,22.7 22.7 Meng K'ang explains, "They are the present ornamental tips to fasting and sacrificial shoe clogs. They protrude from the shoe one or two inches." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Their shape is that of a forked [raised] end." The Sung Ch'i ed. says, "Wei Chao says, `ChÃ¼-li are ornamented at the end and are in the shape of the hilt of a sword.' " In Li-chi II, i, iii, 38 (Couvreur, I, 183) and XI, iii, 12 (Couvreur, I, 710) the first word of this phrase is written . In a note to Yi-li 3: 6a (Steele, I, 15), Cheng HsÃ¼an says, "The chÃ¼ . . . are used as guards in walking. In shape they are like the hilt on a scabbard of a sword, and they are at the front of the shoes." For figures of these clogs, cf. Nieh Ch'ung-yi's San-li T'u (presented 962) 8: 11a; also the account in Wen-hsÃ¼an 35: 36a, sub P'an HsÃ¼ YÃ¼an-mou's (d. 215) "Chiu-hsi-wen." 209WANG MANG 99 A: 22b [2] a princely chariot with bells and a quadriga of A.D. 5, June 22 The Nine Dictinctions. horses,22.8 22.8 Yen Shih-ku explains, "The luan-lu is a princely (lu) carriage on which are used little bells (luan) . . . Four horses are called a (quadriga)." The reference is to Li-chi XII, 15 (31: 7b; Legge, II, 34; Couvreur, I, 734-35). Luan-lu is also used in HS 22: 23b, 24a; 25 B: 13a. with the dragon banner with nine tails and the spotted deerskin cap and white silk pleated robe, a war-chariot with a quadriga of horses, [3] a red bow and arrows and a black bow and arrows,22.9 22.9 Book of History V, xxviii, 4 (Legge, p. 619) states that "a red bow and a hundred red arrows, a black bow and a hundred black arrows" were awarded to Marquis Wen of Chin.

The eastern quarter gives birth to, grows, and nourishes all things." [7] vermillion doors, [8] inside staircases,23.2 23.2 Meng K'ang explains, " is . It means to make an opening at the junction of two walls in the basement of his mansion (tien), and make a staircase, so as not to cause [the staircase] to be exposed to the sky." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Meng [K'ang's] explanation is correct. Honored persons do not wish to be exposed to the sky as they go upstairs, hence they [put the stairs] inside beneath the eaves." In Wen-hsÃ¼an 35: 37a, P'an HsÃ¼ writes in his "Chiu-hsi-wen" ("Essay on the Nine Distinctions"), "For this reason the prince who possesses the distinctions has an inside staircase to mount up [to the main floor of his house]," and Li Shan quotes Ju Shun's explanation, "The basement of the mansion (tien) is cut into to make a staircase in order to have comfort on both sides, above and below [in climbing to the main floor]." Ancient Chinese official residences seem often to have had below the main floor a basement floor for the servants and usually to have had the main floor elevated above the level of the ground. Han funerary pottery shows houses with even five stories; cf. Maspero, "La vie privÃ©e a l'Ã©poque Han," in Revue des arts asiatiques, 7: 188. and [9] the insignia of having an Office of [Superintendancy over] his Clan, an Office of Praying, an Office of Augury, an Office of Recording, three hundred men of [the Gentlemen] as Rapid as Tigers, one Household Steward and one Assistant [Household Steward]. In each of the Offices over his Clan, of Praying, of Divination, and of Recording there 23a were established Bailiffs and Accessory [Officials]. When the Duke Giving Tranquility to the Han Dynasty 29a was in his yamen inside [the Palace] or in his residence outside [the Palace, the Gentlemen] as Rapid as Tigers were to act as the guard at his gates, and those who were qualified to come out or in were to have their names inscribed on a register [at his gates]. From the Four Coadjutors and the three highest ministers [on down, if anyone] had business at his yamen or residence, they were all to use passports. The Prince's Lodge of the Kings of Ch'u was made the residence of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. It was grandly repaired and 211WANG MANG 99 A: 23 a built and a vacant space [arranged] all around it for A.D. 5, June 22 The Nine Distinctions. the guard. The temples and funerary chambers of his [deceased] grandfather and father were all given vermillion doors and inside staircases.23.3 23.3 There are five ancient lists of these nine distinctions: (I) In Han-shih Wai-chuan 8: 9a, sect. 13 (by Han Ying, fl. 174-141 B.C.), "The books say, `When the nobles are virtuous, the Son of Heaven gives them distinctions. The first distinction is carriages and horses; the second distinction is garments and robes, the third distinction is the As Rapid as Tigers; the fourth distinction is music and [musical] instruments; the fifth distinction is inside staircases; the sixth distinction is vermillion doors; the seventh distinction is bows and arrows; the eighth distinction is ceremonial- and battle-axes; the ninth distinction is black millet herb-flavored liquor." (II) The Li-wei Han-wen-chia (prob. end i cent. B.C.), YÃ¼-han Shang-fang Chi-yi-shu collection, p. 6a, has a similar list, but in a slightly different order; (III) the passage of the HS translated above; (IV) in a note to the Kung-yang Commentary 6: 3b, Dk. Chuang, I, x, Ho Hsiu (129-182) quotes the list in the Han-wen-chia; (V) Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) has the same list (translated in HFHD, II, 47-48, n. 9.2). Fan Ning (339-401) also quotes the list from the Han-wen-chia in a note to Ku-liang Commentary 5: 2a, Dk. Chuang, I, x. Wang Mang's list is different from all the others in that, instead of musical instruments, he received "jade tablets with the nine emblems." These nine distinctions are not mentioned in the Five Classics. They are mentioned first, seemingly, in the Han-shih Wai-chuan, and in a memorial of 128 B.C. to Emperor Wu (HS 6: 9a); Chou-li 18: 10b ff, sub the Ta-tsung-po (Biot, I, 428-430) gives a list of the "nine conferments (ming)," (trans. here in n. 21.2); ibid., 21: 1a (Biot II, 1) refers to them (also cf. n. 21.2); but this passage of the Chou-li may be no earlier than the time of Wang Mang. The Spring and Autumn (v cent. B.C.; Dk. Chuang, I, x; Legge, p. 72) uses the phrase , in which the first word is interpreted by the Kung-yang Commentary (iii cent. B.C.) 6: 3a as , but understood as "distinctions" by Ho Hsiu and others. The Bamboo Annals, K. Yu, yr. I (Legge, Shooking, Intro., p. 157) uses the term hsi to mean "to grant distinctions." It is thus probable that the tradition concerning these nine distinctions came down to Wang Mang in a slightly different form from that in the Han-shih Wai-chuan. The use of those distinctions was continued after Han times; San-Kuo-chih, Wei, 1: 35b-36b, quotes an edict of Emperor Hsien, dated A.D. 213, granting these nine distinctions to Ts'ao Ts'ao and enumerating them in detail. Ch'en Ch'ung also memorialized, "When the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty goes outside of the city gate for the purpose of sacrificing to his [deceased] grandfather or father, it would be proper for the Colonel of the City Gate to accompany [the Duke] at the head of his cavalrymen. Then when [the Duke] enters [the city] he will have the guards 212WANG MANG A.D. 5 of his gates [to protect him] and when he goes out 99 A: 23a, b of [the city] he will have cavalrymen [following him, by all of which] his state would be made more honorable." His memorial was approved. Autumn That autumn, because of the auspicious presage that the Empress [nee Wang] would have descendants,23.4 23.4 Chang Yen (iii cent.) explains, "At that time she was in her fourteenth year and first showed signs of womanhood." For the meaning of this name, cf. Glossary sub Tzu-wu Road. 23b [Wang] Mang cut the Tzu-wu Road. The The Tzu-wu Road. Tzu-wu Road cuts straight across the Southern Mountains from Tu-ling and passes [into] Han-chung [Commandery]. The eight messengers23.5 23.5 They had been sent out in March, A.D. 4; cf. A: 17a.

They had falsely invented accompanied A Flattering Report On the State Of the Empire. and unaccompanied songs from the commanderies and kingdoms to praise [Wang Mang's] achievements and virtuous conduct, in altogether thirty thousand words. [Wang] Mang memorialized that [their report] should be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance.23.6 23.6 Chou Shou-ch'ang explains the phrase ting-chu-ling : "When the Son of Heaven of the Han [dynasty] published an ordinance, it was stored in the yamen of the [Grandee] Secretary. The Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and the Empress of [Emperor] Kao employed this practise. When, [in the case of] Emperor Ch'eng, it was ordered that an Heir-apparent should be permitted to cross the imperial pathway [cf. HFHD II, 373-74], the ordinance was also published. At this time, [Wang] Mang openly memorialized, begging that [the matter] should be established and published as an ordinance." He also memorialized that [because] there existed such [perfect] institutions, in the market-places there were not two 23b prices, the offices were without law-cases or litigation, towns were without thieves or robbers, the countryside was without famished people, things dropped on the roads were not picked up, and males and females took separate paths,23.7 23.7 A condition described in Li-chi III, v, 15 (Legge I, 244; Couvreur I, 319). [hence] those who violated 213WANG MANG 99 A: 23b, 24a [the institutions should merely suffer] punishments A.D. 5 [which portrayed] the likeness [of the mutilating punishments in the criminal's clothing].23.8 23.8 Cf.

Since [in the empire, Wang] Mang had brought The Ch'iang Are Induced To Surrender the Kokonor Territory. about [the condition of] complete tranquillity, in that to the north he had influenced the Huns, to the east he had caused [people] to come [from] beyond the ocean, and to the south he had attracted the Huang-chih, [but] only in the western quarter he had not yet produced [any effects], he therefore sent a General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, P'ing Hsien, and others, bearing much money and silk, to tempt the Ch'iang outside the barriers and have them present their territory [to the throne and to express] a desire to be received by and to be subordinate [to Chinese rule. Upon his return, P'ing] Hsien and the others memorialized, saying, "The leaders of the Ch'iang tribes, Liang YÃ¼an, and others, whose number might 24a be twelve thousand persons, wish to be received and to be your subjects. They offer the Hsien-shui Sea, the YÃ¼n Gorge, and the Salt Lake. The level land with fine grass is all given to the Chinese people, and [the Ch'iang] will themselves dwell in the narrow and difficult places and act as guards at the frontiers. "When I asked Liang YÃ¼an the reason for his submitting, he replied, saying, `The Grand Empress 214WANG MANG A.D. 5 Dowager is sage and glorious, the Duke Giving 99 A: 24a Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty is most benevolent, 30a and the world is completely peaceful, so that the five [kinds of] cereals ripen and there are good harvests.

The use of a phrase from the Odes in a quotation of a speech by the barbarian Ch'iang indicates the artificial classicism of Wang Mang's court. to be admitted [to the Chinese empire] and to become your subordinates.' "It would be proper at this time to settle them in [stationary] occupations and to establish a [Chief Commandant] of a Dependent State to direct and protect them." The matter was referred to [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang memorialized in reply, saying, "You, [Grand] Empress Dowager, have controlled the rule for several years; your grace and bounty have inundated and overflowed, so that a filial attitude of submission [has spread over] the four quarters and not even the most distant regions with different customs have 24a failed to turn towards correct principles.

I beg that you will accept the territory which Liang YÃ¼an and the others are offering and make it the commandery of Hsi-hai. "Your servant has also heard that when the Sage-kings 30b gave order to the ornaments of Heaven, [the Geographical Arrangements to be Rectified. stars], and fixed the principles of geographical [arrangements], they took the mountains, streams, and customs of the common people as the principles for the boundaries of their provinces. The territory of the Han dynasty is broader than that of the two [sage-]lords and three [dynasties of] kings,24.5 24.5 Fu Ch'ien comments, "The domain of restraint [belonging to] T'ang [Yao] and YÃ¼ [Shun], [who were the two "sage-lords"], together with that [belonging to] the Chou [dynasty] was seven thousand li square; that [belonging to] the Hsia and Yin [dynasties] was three thousand li square; the territory of the Han [dynasty] is thirteen thousand li from north to south." With this belief that the Han was the greatest of dynasties, it was only natural that the Chinese called themselves "men of Han." having 24b altogether thirteen provinces. Many of the names of the provinces together with their boundaries do not correspond to those in the Classics. The `Canon of Yao' [speaks of] twelve provinces;24.6 24.6 Book of History, II, i, 10 (Legge, p. 38). later they 216WANG MANG A.D. 5 were fixed at nine provinces. The vast territory of 99 A: 24b the Han dynasty is far-extending. When the Provincial Shepherds go to inspect their divisions, the most distant ones are more than thirty thousand li [away], so that there cannot be [only] nine [provinces]. I would respectfully employ the ideas of the Classics in correcting the names of the twelve provinces and make boundaries for them to correspond to the correct original [boundaries]." The memorial was approved. Thousands Exiled to Kokonor. He also added fifty items to the laws. Offenders were transported to Hsi-hai [Commandery]. Those who were transported were counted by the thousands and ten-thousands, so that the common people for the first [time] held grudges [against Wang Mang]. The Marquis of Ch'Ã¼an-ling, Liu Ch'ing4i, sent 24b to the imperial court a letter saying, "When King It is Suggested that he be made Regent. Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor, he was called the Young Prince, and the Duke of Chou acted as Regent. Now that the Emperor is rich in youthfulness, it would be proper to order the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to perform the duties of the Son of Heaven like the Duke of Chou." The various courtiers all said, "it would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Ch'ing4i has said." 31a In the winter, when [the planet] Mars was occulted Winter. by the moon,24.7 24.7 Mars was occulted by the moon at sunset on Nov. 29 of this year.

[Wang] Mang made a written declaration [to Heaven] in which he begged for [the Emperor's] life at the altar to the Supreme [One]. He had a jade circlet hung on his person, carried jade insignia, and [declared] that he was willing in person to take the place [of the dying Emperor]. The declaration was stored in a "metal-bound coffer"24.8 24.8 This term is the title of ch. vi in the Book of History V (Legge, p. 351); Wang Mang was imitating the incident therein recorded as performed by the Duke of Chou. The coffer was opened in 24 A.D., cf. 99 C: 22b. and placed in the 217WANG MANG 99 A: 24b, 25a Front Hall [of the Palace].

[Wang Mang] memorialized, that the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-ch'eng should be honored with the title of [the Temple of] the Controlling Exemplar and the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing with the title of [the Temple of] the Primary Exemplar. At that time, the line of descent from Emperor YÃ¼an had been ended, but of the great-grandsons of Emperor HsÃ¼an there were living: five kings and 25a forty-eight full marquises, [including] the Marquis of Kuang-chi, [Liu] Hsien3c.25.1 25.1 These five kings were the King of Huai-yang, Liu Yin4b (HS 14: 21b); the King of Chung-shan, Liu Ch'eng-tu (14: 22a); the King of Ch'u, Liu YÃ¼1a (14: 22b); the King of Hsin-tua, Liu Ching3b (14: 22b); and the King of Tung-p'ing, Liu K'ai-ming (14: 21b). (Listed by Hu San-hsing, [1230-1287].) He also enumerates the following as the marquises referred to: the Marquis of Kuang-chi, Liu Hsien3c (HS 15 B: 37b); the Marquis of Yang-hsing, Liu Chi-sheng (15 B: 41a); the Marquis of Ling-yang, Liu Chia1n (15 B: 41b); the Marquis of Kao-lo, Liu Hsiu2c (15 B: 41b); the Marquis of P'ing-yi, Liu Min3d (15 B: 42a); the Marquis of P'ing-tsuan, Liu K'uang4c (15 B: 42a); the Marquis of Ho-ch'ang, Liu Fu3b (15 B: 42b); the Marquis of Yi1-hsiang, Liu K'ai1b (15 B: 42b); the Marquis of Chiu-hsiang, Liu Pu-haid (15 B: 43a); the Marquis of Chiao-hsiang, Liu Wu3c (15 B: 43a); the Marquis of Yi2-hsiang, Liu K'uei1f (15 B: 43b); the Marquis of Ch'ang-ch'eng, Liu Feng2a (15 B: 43b); the Marquis of Lo-an, Liu YÃ¼10g (15 B: 44a); the Marquis of T'ao-hsiang, Liu Kuei1e (15 B: 52a); the Marquis of Li-hsiang, Liu Pao1c (15 B: 52b); the Marquis of Ch'ang-hsiang, Liu Tan4d (15 B: 52b); the Marquis of Hsin-hsiang, Liu Li7 (15 B: 53a); the Marquis of Wu-hsiang, Liu Kuang1k (15 B: 53a); the Marquis of Hsin-ch'eng, Liu Wu3d (15 B: 53b); the Marquis of Yi-ling, Liu Feng2b (15 B: 53b); the Marquis of T'ang-hsiang, Liu Hu4e (15 B: 54a); the Marquis of Ch'eng-ling, Liu Yu2c (15 B: 54a); the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang, Liu Chung6c (15 B: 54b); the Marquis of Fu-ch'ang, Liu Hsiu1b (15 B: 54b); the Marquis of An-lu, Liu P'ing2e (15 B: 55a); the Marquis of Wu-an, Liu YÃ¼9 (15 B: 55a); the Marquis of Chao-hsiang, Liu Ch'ung1c (15 B: 55b); the Marquis of Fu-hsiang, Liu P'u3c (15 B: 55b); the Marquis of Fang-ch'eng, Liu HsÃ¼an1f (15 B: 56a); the Marquis of Tang-yang, Liu Yi8 (15 B: 56a); the Marquis of Kuang-ch'eng, Liu Chieh2 (15 B: 56b); the Marquis of Ch'un-ch'eng, Liu YÃ¼n3 (15 B: 56b); the Marquis of LÃ¼-hsiang, Liu Shang4c (15 B: 57b); the Marquis of Li-hsiang, Liu Yin2e (15 B: 58a); the Marquis of YÃ¼an-hsiang, Liu Lung1b (15 B: 58a); the Marquis of Shou-ch'Ã¼an, Liu Ch'eng5b (15 B: 58b); the Marquis of Hsiang-shan, Liu Tsun2 (15 B: 58b); the Marquis of Yen-hsiang, Liu Hsin4g (15 B: 50a); the Marquis of Wu-p'ing, Liu Huang5b (15 B: 50b); the Marquis of Ling-hsiang, Liu Ts'engb (15 B: 50b); the Marquis of Wu-an, Liu Shou5c (15 B: 51a); the Marquis of Fu-yang, Liu Meng (15 B: 45a); the Marquis of Hsi-yang, Liu Yen3j (15 B: 47a); the Marquis of T'ao-hsiang, Liu Li5b (15 B: 44a); the Marquis of Li-hsiang, Liu HsÃ¼an-ch'eng (15 B: 39b); the Marquis of Chin-hsiang, Liu Pu-haic (15 B: 40a); the Marquis of P'ing-t'ung, Liu Tan4c (15 B: 40a); the Marquis of Hsi-an, Liu Han4d (15 B: 40b); the Marquis of Hu-hsiang, Liu K'ai1a (15 B: 40b); and the Marquis of Chung-hsiang, Liu Shao-po (15 B: 41a). Hu San-hsing enumerates fifty marquises and states that the Marquis of Kuang-chi, Liu Hsien3c, was the father of the Young Prince (so should not be counted) and the Marquis of Li-hsiang, Liu HsÃ¼an-ch'eng, had previously been dismissed, leaving only forty-eight. But I find no evidence and no date for the dismissal of Liu HsÃ¼an-ch'eng (15 B: 39b). Forty-one of the foregoing fifty, marquisates had been established at the request of Wang Mang in A.D. 1, 2, and 5 [Wang] Mang hated it 218WANG MANG A.D. 6, Feb. The Youngest Descendant of Emperor HsÃ¼an Selected to Succeed to the Throne. that they were adults, so advised, "A cousin is not 99 A: 25a permitted to be the successor [to his cousin of the same generation]." So he selected the very youngest among [Emperor HsÃ¼an's] great-great-grandsons, [Liu] Ying1a, the son of the Marquis of Kuang-chi, [Liu] Hsien3c. He was in the second year of his age. [Wang Mang] took as a pretext that when he was divined about and physiognomized, he was the most auspicious [of all]. In this month, the Displayer of Splendor in the Feb. South, Hsieh Hsiao, memorialized that the Chief of Wu-kung [prefecture], Meng T'ung, while a well was being dug, had secured a white stone, round above 31b the square below, with red writing on the stone. 219WANG MANG 99 A: 25a, b The writing said, "An instruction to the Duke Giving A.D. 6, Feb. The First Portent that Wang Mang Should Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, that he should become the Emperor." The coming of mandates [from Heaven] through portents began indeed with this one. [Wang] Mang had the various highest ministers 25a advise the [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang] Become Emperor of it. The [Grand] Empress Dowager said, "This [thing] is trumped up to deceive the empire. [Its message] cannot be put into practise." The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun4b, said to the [Grand] Empress Dowager that when matters have already reached such [a condition as they had], there was nothing that could be done [about it], that if she wished to check it, she did not have the strength to stop it; and also that [Wang] Mang would not presume 25b to have any other [intentions], but merely desired He is Made Regent. to be entitled25.2 25.2 The Official ed. reads for . The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. the Regent, in order to make his power greater and to settle the empire and make it obedient. The [Grand] Empress Dowager listened to him and promised [to do so]. [Wang] Shun4b and others thereupon together had the [Grand] Empress Dowager issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily, [We] have heard that when `Heaven gave birth to' the crowd of `common people,' they were unable to govern themselves, so `He set up princes for them',25.3 25.3 A quotation from Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XIV, summer (Legge, 4627, 466b). in order to control them. When a prince is young, there must be someone whom he can rely upon, who should then act as regent. Then only will [the prince] be able to carry out [the duties] given him by Heaven and complete the transforming influence of Earth, so that the various living beings will flourish and be nurtured. Does not the Book of History say, `The work is Heaven'sâlet men take the place of [Heaven]'?25.4 25.4 Book of History II, iii, ii, 5 (Legge, p. 73; Couvreur, p. 47). 220WANG MANG A.D. 6, Feb. "Because Emperor Hsiao-p'ing was young, We 99 A: 25b temporarily took charge of the government of the state. [We] hoped to put upon him the cap of maturity and to entrust the government to him and 32a hand it over. But now his life has been cut short and he is dead. Alas! How sad! "[We] have already had the high officials summon twenty-three great-great-grandsons of Emperor Hsiao-hsÃ¼an, to choose an appropriate person to be the heir and successor of Emperor Hsiao-p'ing. This great-great-grandson is of the age when he is in swaddling-clothes; if [We] are not able to secure [to be his regent] a princely man who has reached the very heart of virtue, who can give tranquillity to [the empire]? "The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, has assisted in the government for three reigns, has repeatedly met with critical times, has tranquillized and made brilliant the House of Han, and has thereupon made [people] of customs differing [from those of the Chinese become] like [the Chinese even] in their institutions, [so that] he 25b has had the same presages as those had at a different age by the Duke of Chou. Now the Displayer of Splendor in the South, [Hsieh] Hsiao, and the Chief of Wu-kung [prefecture, Meng] T'ung, have presented [a memorial] speaking of a red stone portent. We have thought profoundly that its meaning, which said, `[Wang Mang] should become Emperor,' is however that as Regent he should perform the duties of the Emperor. Verily if there is a model, accomplishment is easy; [but] if there is no sage, there is no model.25.5 25.5 Stange, ibid., 82, n. 1, remarks that this sentence refers to the Duke of Chou as the model. "Let it be ordered that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should occupy [the 221WANG MANG 99 A: 25b, 26a post of] Regent and should [be permitted to] mount A.D. 6, Feb. the eastern [master's] steps [at the altar to Heaven], as in the former case [was done by] the Duke of Chou. 26a Let the prefecture of Wu-kung become the territory whose revenue is allocated to the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, and let its name be the town of Han-kuang (the Han [dynasty's] brilliance). Let there be prepared a memorial concerning the ceremonial [for the above]." Thereupon the various courtiers memorialized, saying, "The sage virtue of the [Grand] Empress He is Given the Dowager is brilliant. You have seen deeply into the intentions of Heaven and have issued an imperial 32b order that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Rites of a Son of Heaven and the Title of Acting Emperor. Dynasty should act as Regent. Your subjects have heard that when King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed, so that King Ch'eng was unable to perform his duties to Heaven and Earth and to renew the illustrious services [performed by Kings] Wen and Wu, the Duke of Chou temporarily acted as Regent and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] were therefore completed and its kingly house was at peace. If he had not acted as Regent, then it is to be feared that the Chou [dynasty] would have lost the mandate of Heaven. "The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou as] saying [to Prince Shih, the Duke of Shao], `If the son or grandson who becomes the heir to and serves our [lord, King Wu], should be altogether incapable of reverencing [the deities] above and below, [Heaven, Earth, the ancestors, and gods], and lose the glory of his predecessors, if we [were retired, living] at home, we would remain ignorant of it.26.1 26.1 This translation deviates from that of Legge, who follows the pseudo-Kung An-kuo comment. It is justified by the context in the HS, cf. Shang-shu Chu-su 16: 11a; Chiang Sheng, Shang-shu Chi-chu Yin-su ("Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh," 397: 11b); Sun Hsing-yen, Shang-shu Chin-ku-wen Chu-su 22:2b ("P'ing-chin-kuan Ts'ung-shu ed.). But Yen Shih-ku and Liu Fung-lu, Shang-shu Chin-ku-wen Chi-chieh ("Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh HsÃ¼-p'ien" 344: 1b) punctuate differently. The point is that just as the sage Duke of Chou knew he needed to be Regent, so Wang Mang must now be Regent. 222WANG MANG A.D. 6, Feb. The Mandate [of Heaven] is not easy [to retain], and 99 A: 26a, b the assistance of Heaven is not sure, so that His mandate may be lost.'26.2 26.2 Book of History V, xvi, 3, 4 (Legge, p. 476; Couvreur, pp. 298, 299). This quotation differs from the present (ancient) text of the Book of History: for , this quotation reads ; for it reads ; for it reads ; for , it reads ; the before the is omitted; for , it reads ; for it reads . The HS quotes, as usual, the "modern text" of that book (Tuan YÃ¼-ts'ai, Ku-wen Shang-shu Chuan-yi ("Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 590: 1b). The explanation says, 26a `The Duke of Chou wore the tasselled mortar-board bonnet of the Son of Heaven, faced south and held audience for the courtiers, and made proclamations and gave ordinances, constantly calling them the mandates of the King. The Duke of Shao was a worthy person, [but] did not understand the intentions of the sage, [the Duke of Chou], hence was not pleased.'26.3 26.3 We have not been able to discover whence this comment was taken. The [Record of] Proprieties (Li[chi]), in `Record of the Ming-t'ang,' says, `When the Duke of Chou held court for the nobles in the Ming-t'ang, [like] the Son of Heaven, he turned his back to the 33a axe-embroidered screen, faced south, and stood up.'26.4 26.4 Li-chi XII, 1 (Legge, II, 29; Couvreur, I, 725). It means that the Duke of Chou occupied the throne of the Son of Heaven to the sixth year, 26b held court for the nobles, established the rites, and composed the music, so that the empire submitted widely. [But] the Duke of Shao was not pleased. At that time, King Wu had [just] died and the coarse mourning garments had not yet been put off. If we consider it in this way, when the Duke of Chou first became Regent, he then occupied the Son of Heaven's throne and it was not [that he waited] until the sixth year [before] he mounted the eastern steps.26.5 26.5 The eastern steps were reserved for the host or the master of the household and for the Son of Heaven at the altar to Heaven. 223WANG MANG 99 A: 26b "The lost chapter of the Book of History, `Auspi- A.D. 6, Feb. cious Grain,'26.6 26.6 The chapter "Auspicious Grain" is one of the lost chapters of the Book of History. It seems to have been one of the "lost chapters" made canonical by Wang Mang. says, `When the Duke of Chou offered the herb-flavored millet liquor, he stood upon the steps of the eastern staircase and was conducted to mount them, and the presentation speech [at the offering] said, "The Acting King is ruling over the government and diligently harmonizing the world." ' The [foregoing] is how the Duke of Chou was entitled by the person [who read] the presentation speech when [the Duke of Chou] was regent in the government. "When King Ch'eng put on his cap of maturity, the Duke of Chou thereupon presented the government to him. The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou] as saying, `We return [the government to Our] nephew, the intelligent prince.'26.7 26.7 Book of History, V, xiii, 1 (Legge, p. 434; Couvreur, 269). I have adopted the K'ung An-kuo interpretation of this sentence, discussed and rejected by Legge, but plainly employed in this memorial. Fu-p'i has come to mean "restore the monarchy." (Duyvendak.) The Duke of Chou constantly called [his orders] the mandates of the King, and acted on his own authority without reporting [matters to the King], hence he said, `I return [the government] to my nephew, the intelligent prince.' "Your subjects beg that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent, mount the eastern steps,26.8 26.8 The Official ed. emends to .

When he goes in or out [of the Palace] 33b in his chariot and robes, [the people] should be 26b warned and [the streets] cleared. The common people and courtiers should call themselves his `subjects' or `female servants.'26.10 26.10 Chieh is the feminine of ch'en ; cf. 24 A: 20b12; 44: 3a3. In all [these matters, he should be treated] as in the regulations for the Son of Heaven. "When he makes the suburban sacrifices to Heaven and to Earth, makes the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar of the house in the Ming-t'ang, makes offerings and sacrifices in the [imperial] ancestral temples, and performs worship and makes sacrifices to the many gods, in his presentation speech he should be called, `the Acting Emperor.' The common people and courtiers should speak of him as `the Regent-Emperor'; he should call himself `I'.26.11 26.11 This word yÃ¼ is part of the imperial self-designation . In judging and deciding matters [when holding] court, he should regularily employ the imperial edicts of the Emperor and pronounce [that he issues imperial] decrees,26.12 26.12 Cf. HFHD, I, 192, n. 1. thereby upholding and obeying the will of August Heaven, assisting and protecting the House of Han, and guarding and tranquillizing the young heir to Emperor Hsiao-p'ing, [thus] carrying out the principle of entrusting [a Regent with the rule] and exalting the development of good government and peace. "When he pays court at an audience of either the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] or the Empress 27a Dowager [nee Wang], he should reassume the devotion of a subject. He should in his own person [as a noble] exercise the government and issue `instructions' to his own palace, his family, his [marquis's] estate, and his special territory [of Han-kuang], as in 225WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, i 99 A: 27a his previous practise, [according to] the legal practises A.D. 6, Feb. of a noble. Your subjects, risking death, make this request." The edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager said, "It is approved." The next year, [Wang Mang] changed the year-period and called it ChÃ¼-shÃª (the Regency). In [the year-period] ChÃ¼-shÃª, the first year, the I first month, [Wang] Mang sacrificed to the Lords on A.D. 6, High at the Southern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, Feb./Mar. welcomed the spring at the Eastern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, performed the rites of the great archery contest in the Ming-t'ang, and served food to Thrice Venerable and Fivefold Experienced.

The last sentence probably means that his attendance was not perfunctory and that he stayed through the whole ceremony. He established the Five Clerks At the Foot of the Court Steno- Pillars, with their rank like that of the [Attendant] Secretaries. When he attended to government business, 34a they attended at his side and recorded and made graphers. detailed accounts of his words and acts.

Wang Shun4b was made Grand Tutor Assisting on the Left, Chen Feng was made Grand Support Aiding on the Right, and Chen Han was made Grand Guardian Serving at the Rear. There were also established four Junior [Coadjutors] whose ranks were all two thousand piculs.27.2 27.2 Hu San-hsing states that these four Junior Coadjutors were the Junior Master, the Junior Tutor, the Junior Support, and the Junior Guardian. In the fourth month, the Marquis of An-chung, May/June Liu Ch'ung2c, plotted with his Chancellor, Chang 27a 226WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, iv A.D. 6, May/June Shao, saying, "The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the 99 A: 27a, b Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, acts on his own authority 27b in holding court and exercizing the government, Liu Ch'ung's Rebellion. which will inevitably endanger the Liu clan. No one of those in the empire who disapprove of it has however dared to be the first to make a move. This is a shame to the [imperial] house. I will give an example to the [imperial] house and clan and be the first [to attack. All] within [the four] seas will certainly respond." [Chang] Shao and others, who followed him, [to the number of] more than a hundred persons, thereupon made an assault upon [the city of] YÃ¼an, [but] did not succeed in entering it and were defeated. Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia [Chang] Shao was a cousin of Chang Sung. [Chang] Sung, with [Liu] Ch'ung's father's cousin, Liu Chia1s, went to [the palace] portals and surrendered of their own accord, [so that Wang] Mang pardoned them and did not condemn them. Thereupon [Chang] Sung composed a memorial for [Liu] Chia1s, which said, 6-1 B.C. "During [the year-periods] Chien-p'ing and YÃ¼an-shou, when the main line [of the Han Dynasty] was in imminent danger of being cut short and the [imperial] house was in imminent danger of being overthrown, thanks to your Majesty [Wang Mang's] sage 34b virtue, you `crawled on your knees to rescue and save it,'27.3 27.3 A phrase from the Book of Odes, I, iii, x, 4 (Legge, p. 57). you protected and defended, succored27.4 27.4 The Official ed. has restored the stroke taken from the word , both here and on p. 30a, which was omitted because of the taboo on the personal name of the Grand Founder (T'ai-tsu) of the Sung dynasty, Chao K'uang-yin, who reigned 960-975. and guarded it, so that the [heavenly] mandate of the [Han] state was again prolonged and the imperial house opened its eyes [again]. "When you attended court, controlled the government, put out proclamations, and put forth ordinances, 227WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, iv 99 A: 27b in your every act you made the imperial AD. 6, May/June Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia. house the first [and most important consideration] and the promotion and employment of the nine [sets of imperial] relatives as the primary matter. You have had included with them and recorded [upon the registers of the imperial house] cadet branches [of that house] and have established kings and marquises [from among these cadet branches], so that those who face south [in holding court and call themselves by the designation a noble uses for himself], ku,27.5 27.5 Ku was used by reigning nobles to designate themselves when addressing their subjects. The term means literally, "orphan," and implies therefore, in a patriarchal society, a rightful ruler, indicating that he is no usurper but regins by right of succession to his father (Duyvendak). For these enfeoffments from and favors to cadet members of the imperial house, cf. HS 12: 2b, 3a, 4b, 5a, 8b, 9a; 99 A: 7a, 19b. are numbered by the hundreds. You gathered in and restored those members whose [registration in the imperial house] had been broken off, you preserved those [whose lines of descent as nobles] had died out, and you continued [those lines whose heads] had been dismissed [from their noble ranks], so that they form a numerous company who are able to be shoulder to shoulder and head to head [with the other nobles] and have been restored in their persons. You have thereby defended the Han [dynasty's] state and supported the Han clan. "You have established the Pi-yung and set up the Ming-t'ang to propagate the law of Heaven and to spread the influence of the sages. You have held court for the various princes in order to render your `culture and virtue'27.6 27.6 Culture and virtue, wen-tÃª " is a phrase from Book of History II, ii, 21 (Legge, p. 66). Stange, op. cit., 89, n. 2 remarks that wen-te originally referred to a magical dance. That is probably correct, but the gloss on this passage attributed to K'ung An-kuo (Shih-san-ching Chu-su 4: 8b) shows that in Han times these words denoted, not magical practises, but civilization and culture. manifest.

The 28a reason that the state has gained this beauty, has Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia. obtained this fame, has enjoyed these blessings, and has received this gloryâis it not [the result of the fact that] the Grand Empress Dowager considers [that she must be diligent until] `sundown'28.1 28.1 An allusion to Book of History V, xv, 10 (Legge, p. 469). and that `in the evening' your Majesty is still `carefully' contemplating [your duties]?28.2 28.2 An allusion to Book of Changes, Hex. 1, 3 (Legge, p. 57). How [otherwise could it be] explained? "When there has been disorder, you have controlled it; when there has been danger, you have turned it to tranquillity; when there has been calamity, 35a you have led it to happiness; when [lines of descent] have been cut off, you have continued their succession, when [the Emperor] is young, you have taken his place and borne his burdens. Day and night, you have performed detailed labor; in cold and in heat, you have been diligent, without any time for relaxation, with unending unwearied effort. All was for the sake of the empire and to favor the Liu clan. "The courtiers, whether stupid or wise, and the common people, whether male or female, have all understood your high intentions. But the Marquis of An-chung, [Liu] Ch'ung2c, alone entertained perverse illusions in his heart and held rebellious thoughts, so that he raised his troops and moved the multitude, intending to endanger the imperial [ancestral] temples. Of his wickedness one cannot endure to hear and for his crime one cannot be patient with [mere] execution. Verily, he was an enemy of [loyal] subjects and [filial] sons,28.3 28.3 Chen-tzu is today a compound noun meaning "ministers of state." The difference between Han and recent usage is illustrated by this phrase, which is found twice in the Li-chi (Li-chi Chu-su 50: 2a, b = Legge, Li Ki, II, 258, 259), where it plainly means "courtiers [or subjects] and sons." a foe of the imperial 229WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, iv 99 A: 28a, b house, a rebel against the state, and an injury A.D. 6, May/June Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia. to the country. "For this reason, his clan and relatives by marriage quaked, became distant to him and gave information of his crimes; the common people dispersed, rebelled against him, and threw away their arms, so that in advancing he could not [take] a step and when he retired he suffered the calamity [visited upon] him [by Heaven]. His mother, who was near the end of her life, and his smiling babes, carried in [their nurses'] arms,28.4 28.4 "Hundred years " is a phrase from Book of Odes, I, xi, 4 (Legge, 187).

This practise is mentioned in Mencius III, B, ix, 5 (Legge, 280) and in Li-chi II, ii, iii, 18 (Legge, I, 195). In the latter it is the punishment for parricide. The translation "palace-building" for kung-shih is suggested by Duyvendak. The Erh-ya equates kung and shih. But after Ch'in times they were distinguished (Erh-ya Chu-su 5: 1a). They put four walls [around] its mound to the gods of the soils, covered it above, and 230WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, iv A.D. 6, May/June Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia. put a mat [on it] below,28.7 28.7 Wei Chao remarks, "Chan is ch'ai [firewood or a wooden fence]." Kung-yang Commentary 27: 5b, Dk. Ai, IV, vi, says, "The mound to the gods of the soils of a destroyed state is covered up; it is covered from above and ch'ai below," and Cheng HsÃ¼an, in a note to Chou-li 26: 3a, sub the Sang-chu, quotes the latter part of that sentence, using chan instead of ch'ai, so that these two words had the same meaning. Yen Shih-ku explains, "Chan means to use a mat to cover it. Below, it is chan, and above, it is, covered, in order that to block off and prevent the passage of the yin and yang emanations." Ma HsÃ¼-lun (xx cent.), in his Tu Liang-HS Chi, p. 18a, who quotes the preceding passages, states that the text means that the mound was covered by a bamboo framework, citing Shuo-wen 6 A: 6b, which explains chan by p'eng , a scaffold, and adds that it also denotes a bamboo wattled military chariot. King Wu is said to have levelled the mound of the Yin dynasty's gods of the soils at Po5 and to have distributed its soil to the nobles to serve as a warning against rebellion; four walls and a roof, with possibly a window only on the north, were built around the place to keep out the yang influence (which comes from Heaven with the sun); then the place was covered with a mat of branches, etc., to keep out the yin influence. so that spirits of 99 A: 28b, 29a the earth could not communicate [with those of heaven.28.8 28.8 Prof. Duyvendak suggests reading as , interpreting the clause to mean that the yin (spirits of the earth) and the yang (spirits of heaven) could not intercommunicate. The soil of] its mound was distributed to the nobles' [altars for the gods of the soils], so that when they went out of their gates and saw it, it would be visible to them as a warning. "Just now, when the empire heard that [Liu] Ch'ung2c rebelled, all wanted to raise up [the skirts of] their robes, [take] a two-edged sword in their hand, and rail at him. Those who first reached him, cut28.9 28.9 Wang Nien-sun states that should be read as , to chop, to make it parallel with the other clauses. his throat, struck his breast, pierced his body,28.10 28.10 The Sung Ch'i ed. states that for there was anciently written , but the Ching-yu ed. reads the former. The Tzu-lin K'ao-yi (by Jen Ta-ch'un, 17381789), basing itself on the Tzu-lin (by LÃ¼ Shen, iv cent.; book lost), declares that the first word of the latter phrase means ", to cut." and hacked his flesh. Those who came 29a later wanted to pull down his gates, break down his walls, raze his houses, and burn his utensils. [As rapidly as] an echo follows a sound, [their blood] stained the earth, so immediately was a wound created 231WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, iv 99 A: 29a [in people's feelings]. [The members of] the im- A.D. 6, May/June 28b perial house moreover [felt it] especially keenly, so that, when they spoke of him, they inevitably gnashed 36a their teeth. Why so? Because he had gone contrary Chang Sung's Memorial for Liu Chia. to and rebelled against your favor and beneficence and did not recognize where the greatest virtue lay. "The [members of] the imperial house, for the most part, live at places distant [from YÃ¼an]; I, Chia, have been fortunate to have been able to hear of [his rebellion] first and have not [been able] to resist my indignant desire. I wish to take the lead of the imperial house, myself, [with] my sons and my elder and younger brothers, to carry baskets on our shoulders and to bear mattocks,29.1 29.1 The official ed. reads yi for ho , and quotes the Sung Ch'i ed. as saying that yi should be ho. The Ching-yu ed. however reads ho. Wang Nien-sun adds that anciently yi was read like , with the upper tone, quoting in proof a line from the Lao-tzu ch. 58 in which yi is rhymed with , so that its pronunciation must have been quite similar to that of ho. gallop to Nan-yang [Commandery], and make a pond of [Liu] Ch'ung2c's palace-buildings, in order to cause them to be according to the ancient institutions. They, together with the mound to the gods of the soils belonging to [Liu] Ch'ung2c, should be like the mound to the gods of the soils at Po5,29.2 29.2 Po5 was the capital of the Yin dynasty; cf. n. 28.7. and should be used to grant to the nobles, in order that it may be an eternal lesson and warning. I wish that [this matter] may be referred to the Four Coadjutors, the ministers, and the grandees, for discussion, in order to make plain its right and wrong and to show it [as an example] to the four quarters [of the empire]." [Wang] Mang was thereupon very much pleased. Liu Chia and Chang Sung Rewarded. The ministers all said,29.3 29.3 Su YÃ¼ states that should probably be interchanged. "It would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Chia1s says," [so Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, 232WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I A.D. 6 which said, "Verily, although [Liu] Chia1s, a father 99 A: 29a, b and his sons, his elder and younger brothers, are related to [Liu] Ch'ung2c, they did not presume to show partiality to him. Whenever they saw some sprouts [of evil], they led each other in giving information [about it]. Now that this calamity [of rebellion] has come to pass, they unanimously and together [want to] take vengeance upon him. [Their act is] a response 29b to ancient institutions, so that their loyalty and filial devotion is apparent. "Let [Liu] Chia1s be enfeoffed with a thousand households of [the prefecture] of Tu-yen, as the Marquis Leading29.4 29.4 The text reads shih , but Ch'ien Ta-chao asserts that the word should be shuai1 , which is interchanged with shuai2 . On 99 B: 14a he is called the Shuai2-li Marquis; Wang Nien-sun adds that the T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan, ch. 201, quoting this passage, reads shuai1 (the Sung ed. reprinted in the "Szu-pu Ts'ung-K'an" and my reprint of a 1807 edition, 201: 4b, both read shih). by the Rules of Proper Conduct, and [let Liu] Chia1s's seven sons be all granted the noble rank of Marquises of the Imperial Domain." 36b Later [Chang] Sung was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Pure Virtue. In Ch'ang-an there was a saying about him, which said, "If you seek enfeoffment, Go to Chang [Sung] Po-sung. Strength in fighting Is not as good as cleverness in preparing memorials." [Wang] Mang also enfeoffed more than a hundred officials and common people of Nan-yang [Commandery] who had distinguished themselves. He made a stagnant pond of Liu Ch'ung2c's residence. 29a People who later plotted to rebel all had stagnant ponds [made out of their residences].29.5 29.5 We are told chiefly incidentally about such subsequent rebellions. HS 15 B: 50b mentions Lin Huang5b, Marquis of Wu-p'ing, who rebelled in A.D. 7. In 99 B: 13b, Sun Chien also mentions Liu K'uai, Liu Ts'engb, and Liu Kueib; cf. Glossary, sub vocibus. 233WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I 99 A: 29b The various courtiers furthermore advised [the A.D. 6 Wang Mang's Power Increased. Grand Empress Dowager] that Liu Ch'ung2c and the others had plotted treason because [Wang] Mang's power was too light, and that it would be proper to honor and make him more powerful in order that he might control [all] within [the four] seas. In the fifth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en, the July 1. [Grand] Empress Dowager issued an imperial edict He is made Acting Emperor. that when [Wang] Mang comes to a court audience of the [Grand] Empress Dowager, he should be called the Acting Emperor. In the winter, the tenth month, on [the day] ping- Sept. 11. ch'en, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.29.6 29.6 Cf. Appendix IV. Before this eclipse there appeared the varicolored horse of the constellation San-t'ai, the second portent urging Wang Mang to take the throne; cf. 99 B: 9b. In the twelfth month, various courtiers memorialized, A.D. 7, begging to increase the officials in the palace Jan./Feb. and in the home of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to His Residence is given the Honors of an Imperial Palace. the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], to establish a Chief Leader of Conscripts, Chiefs and Assistants in his Temple, Stable, and Kitchen, Palace Bodyguards, [Gentlemen] As Rapid as Tigers, and those of lower [rank, to the number of] more than a hundred persons, and also establish Guards [for him to the number of] three hundred persons. The rooms, [in the imperial palace], of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should be [called] the Regent's Apartments; his yamen should be [called the Regent's Hall; and his residence should be [called] the Regent's Palace.29.7 29.7 Hu San-hsing explains, "The rooms lu were his habitations shÃª for stopping and spending the night in the [Palace] Hall ; his yamen fu was his place for doing business; his residence ti was where he lived." The memorial was approved. [Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily when the late Grand Master, [K'ung] Kuang, died 234WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she I, II A.D. 7 previously, his achievements were already made 99 A: 29b, 30a 37a known. The Grand Guardian, [Wang] Shun4b, the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen] Feng, the General of Light Chariots, [Chen] Han, and the General of Foot-soldiers, [Sun] Chien, all formed plans for inducing 30a the Shan-yÃ¼ [to adopt Chinese customs]. His Associates' Sons Honored. They also had charge of the Spiritual Tower, the Ming-t'ang, the Pi-yung, and the four [altars for] the suburban sacrifices, and fixed their institutions and regulations. They opened up the Tzu-wu Road, were of the same mind with the Ruling Governor in delighting in virtue, and were in accord with his ideas and of mutual assistance to him, so that their achievements and virtuous conduct are abundant and apparent. [We] enfeoff the sons of [Wang] Shun: [Wang] K'uang1a as the Marquis of the Same Mind [with the Ruling Governor] and [Wang] Lin2 as the Marquis Delighting in Virtue; [K'ung] Kuang's grandson, [K'ung] Shou, as the Marquis of Accordance of Ideas; [Chen] Feng's grandson, [Chen] K'uang, as the Marquis of Mutual Assistance; and add [to the enfeoffments of Chen] Han and of [Sun] Chien, to each [the income of] three thousand households." The Ch'iang Rebel. In this year, P'ang T'ien, Fu Fan, and others of the Western Ch'iang, who had held a grudge [because Wang] Mang had taken away their land and made of it the commandery of Hsi-hai, rebelled and attacked the Grand Administrator of Hsi-hai [Commandery], 29b Ch'eng Yung. [Ch'eng] Yung fled hastily, [so Wang] Mang executed [Ch'eng] Yung and sent the Colonel Commissioner for the Ch'iang, Tou K'uang, to attack [the Ch'iang]. II In the second year, in the spring, Tou K'uang and Spring. others attacked and routed the Western Ch'iang. June/July. In the fifth month, [Wang Mang] changed [the Change of Coinage. coinage] and created as [objects of] exchange, [gold] inlaid knife [coins] (ts'o-tao), one of which was worth five thousand [cash], graving knife [coins] (ch'i-tao), 235WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she II 99 A: 30a one of which was worth five hundred [cash], and A.D. 7 large cash (ta-ch'ien), one of which was worth fifty [cash]. Together with the [previous] five-shu cash,30.1 30.1 Cf. HS 24 B: 21a, b (trans. in Appendix I to this chapter) and annotations. From the nature of this coinage, Wang Mang does not seem to have yet been aiming at the imperial throne, for he had to abolish the gilded knife-money when he took the throne. That change may however have been an afterthought. Cf. 24 B: 21b. [all of them were to] circulate together. Many common people cast counterfeit [money]. Full marquises and those of lower [rank] were not 37b permitted to possess actual gold; they were to transport it to the Imperial Wardrobe, to receive its value [in money]. Yet in the end he did not give them its value. In the ninth month, the Grand Administrator of Oct. Tung Commandery, Chai Yi, held his [annual] Chai Yi's Rebellion. general [military review and] examinations,30.2 30.2 The parallel passage in 84: 11a (cf. Glossary sub Chai Yi) makes it plain that the tu-shih (the annual review and inspection) occurred on a special day; in 76: 9a, when Han Yen-shou was Grand Administrator of the Tung Commandery, it is said that he "tu-shih and chiang-wu , set up axes and banners and practised archery and driving." Ju Shun, in a note to the former passage, explains, "The Grand Administrator, Chief Commandant, Prefects, Chiefs, Assistant [Prefects and Chiefs], and Commandants assembled to tu-shih, and were examined for their ranking [in efficiency]," but Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768) declares that this explanation is incorrect, for the tu-shih day was the day for chiang-wu (which latter term is found in Li-chi IV, vi, 20 [Couvreur, I, 396; Legge, I, 300] where it seems to mean, "give instructions on military operations"). He asserts that according to the Han dynasty's Code, in the autumn a tu-shih was regularly performed. The phrase tu-shih also occurs in HHS, Mem. 5: 2a3, where Li Hsien explains, "According to the Han law, on the day of the autumnal equinox, they tu-shih the cavalrymen and soldiers, which means that they were examined concerning their relative ranking [in military efficiency]." led [out] his chariots and cavalry, and made use of this occasion to mobilize emergency troops. He set up the Marquis of Yen-hsiang, Liu Hsin4g, as the Son of Heaven, and sent a call-to-arms to the commanderies and kingdoms, saying, "[Wang] Mang murdered Emperor P'ing by poison and, as Regent, [has taken to himself] the throne of the Son of Heaven, intending 236WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she II A.D. 7, Oct. to cut short [the reign of] the House of Han. 99 A: 30a, b Now we should respectfully30.3 30.3 I have adopted Yen Shih-Ku's interpretation, that should be read as . The latter character is found in the Ching-yu ed.'s note. inflict the punishment of Heaven and execute [Wang] Mang." Wang Mang's Fearfulness. In the commanderies and kingdoms he caused a crowd of more than a hundred thousand [persons] to doubt and suspect [Wang Mang.30.4 30.4 Cf. 84: 11a for another phrasing and a parallel account of this rebellion. Wang] Mang was frightened and afraid and could not eat. Day and night he held the Young Prince, [Liu Ying], in his arms. He gave information [to the gods] in prayers at [the altars for] the suburban sacrifices and at [the imperial ancestral] temples. He made a document after the model of the "Great Announcement,"30.5 30.5 This phrase is the title of ch. vii in Book of History V, (Legge, 362-375), which was supposed to have been written by the Duke of Chou in the name of King Ch'eng on the occasion of the revolt by the King's two Uncles of Kuan, of Ts'ai, and others. 30b and sent the Grandee-remonstrant Huan T'an and others to publish it in the empire and to proclaim the idea that, since [Wang Mang] had [only] the post of regent, he would be obliged to return the government [in due time] to the Young Prince. [Wang Mang] sent Wang Yi5, Sun Chien, and others, eight generals [in all], to attack [Chai] Yi, and distributed [others] to garrison the various passes and guard the barriers in the defiles. Rebellion Near the Capital. Some men of Huai-li, Chao Ming, Ho Hung, and others, raised troops in response to Chai Yi, and plotted with them, saying, "The generals and picked troops have all gone to the east, so that the imperial capital is empty [of troops] and it is possible to 30a attack Ch'ang-an." Their bands were quite large, 38a reaching almost a hundred thousand persons. [Wang] Mang was afraid and sent the generals, Wang Ch'i and Wang Chi6, leading troops, to resist them. He made the Grand Guardian, Chen Han, the General-in-chief. [Chen Han] received his axe 237WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she II 99 A: 30b of authority in the Temple of [Emperor] Kao [and A.D. 7, 8 was ordered] to lead the empire's troops. In his left [hand] he held his credentials and in his right [hand] he grasped his axe of authority. He encamped outside the city walls. Wang Shun4b and Chen Feng day and night patrolled in the [Palace] Halls. In the twelfth month, Wang Yi5 and the others Dec./Jan. routed Chai Yi at YÃ¼3. A.D. 8. The Director of Majesty, Ch'en Ch'ung, who had Chai Yi Defeated. been sent to superintend to army, sent [to Wang Mang] a letter, saying, "Your Majesty has upheld the great plan30.6 30.6 An allusion to the title of Book of History V, ch. iv (Legge, p. 320). of A Flattering Memorial. Heaven and in your heart you have accorded with [the prognostications from] the precious tortoise.30.7 30.7 An allusion to Book of History V, vii, 3 (Legge, p. 365). The "great mandate" is that of a dynasty (Book of History V, xiv, 5; Legge, 456); Ch'en Ch'ung hints that Wang Mang ought to be the actual Emperor. You have received the great mandate [of Heaven, so that] you know beforehand [what will] succeed [and what will] fail, and you were influenced by and responded to the auguries by the tortoise-shell and the lots. This means that you are the associate of Heaven. When a lord who is the associate of Heaven reflects, he changes the emanations; when he speaks, he moves [the many] beings and things; when he acts, he brings his transforming influence to success. "Your subject Ch'ung humbly read of the date when your written imperial edict was issued, and your humble servant compared it with the time [of the victory]. When your sage reflections were first begun, the rebellious caitiffs were then routed; when the words of your edict were first written, the rebellious caitiffs were seriously defeated, and when your written imperial decree was first issued, the rebellious caitiffs were completely beheaded. Before the many 238WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she II, III A.D. 8 generals had time to array the sword points [of their 99 A: 30b, 31a troops], and before I, your subject Ch'ung, had time to complete my foolish thoughts, the matter had been already settled." [Wang] Mang was greatly pleased. 31a 38b In the third year, in the spring, there was an earthquake, III and a general amnesty [was granted] to the Spring. empire. Wang Yi5 and the others returned to the imperial capital and went west to join with Wang Chi6 and the others to attack [Chao] Ming and [Ho] Hung, 84: 18b, who were all routed and annihilated. A discussion is 19a. in the "Memoir of Chai Yi." The Victory Banquet. [Wang] Mang held a great banquet in the White Tiger Hall of the Wei-yang Palace to make grants to the generals and leaders for their toil. In an imperial edict, [he ordered] Ch'en Ch'ung to examine 30b and estimate the military achievements [of the leaders] and rank them as high or low. Five Grades of Nobility Established. [Wang] Mang then sent [to the Grand Empress Dowager] a memorial which said, "In an age of brilliant sages, there are many capable persons in the state, hence at the time of T'ang [Yao] and YÃ¼ [Shun], in every house [someone] was capable of being enfeoffed and when their meritorious services had been performed and their work had been done, rewards were given. At the time of the assembly [called by] the Sovereign of the Hsia [dynasty, YÃ¼,] at T'u-shan, those who held jade and silk [at the ceremonies, belonged to] ten thousand states.31.1 31.1 A reference to Tso-chuan, Dk. Ai, VII; Legge, p. 814. Duyvendak remarks that the next sentence in the text, which I have placed in parentheses, is probably an interpolation from some commentary. It is now found in Tu YÃ¼'s (222-284) comment to the Tso-chuan passage. This sentence may however have been Wang Mang's citation of the classical authority for his establishment of the noble rank of Vassal at this time, in addition to his other five noble ranks, the classical authority for which is cited a little further on. (The nobles held jade and their sub-vassals held silk.) [In the time of] King Wu of the Chou [dynasty, at 239WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III 99 A: 31a the assembly] above the Meng Ford, there were still A.D. 8 eight hundred nobles. When the Duke of Chou occupied [the post] of Regent, he performed the suburban sacrifice to Prince Millet as the coadjutor of Heaven and performed in the Ming-t'ang the ancestral sacrifice to the greatest exemplar, to King Wen, as the coadjutor of the Lord on High. For this reason, when, within the four seas, each person came to [assist in] the sacrifice in accordance with his duty, there were indeed probably 1800 nobles. The Record of Proprieties (Li-chi), [in the chapter,] `The Royal Regulations,' [speaks of] more than seventeen hundred states.31.2 31.2 Li-chi III, i, 10 (Legge, I, 212; Couvreur, I, 269). For this reason, when Confucius composed the Classic of Filial Piety, he said, `[anciently, the brilliant kings] did not presume to neglect the ministers of [even] small statesâthen how much more dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons! 39a Hence they brought it about that the myriad states rejoiced in heart and therefore served [the King's] deceased predecessors.'31.3 31.3 Hsiao-ching ch. viii; 4: 1a (Legge, 474). The Official ed. of the HS lacks the word , but the Ching-yu ed. reads it. The Sung Ch'i ed. states that the Shao ed. (xi or xii cent.) has this word. The foregoing [was the result of] the Son of Heaven's filial piety. "The Ch'in [dynasty] acted contrary to the [right] way, killing the nobles and exterminating their clans, making [their territories] into commanderies and prefectures, with the intention of arrogating to itself [all] the benefits of the whole country. Hence [in the reign of] the Second Emperor, it fell and Emperor Kao received the mandate [of Heaven] to do away with [the Ch'in dynasty's] oppression. He examined [his subjects'] merits, distributed rewards, and established several hundred [kings' and marquises'] states. Later they declined considerably [in number] and the remainder have barely preserved [their noble 240WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III A.D. 8 ranks]. 99 A: 31a, b "You, Grand Empress Dowager, have yourself controlled the great fundamental [features of the government] and have extensively enfeoffed meritorious and virtuous [persons] in order to stimulate [people] to goodness. You have revived destroyed [nobilities], and continued [noble houses] that had been ended, 31b in order to perpetuate their lines. For this reason your great transforming influence has spread abroad and will be completely effective in a short time. "It happened that, when the Ch'iang malefactors injured Hsi-hai Commandery, when rebellious caitiffs 31a spread lying words in Tung Commandery, and when treasonable robbers misled the crowd [even] in the land west [of the imperial capital], no loyal subjects or filial sons failed to become angry, so that those against whom they made expeditions have been extirpated and have all suffered31.4 31.4 Wang Nien-sun asserts that pei should be read as fu1 (the usual word in this phrase) and that the word was probably originally fu2 ; anciently pei, fu1, and fu2 were all read like the second word in the phrase , hence were interchanged. Li Tz'u-ming suggests that pei should be , which is the same as fu2, quoting the use of this word in HHS, Mem. 61: 6b. for their crimes, with the result that the empire is altogether peaceful. "I31.5 31.5 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) did not have the word . The Ching-yu ed. also lacks it, I have omitted it. have been instituting rites and composing music, and have verified by investigation that there is an explicit written statement [to the effect that] the noble ranks of the Chou [period] were of five grades and that their lands were of four grades,31.6 31.6 Su Lin explains, "The five grades of noble ranks were dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. The four grades of lands were: the first grade, those of dukes; the second grade, those of marquises and earls; the third grade, those of viscounts and barons; the fourth grade, those of sub-vassals. and that there is the saying but no written statement that the noble ranks of the Yin [period] were of three grades.31.7 31.7 Yen Shih-ku glosses, "The first grade were dukes, the second grade were marquises, and the third grades were earls, viscounts, and barons." Su YÃ¼ remarks that the Po-hu-t'ung (i or iii cent.) 1: 1b quotes the Li-wei Han-wen-chia (end i cent.) as saying that in Yin times there were three grades of noble ranks and in Chou times there were five grades; the Kung-yang Commentary 5: 6a states that in the Spring and Autumn period, earls, viscounts, and barons were classed together as one grade, making, with dukes and marquises, three grades (the Ho Hsin [129-182] gloss states that the Spring and Autumn period reverted to the Yin practise); the Ch'un-ch'iu Fan-lu (by Tung Chung-shu, ca. 175-ca. 105 B.C.), 7: 7b, chap. 23, "San-tai Kai-chih," states that there were five grades of noble ranks in the Chou period and three grades in the Spring and Autumn period. Su YÃ¼ concludes, "Probably the explanations of the `modern text' school were such as [those referred to in the edict and Wang Mang] says, `There is not this written statement' [because] these words do not appear in the Classics." Confucius said, `The Chou [dynasty] 241WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III 99 A: 31b, 32a surveyed the two [preceding] dynasties. How replete A.D. 8 39b was its culture! I follow the Chou [dynasty].'31.8 31.8 Analects, III, xiv. Your subject begs that the various leaders who ought to receive noble ranks and estates should [be granted] noble ranks of five grades and lands of four grades." The memorial was approved. Thereupon the highest of those who were enfeoffed were made marquises and earls; the next were made viscounts and barons; those who would have been granted the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain [had their nobilities] changed and were entitled Sub-vassals. Altogether there were several 32a hundreds [of people enfeoffed]. Those who had attacked [the rebels in] Hsi-hai [Commandery] had [the word] Ch'iang used in their titles, [those who had attacked the rebels in] Huai-li had [the word] Wu (military) used in their titles; [those who had attacked] Chai Yi [had the word] caitiff (lu) used in their titles. The courtiers again memorialized, saying, "Of the His Sons Ennobled. persons whose merits the [Grand] Empress Dowager has embellished and whose virtue she has recorded, the greatest ones [will be remembered for] a thousand years, and the lesser ones for the present generation. Some were enfeoffed for civil [deeds] and some received noble ranks for military [acts]. None, 242WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III A.D. 8 [whether their merits were] deep or shallow, great 99A: 32a or small, have failed to be presented [for rewards]. "Now the Regent-Emperor, [Wang Mang], turns his back to the screen and mounts the eastern steps, so that it is proper that he should be [treated] differently from at the time when he was [merely] the chief minister of the state. Although his instituting [of regulations] and composing [of music and dances] has not yet been all completed, it is proper that the noble ranks of his two sons should be advanced and that both should be made dukes. "[According to the principle of] the Spring and Autumn [in the Kung-yang Commentary], that `treating well the good should be extended to their sons and grandsons and [treating well] the worthy to' their descendants,32.1 32.1 Kung-yang Commentary, 23: 7b; Dk. Chao, XX. it is proper that [these persons] should possess lands and territory. King Ch'eng 31b gave broad enfeoffments to the sons of the Duke of Chou by concubines, so that all his six sons had soil enveloped in quitch-grass [as a token of their enfeoffment]. So the relatives of the famous Chancellor [of State] and of [the famous] General-in-chief of the Han dynasty, Hsiao [Ho] and Ho [Kuang, respectively,] 40a were all [enfeoffed] together with their relatives and connections. [Wang Mang's] elder brother's son, [Wang] Kuang1, might first be enfeoffed as a full marquis. When the institutions and regulations are all completed, the Grand Minister over the Masses and the Grand Minister of Works should present the names of [Wang Mang's various grandsons] to the throne in accordance with the previous written imperial edict." The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "[We] promote the sons of the Regent-Emperor: the Marquis in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu], [Wang] An1a, to be the Duke Recommended 243WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III 99 A: 32a, b by [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu]; and the A.D. 8 Marquis in Reward to [the Marquis of Hsin-] tu, [Wang] Lin1a, to be the Duke in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin [-tu]; and enfeoff [Wang] Kuang1 as the Marquis of Vast Merit." At this time, [Wang] Mang returned his state of Hsin-tuc, so various courtiers again advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] and she enfeoffed [Wang] Mang's grandson, [Wang] Tsung, as the Marquis of Hsin-tuc. Since [Wang] Mang had annihilated Chai Yi, he He Plots to Become Emperor. himself considered that his majesty and virtue was increasing daily and that he had secured the assistance of Heaven and of men, so he plotted to ascend [the throne] as the actual [Emperor]. In the ninth month, [Wang] Mang's mother, the Oct./Nov. Baronetess of Apparent Merits, died. [Wang His Mother Dies. Mang's] mind was not upon mourning, so he had the [Grand] Empress Dowager issue an imperial edict [ordering] the discussion of [what] mourning garments [should be worn]. The Junior Supporter, the Hsi-and-Ho, Liu Hsin1a, with the Erudits and Confucians [to the number of] 78 persons [altogether], all said, "The principle of acting as Regent is to direct the performance of the duties established by Heaven, to promote the reverencing of the way of [the ancient 32b Sage]-lords,32.2 32.2 For this peculiar philosophical concept, cf. Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, p. 11; Bodde, China's First Unifier, p. 43. Here it means, "the highest ideals." to bring to a successful issue the laws His Mourning Rites. and regulations, and to make tranquil and concordant [all] within [the four] seas. Anciently, when T'ang the Victorious of the Yin [dynasty] had died and his Heir-apparent had died in his youth, his son T'ai-chia was a minor and unintelligent, so Yi Yin banished him to the T'ung Palace and acted as 40b Regent in order to promote the course of the Yin 244WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, ix A.D. 8, Oct./Nov. [dynasty]. When King Wu of the Chou [dynasty] 99 A: 32b had died, the ways of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed and `King Ch'eng was young' and a minor, `so the Duke of Chou protected King Ch'eng'32.3 32.3 A quotation from HsÃ¼ntze 4: 1a, Bk. VIII (Dubs, p. 91). (Reference from Lin Ch'ang.) and acted as Regent in order to perfect 32a the ways of the Chou [dynasty]. For this reason the Yin [dynasty] had the development of being `orderly'32.4 32.4 A quotation from Book of Odes, #305; IV, iii, v, 5 (Legge, p. 646). This adjective is applied to Wang Mang in HS 99 A: 12a. and the Chou [dynasty] had the merit of establishing but not employing the mutilating punishments.32.5 32.5 During the reigns of Kings Ch'eng and K'ang; cf. HFHD, II, 36, n. 5.1. "Now the Grand Empress Dowager has frequently `happened upon untoward circumstances in the state,'32.6 32.6 A quotation from Book of Odes, #286; IV, i, [iii], i, (Legge, p. 569). and has commissioned the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to rule and control the various officials, and to govern32.7 32.7 "Ruling" and "governing" allude to his title of Ruling Governor. Yen Shih-Ku states that the phrase translated "govern justly" means literally, "like the beam of a balance." the empire justly. It has happened that since the Young Prince is a minor and has not yet been able to be diligently respectful32.8 32.8 I follow Yen Shih-ku in reading as . to [the gods] above and below, August Heaven has sent down auspicious presages and has produced the portent of the red stone. For this reason, the Grand Empress Dowager followed the plain mandate of Heaven and issued an imperial edict that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent and mount the eastern steps in order that he might perform the duties of the sage Han [dynasty] and make it equally eminent with that of T'ang [Yao], YÃ¼ [Shun], and the three dynasties. 245WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, ix 99 A: 32a, b "The Regent-Emperor thereupon opened his pri- A.D. 8, Oct./Nov. vate yamen32.9 32.9 Pi-fu is also used in HS 30: 1b, "[Emperor] Hsiao-wu . . . thereupon had prepared blank fascicles for library writing tablets and set up an office for copying writings. He sent to it [for copying] even the accounts and sayings of the various philosophers. All [those books] were stored in his private courts (pi-fu)," i.e., the imperial private library (pi-). But to interpret the text here as declaring that Wang Mang "opened [to the public] the imperial private library" does not fit the context. We must take pi-fu in its generic sense, "private courts" or "private yamen." and met with various Confucians to institute rites and compose [the proper] music, to assist in fixing the [titles of] the many offices, and to complete beautifully the work of Heaven. His sage mind is in all respects complete, and eminent are his 41a individual insights. The Chou Rites (the Chou-li) was discovered and secured,32.10 32.10 K'ang Yu-wei, in his Hsin-hsÃ¼eh Wei-ching K'ao, ch. 6, p. 24, takes this passage to imply that Liu Hsin fabricated the Chou-li and deceived Wang Mang by means of it. The Chou-li however contains passages that date as far back as the iv cent. B.C.; cf. Karlgren, "The Early History of the Chou Li and Tso Chuan Texts," Bull. Mus. Far East. Antiq., no. 3 (1931), pp. 1-59. so that it was made plain what should be `followed' and `surveyed'.32.11 32.11 "Followed" is an allusion to Analects II, xxiii, 2 and "surveyed" is another allusion to ibid., III, xiv (from Li Ch'i). He took Heaven as his model and searched out ancient ways, yet modified them. It was just as when [K'ung Ch'iu] Chung-ni heard [the music] Shao,32.12 32.12 An allusion to Analects VII, xiii. and [just as] `the sun and moon' `cannot [be climbed 33a up to by any] stairs.'33.1 33.1 Allusions to Analects XIX, xxiv; xxv, 3, which praise Confucius. If [Wang Mang] had not 32b the utmost of sage wisdom, how could he have been able to perform these [deeds]? The fundamental and subordinate principles [of government] are all displayed and completed [except for] one basketful.33.2 33.2 An allusion to the Book of History V, v, 9 (Legge, p. 350) or to Analects IX, xviii. These [matters] are the means by which he has devoted himself to protecting and assisting the sage Han [dynasty] and giving tranquillity to the great multitude. 246WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, ix A.D. 8, Oct./Nov. "Now the Baronetess of Apparent Merits has died. 99 A: 33a, b The [Ceremonies and] Rites [Yi]-li [says], `The son of a concubine who becomes the heir [of his father] wears the three-month's szu mourning for his own mother,' and the explanation says, `He is in the same position as the most honorable person [in the family, i.e., his father, and so] should not presume to wear [deep] mourning for his own mother.'33.3 33.3 Yi-li 33: 4a, b (Steele, II, 37). The explanation is said to have been made by Tzu-hsia. The Regent-Emperor has, through his sage virtue, obtained the mandate of August Heaven, received the imperial edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager that he should act 41b as Regent and mount the eastern steps,33.4 33.4 The Official ed. emends to . The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. and support the descendant of the great Han imperial family. On the one hand, he has his weighty [duties] to Heaven, Earth, and the gods of the soils and the grains, and on the other hand, he has the care of the great multitude and the multifarious matters [of the government],33.5 33.5 A phrase from Book of History II, iii, 5 (Legge, p. 73; Couvreur, p. 47). so that he is not permitted to consider his own relatives. Hence the Grand Empress Dowager has established his eldest grandson [as a noble], causing him to be the marquis at Hsin-tuc and the successor to Marquis Ai, [Wang Wan], making plain that the Regent-Emperor is in the same position as the most honorable person, [the Emperor], upholds the sacrifices at [imperial] ancestral temples, 33b is in charge of supplying the needs of the Grand Empress Dowager, and is not permitted to wear mourning for his own parents. "The Chou Rites (Chou-li) says, `A king, . . . [in wearing mourning] for his nobles, [wears] the hemp 33a mourning badge and cap,' to which there is added a ring of `hemp banding.'33.6 33.6 Chou-li 21: 7a sub the Szu-fu, (Biot, II, 9 f). The Chou-li makes no distinction between mourning for those relatives of the same and of different surnames. Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C.-A.D. 83), in a note to that passage, says, "Szu has its woof of fifteen times eighty threads of hemp, half of which are dropped. The threads may be treated [i.e., cleaned]; but the cloth may not be treated." If Liu Hsin fabricated the Chou-li, it is curious that he should have quoted it so inexactly. If [the nobles] are of the 247WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III 99 A: 33b same surname [as the king], then [his mourning gar- A.D. 8 ments] are of hemp (Cannabis); if they are of a different surname, then they are of ke hemp (Pueraria). The Regent-Emperor ought to wear the hemp mourning badge for the Baronetess of Apparent Merits and a cap to which there has been added a hemp ring of banding, like the mourning garments of the Son of Heaven in condoling his nobles, in order to respond to the institutions of the sages." [Wang] Mang therefore acted [accordingly]. Altogether he paid one mourning [visit] and a second [time] assembled [the mourners] and ordered the Marquis of Hsin-tuc, [Wang] Tsung, to be in charge [of the ceremonies] and wear mourning to the third year. The Director of Majesty, Ch'en Ch'ung, memorialized Wang Mang's Nephew's Execution that the Marquis of Vast Merit, [Wang] Kuang1, had secretly sent a message to the Bearer of the Gilded Mace, Tou K'uang, and had ordered him to kill a man,33.7 33.7 The Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. read for the . But the Ching-yu ed. and Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 36: 18a read the latter, so I make no emendation. and that for this reason [Tou] K'uang had arrested and bound [this person] and had applied the law to him. [Wang] Mang was furious and bitterly reproached [Wang] Kuang1. [Wang] 42a Kuang1's mother said [to her son], "Do you yourself consider in what way [you are any different from Wang YÃ¼] Chang-sun or [Wang Huob] Chung-sun, [Wang Mang's dead sons]?" Thereupon [both of them], mother and son, committed suicide; together with [Tou] K'uang they all died. Previously, because [Wang] Mang had served his 248WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III A.D. 8 mother, had nourished his elder brother's wife, and 99 A: 33b, 34a had raised his elder brother's son, [Wang Kuang1], he had made a name [for himself]. Then later, his perversity and cruelty were again used to show [that he was actuated by] public spirit and sense of duty. 34a He ordered [Wang] Kuang1's son, [Wang] Chia1b, to inherit [his father's] noble rank and become the Marquis [of Vast Merits]. [Wang] Mang issued a written message,34.1 34.1 In this chapter, after Wang Mang is declared to have plotted to become actual Emperor (99 A: 32a), Pan Ku avoids stating that Wang Mang issued any "imperial edicts, chao ", or "imperial decrees, chih ." (These two terms are equated in 99 A: 30b, altho they were not precisely synonymous; cf. Mh II, 126, n. 2.) The full terms for these imperial orders were "written imperial edict, chao-shu " and "written imperial decree, chih-shu" (cf. Yen Shih-ku's statement, quoted in HFHD I, 192, n. 1). Pan Ku merely states that Wang Mang issued "written messages, shu" or, occasionally, "documents, ts'e " (99 B: 23a8). In this usage and in refusing to call Wang Mang by the title of emperor , Pan Ku indicates his loyalty to the Han dynasty. If he had written regularly that Wang Mang issued chao or chih, he would have implied that Wang Mang was a legitimate emperor. (Chao in 99 B: 20b5, 99 C: 4a2, 10b6, 11b7, 21a4, and chao-shu in 99 B: 25b1 are slips or later emendations, since they are contrary to Pan Ku's regular practise; chih-chao in 99 B: 25b1, chao-shu in 99 C: 13a11, and chao-ling in 99 C: 19b2 are probably quoted from Wang Mang's edicts. In other chapters, Pan Ku is not so careful: Wang Mang is said to issue imperial edicts (chao) in 24 A: 21b4, 22a3; B: 23a10, b5, and 25b11.) Pan Ku does not however refrain from quoting statements by others that Wang Mang issued imperial edicts (chao, 99 B: 23a1; C: 5b6, 16a2) or that he was the Son of Heaven (99 A: 36a8) and Emperor (99 B: 10b2). He allowed to Wang Mang the terms proclamation (, 99 A: 35a4) and ordinance (ling, 99 A: 35a4; B: 6a6). These terms, while used by emperors, could also be used by high nobles. He also allows Wang Mang to issue mandates (99 B: 1a12), charters (ts'e, 99 B: 1a12, 2b8), royally sealed messages hsi- shu (99 C: 16a9; hsi may denote either an imperial or a royal seal), and commands (, 99 B: 2b5, 23b11; this last term was not yet commonly used nor was its use as yet an imperial prerogative). The avoidance of chao and chih was a courtesy to the reigning Han dynasty and does not imply any perversion of the facts. The term shu for an imperial order is moreover unusual, so that any reader who knew the correct terms for imperial orders would immediately understand the reference to chao-shu or chih-shu. Thus Pan Ku actually preserved the original meaning, while extending to the Emperor, his patron, the proper courtesy. I have accordingly translated shu as "message." which said, "The principle of `stopping and hushing [instruments' 249WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III 99 A: 34a as a sign of mourning for the Emperor]34.2 34.2 An allusion to Book of History, II, i, v, 13 (Legge, p. 40f), where it is said that the people mourned for Yao to the third year, stopping and hushing the eight kinds of musical instruments. This written (edict) refers to the third year after the death of Emperor P'ing, including A.D. 6 as the first year. will A.D. 8, 9 end with the last month of [this] winter. In the first month [of the next year], at the suburban sacrifices, the eight [kinds of] musical instruments should be played. Altogether how many grades of 33b music [should be played by their own musicians] Mourning Rites for Nobles Ordered Fixed. for the kings, ministers, and gentlemen? For each of the several ranks, what should be the number of the five [kinds of] notes and the eight [kinds of] musical instruments? Let [the proper officials] with the Confucian Masters under their control each employ their spirits and minds to the utmost and set forth their ideas completely." In this year, Liu Ching1a, the Marquis of Kuang-jao, More Portents that he Should Become Emperor. Hu YÃ¼n, a Millenary of the General of Chariots and Cavalry, and Tsang Hung, a subordinate of the Grand Guardian, memorialized mandates [from Heaven through] portents. [Liu] Ching1a spoke of the new well in Ch'i Commandery, [Hu] YÃ¼n spoke of the stone ox in Pa Commandery and [Tsang] Hung spoke of the stone at Yung in the [Yu]-fu-feng [Commandery. Wang] Mang welcomed and accepted all [of them],34.3 34.3 For these portents, cf. the subsequent memorial. and in the eleventh month, 42b on [the day] chia-tzu, [Wang] Mang presented a A.D. 9, memorial to the [Grand] Empress Dowager, which Jan. 6. said, "When your Majesty with your extreme sagacity He asks to be Temporarily Emperor. `happened upon untoward circumstances in the state,'34.4 34.4 Another quotation of Book of Odes, #286; IV, i, [iii], i (Legge, p. 596). Cf. n. 32.6. and met with the dangers [at the end of] the twelve reigns of the Han [dynasty, at the end of] the three [times] seven [decades of years],34.5 34.5 Where this phrase occurs in HS 51: 33b, Chang Yen explains, "Three sevens is 210 years. From the beginning of the Han [dynasty] . . . to the death of Emperor P'ing was to the 210th year." Emperor Kao's first year was 206 B.C.; to the death of Emperor P'ing in the last month of the year beginning in A.D. 5 was actually 211 years. But Emperor Kao did not reign in his first year, so that the period was close enough. The text of that passage says that Lu Wen-shu's (fl. 73 B.C.) great uncle had by astrology calculated that after three seventies of years the Han dynasty would come into dangers. He memorialized the matter; in the time of Emperor Ch'eng, Ku Yung also made this prophecy (85: 15b); when Wang Mang wanted to displace the Han dynasty, he published these prophesies. Cf. Meng K'ang's note to 85: 15b. you 250WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, xi A.D. 9, Jan. 6 received a majestic mandate from Heaven, and 99 A: 34a, b issued an imperial mandate that I, your servant Mang, should act as Regent, should receive the care of the Young Prince, and should be entrusted with the charge of the empire. Your servant Mang was careful and vigilant, fearing lest I would be unworthy. "[A member of] the imperial house, the Marquis of Kuang-jao, Liu Ching1a, has sent to the throne a letter saying, Aug./ " `During the seventh month, Hsin Tang, the Sept., Chief of the Ch'ang-hsing Commune in the county A.D. 8. of Lin-tzu in Ch'i Commandery, in one night had a dream several times, which said, " ` "I am a messenger from his excellency Heaven. His excellency Heaven sent me to inform you, Chief of the Commune, saying, `The Regent-Emperor is due to be the actual [Emperor].' If you do not believe me, in this commune there is due to be a new well." 34b " `The Chief of the Commune arose at dawn and looked, and in the Commune there actually was a new well, which entered into the earth for almost a hundred feet.' Dec. 25, "In the eleventh month, on [the day] jen-tzu, A.D. 8. [which was a day] for establishing,34.6 34.6 Cf. n. 36.1. But the winter solstice occurred on Dec. 22 about 8 p.m.âillustrating the inaccuracy in ancient Chinese determinations of the solstice by the gnomen. and was the winter solstice, the stone ox from the Pa Commandery 251WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, xi 99 A: 34b [arrived] and, on [the day] mou-wu, the A.D. 9, Jan. 6 Dec. 31, inscription on the stone at Yung arrived at the Front A.D. 8. Hall of the Wei-yang Palace. When your servant, with the Grand Guardian, the Marquis of An-yang, 34a [Wang] Shun4b, and others were looking at them, a wind arose from Heaven and dust obscured things. When the wind ceased, we obtained a copper portent and a silk design from in front of the stone. Its 43a text reads, `A portent by which Heaven [proclaims that you should become] Emperor. The person who presents it should be enfeoffed as a marquis. Accept the mandate of Heaven And obey the command of the gods.' A Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Ts'ui Fa, and others looked at it and explained it. "Moreover previously, in [the reign of] Emperor Hsiao-ai, in [the year-period] Chien-p'ing, the second July 13, year, the sixth month, on [the day] chia-tzu, [the B.C. 5. Emperor] issued a written imperial edict changing [the year-period] and making it the first year of [the period] T'ai-ch'u-yÃ¼an-chiang. When the source of this [matter] is examined, [it is found to be] the books of revelation by Kan Chung-k'o and Hsia Ho-liang, which have been stored in the Orchid Terrace. Your servant Mang considers that the words, `the first year of [T'ai-ch'u]-yÃ¼an-chiang (great general)' [mean that] when `the General (Chiang)-in-chief acts as Regent, he will change the year-period (yÃ¼an),' which is a testimony for the present [time]. "The Book of History, [in the chapter], `The Announcement to the King's Uncle of K'ang,' [says], `[The Acting] King, [the Duke of Chou], speaks in the following fashion, "The chief of the nobles, Our younger brother, my little one, Feng, [the King's 252WANG MANG, ChÃ¼-she III, xi A.D. 9, Jan. 6 Uncle of K'ang]." '34.7 34.7 Book of History, V, ix, 2 (Legge, p. 383; Couvreur, p. 233). The Duke of Chou is using phraseology reserved for the ruler. The foregoing was the interpretation of this disputed passage in Han times. But cf. Karlgren, BMFEA 20, 278, Gl. 1622. The foregoing words [show 99 A: 34b, 35a that] the Duke of Chou, when acting as Regent, was 35a entitled King. In the Spring and Autumn, it is not said that Duke Yin ascended the throne, because he was Regent.35.1 35.1 In the Spring and Autumn, the first year of Duke Yin's reign lacks the statement of his accession which is found for all the other Dukes. Wang Mang accepts the explanation of the Tso-chuan, "It does not state that he took the throne, because he was a regent [for the infant Duke Hui]." This sentence is not translated by Legge, cf. p. 4-3 of his Ch'un Ts'ew. These two Classics were those fixed by the Duke of Chou and Confucius, indeed to be a model for later [generations]. Confucius said, `[The superior man] fears the Mandate of Heaven, fears the great, and fears the precepts of the Sages.'35.2 35.2 Analects XVI, viii, 1. [How can] your servant Mang presume not to obey? "Your servant begs that in respectfully serving the gods in heaven and earth, in the [imperial] ancestral 43b temples, and in memorializing the Grand Empress Dowager and the Empress [nee Wang] of [Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing, he may call himself `the Acting Emperor,' [but that] when he gives proclamations or ordinances to the empire or when [anyone in] the empire memorializes him about matters, they should not use [the words] `Regent' [i.e., should merely say, `Emperor']; that the third year of [the period] ChÃ¼-shÃª should become the first year of [the 34b period] Ch'u-shih,35.3 35.3 Szu-ma Kuang (1019-1086) in his Tzu-chih T'ung-chien K'ao-yi 2: 2b states that HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh's (149-209) Han-chi 30: 9a, together with Wei Kuang-mei's (fl. 881-4; book lost) Chia-hao Lu and Sung Hsiang's (996-1066; book lost) Chi-nien T'ung-p'u, all invert the name of this year-period to read Shih-ch'u. But the "Szu-pu Ts'ung-k'an" photographic reprint of a 1548 ed. of the Han-chi, 30: 9b and a 1696 ed. of the same book, 30: 9a, do not invert these words. Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 36: 17a moreover reads Ch'u-shih; only 36: 19a reads Shih-ch'u. Ch'u-shih might be translated "The original beginning [of Wang Mang's reign as Acting Emperor]." and that 120 gradations on the clepsydra [in a day] should be the rule,35.4 35.4 Cf. 11: 5b &amp; n. 5.9. which 253WANG MANG, Ch'u-shih I, xi 99 A: 35a, b should be used to respond to the Mandate of Heaven. A.D. 9, Jan. "Your servant Mang will day and night rear and raise the Young Prince and bring it about that he will be equal in virtue with King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] and [thus] spread abroad the majesty and virtue of the Grand Empress Dowager to all quarters, hoping to `enrich and then teach [the people].'35.5 35.5 An allusion to Analects XIII, ix, 3, 4. When the Young Prince is capped, I will `return [the government] to the intelligent prince,'35.6 35.6 A second quotation of Book of History V, xiii, 1 (Legge, p. 434). as in the former circumstance the Duke of Chou did." The memorial was approved. The mass of commoners knew [what was Wang Mang's] motive in receiving respectfully the mandate [given through] the portents. The courtiers discussed it extensively and memorialized separately in order to indicate the gradual [steps] by which he should take [the throne as] the actual [Emperor]. A Gentleman Attendant at the Gate,35.7 35.7 Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that in 1 A.D. the title of the Attendants at the Gate had been changed to the As Rapid as Tigers, and says that this title is a contradiction. Cf. Glossary sub vocibus. Chang An Abortive Rebellion. Ch'ung, and others, six persons [in all], plotted together to abduct [Wang] Mang and set up the King of Ch'u, [Liu YÃ¼1a, as Emperor, but the plot] became known and they were executed and died. Ai Chang, a man of Tzu3a-t'ung, had been doing 35b elementary studying in Ch'ang-an. Heretofore he had no distinction but loved to boast. When he saw that [Wang] Mang was acting as Regent, he immediately made a bronze casket with two envelop covers.35.8 35.8 Hu San-hsing explains, "Mao Huang (fl. dur. 1131-1163) says, `A chien is the cover of a letter, which has the cavity for the seal, and the inscription." The chien was the ancient wooden envelop top; cf. HFHD II, 86, n. 25.1. He wrote on one of them, "The design 254WANG MANG, Ch'u-shih I, xi A.D. 9, Jan. 8 in the metal casket [with] the Seal of the Lord of 99A: 35b 44a Heaven's Act." On the other he wrote, "The written Ai Chang's Portent from Emperor Kao. metal charter [with] the Seal of the Red Lord's Act,35.9 35.9 The legends of these seals imitate the legends on the imperial seals. Cf. HFHD, I, 56, n. 3. The Sung Ch'i ed. reported that the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) and the Shao ed. (xi or xii cent.) lacked the second . The Ching-yu ed. also lacks it. which a certain person transmits to the Yellow Emperor, [Wang Mang." (Instead of] "certain person" [there was written Pang], the personal name of Emperor Kao). The writing said that Wang Mang should be the actual Son of Heaven and the [Grand] Empress Dowager [should act] according to the mandate of Heaven. Both on the design and the writing were written [the names of] eight persons who were [Wang] Mang's high officials. It also named two fine names, Wang Hsing (Wang Rises) and Wang Sheng (Wang Prospers); [Ai] Chang, taking advantage [of this opportunity, also] inserted his own surname and personal name amongst [them, so that] altogether there were eleven persons. For all of them there were written official [titles] and 35a noble ranks as [Wang Mang's] coadjutors and assistants. When [Ai] Chang heard that the matters of the well in Ch'i [Commandery] and of the stone ox had Jan.8.35.10 35.10 Cf.

According to that passage, such temples had assistants as well as Prefects or Chiefs; possibly, because of Emperor Kao's eminence, a Supervisor had been appointed for his temple. 255WANG MANG, Ch'u-shih I, xi 99 A: 35b, 36a The Supervisor thereupon reported it. A.D. 9, Jan. 10 On [the day] mou-ch'en,35.12 35.12 According to 99 B: 10b, Wang Mang received the mandate on the previous day, Jan. 9; but that is possibly a change to suit the theory of the five elements. [Wang] Mang went to Jan. 10. the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, bowed, and received He Takes the Throne as Actual Emperor. the metal casket and the resignation [of the Han dynasty, which] the gods had [commanded]. Wearing the royal hat,35.13 35.13 Wang Mang followed the classical Chou practise, which entitled the monarch, "the King." He also used the title, "emperor." He used the ordinary first personal pronoun and not the special imperial personal pronoun established by the First Emperor of the unclassical Ch'in dynasty. he visited the [Grand] Empress Dowager, returned, seated himself in the Front Hall of the Wei-yang Palace, and issued a written message, which said: "I possess no virtue, [but] I rely upon [the fact His Announcement. that] I am a descendant of my august deceased original ancestor, the Yellow Lord, and a distant descendant of my august deceased first ancestor, the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], and the least of the Grand Empress Dowager's relatives. August Heaven and the Lords on High have made abundantly apparent their great assistance, so that the mandate [of Heaven] has been completed and the succession [to the imperial rule] has been set in order. By portents and credentials, designs and writings, a metal casket 44b and a written charter, the gods have proclaimed that they entrust me with the myriad common people of the empire. "The Red Lord is the genius of Emperor Kao of the Han dynasty. He has received a mandate from Heaven and has transmitted the state [to me by] a 36a writing on a metal charter. I have been extremely reverent and awedâ[how could I] presume not to receive it respectfully? On [the day] mou-ch'en, Jan. 10. which is a day for founding,36.1 36.1 The twelve branches were used to indicate the months, in accordance with the position taken by the handle of the Dipper at dusk, and the days of the month were given astrological significence in accordance with the branch for the month. SC 27: 8 (Mh III, 341), in discussing the constellation Po-tou (the Northern Bushel or the Dipper), says, "[The star] used to determine (chien ) [the month] at dusk is Piao [? U Ma here; elsewhere Piao denotes ?, ?, and ? U Ma]." The astronomical designation for the months, which consists of the word chien with one of the twelve "branches," comes accordingly from the direction taken by a line drawn through this star and the tail star in the handle of the Dipper in the various months. At the winter solstice, the handle of the Dipper points to the northern horizon at dusk; due north is called tzu; hence the month containing the winter solstice is called the chien-tzu month, i.e., the first astronomical month. The other "branches" are distributed about the horizon; cf. de Saussure, Les origines de l'astronomie chinoise, p. 237," who indicates that in Han times this method of determining the months was more theoretical than practical. The eleventh month of this year was accordingly the month chien-tzu, i.e., "the [month when] the determining stars point north." The particular branch used to denote a day in naming the day by the sixty cyclical characters (each of which names contains one "branch" and one "stem") is given an astrological significance which depends upon which branch denotes the month. Huai-nan-tzu, 3: 12a, "T'ien-wen HsÃ¼n," says, "If yin is chien [which clause means both of two things in accordance with two meanings of the word chien: "If the day having the branch yin occurs in the month having the branch yin," and "The day yin is (in that case) the day for establishing"], [the branch] mao is to remove; ch'en is to fill full; is to be tranquil, it is in charge of life; wu is to determine; wei is to grasp, it is in charge of danger; shen is to break, it is in charge of yokes; yu is to be solicitous, it is in charge of attracting to oneself; hsÃ¼ is to be completed, it is in charge of small virtues; hai is to receive, it is in charge of great virtue; tzu is to open, it is in charge of the planet Jupiter; ch'ou is to close, it is in charge of the retrograde correlate of the planet Jupiter." , , (The terms used to give the meanings of the various days all have many meanings, so that the above translation is only approximate; diviners doubtless rung the changes on those words.) The Huai-nan-tzu is interpreting the meanings of those days for a chien-yin month only; in a chien-mao month, the meanings would be shifted along; the day mao would be the day for establishing, ch'en the day for removing, etc. Chou Shou-ch'ang states that today in general, "removing, being solicitous, determining, and grasping are lucky; establishing, filling full, being tranquil, and receiving are the next [lucky days]; to be completed and to open are also lucky; to be closed and to be broken are therefore unlucky. [This is sufficient] to show that this method was already [used] in Han [times]." Since in this case the eleventh month was the month chien-tzu, the interpretations of the branches would accordingly be shifted to mean, tzu is to be established, ch'ou is to remove, . . . ch'en is to determine; etc., and thus the interpretation in this passage and on p. 34b above was generated. Wang Mang seems to have made much of this astrological interpretation for the cyclical days. A calendar for 63 B.C., found by Stein in the limes at Tun-huang (Chavannes, Docu ments chinois, p. 10-14) marks these "determining" days by the word after the day containing the "day for establishing" in each month. Chavannes notes that within a month these "days for establishing" (he misunderstands and translates, "points fixes") are twelve days apart, but in two successive months the "days for establishing" are separated by thirteen days. (Since in successive months the sun advances to the next one of the twelve cardinal points, indicated by the twelve branches, the days containing the next branch will be "days for establishing," so that thirteen, not twelve days separate "days for establishing" in successive months.) It is interesting to find this astrological device so popular that it was put into the calendar half a century before the time of Wang Mang. This precise method of determining lucky and unlucky days seems to have been lost. but the terms, "establishing," "fill full," "be tranquil," etc. are still used; cf. Duyvendak in T'oung Pao, v. 32 (1936), p. 297 &amp; n. 3; H. DorÃ©, Recherches sur les Superstitions en Chine, IÃ¨re partie, tome II ("Var. Sin." no. 34), p. 269; PP. Havret &amp; Chambeau, "Notes Concernant la chronologie chinoise," pp. 29, 30, in MÃ©langes sur la chronologie chinoise, ("Var. Sin.," no. 52).

Sui-shu 16: 27a, "The Treatise on the Musical Tubes and the Calendar, Part A," at the end quotes an inscription of the same date as this edict, "In the Later Wei [dynasty], during [the period] Ching-ming [500-503], a man of Ping Province, Wang Hsien-ta, presented one ancient bronze balance, on the top of which there were engraved 81 words. The engraving reads, `A legal balance in which the picul has the weight of four chÃ¼n.' It said also [the remainder of this inscription is also to be found on Wang Mang's Standard Measure, cf. Chin-shih-so, chin, 2: 51b, 52a. It is explained in Ma Heng, The Fifteen Different Classes of Measures as given in the LÃ¼ Li Chih of the Sui Dynasty History, trans. by John C. Ferguson, p. 5, 6], " `The Yellow Lord was my original ancestor. In a cycle, his virtue came to YÃ¼ [Shun]. Lord YÃ¼ [Shun] was my first ancestor. In a cycle, his virtue came to the Hsin [dynasty]. When the planet Jupiter was in Ta-liang [Taurus] and the [Azure] Dragon [the hypothetical symmetrically placed and retrograding correlate of Jupiter] [was in mou-ch'en (these words are omitted in the Sui History by a dittographic lapse, but are found in the Chin-shih-so and are needed for the rhythm)], on [the day] mou-ch'en, which was a day for founding, [Jan. 10, A.D. 9], by the mandate of Heaven, a [certain] commoner [the Sui History reads "man" because of the taboo in T'ang times on the word ming, "commoner"], who depended upon the virtue of [the element] earth, received his dynastic title, ascended [the throne as] the actual [Emperor], and changed the first [month of the year to be the astronomical] second month. May he have long life, be eminent, and prosperous! "He made uniform the musical tubes, the measures of length, the measures of capacity, and the weights" [a quotation from the Book of History II, I, iii, 8 (Legge, p. 35)], investigating so that they are in accordance with [those of] the ancients. When the [Azure] Dragon was in Chi-szu and the planet Jupiter was in Shih-shen [the constellation Pi, i.e., in the next Chinese year, A.D. 9], [this regulation] was first proclaimed to the empire, so that all countries should forever obey it from generation to generation and it should be enjoyed and transmitted for a hundred thousand years.' "This [balance] was also made under Wang Mang. At that time the Chief of the Great Music, Kung-sun Ch'ung [not mentioned in the HS or HHS], first prepared and evaluated the foot [measure] according to the Han institutions. Moreover we see that this weight is an evaluation of the Hsin [dynasty], which evaluated it, [so that one picul] should weigh 120 catties. The evaluation and the weights of the Hsin [dynasty] were according to [Wang Mang's] portents and documents, so that they were entrusted to [Kung-sun] Ch'ung." 258WANG MANG, Ch'u-shih I, xi A.D. 9, Jan. 10 "Let there be a change in the first day of the first 99 A: 36a, b month, an alternation in the colors of the [court] robes, a variation in the sacrifical victims, a difference in the standards and pennons, and a diversity in the utensils and institutions. Let the first day of the Jan. 15. twelfth month, [the day] kuei-yu, become the first day of the first month in the first year of [the year-period Shih]-chien-kuo,36.3 36.3 Liu Pin notes that Wang Mang named this new period Shih-chien-kuo and suggests that the word shih has dropped out of the text. The year was now to begin with the second (chien-ch'ou) astronomical month, not, as previously, with the third (chien-yin) astronomical month. This change was made in order to follow Tung Chung-shu's doctrine of triple dynastic beginnings, in accordance with which the Han dynasty ruled by virtue of the black dynastic beginning, so that the next dynasty would rule by virtue of the white dynastic beginning . Cf. Ku Chieh-kang, Ku-shih-pien V, 443, 599. In A.D. 23, the rebels against Wang Mang changed back to the Han practise of beginning the year with the third astronomical month. Ho Ch'uo remarks that in A.D. 237, Emperor Ming of the Wei dynasty, Ts'ao Jui, again changed and used the second astronomical month as the first month of the year, but his son Fang changed the first month back to the third astronomical month when he ascended the throne in 240. and let the crowing of the 36b cock be the hour.36.4 36.4 Hu San-hsing remarks that the second double-hour, ch'ou (1-3 a.m.), was now taken as the beginning of the day, just as the chien-ch'ou month was taken as the first month. The justification of this change was the same as that for the change in the first month of the year; cf. n. 36.3. The colors of robes shall match the virtue [of the ruling element, earth, so that] yellow shall be esteemed. The sacrificial victims 35b shall correspond to the first month, and so shall be 259 white.36.5 36.5 Hu San-hsing explains, "[Wang Mang] considered that [the element] earth succeeded to that of fire, [which latter was the element taken by the Han dynasty], hence he took, [as the imperial color], the [color] yellow. All things knot (niu ) their sprouts in the ch'ou ([astronomical] second month, [which was the former calendrical twelfth month]). Its color is white. [Wang Mang] hence responded to the first [month of his calendar year] by employing white." Shuo-wen 14 B: 7a, sub ch'ou (which is the word used to denote the second astronomical month) says, "To knot (niu [a play on words, found in Huai-nan-tzu ch. 3; Mh III, 306; etc.]). In the twelfth [calendrical] month, all things move and [begin to] act. It symbolizes the shape of a fist." The color yellow is that of the element earth, which, according to the Liu Hsiang's theory of the succession of the elements, followed the element fire, the element by virtue of which the Han dynasty ruled; cf. 99 C: n. 24.1; Ku Chieh-Kang, Ku-shih-pien, V, 599. The color of the sacrificial victims, white, was taken from Tung Chung-shu's triple theory; cf. n. 36.3. Wang Mang was using eclectically the theories of both these great Han teachers. The pennons and banners of commissioners' credentials shall all be made pure yellow. The writing on them shall be, `Credentials of the Five Majestic [Principles] for Commissioners of the Hsin [Dynasty],' to accord with the majestic mandate of August Heaven and the Lords on High." 260 THE HISTORY OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] [Chapter] XCIX THE SIXTY-NINTH [MEMOIR] The Memoir of Wang Mang PART B I In [the year-period] Shih-chien-kuo, the first year, A.D. 9, the first month, on the first day of the month, [Wang] Jan. 15.

Seemingly the Grand Empress Dowager's ceremonial apron was made of silk instead of leather, as befits a lady, and the word for this article, when the article is made of silk, could be written with the silk radical as early as the time of Wang Mang or of Pan Ku; cf. 99 A: n. 18.3. of an Empress Dowager and present it to the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang,1.2 1.2 The Grand Empress Dowager bitterly opposed Wang Mang's usurpation of the imperial title; she possessed the Ch'in dynasty's imperial seal, which Chao Tzu-ying had surrendered to Emperor Kao, and which was called "The seal whereby the Han dynasty transmits the state ." When Wang Mang asked for this important seal, she refused to give it up, saying that Wang Mang was worse than a pig or dog. She was however compelled by threats to give up this seal and she accepted the Hsin dynasty's seal. But secretly she continued certain of the Han dynasty's practises, which Wang Mang had abolished. Cf. 98: 13a-15a; Glossary sub Wang, Grand Empress Dowager nee. Wang Mang made her his Empress Dowager, i.e., instead of being the grandmother of a Han emperor, she became the (adopted) mother of the Hsin emperor. Wang Mang later wore mourning for her as for his own mother; cf. 99 B: 21b. in order to] obey the mandate [given through] the portents and do away with her title An Heir-Apparent Appointed. from the Han [dynasty]. Previously, [Wang] Mang had married a daughter of the Marquis of Yi-ch'una, [Wang Hsien2a], who was surnamed Wang.1.3 1.3 The Wang clan of Yi-ch'un was not related to the Wang clan of YÃ¼an-ch'eng, to which Wang Mang belonged, so that this marriage was considered quite proper; cf. 99 B: 6a &amp; n. 6.4. She was made the Empress. 261WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I, i 99 B: 1a, b She had originally given birth to four boys: YÃ¼3, A.D. 9, Jan. 15 HUOb, An1a, and Lin1a. Two sons had previously been executed. [Wang] An1a's mind was almost completely gone, so [Wang Mang] made [Wang] Lin1a the Imperial Heir-apparent, and made [Wang] An1a the Admirable Prince of the Hsin [House. Wang Mang] enfeoffed the six sons of [Wang] YÃ¼: [Wang] Ch'ien2 as Duke of Prospering Merits, [Wang] Shou as Duke of Brilliant Merits, [Wang] Chi5b as Duke of Perfected Merits, [Wang] Tsung as Duke of Eminent Merits, [Wang] Shih as Duke of Shining Merits, and [Wang] Li4 as Duke of Marked Merits. A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. [Wang] Mang thereupon gave a charter-mandate to the Young Prince [Liu Ying1a], which said, " `O 1b thou'1.4 1.4 A phrase from Analects XX, i, 1. Ying! Anciently, August Heaven assisted 1b the Grand Founder of your [dynasty, Emperor Kao, The Han Young Prince is Dismissed so that his descendants] succeeded [each other] for twelve reigns and enjoyed the state for two hundred ten years. `The [Heaven]-determined order of succession rests upon my person.'1.5 1.5 A quotation from Book of History, II, ii, 14 (Legge, p. 61) and Analects XX, i, 1. Does not the Book 1b of Odes say, `They became subject to the Chou [dynasty, for] the mandate of Heaven is not constant'?1.6 1.6 Book of Odes, 235; III, i, i, 5 (Legge, p. 430). I enfeoff you as the Duke of Established Tranquillity, foreover to be a guest of the Hsin House. Alas! Reverence the beneficence of Heaven. Go and take your position and do not neglect my commands." It also said, "Let a region a hundred li square, with altogether ten thousand households in [the prefectures of] P'ing-yÃ¼an, An-tÃª, T'a-yin, Ko, and Chung-ch'iu become the state of the Duke of Established Tranquillity, and let there be set up a temple to his ancestors, [the Emperors] of the Han [dynasty], 262WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I, i A.D. 9, Jan. 15 The Han Young Prince. at his state, just as [was done] for the de- 99 B: 1b, 2a scendants of the Chou [dynasty].1.7 1.7 Cf.

Let the Empress [nee Wang] of [Emperor] Hsiao-p'ing become the Duchess Dowager of Established Tranquillity." When the reading of the charter was ended, [Wang] Mang himself grasped the hand of the Young Prince, dropped tears, and sighed, saying, "Anciently, when the Duke of Chou had the position of regent, he was finally able to `return [the government] to his intelligent 2a prince.'1.10 1.10 A quotation of Book of History V, xiii, 1 (Legge, p. 434) for the third time in this chapter. [But] now, only [because] I am pressed by the majestic mandate of August Heaven, am I unable to follow my intention [to return the government to you]." He sorrowed and sighed for a long time. A Palace Tutor took the Young Prince 2a down below the Hall, faced him north, and pronounced him a subject [of the new dynasty]. None of the many lower officials who acted as assistants to those who had positions [in the court at this ceremony] failed to be moved and influenced. The Ministers Ennobled. The coadjuting ministers were moreover all enfeoffed and installed according to [the list in] the metal casket. The Grand Tutor Assisting on the Left and General of Agile Cavalry, the Marquis of An-yang, Wang Shun4b, became the Grand Master and was enfeoffed as the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Hsin [Dynasty].

Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the Southern ed. (poss. x cent., or the Southern Academy ed., 1531) reads for . The Ching-yu ed. agrees with our text. Ai Chang, from Tzu3a-t'ung in Kuang-han [Commandery], became the State General and the Duke Beautifying the Hsin [Dynasty]. The foregoing were the Four Coadjutors. Their rank was that of the highest rank of the highest [ministers]. The Grand Guardian Serving at the Rear, the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang, Chen Han, became the Commander-in-chief and the Duke Serving the Hsin [Dynasty]. The Marquis Making Great Efforts, Wang HsÃ¼n3, became the Grand Minister over the Masses and the Duke Ornamenting the Hsin [Dynasty]. The General of Foot-soldiers, the Marquis of Ch'eng-tub, Wang Yi5, became the Grand Minister of Works and the Duke Prospering the Hsin [Dynasty]. The foregoing were the three highest ministers. The Grand Supporter Aiding on the Right, the Grand Minister of Works and General of the Guard, the Marquis of Kuang-yang, Chen Feng, became the General of a New Beginning and the Duke Extending the Hsin [Dynasty]. Wang Hsinga, from the imperial 2b capital, became the General of the Guard and the Duke Upholding the Hsin [Dynasty]. The General of Light Chariots, the Marquis of Ch'eng-wu, Sun Chien, became the General Establishing the State and the Duke Perfecting the Hsin [Dynasty]. Wang Sheng, from the imperial capital, became the General of the Van and the Duke Exalting the Hsin [Dynasty]. The foregoing were the Four Generals. Altogether there were eleven highest ministers. 264WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I, i A.D. 9, Jan. 15 Wang Hsinga was a former clerk to a Prefect of a 99 B: 2a, b 2b City-gate,2.2 2.2 Hu San-hsing explains, " `A clerk to a Prefect of a City-gate' served a Colonel of a City-gate. He had charge of writings." and Wang Sheng had been a seller of cakes. In accordance with the mandate [given through] the portent, [Wang] Mang sought out and secured more than ten persons with these surnames and given names. These two persons' features responded to divination and physiognomization, so they were elevated directly from [the condition of] wearing plain clothes and were given [these high] offices, in order to show that it was a supernatural [matter]. The other persons [with these surnames and given names] were all installed as Gentlemen. On this day, altogether several hundred persons were enfeoffed and installed in the offices of high ministers, grandees, Palace Attendants, and Masters of Writing.

It was ordered that [Liu Ying1a's] nurses2.4 2.4 Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) asserts that the word pao should be inserted after the o , in accordance with Han-chi 30: 10b. He declares that pao and o are always used together, that without pao the phrasing would not be good and the meaning (merely "wet-nurses," omitting the other nurses) would not be complete. In HS 75: 26a, a similar phrasing, pao-o, is read. and wet-nurses should not be permitted to talk with him.

Later [Wang] Mang married him to his granddaughter (a child of 3a [Wang] YÃ¼3).2.5 2.5 Yang Shu-ta, in his "Examples of Historical Method in the HS," Yenching Jour. of Chin. Studies, no. 3, June, 1928, p. 441 f, states that the phrase, "a child of [Wang] YÃ¼," is an example of Pan Ku's use of author's explanatory notesâa practise first used by him in a historical work. Since the practise of writing annotations in smaller characters was not invented until a generation later (Ma Jung is said to have first used it in his edition of the Chou-li, A.D. 138-40; cf. Maspero, "Melanges Chinois et Bouddhiques," Inst. Belge des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, I [1931-32], p. 183), Pan Ku had to insert such an annotation into the text as a phrase in apposition with the term explained, which appository phrase accordingly interrupts the sentence. Yang Shu-ta instances seven other examples from different parts of the HS. Perhaps this use of explanatory notes was taken by Pan Ku from official documents such as the edict of Wang Mang to be found on 99 B: 25b.

At the vernal and autumnal equinoxes a gnomen is set up to determine [due] east and west. East is where the sun first rises [at the equinoxes], hence `its shadow is examined by the sun-dial' belongs to [the planet Jupiter]." "As [the planet] Mars presides over `wisdom',2.9 2.9 Mars was supposed to punish violations of the rites by unusual heat; cf. Mh III, 364. Ying Shao glosses, "[Mars] punishes [lack of wisdom] by prolonged heat." so [the Chief of] the Southern [Sacred] Peak and Grand Tutor is in charge of bringing `timely 3a warmth.'2.10 2.10 Chin Shao comments, "The southern quarter is the seat whence the yang principle rises." As its red spendor enlarges tranquillity, so he investigates sounds by the musical tubes."3.1 3.1 Chin Shao explains, "Yung is (enlarge, be liberal, pardon). [Yen Shih-ku explains yung as . These two words are interchanged.] Summer [archaic pronunciation g'Ã¥] [means] (to enlarge [archaic pronunciation kÃ¥; an assonance]. Things grow large, whereupon they manifest their tranquillity. The sixth month [is the time for] the beginning of the yin emanation, hence the earth is made to rule. `The middle number of earth is six. Six is the musical tube, [huang-chung]. The musical tube has a shape and a color. Its ruling color is yellow.' [A quotation from HS 21 A: 5b]. Hence `investigating the sounds by the musical tubes' belongs to [the planet Mars]." "As [the planet] Venus presides over `orderliness,' so [the Chief of] the Western [Sacred] Peak and 267WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 3a State Master has charge of bringing `timely sun- A.D. 9 shine.'3.2 3.2 Ying Shao explains, "When [a person's] words are not in accordance [with the Way], this is what is meant by not-yi . Yi makes peaceful . The punishment for [failing to do] this is always [a superabundance of the principle] yang. Yang brings drought." Instead of yang , Book of History V, iv, 34 has , cool sunshine. Yen Shih-ku adds, "Yi should be read as ." Mh III, 371 states that Venus presides over killing and punishes murder. As its white splendor gives form to tranquillity, 3a so he investigates measures of capacity by weighing instruments."3.3 3.3 Ying Shao explains, "The measures of capacity are the tou and hu. are the steelyard and balances ." Chin Shao adds, "All things perfect their forms in the western quarter [autumn, so that] their size and weight may all be known. Hence scales and `measures of capacity' belong to [the planet Venus]." "As [the planet] Mercury presides over `deliberation,' so [the Chief of] the Northern [Sacred] Peak and State General has charge of bringing `timely 3b cold.'3.4 3.4 Ying Shao explains, "To listen to a person [but] without attentiveness, this is what is meant by not deliberating well. Mou is . The punishment [for failing to do] this is prolonged cold." Chin Shao adds, "North is to be prostrated. When the yang emanation is prostrate underneath [the earth], the yin principle has charge of killing. Hence he has the State General guard against it." Mh III, 379 says that Mercury punishes for incorrect punishments. As its sombre brilliance harmonizes tranquillity, so he investigates the planets by the clepsydra."3.5 3.5 Ying Shao explains, "We investigate the courses and degrees of the five planets by the clepsydra and its divisions." Chin Shao adds, "Ho is to unite . All things are all united and stored in the northern quarter [winter]. Mercury is also in charge of peace, hence he said, `harmonizes tranquillity.' The regulations for the calendar arise from [the constellation] Tou [the Bushel, Ursa Major], which distinguishes the revolutions of the sun and moon by [the constellation] She-t'i [?, ?, ?; ?, ?, ? Bootes]. She-t'i occupies the place where the handle of the Bushel points, and is used to establish the seasons and the [twenty-four] solar terms, hence `investigating the planets' belongs to [the planet Mercury]." "As the Moon [has charge of] punishments, and is the great limb3.6 3.6 I.e., executive; the officials were considered to be the "arms and legs" of the Emperor. [of the heavenly powers], so the Commander-[in-chief] on the left has charge of bringing about military responses [to evil deeds. 268WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 Charters to Ministers. As we] investigate squareness3.7 3.7 The earth was thought to be square and heaven round; both the moon and the earth are yin; hence heavenly phenomena that concern the earth (astrology) belong to the commander-in-chief. by the standard of 99 B: 3a, b the try-square, so he has charge of presiding over astrological phenomena, `reverently in accordance with [the observation] of the vast heavens, to deliver the seasons respectfully to the common people,'3.8 3.8 A quotation from Book of History 2: 5b; I, ii, 3 (Legge, p. 18). and to give stimulation and encouragement to agricultural pursuits, in order [to bring about] an abundant harvest of grain." "As the Sun has charge of virtues3.9 3.9 "Virtue" is to be taken in its ancient meaning of "power." "Arm" denotes "executive"; cf. n. 3.6. and is the great arm [of the heavenly powers, so] the [Grand] Minister over the Masses on the right has charge of bringing auspicious presages [concerning] civil [matters]. As a circle is investigated by testing it with the compasses,3.10 3.10 Chin Shao explains, "The arms [can be made into the shape of] a circle, [as the limbs form right angles]. When `the five [things that must be] taught are [taught] with gentleness' [a quotation from Book of History II, i, v, 19 (Legge, p. 44; Couvreur, p. 26)], then a filial attitude of submission influences creatures and things and the four supernatural animals [probably: unicorn, phoenix, tortoise, dragon] appear. Hence `auspicious presages [concerning] civil [matters]' belongs to [the Sun]." so he has charge of presiding over human ways. The `five [fundamental] teachings' 3b are to be supported by him. He is to lead the common people, to receive [commands] from the throne, to propagate and beautify the customs and usages, and the five grades [of people will be well] instructed."3.11 3.11 Yen Shih-ku explains, " `The five [fundamental] teachings (wu-chiao )' [a phrase from Book of History II, i, v, 19 (Legge, p. 44)] means the justice (yi) of a father, the kindliness (tz'u) of a mother, the friendliness (yu) of an elder brother, the respectfulness (kung) of a younger brother, and the filial piety (hsiao) of a son. [This interpretation comes from Tso-chuan, Dk. Wen, XVIII (Legge, 2808, 283a). Mencius III, i, iv, 8 (Legge, p. 251f) has a slightly different list.] The five grades (wu-p'in ) are the five social usages (wu-ch'ang ), which means benevolence (jen), righteousness (yi), proper conduct (li), wisdom (chih), and trustworthiness (hsin)." The K'ung An-kuo interpretation of the above passage from the Book of History (Shang-shu Chu-su 3: 13a) however states that the five grades are the five social usages and K'ung Ying-ta (ibid., 3: 13b) explains that the five grades are "the differences of honor within one family, namely, father, mother, elder, younger brother, and son, who are taught by justice, kindliness, friendliness, respectfulness, and filial piety"âthe same list as that for the five fundamental teachings, which accordingly fits better here than Yen Shih-ku's list (which comes from Wang Ch'ung). 269WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 3b "[As the constellation of the Northern] Bushel A.D. 9 [has charge of] balancing [i.e., judging]3.12 3.12 SC 27: 6 = Mh III, 341 states that the constellation Po-tou (the Northern Bushel) is the jade balance. and is the great heart [(or center) of heaven], so in the center the [Grand] Minister of Works has charge of preparing designs [i.e., planning] for (animate and inanimate) things. As length is investigated by the [carpenter's] line, so he has charge of presiding over 3b 4a the principles of geographical arrangements, of balancing and ruling the waters and the earth, and is in charge of [the spirits of] the famous mountains and streams, of multiplying birds and beasts, and of making grass and trees luxurious and abundant." [Wang Mang thus] gave a charter-mandate to each one according to his duties, [using] words like those in the "Canons" and the "Announcements."3.13 3.13 "Canon" is part of the title to Book of History I, bk. i and II, bk i; "Announcement" is similarly part of the title to op. cit. V, bks. vii, ix, x, xii, and xiii. He established a Director of Confidence in the Commander-in-chief, a Director of Uprightness to the Grand Minister over the Masses, and a Director of Obedience to the Grand Minister of Works, whose positions were those of senior high ministers. He [had previously] changed the title of the Grand Titles Changed. Minister of Agriculture to be the Hsi-and-Ho,3.14 3.14 This change had been made in 1 A.D. Cf. 12: 3b. and later changed it to be the Communicator. The Grand Judge was called the Deciding Judge, the Grand Minister of Ceremonies was called the Arranger of the Ancestral Temples, the Grand Herald was called the Director of Music, the Privy Treasurer 270WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 New Titles. was called the Provider of Works, and the Chief 99 B: 3b, 4a Commandant of Waters and Parks was called the My Forester. [These six officials], with the [three senior] high ministers who were directors to the three highest ministers were together [ranked as] the nine high ministers. They were divided and [each] made subordinate to [some one of] the three highest ministers. For each high minister there were established three grandees, and for each grandee there were established three First Officers, so that altogether there were twenty-seven grandees and eighty-one First Officers.3.15 3.15 These titles for the grades and the number of officials in each grade are taken from Tung Chung-shu's Ch'un-ch'iu Fan-lu, 7: 10a, ch. 24, "Kuan-chih Hsiang-Tien." They were separately put in charge of the various duties in the offices of the imperial capital. He changed the title of the Superintendant of the Imperial Household to be the Director of Palaces, the Grand Coachman to be the Grand3.16 3.16 Li Tz'u-ming, HS Cha-chi, 7: 15b, suggests that the first word in and was originally , as in (Grand Keeper of the Robes) and (Grand Governor).

He also established the office of Grand 4b Keeper of the Robes, who had charge of the imperial chariots of state, robes, and imperial articles. Later [this officer] also had charge of troops. The ranks and positions [of the foregoing six officials] were all those of the highest [rank] of the high ministers; they were entitled the Six Superintendants. [The titles of] Grand Administrators of commanderies 271WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 4a were changed to be Grand Governors, A.D. 9 [commandery] Chief Commandants were called Grand Commandants, Prefects and Chiefs of prefectures were called Rulers, [Attending] Secretaries 4a were called Upholders of the Laws, the Majors in Charge of Official Carriages were called [the Directors of] the Four Gates to the Royal Apartments. The Ch'ang1-lo Palace was called the Ch'ang2-lo House, the Wei-yang (Never Completed) Palace was called the Shou-ch'eng House (the House Where a Long Life is Perfected), the Front Hall was called the Hall with the Royal Apartments, and Ch'ang1-an was called Ch'ang2-an. The names of the [civil] ranks were changed: the [occupants of positions ranking at] 100 piculs were called Common Officers, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 300 piculs were called Lower-ranking Officers, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 400 piculs were called Middle-ranking Officers, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 500 piculs were called Mandated Officers, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 600 piculs were called First Officers, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 1000 piculs were called Lower-ranking Grandees, the [occupants of positions ranking at] equivalent to 2000 piculs were called Middle-ranking Grandees, the [occupants of positions ranking at] 2000 piculs were called Upper-ranking Grandees, and the [occupants of positions ranking at] fully 2000 piculs were called High Ministers. The carriages, robes, aprons, and mortarboard hats of each [differed according to] their different degrees. There were also established [the Grandee] in Charge of Respectfulness, [the Grandee] in Charge of Accordance [with the Way,4.1 4.1 The text reads, "Minister over the Masses ." Liu Pin suggests emending the last character to , and Ch'i Shao-nan points out that this latter term harmonizes with the rest of this passage, for these titles are taken from Book of History V, iv, 6, (Legge, p. 326), the same one from which come the correspondences in n. 2.6. the Grandee] in Charge 272WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 New Officials. of Clearsightedness, [the Grandee] in Charge of 99 B: 4a, b Attentiveness, and the Grandee in Charge of Perspicaciousness,4.2 4.2 Li Tz'u-ming, in his HS Cha-chi 7: 15b suggests that should be ; in the Book of History (loc. cit.), the latter character is used. The former character has previously been used for the Director of Palaces, so would not be used here. who, together with the Musician Chanting the Odes and the Ruler for Removing the Viands were to have charge of [the Emperor's] errors. Their charters said, "I have heard that the sages of the most [ancient 5a times] wished to make their virtues brilliant, so 4b never failed to cultivate their persons carefully, in order that they might tranquillize [everyone, even those] at a distance. For this purpose I have established you to have charge of your `five activities.'4.3 4.3 The "five activities" are, according to ibid.: demeanor, speech, seeing, hearing, and thinking, the virtues of which are those mentioned in the first five titles of the preceding paragraph. Do not hide my faults and do not assist me in vainglory. `In your likes and dislikes make no errors'4.4 4.4 A quotation from Tso-chuan, Dk Chao XV, (Legge 65710, 659a). and hold to the mean. O! Put forth all your efforts!" [Wang Mang] ordered that the [Directors of Four Gates to] the Royal Apartments should establish the banner for initiating improvements, the post for speaking ill and criticizing,4.5 4.5 For these two articles, cf. HFHD I, 243, n. 4; p. 244, n. 1. and the drum for those who dare to admonish.4.6 4.6 The text reads ; Wang Nien-sun says it should be in accordance with the Ching-yu ed. (1035) and the parallel phrase in HS 48: 23b. The "drum for those who dare to admonish" is mentioned in the Ta-Tai Li (compiled i cent. A.D.) 3: 3a, ch. 48 (Wilhelm, Li Gi, p. 219), and Liu Pien (fl. 520-557) glosses, "Shun established it. He had those who would admonish, beat it in order that he might himself hear of them." Chia Yi mentions it in a memorial which alludes to that passage (HS 48: 23b). K'ung Kuang-sen (1752-1786) adds, "The ordinance of YÃ¼ said, `Those who would teach Us concerning the Way should strike the drum.' " Chou-li 31: 7b, 8a (Biot, II, 226) declares that the T'ai-p'u "places the drum for the royal apartments outside the gate to the main part of the royal apartments and has charge of controlling it [beating it to announce the time]. It awaits those who would communicate their misfortunes and those who transmit ordinances. When [the T'ai-p'u] hears the sound of the drum, he then quickly receives [the report of] the YÃ¼-p'u or the YÃ¼-shu-tzu [which two officials were in attendance upon the drum, to take the complaint or report of the person who had struck the drum]." Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C.-83 A.D.) comments, "It is like when those beat a drum who at the present time report matters of grievous vicissitudes to the emperor." Wang Mang, in establishing this drum, is following the teaching of the Chou-li. Four Grandee-remonstrants were regularily seated at the Gates to the 273WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 4b King's Apartments to receive those who would speak A.D. 9 of matters. The members of the Wang clan who were related Nobilities for the Wang Clan. [closely enough so that they would wear] the one-year's mourning were enfeoffed as Marquises, [those who would wear] the nine-months' mourning became Earls, [those who would wear] the five-months' mourning became Viscounts, and [those who would wear] the three-months' mourning became Barons. 4b The females all became Baronesses. The males all had Mu (concord) and the females had Lung (prosperous) in their titles.4.7 4.7 Evidently this rule was not always consistently carried out. Wang Yi5's title, Duke Prospering the Hsin Dynasty (Lung-hsin Kung) and Liu Fen's title, Marquis Prospering the Majestic Principles (Lung-wei Hou) contained the word lung, although they were men; Wang Mang's daughters by concubines, Wang Chieh6 and Wang Yeh6, were entitled the Baroness of Attained Concord (Mu-tai Jen) and the Baroness of Cultivated Concord (Mu-hsin Jen), respectively. Wang Mang's grandson, Wang Ch'ien2 was the Duke whose Merits Prosper (Kung-lung Kung). Cf. Glossary sub vocibus. Wang Mang's enactments were so multifarious that many were probably forgotten, since card files had not yet been invented. Mu and Lung were not interchanged, as Stange (p. 126, n. 2) suggests, for Yao HsÃ¼n was made Marquis of Original Concord (Ch'u-mu Hou), Kuei Ch'ang was made Marquis of the Beginning of Concord (Shih-mu Hou), Ch'en Ch'ung was made Marquis of Ruling Concord (T'ung-mu Hou), and T'ien Feng was made Marquis of Hereditary Concord (Shih-mu Hou), all of whom were considered as imperial relatives, since they were considered descendants of Wang Mang's mythical ancestor, the Yellow Lord. All received seals and cords. [Wang Mang] ordered that for the nobles there should be appointed Ladies Dowager, Ladies, and Heirs, who would also receive seals and cords. 274WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 Kingly Titles Abolished. [His message] also said, " `Heaven has not two 99 B: 4b, 5a suns, nor has Earth two kings'4.8 4.8 A quotation from Mencius V, i, iv, 1 (Legge, p. 352), where it is said to be a saying of Confucius. âthis is the unchangeable way of all the kings. Some of the nobles of the Han clan were entitled Kings, and even the barbarians [beyond] the four [frontiers] followed [this practise]. It is contrary to the ancient institutions and absurd [in view of the principle that there 5b is only] one sovereign [in the world]. Let it be fixed that the titles of vassal kings shall all be [changed to] Duke, and that those of the barbarians [beyond] the four [frontiers] who have usurped this title and called themselves Kings shall all be changed and become Marquises." Ancestral Sacrifices to Ancient Rulers Established. It also said: "According to the Way of the [ancient] lords and kings, one followed [the ways of his predecessor, so that [their principles] were transmitted [from one to another]. As a recompense for their abundant virtues for hundreds of generations [after their death] they should enjoy sacrifices. I reflect that the Yellow Lord, the Lord, Shao-hao, the Lord, Chuan-hsÃ¼, the Lord, K'u, the Lord, Yao, the Lord, Shun, the Lord, YÃ¼ of the Hsia [dynasty], 5a Kao-yao, and Yi Yin all possessed sage virtues and ascended to August Heaven, [becoming gods]. Their achievements were sublime and their brilliance was spread5.1 5.1 The Sung Ch'i ed. states that one text reads for . to a distance. I esteem them highly and have `instituted a search'5.2 5.2 A quotation from Book of History, Intro. 28 (Legge, p. 7). for their descendants in order to recompense them by [enfeoffing descendants to] sacrifice to them. Verily, the Wang clan are descendants of the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], who was descended from the Lord, K'u, and the Liu clan are descendants of Yao, who was descended from Chuan-hsÃ¼."5.3 5.3 According to SC 1: 45 = Mh I, 71, Shun was a descendant of Chuan-hsÃ¼; according to SC 1: 21 = Mh I, 41, Yao was the son of K'u. Wang Mang is following a different tradition. 275WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 5a Thereupon he enfeoffed Yao HsÃ¼n as the Marquis A.D. 9 of Original Concord to make offerings as the descendant of the Yellow Lord and Liang Hu as the Earl Renewing Distant [Sacrifices] to make offerings as the descendant of Shao-hao. The Imperial Grandson, 5a the Duke of Prospering Merits, [Wang] Ch'ien2, was to make offerings as the descendant of the Lord, K'u. Liu Hsin1b became the Earl of Vast Glories to make offerings as the descendant of Chuan-hsÃ¼. [Liu] Tieh, the son to the State Master, Liu Hsin1a, became the Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, to make offerings as the descendant of Yao. Kuei Ch'ang became 6a the Marquis of the Beginning of Concord to make offerings as the descendant of the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun]. Shan Tsun became the Viscount as a Recompense for Counsel to make offerings as the descendant of Kao-yao. Yi HsÃ¼an became the Viscount in Recompense to the [Supporting] Governor, to make offerings as the descendant of Yi Yin. The position of the descendant of the Han [dynasty], the Duke of Established Tranquillity, Liu Ting1a, was made that of a Guest. [The title of] the descendant of the Chou [dynasty], the Duke of Weis,5.4 5.4 Weis is here probably an anachronism; the title, Duke of Weis, was bestowed in A.D. 37 upon Chi Tang's grandson, according to HS 18: 10a; HHS, An. 1 B: 9b. Chi Tang was at this time Duke of Cheng, according to 18: 10a. Chi Tang, was changed, and he was enfeoffed as the Duke of Manifest Peace and was also made a Guest. [The title of] the descendant of the Yin [dynasty], the Duke of Sung, K'ung Hung, whose rank was altered [because of] the change in [the dynasty], was changed, and he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Manifest Brilliance and his position was made that of a Respected Guest.5.5 5.5 Yen Shih-ku remarks, "K'o1 is to be respectful. It means that he treated him ith added respect, also like a guest. The Chou [dynasty] took the descendants of hun, together with [the princes of] Ch'i and Sung, [the descendants of the Hsia and Yin dynasties], and made them the three Respected Guests (K'o)." The Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XXV (Legge, 516) states that the Chou dynasty treated the descendants of YÃ¼ (Shun), the Hsia, and the Shang dynasties as Respected Guests. Cf. also Mh I, 239. On the meaning of k'o1, Wu Ta-cheng (1844-1902), in his Ku-chuan Pu, sub Sh Chou K'o-ting, (also included in Shuo-wen Chieh-tzu Ku-lin Pu-yi 7 B: 494 b, sub k'o) remarks that k'o1 was a different writing for k'o2 , and that k'o2 is merely a different writing of k'o3 , which means guest, so that the meaning of k'o1 was originally "guest." In the Book of Odes, no. 278; IV, i, [ii], iii, (Legge, p. 585), these Respected Ones of the former dynasties are called k'o3, and Mr. Mao (ii cent. B.C.) explains, "The k'o3 are the descendants of the two [dynasties] of kings." The K'ung-tsung-tzu ch. 21, 6: 18a (prob. iii cent.), in a discussion of the three Respected Ones, says, "K'o1 is to respect. These [three Respected Guests] were treated with rites like those for a guest k'o3." Of. Tz'u-hai, sub k'o1. A descendant of the Hsia [dynasty], Szu 276WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 Feng, [a man] from Liao-hsi [Commandery], was 99 B: 5a, b enfeoffed and made the Marquis of Manifest Merits 5b and was also made a Respected Guest. (To the most ancient examplars of the four dynasties there were made sacrifices to exemplars in the Ming-t'ang, and they were made the coadjutors of the August First Deceased Ancestor, the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun].)5.6 5.6 Liu Feng-shih remarks that the passage in parentheses interrupts the account, and also that since the persons to whom sacrifices were made all had descendants enfeoffed, the sentence is not appropriate at this point. Furthermore the matter is referred to later. He said that this sentence is therefore an interpolation. Yang Shu-ta however replies that these sacrifices are mentioned in connection with the enfeoffment of the descendants of the persons sacrificed to, and says that the passage seems genuine. The four dynasties were the Hsia, Yin, Chou, and Han dynasties. The descendant of the Duke of Chou, the Viscount in Recompense to [the Duke of] Lu, Chi Chiu, and the descendant of Duke HsÃ¼an-ni [in Recompense for Perfection, Confucius], the Viscount in Recompense for Perfection, K'ung ChÃ¼n, had already been previously appointed. Sacrifices to Ancestors of the Wang [Wang] Mang also said, "When previously I was Regent, I founded a temple for the suburban sacrifices, established a temple for the distant ancestors, and set up [an altar for] the gods of the soils and grains. The gods in heaven and earth responded by [granting] 5b favors. Sometimes `lights descended from above, Clan. dissolving into a crow';5.7 5.7 A quotation from the "Modern text" of the Book of History, V, i, now a fragment Cf.

"From the Yellow Lord to King Po of Chi-nan, [Wang Sui], there have indeed been five surnames in the generations of the founders [of my clan].5.9 5.9 Li Tz'u-ming, ibid., suggests that is a copyist's error for kao . But there is no grammatical necessity to change the text. If kao-tsu had been originally in the text, it would have preceded "King Po" as it does on 99 B: 9a and Wang Mang's temple name for the Yellow Lord would also have been used, and if Yen Shih-ku's text had read kao-tsu, be would not have explained in his note that King Po of Chi-nan was Wang Mang's name for the Eminent Founder (kao-tsu) of his house. This person was named Wang Sui, cf. Glossary, sub voce. The Yellow Lord had twenty-five sons, and granted them twelve separate surnames. My ancestor who was the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], received the surname Yao; in [the time of] T'ao-and-T'ang [Yao], [my ancestors] were surnamed Kuei; in [the time of] the Chou [dynasty], they were surnamed Ch'en; in [the state of] Ch'i, they were surnamed T'ien; and in Chi-nan [Commandery] they were surnamed Wang. "I have humbly remembered my August Deceased Original Ancestor, the Yellow Lord, and my August Deceased First5.10 5.10 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the Nan ed.

It is proper that [these ancestors] should be [given the proper] ranks among the founders and exemplars in my personal ancestral temple. Let there be established five shrines to founders [of my line] and four shrines to immediate ancestors,5.11 5.11 The distinction is between the shrines to the founders of houses , which were not changed, and the personal shrines to the immediate ancestors , which were altered as each new generation elevated its father and mother to a place in the ancestral temple. Cf. 99 C: 9b; STange, 129, n. 5. "Temple" is ambigious, here as elsewhere, denoting sometimes a particular shrine in a temple building, and sometimes the temple building or buildings themselves. Wang Mang was following the rule in Li-chi XIII, , 9 (Legge, II, 42) = Li-chi Cheng-yi 32: 4b. and let the queens and ladies 278WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 6a [of these ancestors] all receive offerings with [their 99 B: 6a husbands]. In the suburban sacrifice, let the Yellow Lord be the coadjutor of Heaven, and let the Queen of the Yellow [Lord] be made the coadjutrix of Earth. Let the Eastern Residence of the Marquis of Hsin-tuc become the great clan temple6.1 6.1 Yen Shih-ku explains, "Mei is (a sacrifice [for descendants]). He established this great temple to sacrifice yearly and seasonally to his ancestors regularily." Mei is usually used to refer to the god of marriage and birth; here it is the clan temple where sacrifices are made for descendants to continue the clan. where [these ancestors] shall be worshipped yearly and seasonally. Those whom my family esteem shall be sacrificed to The New Imperial Clan. for posterity thruout the empire.6.2 6.2 Yen Shih-ku glosses, "It means that the state had already established its great clan temple to sacrifice to its deceased founders. Each [ancestor] whom the families of the common people esteem should be given ancestral sacrifices and [these sacrifices] should not be interrupted. All under heaven should follow the same principle." But Lin Feng-shih argues, "This [sentence] refers to the sacrifices for posterity [to those whom Wang] Mang's family esteemed. He ordained that the empire should transmit them and make them its sacrifices for posterity and that they might not fail to be upheld in sacrifice. It was like the mound to the gods of the soils at the Fen-yin (White Elm) [District in Feng] at which [Emperor] Kao of the Han [dynasty sacrificed]." Cf. 25 A: 17b. "All [the members of] all the five clans [surnamed] Yao, Kuei, Ch'en, T'ien, and Wang are distant descendants of the Yellow [Lord] and of YÃ¼ [Shun], and so are my fellowclansman. Does not the Book of History say, `Effect a generous kindness and nice observance of distinctions among the nine [classes of] 6a kindred'?6.3 6.3 Book of History II, iii, i, 1 (Legge, p. 69). Let it be ordered that in the empire the names [of persons bearing] these five surnames should be entered upon the register of the Arranger of the Ancestral Temples; all are to be made [members of] the imperial house. From generation to 279WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 6a, b generation, they shall be exempted and shall not A.D. 9 pay anything. Let [the members of] the Wang clan from YÃ¼an-ch'eng be ordered not to intermarry [among themselves], in order to distinguish [this clan] and to regulate relationships."6.4 6.4 The Yuan-ch'eng Wang clan was that of Wang Mang's own kindred. He had married the daughter of Wang Hsien2a, who was of another Wang clan, and wanted to show that other members of the large groups of persons surnamed Wang could intermarry, yet also to make plain that he disapproved of the intermarriage of persons of the same surname. He was thus led to distinguish among those surnamed Wang; cf. n. 1.3. [Wang Mang] enfeoffed Ch'en Ch'ung as Marquis of Ruling Concord to make offerings as the descendant of King Hu [of Ch'en],6.5 6.5 Meng K'ang remarks, "He posthumously gave the title of King to Duke Hu of Ch'en," who founded the state of Ch'en at the Chou conquest. and T'ien Feng as Marquis of Hereditary Concord, to make offerings as the descendant of King Ching.6.6 6.6 Meng K'ang remarks, "He posthumously gave the title of King to Ch'en [Wan] Ching-chung," who founded the T'ien clan. [As to] all those [Provincial] Shepherds and [Commandery] Administrators in the empire, who, because of [the rebellion of] Chai Yi, Chao Ming, and others, had led their provinces or commanderies [to attack these rebels and thus] had cherished loyalty and filial piety, the Shepherds were enfeoffed as Barons and the Administrators as Sub-Vassals. [Wang Mang] also enfeoffed as Barons the sons of all those who had formerly shown him kindness, [the sons of] Tai Ch'ung, Chin ShÃª, Chi Hung, Yang6.7 6.7 The Official ed. reads for to accord with the reading in 99 A: 1b. The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. Ping and others. He sent the Chief Commandant of Cavalry, [Hsieh] 6b Hsiao, and others in separate parties to prepare funerary parks and altars to the Yellow Lord at the Ch'iao Sacred Place in Shang Commandery, 6.8 6.8 Liu Pin asserts that should be , which statement is confirmed by 28 Bi: 26a, Yang-chou. to the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], at [Mt.] Chiu-yi in Ling-ling 280WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 [Commandery], to King Hu in [the former kingdom 99 B: 6b of] Huai-yang, to King Ching of Ch'en at Lin-tzu in Ch'i [Commandery], to King Min [of Ch'i] at ChÃ¼ 7b in Ch'eng-yang [Commandery], to King Po, [Wang Imperial Ancestral Sacrifices. Sui], at Tung-p'ing-ling in Chi-nan [Commandery], and to King Ju, [Wang Ho4a], at YÃ¼an-ch'eng in Wei Commandery. At the four seasons, commissioners were to bring sacrifices to them. Those whose temples had to be built, because the empire had just recently been tranquillized, were temporarily to have [their tablets] gathered together and to be offered sacrifice in the Grand [Ancestral] Temple of the Ming-t'ang. [The temple of Emperor] Kao of the Han [dynasty] was made the Temple of the Accomplished Ancestor.6.9 6.9 Yen Shih-ku remarks that Wang Mang was imitating the action of Shun, who "received Yao's retirement from the imperial duties in the Temple of the Accomplished Ancestors," a quotation from Book of History II, i, iii, 4 (Legge, p. 32). 6b [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "My August Deceased First Ancestor, the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], received [the throne] by the abdication of T'ang [Yao]. In the age of the original ancestor of the Han dynasty, the Lord of T'ang, [Yao], there was the model for transmitting the state [to another dynasty]. I myself in turn received the metal charter from the genius of Emperor Kao of the Han [dynasty]. When I ponder recompensing the generosity of previous dynasties, how could there be a time when I should forget [the Han dynasty]? There are seven Founders or Exemplars6.10 6.10 Emperors Kao, the Eminent Founder; Hsiao-wen, the Great Exemplar; Hsiao-wu, the Epochal Exemplar; Hsiao-hsÃ¼an, the Central Exemplar; Hsiao-yÃ¼an, the Eminant Exemplar; Hsiao-ch'eng, the Dynastic Exemplar; and Hsiao-p'ing, the Supreme Exemplar. The last three titles had been conferred by Wang Mang. The Official ed. reads, "Exemplars or Founders," but the Ching-yu ed. does not invert thus. in the Han dynasty. According to the proprieties, there should be established temples for them in the state of [the Duke of] Established Tranquillity. Let their funerary parks, 281WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 6b, 7a funerary chambers, and temples at the imperial A.D. 9 capital be not abolished, and let sacrifices and oblations [be made] as formerly. In the autumn, the ninth month, I will myself in person enter the temples of [Emperors] Kao, YÃ¼an, Ch'eng, and P'ing of the Han dynasty. "The various [members of] the Liu [clan] will be The Liu Clan. changed to be enregistered with the Grand Governor of the imperial capital,6.11 6.11 Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that after a change in the dynasty the members of the former imperial house should not continue to be subordinate to the Superintendent of the Imperial House. and not be relieved from their exemption [from taxes], but each one shall 8a [continue to be exempted] to the end of his life. The Provincial Shepherds shall frequently visit and ask after them, and shall bring it about that they should not [undergo] any encroachments or injustices." He also said, "When I previously was in [the position of] the chief director [of the administration,6.12 6.12 A phrase from the Book of History. Cf. A: n. 13.5. and became Regent and Acting [Emperor], I pondered 7a deeply the dangers [at the end of] the three Change in the Coinage. [times] seven [decades] of the Han dynasty,7.1 7.1 Cf. A: n. 34.4. that the emanation of virtue from the Red [Lord] was exhausted, and I thought and sought, searching widely for means whereby I might support the Liu [house] and lengthen its period [on the throne]. There was nothing that I failed to do. For that reason, I made the beneficial metal knife-[money], hoping thereby to assist [the dynasty].7.2 7.2 Fu Ch'ien explains, "The metal knife-[money] was the cash cast by [Wang] Mang." Yen Shih-ku comments, "Because in the word Liu there is above `mao ,' below metal ,' and on the side there is also `knife ,' [Wang] Mang prohibited the kang-mao mulets] together with the metal-knife-[cash]." The metal knife-money was supposed by the magic of its rebus to strengthen the Liu house, hence Wang Mang did away with it. Nevertheless when Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn to make it a model for later kings, [he continued it] until the fourteenth year of [Duke] Ai [of Lu], when 282WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 one age ended. Comparing it with present [times], 99 B: 7a, b 7a it was also fourteen years [after Emperor] Ai [ascended Change in Coinage. the throne that the Han dynasty ended its rule].7.3 7.3 The Spring and Autumn ends with the fourteenth year of Duke Ai, although he reigned for 13 years more; Chang Yen remarks that Emperor Ai reigned to his sixth year, Emperor P'ing to his fifth year, and Wang Mang acted as Regent to the third year, which makes fourteen years. Since the calculated [number of years allotted] for the age of the Red [Lord] was exhausted, I could not eventually have the power to save [that dynasty]. August Heaven made plain its majesty, so that the virtue of the Yellow [Lord] was due to arise and to make [Heaven's] great mandate abundantly apparent, entrusting me with the empire. Now the people all say that August Heaven has dethroned the Han [dynasty] and set up the Hsin [dynasty], that he has dismissed the Liu [clan from the throne] and caused the Wang [clan] to rise. "Verily the word for Liu is made up of mao, metal, and knife. [The wearing of] the first-month kang-mao [amulets] and the convenience of the metal-knife-[money] 8b cannot now be permitted to occur.7.4 7.4 For the Kang-mao amulets, cf. App. I. In a note to the History of the Three Kingdoms (San-kuo-chih) 57: 6a, Pei Sung-chih (372-451) quotes a memorial of YÃ¼ Fan (164-233), in which the latter states that in the ancient seal character, mao was written for liu (willow). Chou Shou-ch'ang concludes that the words and were interchanged with and were written the same as mao, although distinguished by different pronunciations. Hence the Kang- amulets also connoted the Liu house, so were forbidden. 7b [This matter] was widely debated by the ministers and gentlemen, and they all said, `That Heaven and men respond alike is brilliantly apparent. Let the kang-mao [amulets] be done away with, and let no one wear them at their girdles; let the knife-cash be abrogated, and let them not be used as a convenience [for exchange], in order to respond to and accord with the will of Heaven and to rejoice the minds of the people'." Thereupon [the coinage] was changed and there 283WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I, iv 99 B: 7b, 8a were made small cash, 6 fen in diameter, weighing A.D. 9, Apr./May one shu. Their inscription said, "A diminutive cash, worth one [cash]." Together with the preceding large cash, [which were worth], fifty [of the smaller cash], there were two denominations [of coins] circulating at the same time.7.5 7.5 These two denominations were later (A.D. 10; 99 B: 15a) supplemented by 26 others, all of which were still later discontinued, except for these two; cf. HS 24 B: 21b-23b (in App. I), Chin-shih So, "Chin," 4: 28b. [Wang Mang] wanted to 7b prevent the common people from counterfeit casting [of cash], so issued a prohibition that they were not to be allowed to possess copper or charcoal.7.6 7.6 This ordinance was repealed in A.D. 13; cf. 99 B: 22a. In7.7 7.7 Before the words for "the fourth month," the present text has the words " in this year." The Ching-yu ed. lacks them; the Sung Ch'i ed. declares that the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) lacked them. I have not translated this interpolation. the fourth month, the Marquis of HsÃ¼-hsiang, Apr./May Liu K'uai, formed a cabal of several thousand Liu K'uai's Rebellion. persons and raised troops in his state. [Liu] K'uai's elder brother, [Liu] Yin2a, had been the former King of Chiao-tung under the Han [dynasty], and had at this time been changed to be the Duke Supporting 9a and Rendering Homage [to the Hsin Dynasty. When Liu] K'uai mobilized his troops and attacked Chi-mo, [Liu] Yin2a closed the city gates and had himself bound in prison. The officials and common people 8a resisted [Liu] K'uai, so that [Liu] K'uai was defeated and fled to Ch'ang-kuang, where he died. [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "When anciently my ancestor, King Min [of Ch'i, who reigned over territory which is the present] Chi-nan [Commandery], was distressed by the robber [state of] Yen and left Lin-tzu (in [the state of] Ch'i) to take refuge at ChÃ¼, a man of his clan, T'ien Tan1, made extensive and clever plans, captured and killed a general of Yen, and re-established the state of Ch'i. Today the gentlemen and grandees of Chi-mo have again been of the same mind [with me] and have extirpated rebellious caitiffs. I commend most highly those 284WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I, iv A.D. 9, Apr./May who have been loyal and have compassion upon those 99 B: who are guiltless. Rewards for Loyalty. "Let [Liu] Yin2a and the others be pardoned. Except for [Liu] K'uai's wife and children, his blood relatives and relatives by marriage, who ought to be sentenced, are not to be tried. In making consoling inquiries about those who have died, the person in charge of these inquiries shall grant to those who have died fifty thousand [cash] per person for burial money. [Liu] Yin2a understood the great mandate [of Heaven] and deeply hated [Liu] K'uai, for which reason [the latter] suffered immediately for his crimes.8.1 8.1 Prof. Duyvendak points out that the common phrase, "suffered for their crimes" is taken from Book of Odes, no. 194; II, iv, x, 1 (Legge, p. 326). Let the state of [Liu] Yin2a be made a full ten thousand households, with a territory a hundred li square." [Wang Mang] also enfeoffed the more than ten courtiers [who had been concerned with] the mandates [from Heaven given by means of] portents.8.2 8.2 The persons concerned with the portents noted on A: 25a, 34a-35b; B: 9a-10a. The Ching System Restored. [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "When the ancients established the cottages of eight families on the ching [system]8.3 8.3 For this system, cf. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, p. 41 f; Eberhard, "Z Landwirschaft d. Han-Zeit," MSOS 35: 78ff. and one husband and one wife had a hundred mou of cultivated land and paid one-tenth in taxes, then the state had enough and the common people were opulent and composed songs of praise. The foregoing was the way of T'ang [Yao] 9b and of YÃ¼ [Shun], and that which the three dynasties practised obediently. 8a "The [state of] Ch'in was inhuman and made the taxes heavy, in order that [the ruler] might himself have [a large] income. [The ruler] exhausted the strength of the common people in order to satisfy his desires to the utmost. He destroyed the institutions of the sages and did away with the ching 285WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 8a, b [system of] cultivated fields. For this reason the A.D. 9 Criticism of the Han Land System. taking posession of and joining together [of fields by the wealthy] arose and avarice and vileness was born. The strong made designs to secure cultivated fields by the thousands [of mou] and the weak [even] lacked [enough of] a habitation in which to stand up an awl. "[That state] also established market-places for male and female slaves, putting [human beings] in like enclosures with those for cattle and horses. In their rule over their common people and subjects, [the Ch'in rulers] arbitrarily cut short their [very] lives, and villainous and oppressive persons took advantage of the opportunity to make profits, even kidnapping and selling other peoples' wives and children, going contrary to the will of Heaven and 8b disordering human relationships, which is contradictory to the principle that `of all living things, [i.e., animals and plants, produced by] Heaven and Earth, man is the noblest.'8.4 8.4 A saying attributed to Confucius in the Classic of Filial Piety 5: 1a; ch. 9 (Legge, SBE III, p. 476). The Book of History says, `[If you do not obey my commands], I will thereupon enslave and dishonor you,'8.5 8.5 Book of History III, ii, i, 5 (Legge, p. 155). That Book reads "wives &amp; children " instead of the HS's "enslave "; Yen Shih-ku attacks that interpretation of this word in this passage, saying that in view of ibid. V, i, iii, 3 (Legge, p. 295), "He has imprisoned and enslaved upright gentlemen," the meaning "wives &amp; children" cannot be maintained. Wang Mang certainly took it to mean "enslave." Cf. Karlgren, BMFEA 20, 170f, Gl. 1403. [according to which passage] only those who did not obey [the king's] commands should indeed suffer this punishment.8.6 8.6 The Official ed. emends to . The Ching-yu ed. reads the former. [of being enslaved]. "The8.7 8.7 From this point on, this edict is also found (with omissions) in HS 24 A: 21a, b (App. I). Han dynasty reduced and lightened the land tax, taking [only] one-thirtieth, [but in addition] there were regularly [required] conscript service and capitation-taxes, which [even] the sick and aged 286WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9 were all required to pay,8.8 8.8 In a note to 24 A: 21a, Chin Shao explains, "Although they might be old or ill, all had yet to pay the poll-tax (suan)." while powerful common 99 B: 8b people encroached upon [the poor, letting their own] 10a fields [out on] shares, robbing [people] by the rentals Criticism of the Han Land System. [required for their land, so that while] in name they were taxed only one-thirtieth, in reality they are taxed or pay as rent five-tenths of their produce.8.9 8.9 This figure for the rate of rentals was taken from a memorial by Tung Chung-shu, now in HS 24 A: 16b. Fathers and sons, husbands and wives plowed and weeded for a whole year, [but] what they got was insufficient to keep themselves alive. Hence the horses and dogs of the rich had surplus beans and grain and [the rich] were proud and did evil, while the poor could not satiate themselves with brewer's 8b grains, became destitute, and acted wickedly. Both [rich and poor] fell into crime, so that the punishments had to be employed and could not be set aside. "When previously I was the chief director [of the administration], I first ordered that the empire's public cultivated fields [should be organized on] the ching [system according to the number] of persons, and consequently at that time there were happy presages of auspicious [large-eared] cereals. [But] there happened to be rebellious caitiffs and treasonable rebels, so that [the scheme] was temporarily stopped. Sale of Cultivated Fields and Slaves Forbidden. "Now I change the names of the cultivated fields in the empire to be `the King's fields,'8.10 8.10 In Mencius V, i, iv, 2, (Legge, p. 352), Mencius quotes from Book of Odes II, vi, i, 2; no. 205 (Legge, p. 360), the phrase " the king's (or sovereign's) land," which is the source of this term: "All under the wide heaven Is the king's land." Wang Mang took the title of King, hence applied this saying to himself. and of male and female slaves to be `private adherents.' All are not to be permitted to be bought or sold. Let it be that those [rich families with] less than eight males, 287WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 8b, 9a who have more cultivated fields than those in one A.D. 9 ch'ing, shall divide the cultivated fields that are in excess [of those in one ch'ing] and give them to their nine [classes of] relatives or to [people in] their neighborhood.8.11 8.11 A phrase from Analects VI, iii, 4. Those who formerly had no cultivated fields and who ought now to receive cultivated fields [shall be treated] in accordance with the regulations. If there are any who presume to speak evil of the sage institution of the ching [system of] cultivated fields, and mislead the crowd lawlessly, `they shall be thrown out to the four frontiers [and be 9a made] to resist the elves and goblins,'9.1 9.1 A quotation from Tso-chuan, 20: 10b, Dk. Wen, XVIII (Legge, p. 28013.14, 283a). Yen Shih-ku explains, "Ch'ih are the mountain spirits and mei are the essences of aged things." Cf. App. I, HS 24 B: 23a. "Being made to resist the elves and goblins" was a circumlocution for a death sentence. In 24 A: 21b, the punishment for violating the ordinance establishing the ching system is said to have been death. Stange (140, n. 1) suggests that it meant banishment to frontier military colonies, but Tu YÃ¼, in a note to the Tso-chuan passage, explains "t'ou , to be thrown out" as "ch'i , to be executed" (cf. HFHD, I, 319, n. 6.4) and K'ung Ying-ta adds that t'ou-ch'i means " the extreme penalty." as in the former case my August Deceased First Ancestor, the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], did." At this time, the people had considered the Han 10b [dynasty's] five-shu cash convenient, and, because Wang Mang's cash coins had been put out in two [denominations], large and small, and so were difficult to tell [apart], and moreover had been changed and altered several times, so that they were not to be trusted, [therefore the people] all privately used the five-shu cash at the market and in purchases, saying falsely that the large cash are due to be abolished and that no one is willing to keep them. [Wang] Mang was troubled by it and again issued a written message that all those who hoard five-shu cash and say that the large cash are due to be abolished are similar to those who criticize the ching system of cultivated fields and should be "thrown out to the four frontiers."9.1 9.1 A quotation from Tso-chuan, 20: 10b, Dk. Wen, XVIII (Legge, p. 28013.14, 283a). Yen Shih-ku explains, "Ch'ih are the mountain spirits and mei are the essences of aged things." Cf. App. I, HS 24 B: 23a.

Thereupon farmers and 288WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9, Autumn Economic Sufferings. merchants lost their occupations, food and goods 99 B: 9a were both rendered useless, and the common people even wept in the marketplaces and highways. Moreover those who were tried for buying or selling fields or residences, male or female slaves, or for casting cash, from the nobles, high ministers, and grandees down to ordinary common people, and who suffered punishment, could not be counted. Autumn. In the autumn, [Wang Mang] sent twelve Generals of the Five Majestic [Principles], Wang Ch'i 9a and others, [each with his five Lieutenant Generals],9.2 9.2 HS 99 B: 11a mentions five Lieutenant Generals for each of these twelve Generals; 99 B: 12b states that "the Generals . . . and their Lieutenants, seventy-two persons [in all], returned." Hence the Lieutenant Generals should also be mentioned here. Propaganda Sent Out. to publish through the empire the Mandate [of Heaven Given Through] Portents, in 42 fascicles. There were five matters of "Happy Presages of Virtues," twenty-five of "Mandates Through Portents," and twelve of "Responses of Heavenly Favors," forty-two fascicles in all. [The chapters on] "Happy Presages of Virtues" said that in the reigns of [Emperors] Wen and HsÃ¼an, yellow dragons appeared at Ch'eng-chi and Hsin-tub,9.3 9.3 Cf. 4: 15b; 8: n. 23.5. that a catalpa pillar at the gate to the grave of the Deceased Eminent Founder [of Wang Mang's clan], King Po,9.4 9.4 Wang Hsien-ch'ien asserts that the words should be interchanged, to conform to the usual writing of his name. He is probably correct, but this reading is also found in 27 Bb: 6a, where this event is dated in 45 B.C., the year Wang Mang was born. Lin Hsiang is said to have declared that it symbolized the replacing of the Liu by the Wang clan on the throne. [Wang Sui], had sprouted a branch with leaves, and the like. [The chapters on] "Mandates Through Portents" spoke of the well, the stone, the metal casket, and the like.9.5 9.5 Cf. 99 A: 34a-35b.

The language [of the book] was like 9b the Classics,9.6 9.6 Erh-ya has here the same meaning as in SJ 121: 117 = HS 88: 5a8, which quotes from a memorial by Kung-sun Hung, flattering Emperor Wu for his edicts, "Whose literary beauty is like the classics (erh-ya) and the expressions whose instructions are extremely effective." Yen Shih-ku explains, "Erh-ya [means] approaching the classics chin-cheng. It means that the expressions in his edicts are elegant (ya) and classical (cheng) and are extremely effective." (Reference from Prof. Duyvendak.) accorded with them and made use of them in making its interpretations. Its final conclusion was that [Wang] Mang was due to have taken the place of the Han [emperors] and to possess the empire.9.7 9.7 Wang Hsien-shen remarks that this book has not been transmitted, and that HS 27 Bb: 6a, b quotes a few sentences from it, concerning the catalpa pillar. In sum it said, "When lords or kings are to receive The Book of Propaganda. the mandate [of Heaven], there inevitably are portents and auspices concerning the presages of the virtues [and powers through whose dominance they rule], which assist and complete the mandate to the five [powers],9.8 9.8 Yen Shih-ku comments, "Wu-ming means the order in which the five (wu) powers or elements succeed each other and in which the mandate (ming) [of Heaven] is transmitted." and make this circumstance known by responses of heavenly favor. Then only can [a dynasty] achieve sublime merit and transmit it to its descendants, who will eternally enjoy boundless prosperity. Hence, when the Hsin dynasty arose, the happy presages of the virtue [of its power] came forth after the three sevens [of decades] and the nine generations [of emperors] of the Han [dynasty had elapsed].9.9 9.9 Ho Ch'uo explains, "[Emperors] Hsiao-hui and Hsiao-wen were of the same generation and [Emperors] Ai and P'ing were of the same generation." The Empress of Emperor Kao is also omitted in this count of nine generations in the Former Han Dynasty. For "three sevens of decades," cf. A: n. 34.4. "The mandate [to the Hsin dynasty] commenced when [Wang Mang was the Marquis of] Hsin-tuo and received an auspicious presage from [the state 290WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9, Autumn The Book of Propaganda. of] Huang-chih.9.10 9.10 Cf. 12: 4b.

The Yi-wen Lei-chÃ¼ (compiled by Ou-yang HsÃ¼n, 557-641), 93: 3b, quotes the Grand Duke's Liu-t'ao (prob. iv or v cent. B.C. or later) as saying (this passage is not found in the present Liu-t'ao), "When the King of Shang arrested the Chief of Chou, [Chi] Ch'ang, [later known as King Wen], at Yu-li, the [Foreseen] Grand Duke, [LÃ¼ Shang], with San Yi-sheng, took a thousand yi of gold and sought for the [most] precious things in the world to ransom the crime of their lord. Thereupon they obtained from the clans of the Dog Jung wen horses with fine hair, red manes, and eyes like actual gold, and named [the chariot drawn by] them, `The quadriga with chi-szu ' [the name of a supernatural variety of horse; Huai-nan-tzu 12: 12b (Morgan, p. 125) states that San Yi-sheng "secured a quadrigae with tsou-yÃ¼ (herbivorous white tigers with black stripes) and chi-szu"] and presented it to the King of Shang."

The happy Dec. 31. presages which expressed the mandate [of Heaven] gradually became [more and more] outstanding until they reached [the number of] twelve, in order to announce plainly that the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty should ascend the throne]. "The Emperor pondered deeply that the majesty of Heaven Above could not but be feared. Hence he did away with the title of Regent, yet still called himself the Acting [Emperor], and changed the year-period to Ch'u-shih, intending thereby to stop the mandate of Heaven and yet to carry out and satisfy the will of the Lords on High. Yet that was not the purpose for which August Heaven had so carefully10.3 10.3 Yen Shih-ku glosses, "Cheng-chung is as if he said ." sent down his mandate through portents. Hence on that [very] day Heaven again settled [his hesitancy] by a tortoise letter.10.4 10.4 Meng K'ang says that this letter refers to the written charter fabricated by Ai Chang (cf. 99 A: 35a) and that mien means to urge, with which Yen Shih-ku agrees. But Ai Chang's "metal casket, design, and charter" is referred to later as another portent (99 B: 10b). Chin Shao asserts that mien should be kuei (tortoise), and Li Tz'u-ming, ibid., 7: 16a, points out that kuei is similar to min and that anciently mien and min were interchanged, so that kuei was misread as min, and min exchanged for mien. The Sung Ch'i ed. notes that other editions lack the three words , and that the Shao ed. (xi or xii cent.) has not the last of these, ch'i. Wang Hsien-ch'ien adds that the Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. have after the ch'i. Li Tz'u-ming suspects the ch'i to be an interpolation, probably from the same word in Meng K'ang's comment. The Ching-yu ed. reads as the text does, but its ch'i is plainly a correction, being substituted for two words. A Gentleman-in-attendance, 10a 12a 292WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I A.D. 9, Autumn Wang HsÃ¼, moreover saw a man clothed in a white 99 B: 10a, b plain cloth thin garment with a square collar of 10b red ribbon, wearing on his head the small bonnet, The Book of Propaganda. standing in front of the Hall With the Royal Apartments. He said to [Wang] HsÃ¼, `Today, in heaven [everyone] is of the same mind to confide the people of the world to [Wang Mang] as Emperor.'10.5 10.5 Yen Shih-ku explains, " means that the heavenly gods of the five quarters had united in their plans and agreed in their colors. The word should perhaps be pao Pao means that Heaven as a whole had wrapped up the crowds of people of the world and had given them to [Wang] Mang. Both these interpretations are meaningful." While [Wang] HsÃ¼ was marvelling at it and walked more than ten double-paces, the man was suddenly not seen. Jan. 8, "On the evening of [the day] ping-yin, at the A.D. 9. Temple of [Emperor] Kao of the Han dynasty, there was a metal casket with a design and a charter, [stating that] Emperor Kao had received the mandate of Heaven to transmit the state to the Emperor Jan. 9 of the Hsin [dynasty]. The next morning, the Elder of the Imperial House, the Marquis of Loyalty and Filial Piety, Liu Hung3b, reported it. Thereupon the ministers were summoned to discuss it. When they had not yet reached a decision, the great supernatural stone man spoke, saying, `Hasten the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty] to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, [where he is] to receive the Mandate. Do not delay.' "Thereupon the Emperor of the Hsin [dynasty, 293WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo I 99 B: 10b, 11a Wang Mang], at once mounted his chariot and went A.D. 9, Autumn to the Temple of [Emperor] Kao of the Han dynasty and received the mandate.

It makes plain that the virtue of fire, [which was that of] the Han [dynasty] and of the Liu [clan], is exhausted, and that [the state] has been transmitted to the house of Hsin. "Since the Emperor was perfect in `humility,'10.8 10.8 A quotation from Book of Changes, Hex. 15 (Legge, p. 89; Wilhelm I, 47). he renounced firmly [the honors indicated by] the twelve responses [from the gods] by portents, [but] he was compelled by the plain mandate [of Heaven] and could not refuse.

"When the House of Hsin had been fixed [upon the 99 B: 11a throne], the gods in heaven and earth were glad and rejoiced, and emphasized it by responses of [celestial] favor. Their fortunate presages were continuous and reiterated.

By [this mandate] from Heaven he issues his imperial mandates11.2 11.2 Book of Odes, 249; III, ii, v, 1 (Legge, p. 481).

From all [of these persons], immediately that [the Generals] had given out the seals and cords of the House of Hsin, they thereupon took up the seals and cords of the former Han [dynasty]. There were granted, to the lower officials, two steps in noble rank per person, to common people, one step in noble rank per person, to the women of a hundred households, a sheep and wine, and to the barbarians, currency and silk, to each proportionately.

The word used for heaven, ch'ien, is the name of the first hexagram in the Book of Changes; the word used for mares, k'un, is the second hexagram. This equipage represented Heaven and Earth.

For each General there were established Lieutenants of the Left, of the Right, of the Van, of the Rear, and of the Center, five Lieutenants in all. Their clothes and hats, chariots and robes, 11a and the horses yoked [to their chariots] were severally like the colors and numbers of their directions.11.5 11.5 Yen Shih-ku explains, "Their colors were: in the eastern quarter, cerulean, and in the southern quarter, red, [etc.]. Their numbers were: as the number of [the power] wood is three, the number of fire is two, and the like." A polychrome painting on silk, dated 897, representing a Buddha seated on a chariot surrounded by the deities of the five planets (which may be equated with the five directions) is reproduced in A.

The Generals carried credentials with the title, "A Messenger of the Supreme One" and the Lieutenants bore banners with the title, "A Messenger of the Five Lords [on High."

Those who went out eastwards reached HsÃ¼an-t'u [Commandery], Lo-lang [Commandery], the Kao-chÃ¼-li, and the Fu-yÃ¼. Those who went out to the 11b 13b south passed over [the border] beyond Yi Province, where they degraded the King of Kou-t'ing and made him a marquis.

His [charter]-mandate to the Marquis Making the 99 B: 12a Majestic [Principles] Brilliant, Wang Chi6, read, "The fastnesses of the twists and overhangings12.5 12.5 Fu Ch'ien remarks, "A narrow and important road," and Yen Shih-ku adds, "Its location is in the present Shang Province, where the `seven coils and twelve twists' is that place."

What the T'ung-tien [by Tu Yu, 735-812 (I have not been able to find this passage)] calls, `The seven coils and twelve bends' is the difficult road of the Lan-[t'ien] Pass," so that Yen Shih-ku probably wrote `bends ' for the `twists ' at present in his note. Shen Ch'in-han declares that the T'ai-p'ing Huan-yÃ¼ Chi preserves Yen Shih-ku's note with the former word (we have not been able to find it). He quotes a note to Yi-li, chap. 12, saying that cheng means . (I have not been able to find it.) The reference seems to be to the road from Lan-t'ien south through the Yao Pass and Wu Pass. Shui-ching Chu (by Li Tao-yÃ¼an, d. 527) 14: 19b, sub the Ju River, says, "The precipitous and rocky slopes of Lu-lung [which Yang Shou-ching (1839-1915), in his Shui-ching-chu T'u, N. 1, E. 1, b, locates in the present Jehol, on the Luan River, just north of the Great Wall] are sinuous and broken, hence they have the name of `the nine bends,' " so that there was another place with this name.

The ancient state of Ch'u had its best-known capital at Ying, near the present I-chang. But this state spread until it included the lower Yangtze region and extended northwards along the sea-coast to the present Shantung. The legendary province of Ching was smaller, being supposed to have included roughly the present Hupeh, Hunan, and Kiangsi. "Ching-ch'u," i.e., "the part of Ch'u in YÃ¼'s province of Ching," was then a classical phrase denoting the middle Yangtze region below the gorges. You are to serve as the General of the Southern Passes for the Five Majestic [Principles].

[Wang Mang] also sent Grandee-remonstrants [and others], fifty persons [in all], by divisions to cast cash in the commanderies and kingdoms. In this year, a mad woman of Ch'ang-an, Pi, The Mad Woman. called out in the roads, saying, "Emperor Kao is furious [and says], `Quickly return my state.

The vassal kings of the Han [dynasty] who had become Dukes had all given up their kingly seals and cords, had become common people, and none had disobeyed [Wang Mang's] commands. [Wang Mang] enfeoffed the Generals as Viscounts and the Lieutenants as Barons. The Six Monopolies. The ordinances for the six monopolies [lit., "controls"] were first established. It was commanded that the imperial government should [1] dispense liquors, [2] sell salt and [3] iron implements, [4] cast cash, and that all those who picked or took the various things from [5] famous mountains or great marshes were to be taxed. The Five Equalizations. It was also ordered [6] that the offices [in charge of] the market-places should collect [things when they are] cheap and sell them [when they are] dear, and should lend on credit to the common people, taking three [cash per] month as interest for a 13a hundred [cash].12.9 12.9 Ju Shun glosses, "They put out a hundred cash and gave it to common people to use, and collected three cash interest for it per month." For these controls, cf., App. I, HS 24 B: 23a-25b. That passage however says that interest was not to be more than 10% of the borrower's income. The Hsi-and-Ho, [Lu K'uang], established one Officer for Liquor in each commandery, with a riding quadriga, to oversee the profit from the liquor. A prohibition was made that the common people were not allowed to possess crossbows or cuirasses. [Those who violated this prohibition]13.1 13.1 Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 37: 9a has at this point the words , which Wang Hsien-ch'ien thinks have dropped out of the HS text. were to be exiled to Hsi-hai [Commandery]. 301WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xi 99 B: 13a When the Hun Shan-yÃ¼'s [envoy, who had come to A.D. 10, Dec. Hun Raids. the imperial capital,] had asked for [the Shan-yÃ¼'s] former imperial seal, [Wang] Mang had not given it to him, consequently [the Huns had] raided the border commanderies, killing and kidnapping officials and common people.13.2 13.2 Cf. HS 94 B: 17b = de Groot, Die Hunnen, p. 268, 269, where the Hun raid on So-fang Commandery is dated in A.D. 9. It is mentioned here to introduce the incident at Turfan. In the eleventh month, the General Establishing Nov./Dec the State, [Sun] Chien, memorialized, "A general in Rebellion in the Western Frontier Regions. the Western Frontier Regions, [Tan] Ch'in, has sent [to the court a message] which says, `In the ninth month, on [the day] hsin-szu, Ch'en Lang and Chung Tai, officials of the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, joined together, murdered their Colonel, Tiao Hu, and Sept. 15. coerced officials and soldiers, calling themselves Generalissimos of the fallen Han [dynasty], and fled 15b to the Huns.'13.3 13.3 For this incident at Turfan, cf. HS 94: 17b, 18a = de Groot, p. 270. "Moreover in the present month, on [the day] kuei-ch'ou,13.4 13.4 The text reads kuei-yu, but there was no such day in that month.

But Hung Yi-hsÃ¼an (1765-ca. 1830/1840), in his Tu-shu Ts'ung-lu 21: 18a, objects that an inferior wife is a concubine , while a low-class wife is not an inferior wife. He notes that HHS, An. 1 B: 4b quotes an order of Emperor Kuang-wu stating that slaves and low-class wives who have been kidnapped may leave freely, that ibid. 1 B: 10b quotes another order to the effect that people who have been kidnapped and made slaves are to be freed, and those who have become people's low-class wives and want to leave shall be freely permitted to go, that Shuo-wen 12 B: 4a, defines hsÃ¼ [which is used to denote a wife or a concubine] as follows, "Weak; it also denotes a low-class wife," and that HHS, Mem. 2: 1a states that Wang Ch'ang later pretended to be the real Liu Tzu-yÃ¼, "saying that his mother was a singer of the former Emperor Ch'eng." Hence Hung Yi-hsÃ¼an concludes that a low-class wife was not a regular concubine but a slave-woman who was used as a mistress. The mothers of Wang Mang's illegitimate sons (99 C: 11b) were then low-class wives. Such a distinction between a concubine and a slave-woman mistress is likely to be blurred in practise; Chang Yi (fl. dur. 227-232), in his Kuang-ya ["Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 672 B: 5b), says, "A wife is called a hsÃ¼," and Tuan Yi-ts'ai (1735-1815) identifies "low-class wife" and "inferior wife." Cf. also Wang Nien-sun's Kuang-ya Su-cheng Pu-Cheng: 34b ("Kuang-ts'ang HsÃ¼eh-kuan Ts'ung-shu" ed.) 302WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xi A.D. 10, Dec.

The memorial was approved. The Han Ancestral Temples Abolished and the Han Nobles Dismissed. [He also memorialized],13.8 13.8 Wang Hsien-ch'ien observes that the words should be in the text at this point. "Emperor Kao of the Han dynasty frequently made known a warning saying, `Dismiss the officials and soldiers [in the Han Ancestral Temples] and make [the Han emperors] guests at the sacrifice [in the temples of the present dynasty],' sincerely desiring to accord with the will of Heaven and to preserve his descendants. His ancestral temple ought not to be inside the city-walls of Ch'ang2-an, and, together with the [members of] the Liu [clan] who are nobles, they should all have been dismissed at the same time that the Han [dynasty was overthrown]. Your Majesty is most benevolent and for this long time has not settled [this matter]. "Previously, the former Marquis of An-chung, Liu Ch'ung2c, the [former] Marquis of HsÃ¼-hsiang, Liu K'uai, the [former] Marquis of Ling-hsiang, Liu Ts'engb, and the [former] Marquis of Fu-Ãªn, Liu 303WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xi 99 B: 13b, 14a Kueib, and others, one by one collected a crowd and A.D. 10, Dec. plotted to rebel. Now some perverse and treacherous 16a caitiffs have falsely called themselves generals of the fallen Han [dynasty] and one person has called himself [Liu] Tzu-yÃ¼, a son of Emperor Ch'eng, so that they have committed [crimes punishable by] being executed and their relatives being annihilated. The reason that these continual [rebellions] have not stopped is that your sage grace has not sooner cut off the early growths [of such events]. "Your servant stupidly considers that Emperor Kao of the Han [dynasty] should become a guest of the House of Hsin and enjoy sacrifices in the Ming-t'ang. Emperor Ch'eng was your cousin with a different surname and Emperor P'ing was your son-in-law. For all of them it is not proper that they should again enter their temples. Emperor YÃ¼an became of one flesh with the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], and the rites by which your sage grace has exalted her are appropriate also for him. "Your servant begs that the various temples of the Han dynasty in the imperial capital should all be abolished, that the various [members of] the Liu [clan] who are nobles should be put into the hierarchy 14a of five degrees [of nobility] in accordance with 13b the number of households [in their estates], and that those [members of the Liu clan] who are officials should all be dismissed and await new appointments at their homes. On the one hand, [this procedure] will accord with the will of Heaven and agree with the supernatural manifestations from Emperor Kao, and [on the other hand],14.1 14.1 The word has probably dropped out at this point. it will stop the beginnings of perverseness and treachery." [Wang] Mang said [in his message], "It may be done. The Duke Honoring the Hsin [Dynasty], the State Master, [Liu Hsin1a], who, because of the mandate 304WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xi A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. [given by] portents, has been made [one of] my 99 B: 14 Four Coadjutors, the Marquis of Brilliant Virtues, Liu Kung2, the Marquis Leading by the Rules of Proper Conduct, Liu Chia1s" and others, "thirty-two persons in all, all understood the mandate of Heaven; 16b they either presented portents from Heaven or offered congratulatory sayings or arrested or informed upon rebellious caitiffs, so that their merits are abundant. The [members of] the Liu [clan] who are of the same clan and have the same grandfathers as these thirty-two persons are not to be dismissed and are to be granted the [imperial] surname, Wang." Only the State Teacher, [Liu Hsin1a], was not granted this surname, because his daughter had been married to [Wang] Mang's son. The title of the Duchess Dowager of Established Tranquillity, [Wang Mang's daughter], was changed, and she was called the Princess of the Yellow Imperial House, in order to cut her off from the [house of] Han. Dec./Jan., In the winter, the twelfth month, it thundered. A.D. 11. The title of the Shan-yÃ¼ of the Huns (Hsiung-nu) was changed, and he was called the Submitted Capture (Fu-yÃ¼) of the Surrendered Slaves (Hsiang-nu). War Declared Against the Huns. [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "The Submitted Capture of the Surrendered Slaves, [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih, has `despised and insulted the five powers,'14.2 14.2 A quotation from the Book of History III, ii, 3 (Legge, p. 153). has turned his back upon and rebelled against the four articles,14.3 14.3 These four articles are enumerated in HS 94 B: 15b, 16a = de Groot, Die Hunn 264, as follows: "[1] Chinese who escape to the Huns, [2] Wu-sun who escape and surrender to the Huns, [3] those in the various states of the Western Frontier Regions who have worn Chinese seals and cords [officials] and surrender to the Huns, and [4] Wu-huan who surrender to the Huns shall all not be permitted to be received." has invaded and violated the Western Frontier Regions, and has extended himself to and reached the frontiers [of China], where he has made himself injurious to the great multitude. His crimes 305WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii 99 B: 14a, b are such that he ought to be executed and his rela- A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. tives annihilated. I command and send the General Establishing the State, Sun Chien," and others, "twelve generals [in all], to go out simultaneously by ten routes, and respectfully perform the majestic punishment of August Heaven upon the person of [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih. "But I ponder that the ancestor of [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih, the former Shan-yÃ¼ Hu-han-hsieh, [LÃ¼an-ti] Chi-hou-shan, was loyal and filial during successive 14a reigns, protecting the barriers and guarding the frontiers. I cannot bear, because of the crime of one [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih, to destroy the posterity of [LÃ¼an-ti] 17a Chi-hou-shan. Now I divide the state, territory, and 14b people of the Huns and make of it fifteen [states], setting up fifteen descendants of [LÃ¼an-ti] Chi-hou-shan as Shan-yÃ¼." He sent a General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Lin Pao, [with] Tai Chi, to gallop just outside the barrier, summon, and install those who ought to become Shan-yÃ¼. Those people of the Huns who ought to be sentenced because of the law [against] the caitiff [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih were all [granted] amnesty and set free. [Wang Mang] sent the General of the Five Majestic [Principles], Miao Hsin, and the General of the as Rapid as Tigers, Wang K'uang4a, to go out of Wu-yÃ¼an [Commandery], the General Repressing Difficulties, Ch'en Ch'in, and the General Making Barbarians Quake, Wang HsÃ¼n2, to go out of YÃ¼n-chung [Commandery], the General Invigorating His Military [Power], Wang Chia1c, and the General Tranquillizing the Barbarians, Wang Meng2, to go out of Tai Commandery, the General Assisting the Majestic [Principles], Li Shen, and the General Maintaining Order in Distant [Places], Li Weng, to go out of Hsi-ho [Commandery], the General Executing the Mo, Yang ChÃ¼n, and the General Expelling Filth, Chuang Yu, to go out of YÃ¼-yang [Commandery], 306WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. the General Inciting to Military Deeds, 99 B: 14b.

They enlisted the convicts, freemen, and armed soldiers of the empire, 300,000 persons [in all], transporting the taxes from 17b many commanderies,14.4 14.4 At this point the text has ; Liu Feng-shih (1041-1113) declares that it is inexplicable and probably an interpolation. I have omitted it. âclothes and furs, military implements, and provisions, escorted by the Chief Officials [of the prefectures]. From the seacoast, the Yang-tze, and the Huai [Rivers] to the northern borders, commissioners, [riding in] galloping quadrigae, supervised and urged them, and acted in 14b accordance with the law for levying an army. The empire was disturbed. Those who arrived first encamped in the border commanderies, waiting for them all to arrive, and then go out at the same time.14.5 14.5 This expedition was planned on so grandiose a scale, (the armies were to take along provisions for three hundred days) that its requirements could not all be collected and never set out. Cf. Chuang Yu's admonition against the plan in HS 94 B: 18b-19b de Groot, Die Hunnen, 273-5. Five Kinds of Money. Because his cash and [other] currencies finally did not circulate, [Wang] Mang again issued a written message, which said, "The common people consider their food as their life and their goods as their wealth. For this reason among the eight [objects of] government, food is given the first place.14.6 14.6 A reference to Book of History V, iv, 7 (Legge, p. 327). If the valuable 15a currency is all of large [denominations], when one needs a small amount [of money], it is not available; if it is all of small [denominations], then transporting it is troublesome and expensive; if large and small [denominations], big and little [coins], are each of different kinds, then their use is convenient and the common people rejoice." Therefore [Wang Mang] 307WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii B: 15a created valuable currency of five kinds. A discus- A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. 24 B: sion is in the "Treatise on Food and Goods."15.1 15.1 Cf. App. I, HS 24 B: 21b-23a. This passage enumerates six kinds of money, of denominations altogether. In the present passage, round cash and spade-money are grouped together because they were made of the same material, bronze, hence there are said to be only five kinds. The peculiarity of this bronze coinage was that as the denominations of the coins became greater, the proportionate amount of metal became progressively less, so that while the one-cash coin contained 1 shu of bronze, the thousand-cash spade coin contained only 24 shu of bronze, 0.024 shu per cash. Cf. 24 B: n. 22.11. No wonder Wang Mang had to compel people to use them! His purpose seems to have been to facilitate the transport of large sums of money, as well as to profit from the depreciation of the coinage. 21b-23a. The people did not accord, and only used merely The People Oppose the New Currency. two denominations of cash, the large and the diminutive [cash]. Since those who cast counterfeit cash could not be stopped, [Wang Mang] made the penalties [against counterfeiting] heavy. When one family cast cash, the five [neighboring] families were to be sentenced for it, [their property was to be] confiscated, and they were to be enslaved. When officials and common people went iin or out [the barriers], they were to carry spade-money as an adjunct to their passport credentials.15.2 15.2 Yen Shih-ku explains, "[According to] the old laws, those who travelled carried passport credentials and were then not delayed or detained. Now [Wang Mang] changed [the law] and ordered that they should carry spade-money to be with their credentials, and thus only were they permitted to pass." For those 18a who did not carry [spade-money], the [post]-kitchens Officials Forced to Carry Spade-money. and relay stations were not to house them, and at the barriers and fords they were to be investigated and detained.15.3 15.3 Yen Shih-ku explains, "The kitchens ch'u were the places for eating and drinking in traveling along the roads. The chuan were the hostelries established at the posts. Ho is to question ." The ministers were all to hold them when they entered the gates of the palaces and halls. The intention was to make them valuable and circulate. At this time, [many persons] strove to make mandates New Portents Prohibited. [from Heaven by means of] portents in order to be enfeoffed as marquises. Those who did not 308WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. make them, made sport, saying, "Were we alone 99 B: 15a. without letters of appointment from the Lord of Heaven?" A Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], Ch'en Ch'ung, advised [Wang] Mang of it, saying, "This [matter] is opening the way for wicked `subjects to confer [kingly] favors [upon themselves],'15.4 15.4 A phrase from the Book of History V, iv, 19 (Legge, p. 334). and to bring confusion upon the mandate of Heaven. It would be proper to cut away its source." [Wang] Mang also had had his fill of it, and thereupon had a Grandee Master of 15a Writing, Chao Ping, investigate and try [such offenders]. Those who [made known portents] which were not those published by the Generals and Lieutenants of the Five Majestic [Principles] were all sent to prison. Chen Feng Discarded. Previously, Chen Feng, Liu Hsin1a, and Wang Shun4b had been [Wang] Mang's intimate advisors and had led those who were in office in making known 15b [Wang Mang's] achievements and virtuous conduct for rewards.15.5 15.5 HHS, Mem 2: 8b, quotes Chu Fou as saying, "When Wang Mang was Ruling Governor, Chen Feng went in to him at dawn and at dusk to plan and discuss [matters]. At that time, people said, `The midnight guest is Chen [Feng] Chang-po.' " (Reference from Yang Shu-ta.) His titles of [Duke] Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty] and Ruling Governor, together with the enfeoffment of [Wang] Mang's mother and his two sons and a nephew,15.6 15.6 Cf. HS 99 A: 32a. were all planned by [Chen] Feng together with the others. [Chen] Feng, [Wang] Shun4b, and [Liu] Hsin1a had moreover received grants from him and had all become indeed wealthy and honorable. They did not in addition want to bring it about that [Wang] Mang should become Regent. The first beginnings of his becoming the Regent came from the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼an-ling, Liu Ch'ing4i, the Displayer of Splendor in the South, Hsieh Hsiao, and the Prefect of Ch'ang-an, T'ien Chung-shu. 309WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii 99 B: 15b When [Wang] Mang's wings had grown and he A.D. 10/11, Dec./ 18b desired to be entitled Regent, [Chen] Feng and the others accepted and agreed with his intentions. [Wang] Mang immediately enfeoffed in addition the two sons of [Wang] Shun4b and of [Liu] Hsin1a, together with [Chen] Feng's grandson. When the noble rank and official position of [Chen] Feng and the others had been received, their ambitions were satisfied. They moreover really feared the Han imperial house and the prominent persons in the empire. But those who had been distant from [Wang Mang] and wanted to advance, simultaneously made mandates [from Heaven given through] portents. When [Wang] Mang thereupon employed them in order to ascend [the throne as] the actual [Emperor, Wang] Shun4b and [Liu] Hsin1a merely became inwardly fearful. [Chen] Feng was ordinarily resolute, [so Wang] Mang became conscious that [Chen Feng] was not pleased. Hence [Wang Mang] removed him from being Grand Support Aiding on the Right and Grand Minister of Works,15.7 15.7 Li Tz'u-ming, ibid. 7: 6a, suggests that is here an interpolation. It interrupts the sentence. and, taking advantage of a writing on a mandate by a portent, he made him the General of a New Beginning, ranking him the same as the seller of cakes, Wang Sheng. [Chen] Feng and his son kept silent [but were dissatisfied].15.8 15.8 In SC 84: 24, where this phrase is written mo-mo , Ying Shao interprets it . At this time, [Chen Feng's] son, [Chen] HsÃ¼n, was Chen Hs and Associate Executed a Palace Attendant, Grand Governor of the Capital, and Marquis of Abundant Virtues. He now made a mandate [from Heaven by means of a] portent, saying that the House of Hsin ought to divide [its territory at] Shan and set up two Chiefs [to govern that territory], making [Chen] Feng the Western 15b 310WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. Chen HsÃ¼n and his Associates Executed. Chief and the Grand Tutor, and P'ing Yen, the 99 B: 15b Eastern Chief, as in the former circumstances [was done for the Dukes of] Chou and of Shao.15.9 15.9 SC 34: 2 (Mh IV, 133 f) recounts that at the time of King Ch'eng of the dynasty, the Duke of Shao supervised the country west of Shan and the Duke of that east of Shan. [Wang] Mang thereupon followed this [mandate] and installed [Chen] Feng as the Western Chief. [Chen Feng] was to "report on his duties"15.10 15.10 A phrase from Mencius I, B, iv, 5 (Legge, p. 159). and go out to the west, but had not yet gone, when [Chen] HsÃ¼n again made a mandate [from Heaven by means 19a of] a portent, which said that the Empress [nee Wang] of the former Emperor P'ing of the Han clan, the Princess of the Yellow Imperial House, was [to be] the wife of [Chen] HsÃ¼n. [Wang] Mang had been set [on the throne] by fraud, so he suspected in his heart that his great 16a officials would hate and malign him. He wanted to terrify them in order to make his inferiors fear him. Because of these [feelings], he burst out in anger and said, "The Princess of the Yellow Imperial House is a mother of the empire. What means this [statement] [about her becoming the wife of Chen HsÃ¼n]?" He [ordered Chen] HsÃ¼n arrested. [Chen] HsÃ¼n fled and [Chen] Feng committed suicide. [Chen] HsÃ¼n followed a gentleman versed in the magical arts and entered [the solitudes of] Mt. Hua. After more than a year he was siezed. His confession implicated [1] the Palace Attendant, Supernaturally [Influencing] General [Whose Influence] Penetrates Eastwards, Grandee in Charge of the Five Behaviors, and Marquis Prospering the Majestic [Principles], Liu Fen, the son of the State Master and Duke, [Liu] Hsin1a, [2] Liu Fen's younger brother, the Senior Department Head, Colonel of the Ch'ang River [Encampments], and Marquis Attacking Caitiffs, [Liu] Yung4, [3] the General of the 311WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II, xii B: 16a Eastern Passes16.1 16.1 Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that should be to accord with the phrase on 99 B: 12a. The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that the Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. read likewise. [for the Five Majestic Principles] A.D. 10/11, Dec./Jan. and Marquis Grasping16.2 16.2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that should be to agree with the reading on B: 12a. the Majestic Principles, [Wang] Ch'i, the younger brother of the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang] Yi5, together with [4] a disciple of Liu Hsin1a, the Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Cavalry, Ting Lung, and others. They involved ministers, their cabals, and their relatives. The full marquises and those [ranking] lower who died were numbered by the hundreds. In the lines of [Chen] HsÃ¼n's hands there were the words, "Son of Heaven." [Wang] Mang had his arms untied, had him enter [the palace], and looked at [his hands]. He said, "These [words] are `one big fellow.' "16.3 16.3 The Official ed. reads t'ien for ta , with the note, "The Sung Ch'i [ed.] says, T'ien should perhaps be ta.' " But the Ching-yu ed. (1035) reads ta. Some one said, "[It is] `one lu fellow.' `Lu' is to put to death.16.4 16.4 Chen HsÃ¼n was said to have had on his hand the words . Wang Mang said they were . Another person said they were . The words ` (six)' and ` (put to death)' must have then been pronounced alike; cf. Karlgren, Grammata Serica, #1032a &amp; 1069v; Analyt. Dict. #546 &amp; 563. It makes plain that [Chen Feng and Chen] HsÃ¼n, father and son, must be put to death and die." Thereupon [Wang Mang] executed and banished [Liu] Fen to Yu Province, executed and expelled [(Wang) Ch'i to Mt. Ch'ung, executed and drove away Chen] HsÃ¼n to [Mt.] San-wei, and executed and killed [Ting] Lung 16a on Mt. YÃ¼.16.5 16.5 He was imitating Shun's treatment of his four criminals as related in the Bk. of Hist. II, i, 12 (Legge, p. 39 f). Wang Mang evidently interpreted this passage, not as Yang Shu-ta and Legge do, but as the K'ung An-kuo tradition did, which says, " and all [mean] execution . Their difference is in the character of the language used." Even if the K'ung An-kuo commentary is a later forgery, yet it probably contains early statements. Mencius V, A, iii, 2 (Legge, p. 349), repeating this passage from the Book of History, states that Shun "slew [the prince of] the San-miao, of these four criminals], on [Mt.] San-wei." Han Fei-tzu 13: 7b, 8a; ch. 34, further states, "Yao, . . . using military weapons, executed K'un in the wilderness of YÃ¼, . . . and, using military weapons, executed the Provider of Works at the tal of Yu Province." There is thus ample evidence to substantiate the K'ung An- interpretation as ancient. Wang Mang certainly understood this passage to execution. Cf. Chung Feng-nien, "The Four Banishments in the Shu-ching," in ching Journal of Chinese Studies, no. 27, June 1940, pp. 211-232, Karlgren, BMFEA 91ff, Gl. 1272; Shang-shu Chu-su 3: 8b. The Bk. of Hist. records the punishment of four criminals; Li Tz'u-ming, ibid., 7: accordingly suggests that a clause has dropped out of the text. After I accordi insert the words . (Li Tz'u-ming's own emendation does not follow Book of History closely enough.) The corpses of all were transported in 19b post-chariots to their destinations. 312WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II A.D. 10/11 As a man, [Wang] Mang had a large mouth and a 99 B: 16b receding chin, bulging eyes with brilliant16.6 16.6 (red) and (fiery) were anciently interchanged. pupils, Wang Mang's Terrifying Appearance. and a loud voice which was hoarse. He was seven feet five inches tall,16.7 16.7 About 5 ft. 7 in. Eng. measure. loved thick-[soled] shoes and tall bonnets, and used clothes padded with felt.16.8 16.8 For the shoes and hats, cf. Eberhard, Die Mode der Han-und Chin-Zeit, pp. 49-55. Erh-ya (Han period) 3: 5a, says, "Li is chi (wool or felt)," and Ping (932-1010) says, "People of honorable clans say that li means felt (mao The Hu connect sheep's hair and make clothes. Then chi is made of woven hair like present hairy rug ." K'ung Ying-ta (574-648), in a note to Book of Histo 11a (in "The Tribute of YÃ¼"; cf. Legge, p. 122), quotes Sung Yen (fl. ca. 220) as say$ "Mao-li becomes wool (chi), which is woven hair." He stuck out his chest and made himself look tall, [so that he could] look down on those who were around him.16.9 16.9 Stange, p. 165, translates differently, "Selbst wenn er (scheinbar) abgewandt behielt er doch, von oben sehend, seine Umgebung im Auge." At this time, there was a person skilled in medical and allied arts who was an Expectant Appointee at the Yellow Gate. Someone asked him about [Wang] Mang's figure and countenance, and the Expectant Appointee replied, "[Wang] Mang is a person who may be said to have owl's eyes, tiger's jaws, and a wolf's voice. Hence he is able to eat people and is also due to be eaten by people." The person who questioned him gave information about [his reply, and Wang] Mang exterminated the Expectant Appointee 313WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo II B: 16b, 17a [and his relatives] and enfeoffed the informer. A.D. 10/11 Afterwards [Wang Mang] regularily screened himself with a mica fan, so that, except for his intimates, no one was permitted to have an audience with him. In this year, the Marquis of Original Concord, Yao HsÃ¼n, was made the General of a Peaceful Beginning. In the third year, [Wang] Mang said, "The many III offices have been changed and altered and their A.D. 11. duties have been redistributed, but the code, ordinances, ceremonies, and laws have not yet been all 20a determined upon, [hence] temporarily the Han [dynasty's] The Han Code Continued. code, ordinances, ceremonies, and laws should be followed and applied in [government] business." He ordered that the ministers, grandees, nobles, [and officials ranking at] 2000 piculs might recommend one official or commoner each who showed an upright character, who was experienced in administrative matters, who was gifted in speech, and who was intelligent in literary studies.16.10 16.10 The four qualifications are taken from Analects XI, ii, 2. [Such] persons were to go to the [Directors of] the Four Gates to the Royal Apartments. [Wang Mang] sent the Grandee Master of Writing, 16b Chao Ping, to bring encouragement to the northern borders. He returned and said that in Po-chia of Wu-yÃ¼an [Commandery the soil] is fertile and produces grain, and that at other times offices for cultivated 17a fields had regularily been established there. Trouble At the Northern Borders. Thereupon [Wang Mang] made [Chao] Ping the General of Cultivated Fields and Grain to send frontier troops to garrison farms in Po-chia, in order to assist the army with provisions. At that time, while the various generals who were at the border were waiting for the large bands [of soldiers] to be collected, their officers and soldiers 314WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo III A.D. 11 Disorder at the Northern Borders. did as they pleased, while the inner commanderies 99 B: 17a were troubled with levying [troops] and collecting [materials]. The common people left the cities and suburbs and became vagrants, becoming thieves and robbers. In Ping Province17.1 17.1 At this point the text has the words "and in the P'ing Province ." Hu hsing remarks that P'ing Province did not exist until the third century, when the kingdom of Wei divided P'ing Province off of Yu Province and says that the word "P'ing" in error. He notes that at the end of the Later Han period, Kung-sun Tu set himself as the Shepherd of P'ing Province, which was in the southern part of the present M churia. Ch'ien Ta-hsin however remarks that HS 55: 19b states that Lu Po-tÃª was a man "P'ing-chou1 in Hsi-ho [Commandery]," so that "P'ing-chou1 was the name of county belonging to Hsi-ho Commandery within the section [called] Ping depart (chou)." (A chou contained 2500 families; cf. 24 A: 4a). HS 28 Bi: 29a writes this P'ing-chou2 , so that probably chou1 and chou2 were anciently interchanged. Shen Ch'in-han suggests that P'ing Province was probably established by Wang M out of part of Yu Province, so that Kung-sun Tu took his title from this occurrence, that if P'ing-chou was merely the name of a county, disorder confined chiefly to part one department would hardly have been worth mentioning. This latter remark seems quite conclusive as a reply to Ch'ien Ta-hsin's suggesting There is moreover no classical precedent for the name "P'ing Province" and no notice of Wang Mang having established it, so that this name is itself very dou HS 16: 53b and 17: 20b list a Marquisate at P'ing-chou1, but this place was in the Shantung, not where these disturbances would be expected. Perhaps the best of the difficulty is that of Hu San-hsing; I have consequently omitted this name, sin uncertain what province was originally mentioned instead of P'ing Province. they were especially numerous. [Wang] Mang ordered that the seven highest ministers and the six high ministers17.2 17.2 Hu San-hsing remarks that the "seven highest ministers" were the four Coad with the previous "three highest ministers"; the "six high ministers" were the Hsi-an the Deciding Judge, the Arranger of the Ancestral Temple, the Director of Mu Provider of Works, and the My Forester. should all be concurrently entitled Generals, and sent the General Outstanding in Military Affairs, Lu Ping, and others to control the famous cities, together with 55 Generals of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace and 55 Upholders of the Laws Clad in Embroidered Garments separately to control the large commanderies along the border, to correct the greatly cunning 20b villains who were taking it upon themselves to make 315WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo III 99 B: 17a, b dupes of the troops. They all found it convenient to A.D. 11 do evil in [the regions] outside [the capital], and caused confusion in the provinces and commanderies, making a business of bribes, taking advantage of the people for their own profit. [Wang] Mang issued a written message, saying, "The caitiff [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih's crimes are such that he is due to be annihilated [with his relatives]. Hence I sent my fierce generals, with separate [commands as] twelve divisional generals, to set out simultaneously and destroy him utterly at one stroke. Within [the capital], I established Directors of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles] and Chiefs of Armies; outside [the capital] I set up Superintendants of Armies, twelve persons [in all] verily intending that they should have charge over those who do not uphold my mandate and should cause the soldiers all to be upright. "But now they are not so. Each uses his power Corruption and influence to intimidate good people, illegally 17b putting seals upon common peoples' necks. When [these officials] secure [a bribe of] cash, they take [the seal] off.17.3 17.3 Ju Shun explains, "Powerful officials illegally used the law to do injustice to good , making them slaves by putting a seal upon their necks in order to distinguish . When they secured cash for the hire [of these condemned persons], they then took their seals." According to this passage, some sort of a sealed cord about the neck to have been used instead of the iron collar also used in the Former Han period to slaves and criminals; cf. 99 C: 12b. If merely a seal-mark had been used of branding, there would have been little reason for putting it on the neck. Poisonous and venomous stings are 17a simultaneously performed [at various places], so that the peasants have left [their homes and have become] scattered. If the Directors and Superintendants are as the foregoing, can they be said to be suitable [for their offices]? From this time and henceforth, those who presume to offend in this [manner] will be immediately arrested and held [in prison] and their names shall be reported to me." [The officials] however 316WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo III A.D. 11 did as they liked just as before. 99 B: 17b A New Shan-yÃ¼ Set Up. When Lin Pao and Tai Chi reached [the region] just outside the Barrier, they summoned and allured [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien, the younger brother of the Shan-yÃ¼, [LÃ¼an-ti Chih], and [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien's son, [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng, to enter through the Barrier. By force they installed [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien as the Shan-yÃ¼ Hsiao, granting him a thousand catties of actual gold, and very 21a much brocade and embroidery. They sent him away and brought [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng to Ch'ang-an, [where he was] installed as the Shan-yÃ¼ Shun and retained in the [Hun] princes' quarters.17.4 17.4 HS 94 B: 18b, 20a = de Groot, Die Hunnen p. 272, 276 states that LÃ¼an-ti brother, LÃ¼an-ti Tsu, was first made Shan-yÃ¼ Shun and was taken to Ch'ang-an LÃ¼an-ti Teng, where LÃ¼an-ti Tsu died, and then Wang Mang appointed LÃ¼an-ti Teng Shan-yÃ¼ Shun in place of his brother. Wang Shun dies. From the time that [Wang] Mang usurped the throne, the Grand Master, Wang Shun4b, had been ill with [asthma and]17.5 17.5 The Sung Ch'i ed. states that the Old text (before vi cent.) writes ch'uan chi . Wang Nien-sun accordingly concludes that this passage originally read words, ch'uan-chi. These two words are unlike, so that they would not be confused each other; probably the Old text and later editions had each dropped out one of two words. T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983) 741: 4a, quotes this passage with both Wei Chao, in a note to HS 90: 15a, says, "When in one's heart he pants and sighs ( ), it is called chi." Stange, p. 169, n. 2, suggests angina pectoris. palpitation of the heart, which gradually became worse, so that he died. [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "Anciently the [Foreseen] Grand Duke of Ch'i, [LÃ¼ Shang], became the Grand Master of the Chou dynasty because of his purity and virtue during successive reignsâverily this is what I have perceived [in Wang Shun]. Let [Wang] Shun4b's son, [Wang] Yen2, succeed to his father's noble rank and become the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Hsin [Dynasty]; let [Wang] Yen2's younger brother, the Marquis As Recompense to [the House of] Hsin, [Wang] K'uang1a, become the Grand Master and General; and [let his house] forever be Coadjutors to the Hsin dynasty."17.6 17.6 This practise was in imitation of that in the ancient state of Lu, where the posts were held hereditarily by the descendants of Duke Huan and were relatives of the ruler. 317WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo III 99 B: 17b, 18a For the Heir-apparent, there were established four A.D. 11 New Officials. Masters and four Companions, who were ranked as Grandees. The former Grand Minister over the Masses, Ma Kung, became the Master of Doubts; the former Privy Treasurer, Tsung-po Feng, became the Assistant Tutor; the Erudit YÃ¼an Sheng became the Supporting Coadjutor; the Governor of the Capital, Wang Chia1c, became the Aiding Guardian. The foregoing were the Four Masters. 18a The former Prefect of the Masters of Writing, T'ang Lin, became the Attacher of the Indifferent, the Erudit Li Ch'ung1 became the Hastener to Submission, the Grandee-remonstrant Chao Hsiang became 17b the Guide, the General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Lien Tan, became the Defender. The foregoing were the four Companions. There was also established one Libationer for the Masters and Companions, together with one [Libationer] 21b for the Palace Attendants, one [Libationer for] the Remonstrants and Consultants, and one Libationer [to expound] each of the six Classics, nine Libationers altogether. They were ranked [the same as] the highest ranking of the high ministers. Tso Hsien, from Lang-ya [Commandery], became the [Libationer] Expounding the Spring and Autumn; Man Ch'ang, from Ying-ch'uan [Commandery], became the [Libationer] Expounding the Book of Odes; Kuo Yu, from Ch'ang-an, became the [Libationer] Expounding the Book of Changes; T'ang Ch'ang, from P'ing-yang, became the [Libationer] Expounding the Book of History; Ch'en Hsien, from P'ei Commandery, became the [Libationer] Expounding the Book of Rites; and Ts'ui Fa became the Libationer Expounding the Book of Music. [Wang Mang] sent A Heroic Refusal. an Internuncio, bringing a comfortable chariot, seal, and cord, to go to [the home of] and install Kung 318WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo III, IV A.D. 11/12 Sheng, of the [former] kingdom of Ch'u, as the 99 B: 18a, b Libationer for the Masters and Companions of the Heir-apparent. [Kung] Sheng would not respond to the summons, refused to eat, and died.18.1 18.1 For this heroic loyal refusal to take office under Wang Mang, cf. Glossary Kung Sheng. The General of a Peaceful Beginning, Yao HsÃ¼n, was dismissed and the Palace Attendant, the Marquis of Eminent Blessings, K'ung Yung, became the General of a Peaceful Beginning. Ominous Portents. In this year, in the prefecture of Ch'ih-yang, there were shadows of dwarfs, a foot and more tall. Some rode in quadrigae with horses, some walked on foot, holding18.2 18.2 Ch'ien Ta-chao notes that the Southern Academy ed. and the Fukien ed. read for . The Ching-yu and Official ed. read similarly. all sorts of things. The size [of these shadows in each group] were all proportionate to each other. On the third day, it stopped. In the commanderies on the banks of the [Yellow] River, locusts sprang up, and the [Yellow] River broke its banks in Wei Commandery, overflowing several commanderies from Ch'ing-ho [Commandery] eastwards. Previous to this [time, Wang] Mang had feared that the [Yellow] River would break its banks and injure the tumuli and graves [of his great-grandfather, Wang Ho, and his descendants], at YÃ¼an-ch'eng, [but] when it broke its banks, it went eastwards and YÃ¼an-ch'eng was not troubled by the 22a 18b water. Hence he therefore did not dike it. IV In the fourth year, the second month, an amnesty A.D. 12 [was granted to] the empire. Feb./Mar. In the summer, a red emanation came out in the Summer southeast, reaching to heaven. LÃ¼an-ti Teng Executed. The General Repressing Difficulties, Ch'en Ch'in,18.3 18.3 In 99 B: 14b and 94 B: 20a this man's given name is written so that is error here. said that he had captured some caitiff [Huns] alive, and that [they had told] that violations 319WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV 99 B: 18b of the border by the caitiffs had all been done by A.D. 12 [LÃ¼an-ti] Chio, the son of Shan-yÃ¼ Hsiao, [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien. [Wang] Mang became angry and decapitated 18a [LÃ¼an-ti Hsien's] son, [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng, at Ch'ang-an, in order to make him an example to the barbarians. The Commander-in-chief, Chen Han, died, and the General of a Peaceful Beginning, K'ung Yung, became the Commander-in-chief. The Palace Attendant and Grand Keeper of the Robes, Hou Fu, became the General of a Peaceful Beginning. Every time that [Wang] Mang had to go out [of the palace], immediately preceding there was a search in the city, which was called a "general search." In this month there was a general search for five days.18.4 18.4 For the "search," cf. HFHD, II, 113, n. 36.6. Wang Mang changed its name from to heng-sou . When [Wang] Mang reached the Ming-t'ang and A New Capital Ordered. gave the nobles their clods [enveloped in] quitch-grass18.5 18.5 Cf. Glossary, sub Marquises. [as a sign of enfeoffment], he issued a written message which said, "Although I am not virtuous, because I have inherited [the merits accumulated by] my sage ancestors, I have become the lord of the ten-thousand states.

But its would break the rhythm. provinces and correcting their frontiers, in order to beautify [peoples'] customs, and so I have sought out and surveyed the fundamental and subordinate principles of the earlier dynasties. "Verily, in the `Canon of Yao' [it speaks of] twelve provinces and [concerning] defences [it speaks of] five domains;18.7 18.7 The nine provinces are mentioned, not in the present "Canon of Yao," but in the chapter, where Shun is said to have made this division. (Anciently these two chapters formed one.) Cf. Book of History II, i, iii, 10 (Legge, p. 38). The five are mentioned in ibid. II, iv, i, 8 (Legge, p. 85). the Book of Odes [speaks of] fifteen 320WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 22b states, distributed among nine provinces;18.8 18.8 Yen Shih-ku enumerates these fifteen as follows: Chou and the south, Shao and the south, Wei, the Chou kingly state, Cheng, Ch'i, Weih, T'ang, Ch'in, Ch'en, , Ts'ao, Pin, Lu, and Shang; and alternatively as Chou and the south, Shao and the south, Pei, Yung, Wei, the Chou kingly state, Cheng, Ch'i, Weih, T'ang, Ch'in, Ch'en, , Ts'ao, and Pin. The second list is taken from the names of the "Lessons from the States"; cf. Legge, She-king, I, vii ff.

The Sung Ch'i ed. states that the Shun-hua ed. (994-997) omitted the words . while the Chou Offices, [sub] the Commander-[in-chief], has however no HsÃ¼ or Liang [Province].19.3 19.3 Chou-li 33: 6a-8b (Biot, II, 265-275) contains this list of provinces, which enumerated sub the Chih-fang-shih, a subordinate of the Commander-in-chief. The three different lists of the nine provinces are discussed in the Tz'u-hai, tzu, p. 106 sub The lords and kings changed [the arrangements] of their [predecessors]. Each one [distinguished himself] by his words or actions, some making their deeds brilliant and some enlarging their foundations, [but] their purposes were outstanding and their intentions were the same. "Anciently, two sovereigns of the Chou [dynasty] received the mandate [of Heaven], hence [the dynasty] had dwelling-places at the Eastern Capital, 18b [Lo], and at the Western Capital, [Feng]. Since I have received the mandate [of Heaven], I should verily also be like them. Let Lo-yang become the Eastern Capital of the House of Hsin and let Ch'ang2- an become the Western Capital of the House of Hsin, [two] royal domains with the appropriate organizations, each [royal domain] including territory for the estates of high bureaucrats and baronesses.

The number of the nobles shall be [limited to] 1800, and the number of the Sub-Vassals shall in addition be the same [as that of the nobles, which positions] shall await those who distinguish themselves. The various dukes shall [each] have the territory of one t'ung,19.4 19.4 The Official ed. has mistakenly emended t'ung to . The Ching-yu ed. reads the former. Chou-li 42: 1b, sub the Chiang-jen (Biot, II, 566) defines a t'ung as "a square of a hundred li." This term is also found in the Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XXV, (Legge, 51211, 516b). HS 23: 2b elaborates this passage from the Chou-li and says, "A territory one li square is a ching ; ten ching make a t'ung1 ; ten t'ung1 make a ch'eng (a ch'eng is ten li square); ten ch'eng make a chung ; ten chung make a t'ung2 (a t'ung2 is a hundred li square); ten t'ung2 make a feng ; ten feng make a ch'i (a ch'i is a thousand li square)." the multitude in ten thousand households, a territory a hundred li square. The marquises and earls shall [each] have one kuo, the multitude in five thousand households, a territory seventy li square. The viscounts and barons shall [each] have one tsÃª,19.5 19.5 The Chi-chung Chou-shu (the lost Book of History; possibly written after Han times and taken from earlier material) 5: 8b, 9a, chap. 48, "Tso-Lo Chieh," says, "For those who received a mandate [enfeoffing them as nobles] from the Chou [dynasty, the Chou King had] established a large altar to the gods of the soils in the center of their states [read for ] . . . and for the nobles who were about to be established, [the King] dug into and took of its soil from the side in the direction of their [territory], covered it with yellow earth, enveloped it with white quitch-grass, and used it for the earth [given them for] their enfeoffment. Hence it is said that they received tsÃª -earth from the House of Chou." (One text reads [cut off] instead of tsÃª). Shen Ch'in-han suggests that the term used by Wang Mang for the estates of viscounts and barons is taken from the above passage. The reception of a tsÃª is mentioned as the fifth appointment in Chou-li 18: 11b, sub Ta-tsung-po (Biot I, 429); cf. 99 A: n. 21.2. This passage of the Chou-li also mentions a kuo as the seventh appointment. the multitude in 2500 households, a territory fifty li square. Great Vassals shall have as their estates nine ch'eng,19.6 19.6 Ju Shun explains, "Ten li [square] make a ch'eng ," which is quoted from HS 23: 2b; cf. n. 19.4. the multitude in 900 households, a territory 23a 30 li square. From nine [ch'eng] on down, [the 322WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 Noble Ranks. estates of Vassals] shall decrease [by stages of] two 99 B: 19a, b [ch'eng], down to one ch'eng. When [the position of these] five degrees [of Sub-Vassals] are all filled, [their territories] will together be equal to one tsÃª.19.7 19.7 Wang Wen-pin (xix cent.) explains that it means estates of 9, 7, 5, 3 and 1 ch'eng. This passage is reminiscent of Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XXVI, (Legge, 51914, 524b), `It is the regulation that from the greatest to the least, [rewards] should be increased diminished by two." The areas of these five ranks of Sub-Vassals were, respectively, 900, 700, 500, 300, and 100 square li, the sum of which is 2500 square li, which is the area of a tse (50 li square). "Those who have now already received their clods 19b [enveloped in] quitch-grass are: fourteen dukes,19.8 19.8 Ch'ien Ta-hsin comments, "These fourteen persons were: [1] the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Hsin Dynasty, Wang Yen2, [2] the Duke Advancing the Hsin Dynasty, P'ing Yen, [3] the Duke Honoring the Hsin Dynasty, Liu Hsin1a, [4] the Duke Beautifying the Hsin Dynasty, Ai Chang, [5] the Duke Serving the Hsin Dynasty, Chen Han, [6] the Duke Ornamenting the Hsin Dynasty, Wang HsÃ¼n3, [7] the Duke Prospering the Hsin Dynasty, Wang Yi5, [8] the Duke Upholding the Hsin Dynasty, Wang Hsinga, [9] the Duke Perfecting the Hsin Dynasty, Sun Chien, [10] the Duke Exalting the Hsin Dynasty, Wang Sheng, [11] the Duke of Manifest Peace, Chi Tang, [12] the Duke Promulgating the Majestic Principles, Lin Pao, [13] the Duke Spreading the Majestic Principles, Chi, and [14] the Duke of Established Tranquillity, Liu Ying1a. The Duke Extending the Hsin Dynasty, Chen Feng, had committed a crime, and his state had been abolished, he is not in this number. The dukes of [Wang] Mang's imperial house, like the Recommended by [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu], [Wang] An1a, the Duke in Recompense to [the Marquis of] Hsin-[tu], [Wang] Lin1a, the Duke of High Merits, [Wang] , the Duke of Brilliant Merits, [Wang] Shou, the Duke of Perfected Merits, [Wang] Chi5b, the Duke of Eminent Merits, [Wang] Tsung, the Duke of Shining Merits, [Wang] Shih, and the Duke of Apparent Merits, [Wang] Li4 are also not among these fourteen persons." 93 marquises, 21 earls, 171 viscounts, and 497 barons, altogether 796 persons. [There are also] 1511 Sub-Vassals and 83 women among the nine [classes of royal] relatives who have become Baronesses. Moreover the female descendants of the Han dynasty, the Baronetess Serving the Rules of Proper Conduct, the Baronetess Obedient to Virtue, and the Baronetess Cultivating Moral Principles, in [the former kingdom of] Chung-shan, have been changed and made Baronesses. For the eleven highest ministers, the nine high ministers, the twelve grandees, and the twenty-four First Officers, their states, estates, or the places from which they draw their revenues have been fixed. 323WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV 99 B: 19b, 20a "I have caused the Palace Attendant and Grandee A.D. 12 19a Expounding the Book of Rites, K'ung Ping, and Nobles Given Salaries. others, with [the people] in the provincial divisions and the many commanderies who understand and know the principles of geographical arrangements, maps, and tax registers, together to examine them carefully and study them in the Vermillion Bird Hall of the Shou-ch'eng [House] and determine upon [the division of the empire into nine divisions]. I and the various highest ministers, Libationers, and high ministers of the highest rank have several times in person considered [this matter], so that I have already comprehended it all. "Verily, the recompensing of virtuous conduct and the rewarding of achievements are the means of 23b making illustrious men of virtue and stability. Harmony among one's nine [classes of] relatives is their way of making a return for one's love of one's relatives. Since for a long time I have pondered unremittingly and have thought and investigated [the deeds of] persons in previous [generations], I shall make brilliant the demotions and promotions, so as to make plain the good and evil [of officials] and tranquillize the great multitude." Because the maps and tax registers [for the new division of the country] had not yet been completed, [Wang Mang] had not yet given [these appointees] any states or estates and temporarily ordered that they should receive several thousand cash per month as salary from the [income of] the capital and inner [commanderies]. The nobles were all miserably poor, and there were even some who hired themselves out. A Gentleman-of-the-Household, Ou Po, admonished [Wang] Mang, saying, "Although the ching 20a [system of] cultivated fields was a law of the sage-kings, it has already been abolished for a long time. 324WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 The Ching System Abolished. When the practises of the Chou [dynasty] had de- 99 B: 20a cayed, so that the common people did not follow them, the Ch'in [dynasty] knew how to accommodate itself to the common peoples' minds so as to be able to make great profits. Hence [this dynasty] did away with the cottages of the ching [system] and established [salable] subdivisions [of cultivated fields], and therefore came to rule over all China. "Down to the present, [all] within [the four] seas have not yet had their fill of the perversity of the [Ch'in dynasty in removing the ching system]. If now you wish to go contrary to the desires of the common people and restore the lost practises of a thousand years ago, even though Yao and Shun should arise again, [yet] without a hundred years of gradual [training], they would be unable to put [these ancient practises] into effect. The empire has recently been tranquillized and the many common people have newly attached themselves [to you, so that the ching system] cannot yet be really put into Sale of Land and Slaves Permitted. practise." [Wang] Mang knew that the common people hated [his arrangements],20.1 20.1 T'ung-tien (by Tu Yu, 735-812) 1: 13b, quotes this sentence with the word ch'ou instead of yÃ¼an . (HS 24 A: 21b, in repeating this sentence, also uses ch'ou) Wang Nien-sun declares that someone who did not understand the ancient meaning of ch'ou changed the ch'ou originally in the text of the HS to yÃ¼an, and that ch'ou and yÃ¼an meant the same. Shou-wen 10 B: 8a defined wen as yÃ¼an, meaning to hate. (The present text of the Shou-wen writes nu for yÃ¼an, but that is an emendation; in the Shih-san Ching Chu-su, Book of Odes, no. 238; 16 ii: 13b, K'ung Ying-ta [574-648], quotes the Shuo-wen as saying that wen means yÃ¼an. The Yi-ch'ieh Ching Yin-yi in 25 chapters, written by the monk YÃ¼an-ying [737-790], 5: 6a, 13: 8a, 19: 11a, however quotes Shuo-wen as defining wen by nu.) Kuang-ya (by Chang Yi; in "Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 668A: 8a) defines both wen and ch'ou as hui , to hate. HHS, An. 2: 3b uses ch'ou-yÃ¼an as a phrase. The Ching-yu ed. however here reads yÃ¼an and I see no need to change the text. so he issued a written message, which said, "Those who own or enjoy the income from 24a the King's Fields are all permitted to sell them and are not to be restricted by the law.20.2 20.2 HS 24 A:21b (cf. App. I), in quoting this edict, adds that it applied also to ` adherents,' i.e., slaves. Those who 325WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV 99 B: 20a, b violate [the law against] private buying and selling A.D. 12 of ordinary people [as slaves] will moreover temporarily 19b not be punished." When previously the Generals and Lieutenants of Trouble at the Southwestern Borders. the Five Majestic Principles had gone out, they had changed [the title of] the King of Kou-t'ing to be that of Marquis. The King, [Wu] Han, was resentful and angry and would not be subordinate [to Chinese nobles, so Wang] Mang hinted to the Grand Governor of Tsang-k'o [Commandery], Chou Hsin, to kill [Wu] Han by a ruse. [After this had been done, Wu] Han's younger brother, [Wu] Ch'eng, raised troops, attacked, and killed [Chou] Hsin. Previous to this [time, Wang] Mang [ordered] the Trouble at the Northeastern Borders. troops of Kao-chÃ¼-li to be put into the field and they then would have made an expedition against the northern barbarians (Hu), [but] they did not wish to go. When the commandery [authorities tried to] compel and force them [to move], they all fled, went out of the barrier, and thereupon violated the laws and engaged in robbery. When the Grand Governor of Liao-hsi [Commandery], T'ien T'an, pursued and attacked them, he was killed by them. The provincial and commandery [authorities] put the blame 20b upon a marquis of the Kao-chÃ¼-li, Tsou. Chuang Yu memorialized, saying, "The violations of the law by the Mo people did not arise from Tsou. Even if [Tsou] had evil intentions, it would be proper to order the provincial and commandery [authorities] temporarily to soothe him. If now he is suddenly20.3 20.3 Yen Shih-ku explains that wei means "many, heavily," but Wang Nien-sun, in a note to HS 47: 9a, asserts that wei means suddenly, ts'u . "In a note to Li-chi 17: 2a (quoted in the Shih-san Ching Chu-su; the same passage as in Couvreur, I, 386), Cheng HsÃ¼an says, "Tsung is like wei-ts'u " (the last word should be read as ), so that wei and ts'u were used to form a binom. The Kuang-ya ("Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 671 B: 23b) defines wei as "suddenly ," which word means the same as ts'u. Ho Hsiu (129-182), in a gloss to Kung-yang Commentary 18: 8b, Dk. Ch'eng XVIII, says, "Duke Li wei killed four grandees," where wei means "suddenly." Yung's (79-166) "Fu on the Long Flute" (Wen-hsÃ¼an 18: 3a) likewise says, "The water from the mountains wei arrived," with the same meaning of wei. 326WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 Trouble in the Northeast. adjudged [guilty of] a serious crime, it is to be feared 99 B: 20b that he will thereupon rebel. Some of the Fu-yÃ¼ and their like would certainly respond to him. Since the Huns have not yet been conquered, if the Fu-yÃ¼ and the Wei-mo arise again, there would be serious trouble." [Wang] Mang did not [direct the officials] to console and calm [Tsou], and the Wei-mo accordingly revolted. By an imperial edict, [Wang Mang] ordered 24b [Chuang] Yu to attack them. [Chuang] Yu lured Tsou, the marquis of the Kao-chÃ¼-li, to come, and beheaded him. When his head had been transmitted to Ch'ang-an, [Wang] Mang was greatly pleased, and issued a written message which said, "Recently, I have commanded and sent my fierce generals to perform respectfully20.4 20.4 I follow Yen Shih-ku in reading as , a common exchange of characters. the punishment [directed by] Heaven, to execute and annihilate the caitiff [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih. They are divided into twelve regiments.20.5 20.5 The reference is to the twelve divisional generals who were to attack the Hun empire simultaneously, as is made plain by 94 B: 20a8, 18b10 = de Groot, 276, 273; cf. 99 B: 14a. Some are to cut off his right arm, some to cut thru his left arm-pit, some to break thru his chest and abdomen, and some to pull out his ribs. In this year 20a punishments are in the eastern quarter,20.6 20.6 Chang Yen comments, "In this [year], the year-star [Jupiter] was in jen-shen [the cyclical notation for A.D. 12], so punishments were in the eastern quarter." SC 27: 33 = Mh III, 356 says, "When there are deficiencies in fealty, the punishment comes from the Year-star." SC 27: 36 = Mh III, 360 notes that when Jupiter is in shen, "It is favorable for military [enterprises]." so the regiments who were to punish the Mo set out first, arrested and beheaded the caitiff Tsou, and tranquillized and made secure the eastern frontiers. The destruction and annihilation of the caitiff [LÃ¼an-ti] 327WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV 99 B: 20b, 21a Chih will come in a moment. A.D. 12 "This [success] was a blessing through the aid and assistance of Heaven, Earth, the many gods, the gods of the soils and grains, and the [royal] ancestral temples, and through the power [coming from] the Ministers, Grandees, Officers, and common people being of the same mind and from the generals and lieutenants being [like] roaring tigers. I approve most heartily of them. Let the name of the Kao (high)-chÃ¼-li be changed to be Hsia(low)-chÃ¼-li, and let it be published to all the world in order that everyone shall know of it." Thereupon the Mo people violated the borders all the more and the northeastern together with the southwestern barbarians were both in rebellion. [Wang] Mang's intentions were then grand, and he did not consider the barbarians of the four [quarters] worth destroying, but concentrated his mind on searching out ancient ways. He again 21a issued a written message, which said, "I humbly 25a think that my August Deceased First Ancestor, the An Imperial Progress Announced. Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], `received [Yao's] retirement [from the royal duties in the temple of] the Accomplished Ancestor,' and that he `examined the Fine Jade [Turning] Mechanism and the Jade Balance, in order that he might bring into accord the seven Governors.' Thereupon `he performed the sacrifice lei to the Lords on High, performed the sacrifice yin to his six exemplars, performed the sacrifice from a distance (wang) and arranged in order the mountains and streams, made a universal sacrifice (pien) to the many gods,' `made tours of inspection to' the five sacred peaks, and `held four courts for the various princes, at which they set forth and presented [matters] by word of mouth and were clearly tested by their deeds.'21.1 21.1 Quotations from Book of History II, i, iii, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (Legge, pp. 32, 33, 34, 35, 37). There are certain differences in the HS text: For the Book of History's (also read by the Official ed. of the HS), the HS reads ; for , it reads ; the sixth clause, concerning "the mountains and streams," is quoted at the place given it in the Book of History's v. 6, but has the additional word now in the doublet of that clause in v. 7. On the lei sacrifice, cf. Karlgren, BMFEA 20, pg. 80, Gl. 1256. For the "exemplars," cf. ibid., 81f, Gl. 1257. In Wang Mang's time, there were two interpretations for the phrases from the Book of History, hsÃ¼an-chi or (translated here as "the Beautiful Jade [Turning] Mechanism") and yÃ¼-heng (translated as "the Jade Balance"). Legge, in his translation (Shoo King, p. 33) adopts the interpretation by the pseudo-K'ung An-kuo, as does Couvreur (Chou King, p. 14-15). It interpreted these two phrases as denoting an armillary sphere and its viewing tube, respectively, the whole forming a spherical astrolabe. If such is the correct interpretation, this chapter of the Book of History cannot be very ancient, for the armillary sphere was quite probably a late important into China. W. Eberhard, "Das Astronomische Weltbild im alten China" (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1936, 24 Jahrg., Heft 33, p. 518) states that this instrument was known in China about 100 B.C. Ma Jung (A.D. 79-166), in his comment to this passage (preserved in Shang-shu Chu-su 3: 3b, 4a), describes a spherical astrolabe. There was also a quite different interpretation. The Wen-yao-kou Woof Exposition to the Spring and Autumn (fragments collected in the YÃ¼-han-shan-fang Chi-yi-shu; this passage is also quoted by Wang Hsien-ch'ien in a note on HS 26: 5a) said, "The Bushel [the Dipper in Ursa Major] is the throat of Heaven. From ancient [times], the Jade Balance (yÃ¼-heng) has belonged with Piao [the three stars in the tail of the Dipper: ?, ?, ? Ur Ma, or, as here, only one of them, ?, cf. MH III, 341, n. 5; i.e., the Jade Balance has been the tail of the Dipper] and K'uei [the four stars in the body of the Dipper, ?, ?, ?, ? Ur Maj, or merely ?] has been the Beautiful Jade [Turning] Mechanism (hsÃ¼an-chi)." In HS 21 A: 19b, Pan Ku quotes Liu Hsin concerning "the weights [used with] the balance (heng):" "The one [i.e., the balance] in heaven assists the Beautiful Jade [Turning] Mechanism (hsÃ¼an-chi). [The ruler] consults where it points `in order that he may [discover whether he] brings into accord the Seven Governors (ch'i-cheng).' Hence it is called the Jade Balance (yÃ¼-heng)." SC 27: 6 = MH III, 341 (this passage is also quoted in HS 26: 4b by Ma HsÃ¼, a brother of Ma Jung, who compiled this chapter of the HS) says, "The seven stars of the Northern Bushel [the Dipper] are what are referred to [in the passage of the Book of History which says, `He examined] the Beautiful Jade [Turning] Mechanism (hsÃ¼an-chi) and the Jade Balance (yÃ¼-heng), so that he might bring into accord the Seven Governors (ch'i-cheng).' " These passages make clear that Wang Mang interpreted the Beautiful Jade Turning Mechanism and the Jade Balance as the stars of the Dipper and not as any human astronomical instrument (cf. Chavannes' translation in MH I, 58-65 and 48, n. 2; Karlgren, BMFEA 20, 77ff, Gl. 1255). The Seven Governors (ch'i-cheng), according to both schools, were the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets. The K'ung An-kuo gloss (Shang-shu Chu-su 3: 3a) states (this interpretation was accepted by both schools): "When Yao did not permit Shun to refuse [the rule] and had him take the throne as regent, Shun examined the Ornaments of Heaven [the stars] and inspected and brought into accord the Seven Governors. When he [found that he had] suited the mind of Heaven, he hence performed his [governmental] duties." The underlying conception was that the sun, moon, and planets moved correctly or incorrectly in harmony with the good or evil character of the government, so that Shun, by observing the motion of the stars, was able to determine whether his assumption of the throne did or did not please Heaven. It did, and so his virtue harmonized the stars. The two "constellations" sometimes placed on their court robes by the Ch'ing emperors as symbols of imperial rank are almost surely the Beautiful Jade Turning Mechanism and the Jade Balance. According to the passage in the Book of History, these constellations were the means whereby Heaven confirms the right of an emperor to occupy the throne. The Jade Balance is the "pointer"âthe direction in which it points at dusk is supposed to move around the horizon one-twelfth of the circumference each month, so that it points out the months of the year, and, with the months, the duties of the ruler in each month (given in the "YÃ¼eh-ling," ch. IV of the Li-chi). The Jade Balance reminded the emperor of his governmental duties. It was sometimes worn just below the collar in front. 328WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 "[From the time that] I received the mandate [of 99 B: 21a Heaven] and ascended [the throne as] the actual 329WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV 99 B: 21a [Emperor], down to the fifth year of [the period A.D. 12 A.D. 13. Shih]-chien-kuo, will be already five years. Since the distresses of the nine dry years will have already been crossed and the [untoward] occurrences in 106 [years] will have already been passed,21.2 21.2 Liu Hsin, in his San-t'ung-li, calculated that the first 106 years in a yÃ¼an of 4617 years would contain nine years of drouth; cf. HS 21 A: 42a ff. [the planet] Jupiter will be in Shou-hsing, [the planet] Saturn will be in the [heavenly] Ming-t'ang, the Azure Dragon will be at kuei-yu, the [ruling] virtue will be in the Central Palace,21.3 21.3 Fu Ch'ien asserts, "The Azure Dragon is the T'ai-sui [the hypothetical dextrorotary correlate of the planet Jupiter]." Chang Yen declares, "When the T'ai-sui arises in the chia and yin [parts of the ecliptic], it is the dragon. The eastern quarter is the Azure [part]. In kuei its virtue is in the central palace [i.e., the circumpolar stars]." Chin Shao however explains, "Shou-hsing is [the constellations] Chio and K'ang. `The Eastern Palace [the eastern part of the ecliptic] is the Azure Dragon. Of [the constellations] Fang and Hsin, Hsin is the [heavenly] Ming-t'ang.' [A quotation from HS 26: 7a. `Hsin' here is an allusion to the Hsin dynasty, Wang Mang]. Wherever [the planet] Saturn is located, that state will be prosperous. [Wang] Mang himself said [he ruled through the virtue of the element] earth. The lord of the element earth is [the planet] Saturn. In kuei, the [ruling] virtue is in the central palace. The palace is also [the element] earth." For an account of the position of Jupiter and its Chinese hypothetical dextrorotary correlate, cf. Chavannes, Mh III, App. III. He remarks that because the revolution of Jupiter is accomplished in 11.86 years, instead of in exactly 12 years (in which latter period the Chinese dextrorotary correlate of Jupiter was supposed to make its revolution, thereby generating the cyclical date for a year), for Spring and Autumn times two years must be added to the date as given by the position of Jupiter to get the position of its dextrorotary correlate. From the above dating, it is evident that for Wang Mang's time, two years are similarily to be subtracted. This seems to have been one of the first cases in which the cyclical terms were used to denote a year. Previously they had been confined to the days. [the hexagrams] Kuan and 20b 330WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV A.D. 12 Chin will control the year,21.4 21.4 Meng K'ang explains, "He observed (kuan ) the advance and retreat of the sun, moon, stars and their controlling lords." He would translate this clause: "Observation of their advance [reading chin as ] will control the year." Chin Shao adds, "The observation [i.e., imitation of Duke Wen of] Chin [kuan-Chin; a phase used in Kuo-yÃ¼ 10: 1a] is to find out where the T'ai-sui is, in what degree and constellation of the Zodiac it is located." He also declares that Wang Mang was imitating Duke Wen of Chin in that his movements were timed to those of the T'ai-sui (cf. Kuo-yu, 10: 1a, b). But Ch'ien Ta-hsin points out that Meng K'ang is mistaken, for Kuan and Chin are both hexagrams (nos. 20 &amp; 35 respectively). In HHS, Mem. 20 A: 3b, Su Ching ( A.D. 1-29) is quoted as saying that the hexagram Pi controlled a certain year. The Yi-wei Chi-lan T'u (anonymous, annotated by Cheng HsÃ¼an, 127-200) and the Ch'ien-k'un Tso-to (prob. Han period) discuss what hexagrams control what years. and [divination by] the 99 B: 21a, b tortoise-shell and the milfoil have given information 21b that they approve, let there be prepared a levy and collection of taxes for the rites and ceremonies of a tour of inspection eastwards for that year, in the Feb. 5, second month, at the conjuction inaugurating the A.D. 13, second astronomical month."21.5 21.5 Wang Mang is following the procedure in Li-chi III, ii, 13-16 (Legge, I, 216-8; Couvreur I, 275-8) and the practise of Shun (Book of History II, i, 8, 9; Legge, 35-37). 25b The various highest ministers memorialized begging that there should be solicited from the officials and common people, men, horses, linen cloth, silk cloth,21.6 21.6 The Official ed. omits the , but the Ching-yu ed. reads it. and brocade. It was also begged that the twelve inner commanderies and kingdoms should buy horses and dispatch 450,000 rolls of silk, transporting them to Ch'ang2-an. Those which were to be sent earlier and later were not to wait for each other. 331WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo IV, V 99 B: 21b When [only] more than half arrived, [Wang] Mang A.D. 12/13 issued a written message which said, "Since the person of the Empress Dowager the Mother of Culture [nee Wang] is not in good health, let [the transportation] be temporarily stopped and await a future [order]." In this year, [Wang Mang] changed the titles of Titles Changed. the eleven highest ministers, [altering] hsin1 to be hsin2. Later he again changed hsin2 to be hsin4.21.7 21.7 The change was from Hsin1 the name of Wang Mang's original marquisate, to Hsin2 (heart), and from Hsin2 to Hsin4 (faithful). Anciently hsin1 and hsin2 were interchanged; the name of the Hsin dynasty was indifferently written hsin1 or hsin4. In the fifth year, the second month, the Empress V Dowager the Mother of Culture [nee Wang] died. A.D. 13, She was buried in the Wei Tomb with [her husband], Feb. 321.8 21.8 HS 98: 15a. Emperor YÃ¼an, but separated from him by a ditch.21.9 21.9 Ju Shun explains, "She was buried within the Major's Gates [at the tomb] and a ditch was made to separate her [from her husband's grave]." The Empress Dowager nee Wang dies. A temple for her was established at Ch'ang-an, at which the House of Hsin was from generation to generation to offer sacrifices, which Emperor YÃ¼an was [also] to partake as her spouse, seated below her couch. [Wang] Mang wore mourning for the Empress Dowager [nee Wang] to the third year. The Commander-in-chief, K'ung Yung, begged to retire, and he was granted a comfortable chariot with a quadriga of horses, and as [a person who ranked as] Specially Advanced, he took his place at court. The Marquis Unifying the Customs, Lu Ping, was made the Commander-in-chief. At this time, the common people of Ch'ang-an The Change of the Capital Postponed. heard that [Wang] Mang wanted to make his capital at Lo-yang, so they were unwilling to repair their residences, and some [people] destroyed their [houses] considerably. [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "The inscription on the dark dragon stone said, 21a 332WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo V A.D. 13 `Fix the virtue of the emperor [as that of earth and 99 B: 21b, 22a 26a locate] the capital at Lo-yang.'21.10 21.10 Chou Shou-ch'ang remarks, "This was an omen that [Emperor] Kuang-wu would establish his capital [there]." The mandate [of Heaven by means of] portents is manifest and clear. Could I presume not to uphold it reverently? A.D. 16. Because in the eighth year of [the period] Shih-chien-kuo [the planet] Jupiter will move to [the 22a contellations of] Hsing-chi, [which is equated] with the capital at Lo-yang, let the capital at Ch'ang2-an be carefully put in repair, and let it not be spoilt. Those who presume to violate [this order] shall immediately have their names reported and [the officials] shall beg [the throne to ratify appropriate punishment for] the crimes [of those people]." Trouble at the Northwestern Frontiers. In this year, the Greater and Lesser K'un-mi of the Wu-sun sent envoys to offer tribute. The Greater K'un-mi, [Yi-chih-mi], was a grandson of the Chinese [House of Han] on the distaff side.22.1 22.1 Cf. Glossary sub Wu-sun. His son by a wife who was a northwestern barbarian (Hu) had become the Lesser K'un-mi, to whom the Wu-sun had turned and adhered. [Wang] Mang saw that the Huns were simultaneously invading the various borders, so, with the intention of seeking to obtain the affection of the Wu-sun, he sent a commissioner to lead the envoy from the Lesser K'un-mi and place him [in the court at a station] above that of the envoy of the Greater K'un-mi. The Libationer for the Masters and Companions [of the Heir-apparent] Guarantor of His Perfection, Man Ch'ang, memorialized, impeaching [Wang Mang's] commissioner, saying, "The barbarians consider that China has [a knowledge of] what is right and proper, hence they submit and are obedient to [China]. The Greater K'un-mi is the prince [and the Lesser K'un-mi is his subject]. Now to rank the 333WANG MANG, Shih-chien-kuo V 99 B: 22a envoy of a subject above the envoy of his prince is A.D. 13/14 not the way to hold [the affection of] the barbarians. The commissioner was seriously disrespectful." [Wang] Mang became angry and dismissed [Man] Ch'ang from his office. The various states of the Western [Frontier] Regions considered that [Wang] Mang had repeatedly broken [the ties of] grace and faithfulness [binding them to China. The state of] Karashahr (Yen-ch'i) revolted first, murdering the Protector-General [of 26b the Western Frontier], Tan Ch'in. In the eleventh month, a broom-star appeared. Nov./Dec. In twenty-odd days it disappeared.22.2 22.2 This is no. 54 in Williams, Observations of Comets. Dion Cassius (Hist. Roman., lvi, 29) also mentions comets at this time. Cf. Chambers, Descriptive Astronomy, p. 557. Prohibition of Copper and Charcoal Abolished. In this year, because those who violated [the law against] possessing copper and charcoal were too many, this law done away with. For the next year, [Wang Mang] changed the year-period, calling it T'ien-feng.22.3 22.3 The Han-chi mentions Wang Mang's first year-period, Shih-chien-kuo, but it neglects the others entirely, continuing the enumeration of years from the first to the fifteenth year of Wang Mang's reign. Sub 20 A.D., it merely mentions that every six years the year-period was to be changed, but does not give the name of the next year-period. Sung Hsiang (996-1066) in his Chi-yÃ¼an T'ung-p'u (lost) remarked that he suspects that there had been a happy auspice of phoenixes, from which this reign-period was taken. (Noted by Wang Hui [1321-1373] in the HS P'ing-lin 99 B: 24b.) I In [the year-period] T'ien-feng, the first year, the A.D. 14, first month, an amnesty [was granted] to the empire, Jan./Feb. and [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "In the second Feb. 19. month, at the conjunction inaugurating the second An astronomical month, I will perform the rites of a tour 21b of inspection.

The Sung Ch'i ed. asserts that the word (plowshare) should be added after the word (plow-handle), to agree with that passage in the Li-chi, but Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) replies that this remark is mistaken, for the insertion would break the rhythm of 4-character phrases. and every county shall thereupon plow, in order to encourage `the beginning [of the work of ploughing] at the eastern [season, spring].'22.6 22.6 These phrases are taken from the Book of History, I, ii, 4, 5, 6 (Legge, pp. 18-20); cf. also HFHD II, 392, n. 8.2. When I tour southwards, I must in person carry a hoe, and every county shall thereupon weed, thereby encouraging `the development22.7 22.7 Yen Shih-ku points out that should be read as ; Ch'ien Ta-chao adds that the former character was anciently written .

When I tour westwards, I must in person carry a sickle, and every county shall thereupon reap, thereby encouraging `harvesting in the western [season, autumn].'22.6 22.6 These phrases are taken from the Book of History, I, ii, 4, 5, 6 (Legge, pp. 18-20); cf. also HFHD II, 392, n. 8.2. When I tour northwards, I must in person carry a flail, and every county shall thereupon garner [their grain],22.8 22.8 The text reads su , grain, and Yen Shih-ku declares it means , to thresh. Li Tz'u-ming however objects that this interpretation does not fit in with the last words of the sentence, "covering up and storing [the harvest]," and states that su is probably a copyist's mistake, made before the T'ang period, for , which in ancient times was used for (to store in granaries), since the latter character did not exist in ancient times. thereby encouraging covering up and storing [the harvest]. When I have completed the rites of the tour of inspection northwards, I will thereupon go to the center of the earth and dwell in the capital at Lo-yang. If any [people] presume to run and make a noise, violating the law, they will immediately be dealt with according to military law."22.9 22.9 When the Emperor was inspecting, people were supposed to keep quiet in reverence. 27a The various highest ministers memorialized, saying, "You, Emperor, are most filial. In the last year, 335WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I, i 99 B: 22b, 23a when the sage person of the [Empress Dowager] A.D. 14, Jan./Feb. the Mother of Culture [nee Wang] was not in good health, you yourself in person supplied her needs, rarely taking off your clothes or bonnet. When thereupon it happened that she left her subjects, you became melancholy. The color of your features has not yet returned, and you have eaten and drunk too little. "Now for you to make four tours in one year, [to travel] a road ten thousand li [in length]âyour age is honorable, so that you cannot endure [living on] dry provisions and dried meat. For the time being, do not make [these] tours of inspection. You need to end your deep mourning in order to rest your sage person. Your subjects will use all their power to 23a 22a care for and shepherd the myriad common people and will support and accord with your brilliant edicts." [Wang] Mang replied, "If the highest ministers, the [Provincial] Shepherds, the high officials, the nobles, and `the heads of offices'23.1 23.1 Shu-yin is a phrase from the Book of History, II, iv, iii, 10 (Legge, p. 89), where the pseudo-K'ung An-kuo explains it as . are willing to use all their power, leading each other in caring for and shepherding the myriad common people, and wish thereby to assist me and in this way to obey respectfully,23.2 23.2 For , the Official ed. mistakenly reads .

I will change [my plans] and in the seventh year of [the period] T'ien-feng, A.D. 20. when [the planet] Jupiter will be in Ta-liang and the Azure Dragon will be at keng-ch'en, I will perform the rites of a tour of inspection. The next year Jupiter A.D. 21. will be in Shih-ch'en and the Azure Dragon at hsin-szu, when I will go to the center of the earth at the The Capital to be changed. capital in Lo-yang." [Wang Mang] thereupon sent the Grand Tutor, P'ing Yen, and the Grand Minister of Works, Wang 336WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I, iii A.D. 14, Apr. 18 Yi5, to Lo-yang to plan and perform divination for 99 B: 23a, b [making] a map of the pomeria for [future] graves, and to build the [imperial] ancestral temple, the altars to 27b the gods of the soils and grains, and the pomeria for [the altars for] suburban sacrifices. Apr. 18 In the third month, on [the day] jen-shen, the A Solar Eclipse. last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun, and a general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. The document to the Commander-in-chief, Lu Ping, said, "The sun has been eclipsed so that it had no light, since the shields and spears had not been gathered in. Let the Commander-in-chief transmit to the emperor his seal and [ceremonial] apron [in token of his dismissal] and take the position of a marquis of a noble clan in the court. The Grand Tutor, P'ing Yen, shall not be Intendant of Affairs of the Masters of Writing. Let the Palace Attendants and Department Heads who concurrently hold other positions be dispensed with. Let Miao Hsin, an advantageous male,23.3 23.3 The text now reads, "A man of Li-miao, Hsin," and Ju Shun declares that Li-miao is the name of a town. It is listed in the Tung Commandery. But Li Tz'u-ming (7: 16b) remarks that, from the previous mention on B: 14b and the subsequent notice of dismissal from the post of Commander-in-chief on B: 26a, this name is undoubtedly Miao Hsin; the surnames of Wang Mang's officials are always given; when he enfeoffed people or gave them titles, he always picked lucky names and did not employ the names of towns. Hence and have probably been interchanged, and after a word or words have probably dropped out. This textual error then antedates the third century, for it was in Ju Shun's text. Nan or nan-tzu is occasionally used with the meaning, "a man," cf. SC 6: 161 = MH II, 118, HS 8: 10b, 10: 10a, 99 A: 18b, 30b. become the Commander-in-chief." Disorderly Officials. When Wang Mang had taken the throne as actual [Emperor], he took special precautions against his great officials and restrained and took away the power of his subordinates. If a court official said anything about the faults of [the high officials, Wang Mang] each time promoted [the speaker]. Because K'ung Jen, Chao Po, Fei Hsing, and others dared to 23b attack the great officials, [these daring critics] were 337WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I, iii 99 B: 23b trusted, were selected for outstanding positions, A.D. 14, Apr. and held [such positions]. When the ministers entered the palaces, there was a regular number of officials [for their suite]. When the officials accompanying the Grand Tutor, P'ing Yen, were greater [in number] than the regulation [allowed], a Supervisor at a side-gate minutely questioned [P'ing Yen about it] without showing any 22b deference to him. A Mou Department Head and Officer [in his train] arrested and bound the Supervisor. [Wang] Mang was furious and sent an Upholder of the Laws to send out several hundred chariots and horsemen, surround the yamen of the Grand Tutor, and arrest the Officer, who thereupon died. An Officer of the Grand Minister of Works passed 28a at night by a commune [under the control of] the Master of Ceremonies. When the Chief of the Commune was severe with [the Officer and the latter] made known the name of his office, the Chief of the Commune said drunkenly, "Surely you have passport credentials?" The Officer beat the Chief of the Commune with his horsewhip, and the Chief of the Commune beheaded the Officer and fled. The commandery and prefectural [authorities] pursued him, and his household sent to the Emperor a letter [explaining the matter. Wang] Mang said, "The Chief of the Commune was upholding the public [good]. Do not pursue him," and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang] Yi5, had his Officer's [body] mutilated23.4 23.4 The text reads (to reprimand); Liu Pin remarks that this official had previously been beheaded and so the word should probably be (to cut). Stange (p. 187 &amp; n. 4), and Duyvendak prefer not to emend the text. But Wang Yi plainly wanted to inflict additional punishment upon his Officer. After the Emperor, Wang Mang, had condemned the Officer, a posthumous reprimand by a minister could add nothing. "Cutting," i.e., mutilating the body, was a severe additional punishment, quite in harmony with the practises of the age. in order to excuse himself. Since the State General, Ai Chang, was considerably 338WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I A.D. 14 lacking in purity, [Wang] Mang selected and estab- 99 B: 23b, 24a lished for him a Third Brother Ho. His [imperial] command said, "Do not only protect the doors of the State General's female apartments; it is necessary to protect his blood relatives and relatives by marriage in the western provinces."23.5 23.5 Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that Ai Chang came from Tzu-t'ung in Kuang-han Commandery (in the present Szechuan), hence Wang Mang said, "in the western provinces." The various highest ministers were all light-[weight] and of little worth, 24a [Ai] Chang especially so. Apr./May. In the fourth month, there was a fall of frost which killed the vegetation, especially at the sea-shore. June/July. In the sixth month, a yellow fog [filled up everything Jul./Aug. within] the four quarters. In the seventh month, a great wind uprooted trees and blew off the roof-tiles Ominous Portents. on [the buildings at] the Northern Portal [of the Palace] and at the Chih-ch'eng gate [of Ch'ang-an] 23a and hail fell, killing cattle and sheep. New Titles for Provincial Officials. In accordance with the text of the Chou-li and the "Royal Regulations," [Wang] Mang established Directors of Confederations, Leaders of Combinations, and Grand Governors, whose duties were to be the same as those of [the former] Grand Administrators, and [established] Prefects of Associations and Chiefs 28b of Associations with duties the same as those of [the former] Chief Commandants. He established [nine] Provincial Shepherds who were to be received in audience with [the same] formalities as those [shown] to the three highest ministers, and twenty-five Superintendents of Regional Divisions,24.1 24.1 The suggestion that Provincial Governors (the title previously given to Shepherds) should rank higher than Commandery Administrators had been made by Ho Wu, represented it as a conception of the Spring and Autumn; cf. HS 83: 14b, 15a. The text is difficult to understand as it stands. After chou-mu , I insert tentatively , at the suggestion of T'an Ch'i-hsiang (K'ai-ming Bookstore's Erh-shih-wu-shih Pu-p'ien, I, p. 1747), to parallel the next clause, pu-chien erh-shih-wu jen . I also place these last six characters after the clause chien-li ju san-kung , and drop the word chien that now comes after this kung. (Chien is superfluous as a result of the last change. It is not in the quotation of this passage in Han-chi 30: 13b). The ranking of san-kung, the three highest ministers, can hardly refer to the pu-chien, the Superintendents of Regional Divisions, for they are here stated to have had a lower rank. In HS 99 C: 10b, it is moreover stated that the Provincial Shepherds (chou-mu) had the rank of highest ministers (san-kung). In the transfer of these six characters, I follow Wang Nien-sun. He would emend more drastically, following Han-chi 30: 13b, and reading, "He established Provincial Shepherds, the formalities for whom (ch'i-li ) were to be like those of the three highest ministers, and twenty-five Superintendents of Commanderies (chÃ¼n -chien). The rank of the Superintendents (chien) was to be that of Upper-ranking Grandees. Each was to have charge of five commanderies." Wang Nien-sun eliminates any mention of Superintendents of Regional Divisions (pu-chien) and changes the chien-li of the HS text to ch'i-li as in the Han-chi. As evidence for his emendations he has only the Han-chi's text. Chu Yi-hsien (1846-1894) however protests that it is quite unnecessary to change chien-li to ch'i-li; chien-li is often found in the HS [as in 99 A: 3a], so that there is no reason for emending it. Yang Shu-ta approves this refusal to emend. T'an Ch'i-hsiang (op. cit., pp. 1746-47) argues that Wang Nien-sun is furthermore mistaken in emending pu-chien, Superintendents of Regional Divisions, to chÃ¼n-chien, Superintendents of Commanderies. For (1) the Regional Divisions (pu) are mentioned again in HS 99 B: 29a. (2) In HHS, Mem. 3: 2a, Wei Ao: is quoted as having sent out in A.D. 23 a broadcast to Wang Mang's "Shepherds of Provinces (chou-mu), Superintendents of Regional Divisions (pu-chien)," and minor officials. (3) T'an Ch'i-hsiang also quotes Chang HsÃ¼an's (fl. 1582) Hui Erh-ya (also called the Hui-p'ien) as listing an impression of an ancient seal with the five words: " pu-chien . The Seal of the Superintendent of the Eastern Regional Division." There is then ample evidence that Wang Mang actually had Regional Divisions (pu) with Superintendents (chien). T'an Ch'i-hsiang however finds it difficult to explain how twenty-five regional divisions could have been arranged into nine provinces and how the word pu could have also been used with the title of Shepherd (mu), as in the phrase, "the Shepherd of Yung Regional Division" (99 B: 30a &amp; C: 4b). The word pu, in addition to its other meanings, had, in Han times, certain technical uses. For example, it denoted a "regiment" of 1000 men and 111 officers (HS 69: 11b). It was also used for the administrative areas assigned in 106 B.C. to each of the twelve Inspectors of Regional Divisions (pu ; HS 19 A: 27a, b). After this title had been changed to that of Shepherd (mu) in 1 B.C., the term pu or regional division naturally still clung to these Shepherds. In a memorial dated A.D. 5, Wang Mang remarks (HS 99 A: 24b), "When the Shepherds of Provinces (chou-mu) go to inspect their regional divisions (pu)," and 99 C: 18a states that K'ung Jen was sent in A.D. 22 "to be in charge of the division (pu), YÃ¼ Province." Something of Wang Mang's districting of China may be inferred from the way he had his highest ministers "guarantee" the empire (HS 99 B: 29a). The four Chiefs of the Sacred Peaks in the four quarters guaranteed 100 commanderies, which were grouped into a total of eight provinces plus five regional divisions. The other three highest ministers guaranteed twenty-five commanderies in the central and neighboring regional divisions. These commanderies were not however assigned to them by regional divisions. The Grand Minister over the Masses guaranteed five commanderies from two different regional divisions. Each of these three highest ministers was assigned commanderies from the areas about both the two imperial capitals, Ch'ang-an and Yi4-yangb (Lo-yang). There were in the empire or kingdom (Wang Mang used both the titles of "emperor" [99 B: 22b] and "king") nine provinces, 125 commanderies (99 B: 25a), making twenty-five regional divisions (99 B: 24a). A regional division was composed of five commanderies (99 B: 24a). How many commanderies were there in a province? The three provinces guaranteed by the Grand Master averaged less than seven commanderies each. The two guaranteed by the Grand Tutor and the two guaranteed by the State General averaged ten commanderies each. The province guaranteed by the State Master contained fifteen commanderies. Then a province might have from five to fifteen commanderies or more. In addition to these eight provinces there were five other regional divisions (making twenty-five commanderies) guaranteed by these four ministers, plus twenty-five more commanderies guaranteed by the three other ministers. How could the remaining fifty commanderies form only one province? In the former Han empire, the commanderies about the imperial capital had formed an administrative area under the Colonel Director of the Retainers (Szu-li-hsiao-wei), which was not entitled a province (chou), altho it actually functioned as one. Wang Mang almost surely followed this precedent, both for security reasons and in order to exalt the majesty of his arrangements. He had two capitals, Ch'ang-an and Lo-yang, about each of which he would accordingly have established a group of commanderies not included in any province. This arrangement is implied by the edict concerning the areas neighboring the two capitals quoted in 99 B: 24a, b and is practically stated in Wang Mang's enactment of two "royal domains" (99 B: 19a). We know the names of twelve commanderies in these royal domains (the Western Capital had about it the six Commandants' commanderies and the Eastern Capital had about it the six Neighboring commanderies mentioned in 99 B: 29a; cf. also 99 B: 24a, b, 25a, 99 C: 16a, and T'an Ch'i-hsiang op. cit., pp. 1734-1737). It is moreover not likely that Wang Mang could have considered an area of only seven commanderies, about the size of a small province, adequate to express the dignity of the Son of Heaven. His two royal domains might well have each been larger than any province, being composed of twenty commanderies each, leaving ten commanderies for the ninth province. His kingdom then contained nine provinces plus two large royal domains. It is unlikely that a single regional division included parts of two provinces, since it would be difficult for a single superintendant to investigate two different . Then the number of commanderies in a province was five or a multiple thereofâas arrangement that was justified by the current doctrine of "five powers (wu-hsing)" accepted by Wang Mang. The actual size of commanderies could be adjusted to such a rigid arrangement by varying the number of counties in a commandery. This supposition is substantiated by the size of the province guaranteed by the State Master (fifteen commanderies) and by those guaranteed by the Grand Tutor and the State General (either ten commanderies to each province or else five to one and fifteen to the other). The three provinces guaranteed by the Grand Master totalled twenty commanderies. Then some provinces contained only five commanderies and were identical with a single regional division. This conclusion explains and is justified by the phrase, "the Shepherd of the Yung Regional Division" (99 B: 30a). Meng K'ang (fl. A.D. 220-280) glosses (HS 95: 7a), "[Wang] Mang changed Yi Province to be the Yung Regional Division." (He probably economized by appointing the same person concurrently Shepherd and Superintendent.) Such an area could be called by the name of either the province or the regional division, as in Ch'ing times a city could be called by its name as a prefecture (fu) or as a county (hsien). There is then no reason to follow Wang Nien-sun in his latter two emendations. Some copyist of the Han-chi may not have understood Wang Mang's districting of the country, so changed pu to the more familiar chÃ¼n, whereupon Wang Nien-sun was misled. 339WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I 99 B: 24a who were to rank as Upper-ranking Grandees. Each A D. 14 one was to have charge of five commanderies.

All those offices were made hereditary. Those who did not have any noble ranks were made [Grand] Governors. The neighborhood of the city of Ch'ang-an was divided into six districts, and one Leader was established for each [district]. The capital commanderies were divided and made into six commandants' commanderies.24.2 24.2 San-fu Huang-t'u (iii-vi cent.) 1: 2a describes this division: "Wang Mang divided the neighborhood of the city of Ch'ang-an into six districts and established one Leader for each [district]. He divided the capital districts and made them into six [Commandant's Commanderies] with Chief Commandants. The ten prefectures: Wei-ch'eng and An-ling, and northwest to HsÃ¼n-yi and Yi-ch'Ã¼, were put under the Capital Commandant Grandee, with his yamen at the former Ch'ang-an official building. The ten prefectures, Kao-ling and northwards, were put under the Metropolis Commandant Grandee, with his yamen at the former Commandant of Justice's yamen. The ten prefectures, Hsin-feng and eastwards to Hu were put under the Supporter Commandant Grandee with his yamen at the east of the city. The ten prefectures, Pa-ling, Tu-ling, and eastwards to Lan-t'ien, and westwards to Wu-kung and YÃ¼-yi, were put under the Commandant of Splendor Grandee, with his yamen at the [south] of the city. The ten prefectures, Mou-ling, Huai-li, and westwards to Ch'ien, were put under the Sustainer Commandant Grandee, with his yamen at the west of the city. The ten prefectures, Ch'ang-ling, Ch'ih-yang, and northwards to [YÃ¼n-yang and] Tai-hsÃ¼, were put under the Commandant of Magnificence Grandee, with his yamen at [the north of the city]." (The words in square are not in the present text of the San-fu Huang-t'u, and are supplied from Yen Shih-ku's quotation of this passage, which represents a superior text.) In addition to the six Commandant's counties, the city of Ch'ang-an formed a separate administrative district "The Western Capital of the House of Hsin" (99 B: 19a). [The commanderies of] Ho-tung, Ho-nei, 24b 342WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I A.D. 14 Hung-nung, Jung-yang,24.3 24.3 Liu Feng-shih (1014-1113) asserts that the "Ho-nan" in the text should be Jung-yang, for on this page a little farther on, the title of the Grand Governor of Ho-nan changed to a different title. Lo-yang (renamed Yi-yang), the headquarters of the Ho-nan Commandery, was to be an imperial capital, hence Jung-yang and other of the Ho-nan Commandery were separated to be a Neighboring Commandery. The Jung-yang Commandery is mentioned on 99 B: 25b. Chou Shou-ch'ang points out that in this passage Wang Mang is following in general and with changes the account in the Chou-li, according to which the region within 100 of the capital was called the suburbs, chiao , in which were established six districts, hsiang , and the region beyond the suburbs was called the neighborhood, sui , which were established six administrations over the six Neighborhoods. In a note to Chou-li 9: 1b (Biot, I, 172, n. 2), sub the Hsiang-lao, Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C.-A.D. 83) says, "Within 100 li [from the capital] are the six hsiang: without it are the six Neighboring [Commanderies] (sui)." The Chou-li 15: 8a (Biot, I, 336 ff) has an official called the Sui-jen . The term sui seems to come from the Book of History V, xxix, 5 (Legge, p. 625) where Po-ch'in made to say, "You men of Lu, from the three chiao and three sui, prepare forage." and tui , the word in the text, were anciently interchanged; SC 33: 20 (Mh IV, 103), which quotes the above passage from the Book of History, reads (actually written HS 99 B: 25b), of which tui (here pronounced sui4, according to Yen Shih-ku), is a cursive writing. The six neighboring commanderies were the Capital, Western, Eastern, Southern, Ch'i, and Northern Neighboring Commanderies. Cf. 99 B: 29a. Ying-ch'uan, and 99 B: Changes in Geographical Names. Nan-yang became the six Neighboring Commanderies, and Grandees were established [for them] with duties like those of the [former] Grand Administrators, and Directors of Associations with duties like those of the [former] Chief Commandants. The title of the Grand Governor of Ho-nan [Commandery] was changed to be the High Minister Protecting and devoted to the Hsin4 [Dynasty]. The counties subordinate to Ho-nan [Commandery] were increased to be a full thirty, and six suburbs were established with a Chief of a Department for each [suburb], each [Chief of a Department] having charge of five 343WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I 99 B: 24b, 25a counties. A.D. 14 Moreover the names of the other offices were all 29a changed. The large commanderies were divided into 23b even as many as five [commanderies],24.4 24.4 Ch'ien Ta-hsin remarks that many of these new names are listed in HS ch. 28, the "Treatise on Geography," but the new delimitations of commanderies are not all indicated there. "Three hundred sixty" has an astrological significence, being the number of days in an ancient Chinese solar year. and three 25a hundred sixty commanderies and counties were given the names of communes, in order to accord with the words of the mandates [of Heaven as transmitted by] portents. At the borders there were also established Commandants of the Frontiers. Barons were given [these offices. The numbers of] reserved fields within nobles' estates were increased or decreased in order to promote or demote [these nobles].25.1 25.1 Hsien-t'ien is a term taken from Li-chi, III, i, 8 (Couvreur, I, 268; Legge, I, 212), of which pseudo-K'ung Ying-ta (quoted in the Shih-san Ching Chu-su, Li-chi 11: 5b) says, "If [fields in nobles estates] are not given in enfeoffment to people [who will be their vassals], they are called reserved fields (hsien-t'ien)." [Wang] Mang issued a written message, which said, "At the Western Capital, Ch'ang2-an, [the capital commanderies] shall be called the Six Districts and the various counties shall be called those of the six Commandants; at the Eastern Capital, Yi4-yangb, [the capital commanderies] shall be called the Six Departments,25.2 25.2 Liu Feng-shih remarks that chou (Department) should be (Suburb). According to 99 B: 24b, however, chou is correct, for Wang Mang entitled the heads of the commanderies nearest Lo-yang (then named Yi4-yangb) Chiefs of Departments. and the various counties shall be called [those of] the six Neighboring [Commanderies]. Within [the area which] `contributes grain in the husk and cleaned grain,' [the commanderies] are to be called the Contributing Commanderies.25.3 25.3 Book of History III, i, ii, 18 (Legge, p. 144) says, "From the fourth [hundred li from the capital, they contributed] grain in the husk, and from the fifth [hundred li, they brought] cleaned grain." The first five hundred li from the capital constituted the royal domain. Outside of them, [the commanderies] 344WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I A.D. 14 Classical Districts. are to be called the Attached Commanderies. Those 99 B: [commanderies] which contain barriers or palisades are to be called Border Commanderies. Altogether there are one hundred and twenty-five commanderies in nine provinces with two thousand two hundred and three counties. "Those who do public service in the imperial domain are those `constituting fortified walls.' Those in the Domain of the Nobles are those `securing repose.' Those in the territories allotted to high bureaucrats, baronesses, and the patrols are those `constituting buttresses.'25.4 25.4 The terms, ts'ai, jen, chu-hou2 are taken from Book of History III, i, ii, 19 (Legge, 144-45), except that it uses nan instead of jen. Yen Shih-ku ts'ai as "the ts'ai domain," i.e., the region allotted for the estates supporting and grandees. Jen he interprets as "the domain of the barons (nan)." Wang Mang had however given the title of jen to baronesses (99 B: 4b). The K'ung An-kuo gloss to the above passage (Shang-shu Chu-su 6: 18a) says, "Nan is jen." K'ung Ying-ta explains, "The pronunciation of nan is near to that of jen, hence [the former] is explained by jen." He interprets jen as "to be employed on the king's business," seemingly denoting who hold office. The archaic pronunciation of nan (Grammata Serica, # 649) was and that of jen (ibid. # 667f) was . The K'ung An-kuo gloss may have been a explanation by an assonant word, so that K'ung Ying-ta interprets it correctly. But by using this gloss, jen may be exchanged with nan. Indeed in a note to HS 99 B: 4b, Shih-ku says, "Nan is also jen." This circumstance explains Wang Mang's use of as his title for baronesses. Wang Mang here however uses jen instead of the nan in the Book of History. Did he mean something slightly different? He may have meant () baronesses, (b) barons, or (c) those who hold office. I have preferred the first meaning, for he very likely included the barons along with the nobles in the preceding . The words ts'ai jen are also used on 99 B: 19a, where I have interpreted them likewise. Chu-hou2 may denote "the nobles." But Wang Mang's nobles were located elsewhere, so that this meaning would introduce disorder into his architectonic scheme. The K'ung An-kuo gloss says, "Hou2 is hou4 . They patrol (ch'ih -hou4) and serve. . . . In their 300 li they all alike patrol (ch'ih-hou4) for the king." K'ung Ying-ta explains, "Ch'ih-hou4 means that they patrol strategic places, watching for bandits." (Ch'ih-hou4 today means "sentry.") Wang Mang almost surely had this Han in mind. The Sung interpreters were probably correct about this passage in the Book of History the greatest nobles were said to have been located farthest from the king and the ones nearer him, in order to have powerful defenders at the borders, ready to repel invasion. This passage probably reflects the actual situation during the latter part of the Chou period: Lo-yang was the capital and the large feudal states were at the periphery of the Chinese orbit. Wang Mang established a feudal nobility, because it was in accordance with classical precedents. He ennobled the members of his clan. But he was an who intended to rule the whole country, instead of depending upon his nobles for defence. He turned the classical scheme upside down, placing the greatest noble estates nearest the ruler. This arrangement he doubtless felt was more in accordance with the Confucian principle of exhibiting a due gradation of affection as between his closer relatives (the great nobles) and the more distantly related ones (the minor nobles), by placing his closest relatives nearest himself. Those in the Domain of 345WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I 99 B: 25a, b Submission25.5 25.5 The "domain of submission" is not in the usual lists of domains; this term is taken from the brief list in Kuo-yÃ¼ 1: 2a, b. Yen Shih-ku asserts it is the same as the domain of garrisons in Chou-li XXXIII, 52 (Biot, II, 276). are those `constituting screens.' A.D. 14 Those in [the regions where they] `cultivate the lessons of learning and moral duties [and where they] show the energies of war and defence'25.6 25.6 A quotation from Book of History III, i, ii, 20 (Legge, p. 145), where, in discussing the region constituted by the five hundred li beyond the domain of the nobles, which former is the second domain beyond the innermost one, it says, "In the first three hundred they cultivated the lessons of learning and moral duties; in the other two hundred li they showed the energies of war and defence." are those `constituting [unfortified] walls.' Those outside the nine provinces are those `constituting fences.'25.7 25.7 The six phrases, "constituting fortified walls," "securing repose," "constituting buttresses," "constituting screens," "constituting walls," and "constituting fences" are taken from the Book of Odes, III, ii, x, 7 (Legge, II, 503), where they refer to the king's relatives, the cherishing of virtue, great families, great states, the multitudes of people, and good men, respectively. This stanza is quoted in full in HS 14: 1a. Wang Mang is using this stanza as the authority for his own system of domains which shall harmonize the two systems in the Book of History and the Chou-li. 29b Each one is to be styled in accordance with the region [in which his fief is located]; altogether they constitute the myriad states." In subsequent years, [Wang Mang] again changed Multiple Renaming. [names], even changing the name of a single commandery five times, returning and restoring its former 25b [name], so that the officials and common people 24a could not keep records of [these names], and whenever a written imperial edict was issued, the former names [of places mentioned therein] were each time 346WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I A.D. 14 attached. 99 B: Confusing Changes of Names. [For example], he said, "An imperial edict of decree to the Grand Governor and Grand Commandant of Ch'en-liu [Commandery]. Let [the territory] from Yi-sui and southwards be transferred to Hsin-p'ing [commandery]. (Hsin-p'ing [commandery] is the former Huai-yang [Commandery].) From Yung-ch'iu and eastwards [the territory] is to be transferred to Ch'en-ting [Commandery]. (Ch'en-ting [Commandery] is the former Liang Commandery.) From Feng-ch'iu and eastwards [the territory] is to be transferred to the Chih Commune [Commandery]. (The Chih Commune [Commandery] is the former Tung Commandery.) From [the city of] Ch'en-liu and westwards, [the territory] is to be transferred to the Imperial Domain Neighboring [Commandery]. (The Imperial Domain Neighboring [Commandery] is the former Jung-yang [Commandery].) Ch'en-liu is now not any more to be a commandery. Its Grand Governor and Grand Commandant are both to go to the place where the [Emperor] is." The changes and alterations in [Wang Mang's] ordinances regarding names were all of the foregoing sort. The First Day of the Sexagenary Cycle Changed. [Wang Mang] ordered that in the primary schools of the empire [the day] mou-tzu should take the place of [the day] chia-tzu as the first day of the sixty-[day] cycle.25.8 25.8 Li-chi, IX, i, 20 (Legge, I, 424; Couvreur, I, 586) says, "For the day, a chia [day] is used [for the sacrifice, in order to] employ the first of the days [in the cycle]." and chi are the stems corresponding to the power earth, which Wang Mang considered to be the ruling power during the time of his dynasty. To the names of his year periods there seem to have been added the phrase shang-mou (exalting [the stem] mou); cf. C: n. 17.5. In capping [boys at maturity], mou-tzu should be considered as the best day. For marriages, the decade [beginning with the day] mou-yin25.9 25.9 Ch'ien Ta-hsin remarks, "In the decade [beginning with] mou-yin there is no [day (tzu means son)], hence it is avoided." 347WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I 99 B: 25b, 26a should be considered as days to be avoided. [But] A.D. 14 30a most of the people did not obey [this order]. When the Hun Shan-yÃ¼, [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih, had died, Vengeance on Traitors. and his younger brother, [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien, had been set up as Shan-yÃ¼, he asked for peace and alliance by marriage [with the Chinese imperial house. Wang] Mang sent an envoy to give him rich presents and to promise falsely to return his son, [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng, who had been an Attendant [at the Chinese court]. Thereupon [Wang Mang] offered rewards for Ch'en Liang, Chung Tai, and the others [of their group] and the Shan-yÃ¼ immediately siezed [Ch'en] Liang and the others, and delivered them to the envoys. In carts with cages they went to Ch'ang-an, where [Wang] Mang had [Ch'en] Liang and the others burnt [to death] at the north of the city, and ordered the officials and common people to gather in 26a order to see it.26.1 26.1 HS 94 B: 21a = de Groot, Die Hunnen, 281 says, "[Wang] Mang created the punishment of burning fan-ju , and burnt to death Ch'en Liang and the others." The term fan-ju is a quotation from the Book of Changes, Hexagram 30, 4 (Legge, p. 121; Wilhelm I, 89). Ying Shao says that Wang Mang made this punishment in accordance with that passage of the Classic, which reads, "How sudden is his coming; it is burning, dying, and being done away with [in execution]." Ju Shun adds, This line "refers to unfilial children, who do not care for their parents and do not maintain a proper deportment to their friends, hence they are burnt to death and done away with. [Wang] Mang made the name of the punishment in accordance with this [passage]." At the borders there was a great famine, so that Trouble at the Northern Border. people ate each other. The Grandee-remonstrant, Ju P'u, [was sent to] inspect the border troops and returned, saying, "The soldiers have encamped at the barriers for a long time and have suffered [because] 24b the border commanderies have no means of furnishing supplies for them. Now that the Shan-yÃ¼ has newly made peace, it would therefore be proper to dismiss the troops." Colonel Han Wei came forward and said, "For the majesty of the Hsin House to swallow the northern 348WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I A.D. 14 Vain Boasting Rewarded. barbarian (Hu) caitiffs is no harder than [to swallow 99 B: 26a such small things as] fleas or lice in one's mouth. Your servant wishes to take five thousand brave and daring gentlemen, and, without taking along a bushel of food, in hunger to eat the flesh of the caitiffs and in thirst to drink their blood, so that I shall be able to traverse [their territory freely." Wang] Mang admired his words and made him the Majestically Acting General. But he adopted [Ju] P'u's words and summoned the various generals who were at the border to return, 30b dismissing Ch'en Ch'in and others, eighteen persons [in all]. He also abolished the various garrisons of soldiers [belonging to] the Chief Commandants posted at the four passes [to the imperial capital].26.2 26.2 Hu San-hsing explains that Wang Mang had established at each of the four a Chief Commandant of the Post, with garrison soldiers. [But] it happened that when the Hun envoy returned, the Shan-yÃ¼ came to know that his son, [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng, who had been an Attendant, had previously been executed, so he mobilized his troops and raided the borders, [hence Wang] Mang had again to mobilize the military garrisons. Thereupon the people of the border wandered into the inner commanderies and became slaves and slave-women of those people. Then a prohibition was made, that if officials or common people should presume to possess people from the borders, they should be publicly executed. Trouble At the Southwestern Borders. The barbarians in Yi-chou [Commandery] killed their Grand Governor, Ch'eng Lung, so that the whole of the three borders [to the province] were in rebellion. [Wang Mang] sent the General Tranquillizing the Southern Barbarians, Feng26.3 26.3 Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that should be , to agree with HS 95: 7a and 99 B: 30a. The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter; Wang Hsien-ch'ien adds that the Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. also read it. Mou, leading 349WANG MANG, T'ien-feng I, II 99 B: 26a troops, to attack them. A.D. 14/15 The General of a Peaceful Beginning, Hou Fu, was dismissed, and the Libation Officer Expounding the Book of Changes, Tai Ts'an, was made the General of a Peaceful Beginning. In the second year, the second month, a banquet II was held in the Hall with the Royal Apartments, and A.D. 15, all the ministers and grandees were present at the Feb./Mar. feast. A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. At this time a star was visible at noon,26.4 26.4 If "at this time" refers to the second month of this year (Feb. 8 to Mar. 9, A.D. 15, Julian), this "star" must have been a nova or comet, not Venus. It is not likely that it was an imaginary object, since its appearance was considered a portent sufficiently great to require one of the high ministers to be dismissed. Mr. R. B. Weitzel of Washington, D.C. reports: "From experimental observations made under favorable conditions, I would assign for daylight visibility of Venus without optical aid a limiting value of 110 days before inferior conjunction, the planet having then a magnitude of -3.7 and on elongation approximately 42Â° east. On Mar. 9, A.D. , 160 days before inferior conjunction, Venus with magnitude -3.4 and elongation 31Â° east evidently was not visible to the unaided eye at midday." It did not attain its greatest brightness until June 11th, when its magnitude was -4.25, before and after which date, during a period of several weeks, it was visible at noon to anyone who knew where to look. Unfortunately, we cannot be sure that "at this time" refers to the second month. Pan Ku does not in this chapter furnish the month for any of the events in this year, except for the banquet and amnesty, which are mentioned immediately before the "star." Very likely most of the records for this year perished when the palace was burnt in A.D. 23. "At this time" may mean "in this part of the year," in which case this "star" may indeed have been Venus. Chinese astronomers may however not, in Han times, have been aware that Venus may regularly be seen crossing the sky. SC 27: 53 = Mh III, 374 states: "When it [Venus] appears, it does not cross the sky. When it crosses the sky, the country changes its government." The above statement is repeated in HS 26: 23a and much later in Sui-shu 20: 14b. Thus the appearance of Venus in daytime was considered a great sign, portending a change in the dynasty. It was accordingly expected to occur only once every few centuries. Meng K'ang glosses the above passage: "[`Crossing the sky'] means when [Venus] rises in the east and sets in the west or when it rises in the west and sets in the east. Venus is a [weak] star, so that when it rises in the east [as a morning star] it is due to disappear in the east, and when it becomes visible in the west [as an evening star] it is due to set in the west. [The text is emended, following the suggestion of Dr. A. Pogo, to fit the facts of observation. This last clause reads in the present text, "When it rises in the west it is due to disappear in the west."] Going across the meridian [i.e., being visible at noon] is `crossing the sky'." Chin Shao adds: "The sun is yang [strong]. When it rises, the stars are due to be submerged. When Venus is visible in daytime on the meridian, it is `crossing the sky'." The facts of observation are the following: When Venus is a morning star, it rises in the east, either when the sky is still dark, if its western elongation (the apparent between it and the sun) is sufficient, or, if not, just at dawn. Then it disappears in the rays of the sun soon after sunrise before reaching the meridian, or even at sunrise, depending on its elongation. When Venus is an evening star, it becomes visible in the west shortly before sunset, while the sky is still illuminated, or just at sunset, depending on its elongation. Then it sets in the west soon (possibly three hours) after sunset, depending upon its elongation. These two phenomena are stated correctly in Meng K'ang's gloss (with the emendation mentioned above). Venus is also visible in daylight at the time of its maximum brilliance, which circumstance occurs about five weeks before and after inferior conjunction, twice in each revolution of the planet, in each case lasting for a period of a few weeks. Venus is not conspicuous, because of the sun's light. But anyone who has noted the distance of Venus from the sun at its previous morning (or evening) appearance (which distance is 39Â° at its maximum brightness) can easily pick it out in the daylight sky. At such times, in addition to its setting, when an evening star (or rising, when a morning star), Venus has also a real and visible rising (or setting), so that Meng K'ang is quite correct in saying that Venus may rise in the east and set in the west. It is not easy to understand how the ancient Chinese could have failed to this daylight visibility of Venus or to identify this "star visible in daytime" with the planet. By following such a star for a few hours, it will be found to be identical with the "evening star" Venus, which will be very conspicuous in the evening sky by its brightness. Or the unusually brilliant "morning star" Venus will be found, when followed, to be identical with this "star visible in daytime." So all doubt about the identity of a "noon star" can easily be dissipated. These periods of daylight visibility recur regularly at intervals of 584 days. In Han times, such a "star visible in daytime" was recorded in 182 B.C. (cf. HFHD, I, 198; II, 425), but is not identified with Venus, although that planet was then visible in daytime. The reason that Venus was not recorded under that name when it was visible in daytime is very likely the astrological interpretation given that visibility. Anyone identifying this "noon star" with Venus thereby proclaimed himself a revolutionist, so that his life might be seriously endangered. When however a revolution was expected by powerful persons in the imperial court at the time that the Chou dynasty was being replaced by the Sui, Venus is recorded as appearing in daytime. Sui-shu 1: 14a, b, 21a states, "Venus appeared in daytime" on the dates, March 24, 25, May 21, 581 and on Nov. 2, 584. Jupiter is also said to have been visible in daytime on May 21, 581. During the next decade, however, although periods of Venus' daytime visibility occurred almost every year, there is no notice of that fact. The dynastic revolution had been completed, so that Venus as a portent was no longer useful. These appearances have been checked by calculation from the tables in K. Schoch, Planeten-Tafeln fÃ¼r Jedermann. The records for Venus on May 21, 581 and Nov. 2, are probably correct, for that planet then had a magnitude of -4.0 and -4.40 respectively. But the times of Venus' greatest brightness were on June 18, 581 and Nov. 8, 584, on which days Venus had a magnitude of -4.23 and -4.44, respectively. Then this planet was not reported when it was brightest. We may infer that, on the days Venus was reported, someone in the court bethought himself of the astrological significance to the appearance of Venus, asked some astrologer about this planet, and reported Venus' daytime visibility to the throne, whereupon this entry was placed on the records. The reported appearances of Venus in daytime on Mar. 24 and 25, 581 are doubtful. While the planet had an elongation of 39Â°, its magnitude was only -3.6. Jupiter's magnitude on May 21, 581 was only -1.6. It is not a noon object, but its elongation was 101Â°, so that it could have been seen when the sun was very low in the west. We may conclude that, while some time during or after the Han period, Chinese astronomers became aware of the fact that Venus is occasionally visible in daytime, the astrological interpretation of this circumstance prevented it from becoming known to the public, except at times when the court wished a portent known presaging a change in the dynasty. Meng K'ang's statement that Venus sometimes "rises in the west and sets in the east" raises the interesting question whether he knew that this unusual phenomenon may actually happen. It does not occur at Chinese latitudes, but only near or within the Arctic (or Antarctic) Circles. At the infrequent times when the greatest brightness or the inferior conjunction of this planet occurs in the months of April or May, if an observer far enough north, he will sometimes see Venus traverse the northern sky from west to east. For example, on May 30, B.C. 85, when Venus was at its greatest brightness with a magnitude of -4.3, an observer north of China in latitude 65.3Â° could have seen Venus due north on the horizon, 2 hours 45 minutes before midnight, while the sun at midnight was just 3.3Â° below the horizon. On May 1 of that year, Venus, with a magnitude of -4.1, was on the northern horizon 3 hours 7 minutes before midnight for an observer at 63.2Â° north, and at midnight the sun was 12.7Â° below the horizon. The famous Chinese envoy, Su Wu, was in captivity of the Huns during 100 to 81 B.C., for most of which time he was near Lake Baikal, which extends from about 52Â° to 56Â° north. It is possible that some nomad told Su Wu or some other Chinese traveler of having seen Venus at midnight and that this report was taken to China. and the 350WANG MANG, T'ien-feng II A.D. 15 A Portent.

He was not [however] able to trace [its source.]26.6 26.6 Yen Shih-ku remarks that since Wang Mang held he ruled by virtue of the yellow principle, this evil auspice was directed against him. 31a Since the Shan-yÃ¼, [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien, had made peace The Shan yÃ¼'s Son's Corpse Returned. and an alliance by marriage [with the Chinese imperial house], he asked for the corpse of his son, [LÃ¼an-ti] Teng. [Wang] Mang wanted to send envoys to bring it to him, [but] he feared that because of his grudge [LÃ¼an-ti] Hsien would kill the envoys. So he arrested the former General [Repressing Difficulties], Ch'en Ch'in, who had previously said that [Wang Mang] ought to execute [LÃ¼an-ti Teng,] the son [of the Shan-yÃ¼], in attendance [upon the Chinese Emperor], and had him bound in prison for another crime.26.7 26.7 Cf. 99 B: 18b.

[Wang Mang] ordained that they were to dig up the tomb of the Shan-yÃ¼ [LÃ¼an-ti] Chih, and to whip his corpse with thorns. He also ordered the Huns to withdraw their frontiers north 353WANG MANG, T'ien-feng II 99 B: 26b, 27a of the [Gobi] Desert, and imposed as an indemnity A.D. 15 upon the Shan-yÃ¼ ten thousand head of horses, thirty thousand head of cattle, and a hundred thousand head of sheep. Moreover of the few people and livestock from the borders who had been kidnapped, insofar as they were still alive, [the Shan-yÃ¼] should return them all. [Wang] Mang loved to talk grandly, as in the foregoing [order].26.10 26.10 Liu Pin remarks that the existing text does not make sense, so proposes to emend shao to ch'ao and invert, reading so ch'ao-lio . Duyvendak agrees. He also reads for , a common interchange of characters, which latter reading I adopt. But Chou Shou-ch'ang objects to Liu Pin's emendation, "[The text is] not in error. This was just Wang Mang's `grand talk,' that the Huns had not dared to rob recklessly and had merely kidnapped `a few' of the people at the borders." P. van der Loon agrees, so do I. When [Wang] Hsien2c reached the court of the Shan-yÃ¼, he set forth [Wang] Mang's majestic virtue and reprimanded the Shan-yÃ¼ for his crimes of rebellion. In his replies, [Wang Hsien2c] responded to his opponents in every way, so that the Shan-yÃ¼ was not able to argue him down. Thereupon [Wang Hsien2c] carried out [Wang Mang's] mandate and brought back these [people and livestock].26.11 26.11 Liu Pin asserts that chih is an interpolation.

They would summon meetings of the officials and common people and arrest eye-witnesses. When the commanderies and counties [gathered] capitation-taxes, [these officials] exchanged bribes and presents, so that [even] white and black were confused and those who watched at the [palace] portals [to intercept] accusations were many. 355WANG MANG, T'ien-feng II 99 B: 27a, b [Wang] Mang himself knew that he had previously A.D. 15 usurped the [imperial] power, and had thereby obtained the government from the Han [dynasty], hence he took care to control the multitude of [government] affairs himself and when the high officials received [orders directing] the detailed disposition [of cases], they merely did enough to avoid [punishment]. The various offices [in charge of] the valuable objects, the famous treasuries, and the taxes were all in charge of eunuchs. When officials or common people presented 32a to the Emperor matters in sealed letters, the eunuchs serving in the palace offices or [members of the imperial] entourage broke the seals, so that the Masters of Writing did not get to know about them.27.5 27.5 Hu San-hsing explains, "Anciently when matters were presented to the Emperor in sealed [envelopes], they first went to a Master of Writing, who then memorialized [the matter] to the Emperor. [Wang] Mang feared that the Masters of Writing would block or hide things, so ordered the eunuchs and his entourage to break the seals and [then] he himself examined them." Such were [Wang Mang's] fear of and precautions against his courtiers and subordinates. 27b He also loved to change and alter the institutions Delays in Decisions. and regulations, so that the government ordinances were numerous, and those which needed to be put into practise27.6 27.6 Wang Hsien-ch'ien states that is an error; the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. all read . had each time to be asked about, before anything could be done.

In a note to Book of Changes, Hex. 48, 3 ("YÃ¼-hen Shan-fang Chi-yi-shu," Chou-yi HsÃ¼n-shih Chu B: 14a), HsÃ¼n Shuang (128-190) says, "Hsieh had the meaning of doing away with dirt and turbidity and making it clear and clean." Lu TÃª-ming (ca. 560-627), in his Ching-tien Shih-wen 2: 19a, "Chou-yi," quotes Huang Ying (fl. iv cent.), as saying, "Hsieh is to chih." In SC 84: 9, sub the above line from the Book of Changes, P'ei Yin quotes Hsiang Hsiu (d. ca. 280) as saying, "Hsieh is to dig (chih) deeper and do away with mud and turbidity." 356WANG MANG, T'ien-feng II A.D. 15 26a [Wang] Mang constantly employed the light of a 99 B: 27b, 28a lamp until daylight, but nevertheless he was not able to accomplish his work. Taking advantage of this [circumstance], the Masters of Writing did evil and laid matters aside, so that those who had sent letters to the throne and awaited replies [at the Palace Portals] did not get to leave for successive years. Those who had been arrested and bound [in prison] in the commanderies or counties could only get out when it happened that there was an amnesty, and the soldiers of the [palace] guard were not changed even in the third year.27.8 27.8 They usually served one year only. Cf. Glossary, sub Guard. Banditry At the Northern Border. Grain was constantly expensive. More than two hundred thousand border troops depended for their clothes and food upon the imperial government. They were discontented and bitter. Wu-yÃ¼an and Ta Commanderies suffered especially from them, [so that people in these commanderies] arose and became thieves and robbers, several thousand persons becoming a troop, turning around and entering the neighboring commanderies. [Wang] Mang sent the General Siezing Robbers, K'ung Jen, with troops, to join with the commandery and county [authorities] to attack [the robbers]. Only after more than a year were [the robbers] put down. The border commanderies were moreover almost on the point of being emptied [of people]. 32b North of Han-tan there was a great rain and fog, and the waters rose.

The Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi5, presented Wang Yi's Resignation Refused. a letter, saying, "I have overseen my affairs to the eighth year, and my efforts have not been successful. In my duties as [Grand] Minister of Works, I have [moreover] been more especially useless, so that recently there has even been the grievous vicissitude of an earthquake. I wish to beg to retire." [Wang] Mang replied, "Verily, Earth has movements and has quakes. The quakes cause injury, [but] the movements do not cause injury. The 26b Spring and Autumn records earthquakes and the Book of Changes, in the "Great Appendix," [says] that [the hexagram] k'un, [representing Earth], moves.

(The Southern Academy ed. and the Chi-ku Ko ed. [1642] read, "is 80 tsung," but the Ching-yu ed. [1035] and the Official ed. read "is 80 threads ). Shou-wen 13 A: 1b defines tsungb as "the threads in [the warp on] a loom." The Yen-tzu Ch'un-ch'iu (iv cent. B.C.; fundamentally retouched in xiii cent.), "Tsa-p'ien, B, par. 18; 6: 17a, says, "Ten-tsungc (800 thread) linen cloth and one tou of food are enough to cause a person to escape inner [cold or hunger]."

This practise seems first to have been suggested by Mo-tsu; cf. Mei's trans., p. 18 f. 360WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III, v A.D. 16, Apr./May 29a "[The Chief of] the Eastern [Sacred] Peak and 99 B: Grand Master and the General Establishing the State shall act as guarantors for twenty-five commanderies Officials' Salaries To be Reduced in Times of Disaster. of three provinces and one regional division in the eastern quarter; [the Chief of] Southern Sacred Peak and Grand Tutor and the General of the Van shall act as guarantors for twenty-five commanderies of two provinces and one regional division in the southern quarter; [the Chief of] the Western [Sacred] Peak and State Master and the General of a Peaceful Beginning shall act as guarantors for twenty-five commanderies of one province and two regional divisions in the western quarter; [the Chief of] the Northern [Sacred] Peak and State General and the General of the Guard shall act as guarantors for twenty-five commanderies of two provinces and one regional division in the northern quarter.

This passage seems to have been disarranged in the time of Yen Shih-ku, for his comment misunderstands it; Hu San-hsing in the xiii cent. quotes it in its present form in a note to Tsu-chih T'ung-chien 38: 3a. the Master Commandant [Grandee], the Commandant of Magnificence [Grandee], the Imperial Domain Neighboring Commandery, and the Northern Neighboring Commandery. The directors and high ministers29.4 29.4 The text says, "The six (liu ) directors (szu ) and the six (liu) high ministers (ch'ing )." But there are only three directors (szu) mentioned in Wang Mang's central bureaucracy, cf. 99 B: 3b. Liu Feng-shih remarks, "This [passage] should say merely -ch'ing, which were those called `the high ministers who were directors (szu-ch'ing) to the three highest ministers' [a phrase quoted from 99 B: 3b], namely the Director of Confidence [in the Commander-in-chief], the Director of Justice [to the Grand Minister over the Masses], and the Director of Obedience [to the Grand Minister of Works, all of whom are mentioned on 99 B: 3b]. Later persons did not understand [this reference] and erroneously interpolated the two characters liu." Hu San-hsing however declares that the "six directors (liu-szu)" are the "six superintendents" mentioned on 99 B: 4a. He does not emend the text. But he leaves unexplained who were the "six high ministers." The exact denotation of the phrase liu szu liu ch'ing is not clear, but Wang Mang's intention is plain: the reduction in salaries consequent upon disasters was to be spread among the whole bureaucracy. I have therefore followed Liu Feng-shih in dropping the two characters liu, but have differed from him in interpreting the words szu and ch'ing, making them refer to all officials of those grades without attempting to indicate particular ones. shall all join with the highest ministers to whom they are subordinate in acting as guarantors against visitations and disasters [in the regions for which] their [superiors act as guarantors]. "If there have been calamities or injuries to the 362WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III, v A.D. 16, Apr./June crops in the regions for which they act as guarantors], 99 B: 29a, b the amount shall also be calculated in percentages, 29b and their salaries shall be reduced [proportionately]. Gentlemen, the Imperial Retinue, and officials of the imperial capital offices, who receive their salaries from the receipts within the [imperial] capitals, shall take the amount of the imperial dishes [provided by] the Grand Provisioner as the measure [for their salaries]. Nobles, princesses, baronesses, vassals, and minor officials shall also each act as guarantors against visitations and disasters [in] their [districts]. I hope that [thus] superiors and inferiors will be of the same mind and will encourage the advancement of agriculture and tranquillize the great multitude." [Wang] Mang's regulations were as complicated and detailed as the foregoing. Corruption Increases. The calculations of the taxes could not be made out, so that the officials did not eventually obtain any 34b salaries. Each one took advantage of the duties of his office to do evil, receiving and exacting bribes and presents in order to support himself. June 2.29.5 29.5 There was no mou-ch'en day in the fifth month, according to Huang. He follows that month by an intercalary fifth month, which has such a day. I have assumed that this was the month concerned. In this month, on [the day] mou-ch'en, the western bank of the Ch'ang-p'ing Lodge collapsed, blocking 28a up the Ching River, so that it could not run, was Ominous Portents. cut off, and flowed northwards.29.6 29.6 Hu San-hsing explains, "The Ch'ang-p'ing Lodge was on the plain south of the Ching River. The Ching River flows southeastwards and enters the Wei [River]. was blocked by the bank, hence was cut off and flowed northwards." The actions, interpreting as a happy portent what was actually an indication of a very serious and irretrievable irrigation failure, indicates well the inaccessibility of Wang Mang to unpleasant facts and their own sycophancy and deception of their ruler (cf. to this chapter, p. 113-114). [Wang Mang] sent the Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi5, to inspect it. When he returned and memorialized a description [of the occurrence], the courtiers offered congratulations, considering that it was what the 363WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III, v-x 99 B: 29b, 30a Diagrams From the River had said, that earth pressing A.D. 16, June/ upon water is a happy auspice of the Huns being destroyed. [Wang Mang] thereupon sent the Shepherd of the Ping Province, Sung Hung, the Scouting and Attacking Chief Commandant, Jen Meng,29.7 29.7 The Official ed. reads for , but the Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. and others, leading troops, to attack the Huns. They went to the border, and stopped to garrison it. In the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-yu, there July 25. was a visitation [of fire] to the Pa City-gate, which among the common people is called the Cerulean Gate, and on [the day] mou-tzu, the last day of the Aug. 21. month, there was an eclipse of the sun. A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire, and [Wang Mang] again ordered the ministers, grandees, nobles, and [officials ranking at] 2000 piculs each to recommend one person with the four [types of virtuous] conduct.29.8 29.8 Liu Feng-shih remarks that these four types of conduct were probably those mentioned in 99 B: 16b and taken from the Analects: moral character, gifts in speaking, administrative ability, and scholarship. The mention of "[officials ranking at] two thousand piculs" is probably an anachronism for the sake of clearness; Wang Mang had renamed this rank the Upper-ranking Grandees; cf. 99 B: 4a. The Commander-in-chief, Ch'en Mou, was dismissed because of the eclipse of the sun, and 30a the Earl Establishing Military Power, Chuang Yu, was made the Commander-in-chief. In the tenth month, on [the day] mou-hsÃ¼,30.1 30.1 There was no mou-ch'en day in this month; seemingly the only servicable emendation is from ch'en to hsÃ¼ (also made in 11: 8a). the Oct. 30. Vermillion Bird Gate to the Royal Apartments cried out for a day and night without ceasing. Ts'ui Fa 35a and others said, "The Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun], `opened the gates to the four [quarters] to hear with the ears in the four [quarters].'30.2 30.2 A quotation from Book of History II, i, 15 (Legge, p. 41; Couvreur, p. 23), cf. Karlgren, BMFEA 20, 94ff, Gl. 1274. The crying out of the gate makes plain that you ought to cultivate the rites of 364WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III A.D. 16 the ancient sages in order to attract gentlemen from 99 B: 30a the four quarters." Thereupon [Wang Mang] ordered that the courtiers should all felicitate him. Those who were recommended for the four [types of virtuous] conduct entered by way of the Vermillion Bird Gate in order to take the examinations. The General Tranquillizing the Southern Barbarians, Feng Mou, had attacked Kou-t'ing, and six 28b or seven-tenths of his soldiers had died from pestilence. The Southwestern Borders. As a levy for military purposes upon the common people's wealth he had taken five-tenths, so that the Yi Province was empty and waste, yet [the rebellious barbarians] were not vanquished. [Wang Mang] summoned him to return and sent him to prison, where he died. In his place, [Wang Mang] sent the General of a Peaceful Beginning, Lien Tan, together with the [Provincial] Shepherd of Yung Regional Division, Shih Hsiung, to attack Kou-t'ing.30.3 30.3 Hu San-hsing remarks that previously there were Shepherds of Provinces and Superintendents of Divisions; here a Division and a Province seem to have been the same; cf. n. 24.1, paragraph 9. When they had cut off a considerable [number of] heads and had had a victory, [Wang] Mang summoned [Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung [to come to the capital. Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung wanted [instead] to increase the taxes, [whereupon] they would be certain to conquer. Thereupon they returned and again made a great levy for military purposes. The Grand Governor of Chiu-tu [Commandery], Feng Ying, was not willing to furnish [anything], and sent [a memorial] to the throne, saying, "From the time that Chou Niu of Sui-chiu [county] and Hsieh-tou of T'ung Commune and the like in YÃ¼eh-sui [Commandery] revolted, it has been almost the tenth year, in which [time] the commanderies and counties have been resisting the attacks of [the barbarians] without cessation. When, in succession to [Ch'eng Lung], Feng Mou was employed, 365WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III 99 B: 30a, b he temerariously put into practise a temporary A.D. 16 policy, which was that, altho south of P'o-tao the mountains are high and defiles are deep, [Feng] 35b Mou many times expelled their bands from distant places, so that the expense has been counted by the hundred-thousands [of cash] and officers and soldiers have suffered from poisonous emanations,30.4 30.4 Was this malaria? seven-tenths of them dying. "Now [Lien] Tan and [Shih] Hsiung are afraid that they themselves would be reprimanded [for not 30b having completed their task] in the appointed time, and [seek to] levy and mobilize the troops and grain of the commandery, to re-appraise [the property of] the common people and take four-tenths of it. They have impoverished and ruined Liang Province, but their efforts will not eventually meet with success. It would be proper to dismiss the troops and garrison farms and openly offer rewards [for the rebels]." [Wang] Mang became angry and dismissed [Feng] Ying from his office. [But] later he awakened considerably to [the truth] and said, "[Feng] Ying should not however be severely condemned," and rewarded [Feng] Ying by making him the Leader of the Combination in Ch'ang-sha [Commandery]. Wang-sun Ch'ing, [who belonged to] the faction of Human Dissection. Chai Yi, was arrested and secured, and [Wang] Mang sent the Grand Physician and the Master of Recipes, with a skilled butcher, all together to dissect and flay [Wang-sun Ch'ing], to measure and examine his five 29a viscera, and to use fine bamboos to trace out his arteries, so as to find out their beginnings and ends, saying that [thereby] they would know how to cure illness.30.5 30.5 No more official dissections seem to be recorded until A.D. 1106; cf. Maspero in JA 229 (Apr.-June, 1937), p. 188. In this year, [Wang Mang] sent as the Chief 366WANG MANG, T'ien-feng III A.D. 16 The Silk Route Blocked. Envoy, the General of the Five Majestic Principles, 99 B: 30b, 31a Wang ChÃ¼n4c, with the Protector General of the Western Frontier Regions, Li Ch'ung2, leading the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, [Kou Ch'in], to go out to the Western Frontier Regions. All the various states welcomed [the envoys] at their suburbs and offered tribute. 36a The state of Karshahr (Yen-ch'i)30.6 30.6 Chu is very probably a copyist's error for ch'i . Ch'i was misread as che and the following kuo caused che-kuo to be transcribed as chu-kuo. I emend accordingly. There is no reason for a final particle yen at the end of the preceding HS 96 B: 35b states, "The state of Karashahr (Yen-ch'i-kuo) was nearest the Huns and revolted first, murdering the Protector-General Tan Ch'in." Then the other states had nothing to do with this murder. Here there is moreover the same group of three that almost surely originally stood in this passageâyen-ch'i-kuo. Pan Ku probably used the same original document in writing both passages. A cursively written ch'i in original draft could easily have caused this mistake. Chu is found in the Ching-yu so that this mistake occurred early. had previously murdered the Protector General Tan Ch'in, so [Wang] ChÃ¼n4c wanted to make a surprise attack upon it. He ordered his Associate Lieutenant, Ho Feng, and the Mou-and-Chi Colonel, Kuo Ch'inb, to separate their commands [from his]. Karshahr (Yen-Ch'i) made a pretense of surrendering, and and ambushed troops, who attacked [Wang] ChÃ¼n4c and the others, so that all [his company] died. [Kuo] Ch'inb and [Ho] Feng reached [Karshahr shortly] after [Wang ChÃ¼n4c had been killed, before the troops had returned], and made a surprise attack upon its aged and weak [people, massacring them]. They returned by way of Turfan (ChÃ¼-shih) and entered the [Chinese] barrier. [Wang] Mang installed [Kuo] Ch'inb as the General Maintaining Order in Foreign Parts, and enfeoffed him as the Viscount Exterminating Northwestern Barbarians. 31a Ho Feng was made the Baron Quieting the Northwestern Barbarians. From this time on, the Western Frontier Regions were cut off [from China]. 367 THE HISTORY OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] [Chapter] XCIX THE SIXTY-NINTH [MEMOIR] The Memoir of Wang Mang PART C In [the period T'ien-feng], the fourth year, in the A.D. 17, fifth month, [Wang] Mang said [in a message], "The May/June. Libationer for the Masters and Companions [to the Enfeoffments Made Heir-apparent] Guarantor of His Perfection, T'ang Lin, and the former Libationer for the Remonstrants and Consultants, Chi Ch'Ã¼n, ([a man] from Lang-yeh [Commandery), have shown] filial devotion, brotherly respectfulness, loyalty, and reciprocity; they have been respectful to their superiors and have loved their inferiors; they have been extensively learned in ancient traditions; their upright characters have been excellent and perfect; and even to old age they have not committed any errors. Let [T'ang] Lin be enfeoffed as the Marquis Established Through Virtue and [let Chi] Ch'Ã¼n [be enfeoffed as] the Marquis Enfeoffed Through Virtue; the rank of both shall be a Specially Advanced and they shall be received in audience with rites like those of the three highest ministers. They are [each] to be granted one residence,1.1 1.1 The Official ed. has erroneously emended to . three million cash, and are to be given stools and canes." In the sixth month, when [Wang Mang] changed June/July [the rites, removing to] the Ming-t'ang the bestowal of earth [enveloped in] quitch grass to nobles [as a token of enfeoffment], he said [in a message], "I have instituted the geographical arrangements and have established and enfeoffed [nobles] in five grades. 368WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV, vi A.D. 17, June/July I have examined them by the canonical books and 99 C: 1a, harmonized them with the written traditions [concerning the classics] and the records, and pervaded them by the principles of right relationships. "I have discussed them and pondered over them again and again, from the beginning of the first [year] A.D. 9 in [the period] Shih-chien-kuo down to the present, [which is] the ninth year. Now they have however 1b* * Light upright numbers indicate the paging in the Ching-yu ed., reprinted in the Po-na Series, pub. by the Commercial Press. been indeed fixed upon. I have myself established the [inclined] plane of ornamented stones,1.2 1.2 Pan Ku in his "Fu on the Western Capital" (HHS, Mem. 30 A: 12a), speaking the Front Hall in the Wei-yang Palace at Ch'ang-an, says, "On the left was the and on the right was the [inclined] plane." This statement is repeated in San-fu t'u 2: 3a. Li Hsien quotes Chih YÃ¼'s (fl. ca. 270-310) ChÃ¼eh-yi-yao-chu (lost) "The [inclined] plane with ornamented bricks paralleled [the staircase up to the Hall]." This inclined plane was probably for the imperial chariot. Since the Steps (on the right) were reserved for the Emperor, Wang Mang added a ramp made ornamented blocks, so that it might be possible to ride down from the hall in the with the Emperor's Apartments (the audience hall). Cf. the plan of a palace Hall in T'zu-yÃ¼an, sub . I have 1bâ  â  Bold-face numbers indicate the paging in Wang Hsien-ch'ien's Han-shu Pu-chu, in volumes I and II. arranged the three-ribbed quitch-grass and the four-colored 1bâ¡ â¡ Italic numbers indicate the paging in the Official ed. or Palace ed. or Wu-ying ed., pub. in the "Szu-pu Pei-yao Collecteana." earth,1.3 1.3 The "three-ribbed rush, ching-mao " was used to envelop the clod of from the imperial mound altar of the gods of the soils used in enfeoffing nobles. rush is mentioned in Book of History, III, i, vii, 52 (Legge, p. 115; Mh I, 124). schneider, Botanicum Sinicum, no. 459, p. 279, finds it impossible to identify exactly. Kuan-tzu (iii cent. B.C.) 24: 6b, ch. 83, it is mentioned as growing between the and Huai Rivers. The Imperial mound altar of the gods of the soils contained five colors of soil; only four are mentioned. The Chi-chung Chou-shu (found in a tomb in 280-289 extant in Former Han times) 5: 8b-9a, ch. 48, says, "[The Duke of Chou] established great mound altar to the gods of the soils in the midst of the [Chou] state [capital at Its low ridge around the edge [probably enclosing a ribbon of water encircling the on the east was of cerulean earth, on the south was of red earth, on the west was of earth, on the north was of black earth, and in the center [the mound] was sprinkled yellow earth. When he was about to establish a noble, he dug into and took the earth from one side in that direction [in which the fief of the noble was to be located], enveloped it with yellow earth, and bound it with quitch-grass, using [the whole] for the earth [employed] in the enfeoffment. Hence [the recipient] said, `I have received my sliced [clod of] earth from the house of Chou.' " Since Wang Mang was following ancient practises, he undoubtedly followed this precedent. and have respectfully given information 369WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV 99 C: 1b [of the enfeoffments] to Mount T'ai,1.4 1.4 This name for Mt. T'ai is taken from the Book of History II, i, iii 8 (Legge, p. 35). to the A.D. 17 Grand [Imperial] Mound Altar to the Gods of the Soils, to Sovereign Earth, to my deceased male and female ancestors, in order to publish and transmit [these classical practises. Let] each [noble] go to his state to care for and shepherd his common people in order to accomplish meritorious achievements. For those whose [estates] are on the borders or in Chiang-nan, except for those who are summoned by an imperial edict to be sent to wait upon [the Emperor] in the imperial capital, the Grandee in Charge of Goods [subordinate to] the Communicator shall temporarily collect the old [style] cash from the capital treasuries [in order to] pay them their allowances: to dukes, 800,000 [cash] per year; to marquises and earls, 400,000 [cash per year]; to viscounts and barons, 200,000 [cash per year]."1.5 1.5 Under the Han dynasty, each household in a noble estate paid 200 cash per year (91: 6a), hence the allowances of dukes were the same as those previously enfeoffed with estate of 4000 households; of marquises and earls, 2000 households; and of viscounts and barons, 1000 households. Yet even then they could not receive the full amount. [Wang] Mang loved bombastic speeches and admired ancient practises. He enfeoffed very many people as nobles, [but] in his nature he was in reality niggardly. He took as a pretext that the geographical arrangements had not yet been determined upon, hence temporarily in advance distributed clods with quitch-grass [in token of enfeoffment], using them to console and delight those whom he enfeoffed. In this year, [Wang Mang] again published ordinances 370WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV A.D. 17 The Six Monopolies for the six controls.1.6 1.6 Cf. 99 B: 12b. For each control he 99 C: 1b, established regulations to restrain violators [of the monopoly]; the penalties were as great as capital [punishment. Yet] the officials and common people 2a who suffered for crime became increasingly1.7 1.7 For , the Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. read ; the Ching- ed. reads . numerous. Tax on Slaves He moreover temporarily made a levy [even] upon the highest class of the highest ministers [and those ranking] lower, that whoever possessed male or female slaves should pay a tax of 3600 cash per [slave], so 2a that the empire became even more discontented and thieves and robbers arose.2.1 2.1 The Sung Ch'i ed. asserts that before there should be a . When the Communicator, Feng Ch'ang, remonstrated against the six controls, [Wang] Mang became furious and dismissed [Feng] Ch'ang from office. Supervisors for Commandery [Wang Mang] established Administrators of the Laws at [the Emperor's] Right and Left for the Extirpation of Wickedness, and selected for employment [in this office] capable officials, Hou Pa and 2a others, dispersing them to supervise the six Commandants' Officials [Commanderies] and the six Neighboring Commanderies, like the Inspectors of the Han [dynasty], with one Officer of the three highest ministers for a commandery as an Attendant official [to the Administrator of the Laws for the Extirpation of Wickedness]. Bandit Bands Kua-t'ien Yi of Lin-huai [Commandery] and others became thieves and robbers, relying upon [the fastnesses in] Ch'ang-chou of K'uai-chi [Commandery]. Mother LÃ¼, a woman of Lang-yeh [Commandery], also arose. Previously, Mother LÃ¼'s son had been an official of the county and had been killed on a false charge by its Ruler. His mother dispersed the wealth of her household on [the pretext] of dealing 371WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV C: 2a, b in liquor, by purchasing arms and crossbows, and A.D. 17 privately treating poor youths liberally. When she had obtained more than a hundred men, she thereupon attacked the county-seat of Hai-ch'Ã¼ and killed its Ruler. She used [his corpse] as a sacrifice at the grave of her son. She led her troops into the sea. These bands gradually became greater. Later both [bandit bands] were numbered by the ten-thou-sands.2.2 2.2 At this point Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 38: 7a, b adds the names of other robber bands: Wang K'uang1b and Wang Feng4a from Hsin-shih [in the present central Hupeh; cf. HHS, An. 1 A: 3a]; Ma Wu in Nan-yang Commandery [cf. HHS, Mem. 12: 10a-12a]; Wang Ch'ang and Ch'eng Tan in Ying-ch'uan Commandery; Chang Pa of Nan Commandery; Yang Mu of Chiang-hsia Commandery, each of whose bands increased to be ten thousand in number; cf. Glossary sub vocibus. [Wang] Mang sent commissioners to go to and pardon the thieves and robbers. When [the commissioners] returned, they said, "Whenever the thieves and robbers disperse, they immediately reunite." When he asked them the reason for this 2b [action], they all said, "They are grieved at the laws and prohibitions, which are vexatious and tyrannous, so that they can do nothing, and what they obtain by hard work is insufficient to pay the taxes, while if they close their doors in order to guard themselves, they are moreover sentenced because their group of five neighboring [families] might be casting cash or possessing copper. Wicked officials take advantage of that to afflict2.3 2.3 Wang Nien-sun shows that anciently chou and were interchanged, and suggests reading the latter word here. But chou makes quite good sense. these common people. When 2b common people are improverished, they all arise and become thieves or robbers." [Wang] Mang [became] furious and dismissed them. Some of them fell in with his ideas and said that the common people were perverse and crafty and ought to be executed and also said that the revolution of the seasons was opportune and [the robbers] would 372WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV, viii A.D. 17, Aug./Sept. before long be annihilated, [whereupon Wang] Mang 99 C: was pleased and immediately promoted them. Aug./Sept. In this year, in the eighth month, [Wang] Mang in person went to the place for the suburban sacrifice at the south [of the Capital] to have the majestic tou [measures] cast.2.4 2.4 Couvreur (Dict. Class., III ed., p. 915), followed by Stange, (p. 214, n. 1) says these tou were bronze tablets on which the Northern Bushel (, i.e., the Dipper) was represented, but I cannot find any other authority for this statement. It quite true, as Stange remarks, that ancient Chinese tablets bearing a representation of Northern Bushel have come down to us, but that fact does not constitute any evidence that these articles were made by Wang Mang. The only description seems to be the one in the text. This account furthermore contains some details which indicate that the tou were measures rather than tablets. (1) It says they "were like the Northern ," not that they were inscribed with the Northern Bushel. T'ai-p'ing 765: 4b, in quoting this passage, moreover begins the above clause with the word , making it say, "Their shape was like the Northern Bushel." I take this to mean that they had handles, like Chinese tou measures. (2) Wang Mang ordered his Directors of Mandates to "bear them on their shoulders ." Tablets are carried in the hands worn at the girdle, not borne on the shoulders or back. (3) Their size, 2 ft. 5 in. (58 or 22Â½ in. Eng. measure) is quite in accord with their being measures and containing a tou (cf. HFHD, I, 279). This length was then that of the utensil with its handle. its bowl was shallow, like the one dated 65 B.C. and pictured in Chin-shih-so, "Chin," 3: 42a, its over-all length was just right to contain a tou. I therefore conclude that a ladle-like shape was much more probable than a tablet-like shape. The Northern Bushel (the Dipper) was among the most important of Chinese constellations. Near it is the Pole Star, where resides the Supreme One (T'ai-yi), the God who rules the universe. "The [Northern] Bushel is the chariot of the Lord [i.e., the Supreme One], whereby he moves around at the center [of the heavens], visits and controls the four quarters, separates the yin and yang, determines the four seasons, proportions [the influences of] the five powers [or elements], and gives information concerning the divisions [of time] and the revolutions [of the stars, thereby] fixing [epochs for all] records. All this depends upon the [Northern] Bushel" (SJ 27: 8 = Mh III, 342; cf. also HFHD 99 B: n. 21.1). This constellation is the vehicle whereby the supreme God his authority. The emperor of China, as the Son of Heaven, was the earthly deputy of this supreme God. The Heavenly Bushel accordingly represented, more than any other, the imperial authority. It was a god, to whom sacrifices were made at Yung (Mh III, 444, 491). In 112 B.C., Emperor Wu placed it on his supernatural standard, along with flying dragon to represent the Supreme One (Mh III, 493). "The southern [side] of the city-wall [of Ch'ang-an, built 194-190 B.C.] had the shape of the Southern Bushel and the northern [side] had the shape of the Northern Bushel, [in order that this city should be a proper habitation for an emperor]. This is [the reason that], down to the present, people call the capital of the [Former] Han [dynasty], `the Bushel City' " (San-fu 1: 6a). When Wang Mang was besieged in his palace in A.D. 23, he sat in the direction occupied by the handle of the Bushel, turning about as this constellation turned in the heavens, by sympathy with it, securing its assistance (HS 99 C: 27a). These majestic -measures accordingly denoted this divinity, who would naturally exert his authority in behalf of the emperor on earth. By sympathy with the god, they would draw the god's attention to happenings in their vicinity and would exercise his power to assist and protect the emperor. Cf. also 99 B: 6b &amp; n. 6.9. Nan-shih 33: 24a-b, sub Ho Ch'eng-t'ien, says, (this event is dated between 442 and 447), "Chang Yung was once digging the HsÃ¼an-wu Lake [north of the Shou-tu Metropolis i.e., present Nanking, Kiangsu, according to the Shina Redikai Chimei Yoran, p. 194a], when he happened upon an ancient tomb. Above the tomb he secured a bronze [measure] with handles. Emperor Wen [of the Sung Dynasty] asked the gentlemen of his court about it, and [Ho] Ch'eng-t'ien replied, `This is a majestic tou [measure] of the fallen Hsin [Dynasty. When any of his] three highest ministers died, Wang Mang always granted [such measures] to them: one for the outside of the tomb, and one for the inside of the tomb. At that time, the only one of his highest ministers who lived near the mouth of the Yangtze River [i.e., east of the present Nanking] was Chen Han, who became Grand Minister over the Masses. It must be [Chen] Han's tomb.' "Soon [Chang] Yung opened the tomb, and from inside it, he again secured a tou [measure], and also there was a stone with the inscription, `The tomb of the Grand Minister over the Masses, Chen Han.' " This account must however be mistaken. Shen Ch'in-han points out that Chen Han died in 12 A.D. His son, Chen Feng, was executed in 10 A.D., before these majestic tou- measures were made. When he died, Chen Han was moreover Commander-in-chief, not Grand Minister over the Masses. San-kuo-chih 5: 4b, sub the Empress nee Chen, who was a descendant of Chen Han, says that her home was in Wu-chi of Chung-shan Commandery, and T'ai-p'ing Huan-yÃ¼ Chi 60: 10b locates Chen Han's tomb and those of other members of the Chen clan 35 li southwest of Wu-chi, which place was located, according to Ta-ch'ing Yi-t'ung-chih 27: 5b, at the present place by the same name, in Honan. For making the majestic tou 373WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV, viii 99 C: 2b [measures], five [colors of] minerals were used with A.D. 17, Aug./Sept. bronze.2.5 2.5 Li Ch'i explains, "Mineral medicines of five colors, together with bronze [or copper] were used in making them," but Su Lin glosses, "Copper ore of five colors was used in melting [metal] for them." Yen Shih-ku adds that Li Ch'i is correct and that "It was like the process of making the present t'ou-shih [a gold-appearing copper-zinc alloy, made by smelting together two parts of copper with one part of smithsonite, the present `yellow copper']." Dr. Duyvendak remarks that the number five must refer to the five elements. They were like the Northern Bushel [in 2b shape], two feet five inches long. [Wang Mang] intended The Majestic Tou Measures to use them to repress various military forces by incantations. When they were completed, he ordered the Directors of Mandates [from the Five 374WANG MANG, T'ien-feng IV, V A.D. 17/18 Majestic Principles] to carry them on their shoulders. 99 C: 2b, When [Wang] Mang went out, they went before him; when he had entered [the palace], they waited upon him at his sides.2.6 2.6 Wang Nien-sun says that this sentence originally read as it now is in T'ai- YÃ¼-lan 486: 5a, i.e., with the word after the and the last clause reading . He says that people did not understand that means "wait upon," so dropped out two words and changed one word. Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 38: 6b and T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 765: 5a (with another difference, showing a poorer text) read as the text does here. On the day that these tou [measures] were cast, there was a severe cold [spell], so that some men and horses of the various offices froze to death. V In the fifth year, the first month, on the first day 3a of the month, there was a visitation [of fire] to the ?A.D. 18 southern gate of the Northern Army [Encampment]. Jan. 6 Fei Hsing, the Director of Confidence in the Commander-in-chief, The Monopolies Upheld was made the Shepherd of Ching Province. When he was asked at an audience what would be his plans of action when he reached his 3a regional division, [Fei] Hsing replied, "The common people of Ching and Yang3.1 3.1 The Official and Southern Academy ed. emend to . [Provinces] generally take advantage of their mountains and marshes in making fishing and the picking [of wild fruits] their occupations. Recently the state has set up the six controls, which tax [the products of] the mountains and marshes and have interfered with and taken away the profits of the common people. For a long time in successive years there have been droughts, so that the people are hungry and impoverished. Hence they have become thieves or robbers. "When I, Hsing, reach my regional division, I intend to order and to make it clearly known and inform the thieves and robbers that they should return to their homes and I will lend them oxen for plowing, seed, and food, and exempt them from the land and capitation-taxes. I hope that thereby I may be able to disperse and tranquillize them." 375WANG MANG, T'ien-feng V 99 C: 3a, b [Wang] Mang became incensed [at this proposal] and A.D. 18 dismissed [Fei] Hsing from his office. Because the officials of the [whole] empire did not Rich Officials Mulcted receive their salaries, they all did evil for profit. The personal property of [Grand] Governors of commanderies and Rulers of counties [amounted to] a thousand [catties of] gold. [Hence Wang] Mang issued an imperial edict which said, "Investigate carefully [the deeds of] the military officials and the officials of the borders, from the grandees and upwards, beginning with the second year of [the period] Shih-chien-kuo, when the northern barbarian (Hu) A.D. 10. caitiffs troubled China.3.2 3.2 A phrase from Book of History II, i, 20 (Legge, p. 44). This reference is to the events recorded on 99 B: 14b. If any, have done evil for profit, so that they have increased their property and have become rich, [let] four-fifths of the property in their families be taken and used to aid the distress of the borders." Officers from the highest ministers' yamens [rode] galloping quadrigae [all over] the empire, examining and investigating avaricious [persons]. They persuaded officials to inform on their generals, and male and female slaves to 3a inform on their masters, hoping thereby to stop the 3b evil, [but] the evil became very much more serious. An Imperial Grandson, the Duke of Eminent An Ambitious Imperial Grandson Executed Merits, [Wang] Tsung, was sentenced for having had a picture of himself painted, wearing the robes and bonnet of the Son of Heaven, and having had three seals engraved. One read, "Because of celestial blessings, my official hat is prepared and ready. In the summer [I] dwell in the Southern Mountains, where there is stored up thin ice."3.3 3.3 It is impossible to be sure about the translation of such brief and condensed expressions as these seal inscriptions. Wen Ying glosses, "Chih [means] celestial favors and prosperity. `The hat is prepared and ready' [means that] he wished to succeed to [the imperial throne]." Ying Shao adds, " `In the summer to dwell in the Southern Mountains' [means] going to a shady and cool place. `To store up thin ice' also [means] thereby to avoid the heat." Stange (p. 216) translates, "O GlÃ¼ck, die Krone ruht auf mir. Im Sommer wohne im Nan-shan and ziehe mich nach Pao-ping zurÃ¼ck." He states that according to the commentary Pao-ping was the imperial summer residence. I have been unable to discover any evidence for this interpretation. Duyvendak understands, "[So long as] the Cap of Binding Celestial Blessings is preserved, [that is, so long as I possess it], [it is] already [like] living in the southern mountains and appreciating [even] thin ice." He explains, "That is, even as in extreme heat even thin ice is appreciated, so in this desperate enterprize even the mere possession of the imperial cap gives me courage." He takes wei , not as an exclamatory particle (as does Stange), but as meaning "to bind [the blessings] together," probably alluding to the wei-tou "the Great Bushel" [another name for the Northern Bushel constellation], which is an imperial emblem. I prefer however to take wei in its meaning of . Wen Ying does not interpret this word, so that he seems not to have thought it contained any substantial content and almost surely recognized it as an "empty" particle. The phrase "thin ice" comes from a famous line in Ode no. 196 (Legge, II, v, ii, 6, p. 335), and was commonly used to denote the way a true king should act, as if he were treading upon thin ice, i.e., carefully and circumspectly, from fear of Heaven. Then in the Southern Mountains, Wang Tsung was practising being emperor, by magically treading upon thin ice. This explanation however far from certain. The second 3b 376WANG MANG, T'ien-feng V A.D. 18 read, "Revering the Sages and holding precious the 99 C: 3b heritage."3.4 3.4 Ying Shao explains, "[Wang] Mang himself said that he had inherited descent from the Sage, Shun, and that he had been able to be respectful and to secure the Heavenly treasure, the tortoise, and thereby was set up [as emperor. Wang] Tsung wanted to be the successor to his line." Stange (p. 217) translates, "Wenn man ehrfÃ¼rchtig gegen die Heiligkeit ist, werden die Kostbarkeiten [d.i. kostbare SchildkrÃ¶te des Himmels] forterben." Duyvendak points out that the vague parallelism with the third seal inscription makes it necessary to take these four characters two by two. I have adopted his interpretation. The third said, "[To be] enfeoffed because of virtue and made glorious by the [imperial] documents."3.5 3.5 Su Lin explains, "[Wang] Tsung himself said that he would be enfeoffed [as emperor] thru his [magical?] virtue and so must advance to [this] glorious and brilliant [position] and receive the documents and registers of the empire." Stange (p. 217) translates, "Durch magische Wirkungskraft [mir] verliehenes strahlendes [d.i. kaiserliches] Siegel." Duyvendak interprets, "[Having the empire] conferred [upon me] by virtue, making glorious the Plans [reference to the Tzu-ko T'u?]." I have followed Su Lin more closely. The household of [Wang] Tsung's maternal uncle LÃ¼ K'uan, which had previously been exiled to Ho-p'u 377WANG MANG T'ien-feng V 99 C: 3b [Commandery], had moreover privately communi- A.D. 18 cated with [Wang] Tsung. When [this matter] became known, an examination was made and [Wang] Tsung committed suicide. [Wang] Mang said, "[According to] his relationship, [Wang] Tsung was an Imperial Grandson; [according to] his noble rank, he was [among] the highest of the dukes. He knew that [LÃ¼] K'uan and the others belonged to rebellious clan, but communicated with them. He had three bronze seals engraved whose inscriptions and intentions were extremely pernicious. He did not know how to be contented, and was watching for and desiring what he should not have hoped for. "[According to] the principle in [the Kung-yang Commentary on] the Spring and Autumn, `A relative of the prince should not have had such an intention, [but] since he had that intention, he should have been executed,'3.6 3.6 A quotation from Kung-yang Commentary, Dk. Chuang, XXXII, vii, &amp; Dk. Chao, I, i; 9: 5a &amp; 22: 1b; in each of which cases it is applied to a person attempting to succeed to the throne by assassinating a ruler's son. [Wang Tsung] was deluded and went astray, so that he brought this punishment upon himself. Alas! It is sad!" [Wang] Tsung's personal name was originally Hui-tsung; according to the [imperial] institutions, he had done away with there being two words in his personal name [and used only Tsung as his name].3.7 3.7 As a prospective Emperor, he had done away with his other personal name, just as Wang Mang had the Hun Shan-yÃ¼, LÃ¼an-ti Nan-chih-ya-szu change his personal name to Chih (99 A: 8b). He was now again named Hui-tsung, and his noble 4a rank was degraded and his title was changed. He was granted the posthumous name of the Erring Earl of Eminent Merits, and was buried with the rites of an earl in his former t'ung in Ku-ch'eng Commandery. [Wang] Tsung's elder sister, [Wang] Fang, who was the Lady (wife) of the General of the Guard, 378WANG MANG, T'ien-feng V A.D. 18 3b Wang Hsinga, had made [magical] imprecations 99 C: 3b, 4a against her mother-in-law and had killed a slave-woman in order to stop up her mouth. The matter became known and [Wang] Mang sent the Regular Palace Attendant Tai YÃ¼n to interrogate [Wang] Fang under torture and also to flog [Wang] Hsinga. Both committed suicide. The matter also involved the wife of the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], K'ung Jen. She also committed suicide. [When K'ung] Jen had audience with [Wang] Mang, and doffed his bonnet in acknowledging [his fault, Wang] Mang had a Master of Writing impeach [K'ung] Jen [saying that the fact of his] "having ridden in a heavenly chariot [drawn by] earthly mares, `having on his left the Azure Dragon [Standard], on his right the White Tiger [Standard], in front the Vermillion Bird3.8 3.8 The Official ed. has emended to the more usual . But the Ching-yu ed. reads the former. The sentence in quotation marks is from Li-chi, I, i, v, 8 (Legge, I, 91; Couvreur, I, 55). Doffing the bonnet indicates resigning the office denoted by the bonnet. [Standard], and in his rear the Dark Warrior [Standard],' in his right hand grasping the majestic credentials and on his left [shoulder] bearing the majestic tou [measure], and being called the Red 4a Planet, was not in order to make [K'ung] Jen proud, but to honor the majestic mandate of the Hsin house, [and yet K'ung] Jen has presumed to doff his astrological bonnet, which constitutes [the capital crime] of being extremely disrespectful." [Then] there was an imperial edict [ordering that K'ung Jen] should not be impeached and exchanging his bonnet for a new one. [Wang Mang's] love for marvels was like the foregoing. The Marquis of the Straight Path, Wang ShÃª, was made the General of the Guard. [Wang] ShÃª was the son of the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-yang, [Wang] Ken. In the reign of Emperor Ch'eng, [Wang] Ken had 379WANG MANG, T'ien-feng V, VI 99 C: 4a been Commander-in-chief, and, [when he had been A.D. 18/19 4b about to retire], he had recommended [Wang] Mang Wang Ken's Title Changed to take his place [as Commander-in-chief,4.1 4.1 Cf. HS 99 A: 2a. so that Wang] Mang was grateful to him. [The latter] had considered that Ch'Ã¼-yang (crooked phallus) was not a good designation, so had posthumously [granted Wang] Ken the posthumous name, Duke Jang (Ceding) of the Straight Path. [Wang] ShÃª had inherited this noble title. In this year, Li Tzu-tu, Fan Ch'ung, and others of The Red Eyebrows Arise the Red Eyebrows gathered together because of the famine and arose in Lang-yeh [Commandery]. They moved about and robbed. Their bands all numbered in the ten-thousands. [Wang Mang] sent commissioners to mobilize the troops of the commanderies and kingdoms to attack them, [but these troops] were unable to vanquish [the robber bands]. In this sixth year, in the spring, [Wang] Mang saw VI that the thieves and robbers were so many, hence A.D. 19 ordered the Grand Astrologers to calculate a calendar Spring for thirty-six thousand years, with one change of the year-period [every] six years, and to publish it to 4a the empire. [Wang Mang] issued a message, saying, "The Tzu-ko T'u4.2 4.2 Repeated search has failed to discover any listing of this book, either in the lists of books in the standard histories or the bibliography of the T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan. The Tsu-kung (lit. the Purple Palace) was the Chinese name for the circumpolar constellations, at the center of which was the Supreme One, the heavenly emperor. Tzu-ko T'u may then be translated, "The Plan of the Purple [Heavenly Imperial] Pavilion." says, `The Supreme One and the Yellow Lord both [became] immortals and [then]4.3 4.3 Wang Nien-sun says that after the there was originally the word , as it now is in the quotation of this passage in T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 16: 9b; and that this insertion improves the phrasing. (Repeated search has not discovered this passage in the Ch'u-hsueh Chi, contrary to what he says.) ascended to heaven, [where they] made music on top of the K'un-lun and Ch'ien Mountains.4.4 4.4 The Mu T'ien-tzu Chuan (pos. iii cent.) 2: 1b (Cheng's trans. in JNChRAS., 64: [1933] 133) says, "On the lucky day hsin-yu, the Son of Heaven ascended a mount of K'un-lun [Mts.] and thereupon gazed upon the palace of the Yellow Lord." The Shan-hai Ching (prob. ii &amp; i cent. B.C.) 2: 11a, locates the Yellow Lord Mt. Mi . Shen Ch'in-han suggests that is an error for Mi. T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 9b reads Ch'u . A sage lord who 380WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI A.D. 19 is of their later generations and is to secure auspicious 99 C: 4a, b presages is due [similarly] to have music made upon the top of the Chung-nan Mountains in [the state of] Ch'in.' 4b "Because of my lack of penetration, my performance of [Heaven's] commands has not been intelligent, yet now I have been informed [of the correct procedure]. I restore [a former title, changing] the General of a Peaceful Beginning to be the General of a New Beginning, in order to conform to the Mandate [of Heaven given through] portents. Does not the Book of Changes say, `The daily renewing [of nature] is what is called the flourishing of its virtue; its production 5a of what is produced is what is called its change.'4.5 4.5 Book of Changes, App. III, i, v, 28, 29, (Legge, p. 356). May I receive [Heaven's protection]." He wished thereby to deceive and dazzle the people and to scatter and disperse the thieves and robbers, [but] the vulgar all laughed at him. The Hsin Dynasty's Music Previously when the music of the Hsin [House]had been offered in the Grand [Ancestral] Temple of the Ming-t'ang, when the courtiers had first worn the female unicorn-skin caps,4.6 4.6 Li Ch'i (fl. ca. 200) declares that these were "deerskin hats." Shuo-wen 10 A: 3b defines lin (usually translated `unicorn') as, "A large female deer." Lu Chi (261-303), in a note to Ode 11, "Lin-chih-chih," in Mao-shih Cheng-yi 1, iii: 7b (same as the shih-yin Mao-shih Chu-su), remarks, "At present, in the borders of Ping Province are lin, like deer in size, which are not the lin (unicorns) that are auspicious [from Heaven]." (From Shen Ch'in-han). Thus these caps were probably made of female deer skins from this later Ping Province; Wang Mang was probably glad to call them unicorn caps. someone who heard the sound of this music said, "It is limpid and inspiring, but plaintive,4.7 4.7 This "someone" might very likely have been Pan Chih, Pan Ku's grandfather, had been a high official and was living in retirement as a Gentleman at Emperor Ch'eng's tomb; cf. 100 A: 5b. The Official ed. emends (plaintive) to (enfeebling), seemingly without any . not the music that will make a state 381WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI 99 C: 4b flourish." A.D. 19 At this time, east of [Han-ku] Pass there had been A Grand Levy a famine and drought for several years, so that the partizan bands of Li Tzu-tu and the others became gradually larger. When the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, had attacked [the rebels] in Yi Province, he had not been able to vanquish them, hence he was summoned to return in order that someone might be sent in his place. He was [however] restored to his [former] position [as General of a New Beginning]. Afterwards when Kuo Hsing, [the Commissioner Over] the Army [subordinate to] the Commander-in-chief, and the Shepherd of the Yung Regional Division, Li Yeh, [were sent to] attack the barbarian Jo Tou and others, and the Third Brother Hsi, Sun Hsi, a higher subordinate official of the Grand Tutor, [was sent to] purify the Yangtze valley4.8 4.8 Cf. Glossary sub Chiang-hu. from thieves and robbers, and when moreover the Huns raided the borders very seriously, [Wang] Mang made a great solicitation of the empire's freemen together with those imprisoned for capital crimes and the slaves of the officials and common people. 4b [Those who responded] were called "Boar braves who are porcupines rushing out,"4.9 4.9 Fu Chien, in a note to 24 B: 26b, explains this phrase thus, "Hogs [also porcupines] by nature rush against men impetuously. Hence [Wang Mang] took them for a metaphor." Yen Shih-ku adds, "People in the eastern quarter [of the empire] called pigs . Another [explanation] is that hsi are pigs running." and were considered as ardent troops. [Wang Mang] temporarily taxed the officials and Special Taxation common people of the empire, taking one-thirtieth of their property. Their close-woven waterproof and other silks were all transported to Ch'ang-an. It was ordered that the ministers and those of lower [rank 5b 382WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI A.D. 19 down] to the [officials] in the commanderies and 99 C: 4b, 5a counties who wore yellow seal-cords4.10 4.10 HHS, Tr. 30: 15a, states that officials ranking at 400, 300, and 200 piculs yellow seal-cords. Cf. App. I, HS 24 B: 26b. should all 5a guarantee4.11 4.11 Yen Shih-ku, in a note to the parallel passage in 24 B: 26b, explains, "To means to promise that they will not die or be injured," i.e., to provide another animal case anything happened to these animals. Probably they also paid for rearing them. For these pastures, cf. HFHD, II 304, n. 2.8. the rearing of horses for the army, the number of which [horses] should be proportionate to each [official's] rank. [Wang Mang] also made a wide solicitation for those who possessed extraordinary skills that could be used to attack the Huns, [saying that] they would be treated [extraordinarily by being given a high] ranking [at once and] not be [promoted only] by degrees. Those who said that [their arts] would be advantageous were numbered by the ten-thousands. One said that he was able to cross streams without using boats or oars; that by joining horses and connecting their riders he could cause an army of a million to ford [rivers]. One said that without carrying a measure of grain and by taking drugs, the three [divisions of] an army would not become hungry. Aviation One said that he was able to fly a thousand li in a day and so could spy out the Huns. [Wang] Mang immediately had him try out [his invention]. He took the quills of a large bird to make his two wings; on both his head and his body he stuck feathers. He connected them by pivots.5.1 5.1 This is perhaps the earliest authentic account of human flight. He probably off from a height, so that a flight of several hundred yards was possible. B. Prehistory of Aviation, does not notice this incident. There were also other technical developments in Wang Mang's time; cf. the dissection in 99 B: 30b. He flew several hundred double-paces [and then he] fell. [Wang] Mang knew that these [people] could not be useful, [but] he merely wished to make use of their fame, so he installed them all as Directors of 383WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI 99 C: 5a, b the Army and granted them chariots and horses A.D. 19 while they waited [until the army should] set out. Previously, the Hun Ku-tu Marquis of the West, HsÃ¼-pu Tang Brought to Chang-an HsÃ¼-pu Tang, whose wife, [LÃ¼an-ti YÃ¼n], was the daughter of Wang [Ch'iang] Chao-chÃ¼n, had been attached to [the Chinese. Wang] Mang sent the Marquis of Peace and Alliance By Marriage, Wang Hsi6, the son of [Wang Ch'iang] Chao-chÃ¼n's elder brother, to allure and summon [HsÃ¼-pu] Tang5.2 5.2 For , the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. read , which I adopt. to the foot of the barrier and by force made him go to Ch'ang-an, where he was compelled to be set up as 6a the Shan4-yÃ¼ HsÃ¼-pu and the Duke of Future Peace.5.3 5.3 According to HS 94 B: 21a = de Groot, Die Hunnen, p. 283, HsÃ¼-pu Tang had been made Duke of Future Peace in A.D. 15, whereas he was made Shan-yÃ¼ after A.D. 18 (HS 94 B: 21b = de Groot, ibid., 286), so that at this time only the Hun title was additionally conferred upon him. [When Wang Mang] first wanted to allure and receive [HsÃ¼-pu] Tang, the Commander-in-chief, 5a Chuang Yu, had remonstrated, saying, "[HsÃ¼-pu] Tang is in the western section of the Huns where his troops do not invade [the Chinese] borders. Whenever the Shan-yÃ¼ moves or remains quiet, he immediately [sends] word [of it] to China. [Thus] he is of the greatest assistance in this quarter. If now you receive [HsÃ¼-pu] Tang and establish him on Kao Street5.4 5.4 On Kao Street was located the government lodge for barbarians, cf. 70: 10b &amp; Glossary sub voce. in Ch'ang-an, he will be merely an individual northern foreigner (Hu) and would not be as helpful as if he were among the Huns." [But Wang] Mang did not listen [to him. When Wang Mang] had secured [HsÃ¼-pu] Tang, he wanted to send [Chuang] Yu with Lien Tan to attack the Huns. He granted both of them the surname 5b Cheng (to make a military expedition), entitling them the Two Generals Making a Military 384WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI A.D. 19 Expedition. They were required to execute the 99 C: 5b Shan-yu [LÃ¼an-ti] YÃ¼, and set up [HsÃ¼-pu] Tang to take his place. They were to start out5.5 5.5 Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggests that is probably a mistake for . Chariots were then used only in military ceremonies; cavalry and footmen made up the army. Ch'u-ch'e is moreover the title of Book of Odes, #168; II, i, viii; Legge, p. 261, which ode is stated in the "Little Preface" (Legge, "Introduction," p. 64) to treat of "rewarding the returning troops," with the result that ch'u-ch'e has taken this meaning. from the Kuang Stables at the west of the city. Chuang Yu Dismissed Before they started out, [since Chuang] Yu had usually had wise plans and had opposed [Wang] Mang's [project of] attacking the barbarians in the four [quarters],5.6 5.6 For (west), the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. read (four); the former is not appropriate for an expedition against the Huns to the north. and had remonstrated several times, but [his advice] had not been followed, he composed [a work] in altogether three fascicles, [dealing with] the conception that ancient famous generals, [such as] Yo Yi and Po Ch'i, were [eventually] not employed [by their lords] and also discussing matters [concerning the Chinese] borders, and memorialized [the book] in order to remonstrate with [Wang] Mang. When they were due to start out, in a conference at court, [Chuang] Yu said firmly that the Huns could be temporarily considered as secondary and that the most important concern 6b [of the ruler] should be the thieves and robbers east of the mountains [of Kuang-chung].5.7 5.7 A previous admonition by Chuang Yu, against the expedition planned in A.D. , showing how carefully Chinese generals planned matters, is to be found in 94 B: 19a, b = de Groot, Die Hunnen, 273-5. [Wang] Mang became furious and [wrote] a dismissal notice for [Chuang] Yu, which said, "You have overseen affairs to the fourth year, [but when] `the barbarians became troublesome to the Chinese,' you have not been able to stop or destroy them; when `robbers and brigands have caused disorder outside and inside [the government]',5.8 5.8 The clauses in single quotation marks are a quotation from the Book of History II, I, v, 20 (Legge, p. 44); cf. also HFHD, II, 320, n. 8.3. you have not been 385WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI 99 C: 5b, 6a able to extirpate them; you have not been awed by A.D. 19 the majestic [mandate] of Heaven and have not carried out my mandates in imperial edicts. Your visage has been harsh, [yet] you have approved of yourself. You insist that what you think is right and never change. In your bosom you have cherished inclinations toward rebellion, so that you have condemned and ruined [my plans] in the deliberations on military [matters]. I cannot bear to apply the law to you. You shall deliver up your seals and aprons of the Commander-in-chief and of the Earl Establishing 5b Military Power and return to your former commandery. [Let] the Earl Making Portents Descend, Tung Chung1b, become the Commander-in-chief." T'ien K'uang, the Leader of a Combination at Double Taxation Yi-p'ing [Commandery], memorialized that the commanderies and counties had not appraised the common people's [property] according to the facts, so [Wang] Mang again taxed [their property at the rate of] one-thirtieth. Because of [T'ien] K'uang's faithful words and his solicitude for the state, he was advanced in noble rank, made an earl, and granted two million cash. The mass of commoners all reviled him.5.9 5.9 The Sung Ch'i ed. states that should be , which suggestion looks very much like a "boner" on the part of an ignorant scholar, thus illustrating the spurious character of the Sung Ch'i ed. Cf. HFHD, P., "Editions of the History of the Former Han Dynasty." In Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ [Provinces], many of the common people left their native villages and became vagrants. The aged and weak died on the roads, and the vigorous entered the robber [bands]. The Leader of a Combination at Su-yeh [Commandery], Han Po, sent a message to the emperor, 6a saying, "There is a marvellous gentleman, ten feet ChÃ¼-wu Pa, the tall and ten spans [in circumference], who came to your subject's yamen and said, `I am desirous with 386WANG MANG, T'ien-feng VI A.D. 19 all my energy to attack the caitiff northern foreigners 99 C: 6a 7a (Hu).' He calls himself ChÃ¼-wu Pa and comes from the shore of the Chao-ju Sea northwest of the five cities southeast of P'eng-lai. A small chariot is not able to bear him, and three horses are not able to transport him, so, on the same day, in a large quadriga with four horses, on which is erected a tiger flag, bearing [ChÃ¼-wu] Pa, [I have sent him] to go to the [palace] Portal. When [ChÃ¼-wu] Pa lies down, he pillows [his head] upon a drum.6.1 6.1 The Sung Ch'i ed. notes that the Southern ed. (ca. x-xii cent.), instead of , reads , "his pillow is several feet [high]," and that this reading is mistaken. In a to HHS, An. 1 A: 5a, Li Hsien (fl. 674-676) quotes this passage, reading as the text . (Reference from Ma HsÃ¼-lun.) He eats with iron chopsticks. "This [man has been sent] by August Heaven as a means of assisting the House of Hsin. I wish that your Majesty would have a large cuirass made, with a high chariot and garments for a [Meng] Pen or a [Hsia] YÃ¼, and send a generalissimo and a hundred of the [Gentlemen] As Rapid As Tigers to meet him on the road. The gates and doors in the imperial capital which will not admit him should be enlarged and made taller and larger, in order to show him to the barbarians and settle down the world." [Han] Po's intention was that he wanted thereby to offer a hint to [Wang] Mang,6.2 6.2 The hint is conveyed in the man's name, which means literally, "ChÃ¼ should not be a tyrant." ChÃ¼ was the first word of Wang Mang's courtesy name and is used in Pan Ku's "Fu on Penetrating Obscurities" (100 A: 12a) to denote Wang Mang. Chin Shao , "The hint said, `It is not permitted to be a usurper and thief and become a tyrant!' " [but when Wang] Mang was informed of it, he disliked it and detained 6a [ChÃ¼-wu] Pa at the place where he was in Hsin-feng. He changed his surname to be Mr. ChÃ¼-mu (ChÃ¼'s Mother), saying, "Because of the Empress Dowager the Mother of Culture there has been this portent [that Wang (Mang) ChÃ¼-(chÃ¼n) should be] a lord protector (pa) and a [true] king."6.3 6.3 Yen Shih-ku explains that "it means that the Mother of Culture sent this man to cause me to be a lord protector and king." Pa means both "tyrant" and "Lord Protector." [Wang Mang] 387WANG MANG, Ti-huang I 99 C: 6a, b summoned [Han] Po [to court], sent him to prison, A.D. 19/20 and had him publicly executed, because he had said things that were not proper. In the next year, the year-period was to be changed to Ti-huang, which was a title taken from the calendar for thirty-six thousand years.6.4 6.4 T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 78: 1a quotes Hsiang ChÃ¼n's (fl. dur. 222-280) Shih-hsÃ¼eh Chi as saying, "When Heaven and Earth had been set up, there were twelve Heavenly Sovereigns , called T'ien-ling , who rule over 18,000 years. Because their virtue was wood, they ruled." Ibid., 1b, quotes the same source, "The twelve Earthly Sovereigns rule over 18,000 years." These two groups of gods seem to cover the 36,000 years referred to. (Reference from Su YÃ¼.) In [the period] Ti-huang, the first year, in the first 6b 7b month, on [the day] yi-wei, an amnesty [was granted] I to the empire. [Wang Mang] issued a message, A.D. 20 saying, "At the time when the army is being sent out Feb. 9 and the troops are being put into motion, those who Executions Permitted At All Seasons presume to run and shout, violating the law, should immediately be judged and beheaded. It is not necessary [to wait for] the season [for executions, winter]. When the year is up, [this order] shall cease." Thereupon during the spring and summer people were beheaded in the market-places of the capitals; the people were terrified and afraid and `on the highroads and paths, they indicated their hatred [of Wang Mang] in their eyes.'6.5 6.5 A famous phrase from Kuo-yÃ¼ 1: 4b, where the peoples' anger is directed against the tyrannous King Li, who was subsequently overthrown. In accordance with the "Ordinances for the Months," executions had previously been confined to the winter months. In the third6.6 6.6 The text reads "second month," but there was no jen-shen day in that month, and there seems to be no servicable emendation of the cyclical characters. Probably "two' was mistakenly written for "three," a common copyist's error. month, on [the day] jen-shen, in the Mar. 17 center of the sun there was a blackness.6.7 6.7 Stange (p. 228) translates jih cheng as, "wurde die Sonne ganz (dunkel)." It might be, "At midday there was (a blackness)," to parallel jih-chung below, which may be translated, "At midday (we saw a dusk)." While "midday" is the correct translation for jih-chung in the quotation from the Book of Changes, yet this line may have been used by Wang Mang without bothering about its exact meaning, just as from the Bible were frequently used as proof-texts with a quite different meaning from that in the original. Jih-chung furthermore need not necessarily mean "midday," cf. HS 27 Cb: 17b1, jih chung yang , "in the center of the sun." The important circumstance is the Pan Ku does not himself write jih chung, but jih cheng, and cheng "the center of a target." I conclude that Pan Ku writes exactly in his phrase jih cheng, meaning "the middle of the sun," and quotes Wang Mang as fitting to the situation a classical quotation by wresting it from its original meaning. A blackness at midday might be a solar eclipse, a heavy cloud, or a dust-storm. There was no eclipse at this time. Heavy clouds and dust-storms were so well-known that they would hardly have been considered "grievous vicissitudes." I cannot make the translations of Stange or the other one physically plausible. Large sun-spots are however visible to the naked eye at sunrise or sunset, when the sun's brilliance is dimmed. Such a sun-spot would cause as much consternation in ancient China as they did in Europe when Galileo first saw them. One had previously been noticed in 28 B.C. (HFHD II, 384, n. 5.6) and was called a "black emanation," like the present one. [Wang] 388WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, iii A.D. 20, March An Ominous Portent Mang disliked it, and issued a message which said, 99 C: 6b "Recently, `in the sun an obscurity has appeared.'6.8 6.8 A quotation from Book of Changes, Hex. 55, 3, with meis instead of the meis in the present text of that classic. Legge (p. 185) translates this sentence, "At midday he can see (the small) Mei star." But Cheng HsÃ¼an, in his comment on the Book of Changes, gives the same interpretation of mei as that employed here. The Yin [principle] is pressing upon the Yang [principle, and has produced] the grievous vicissitude of a black emanation. None of the people have failed to be startled by the marvel. The Generalissimo of the Northern City-wall [of Ch'ang-an],6.9 6.9 I read po-ch'eng instead of the chao-yÃ¼ in the text, at the suggestion of Liu Feng-shih (1041-1113). While chao-yÃ¼ ("Generalissimo of the Pomoerium for the Tumuli") is not impossible, as Stange points out (p. 228, n. 4), it is nevertheless unparalleled. Liu Feng-shih says it does not make sense. HS 99 C: 7a states that each Shepherd of a province was made a generalissimo. On 99 B: 28a, Lien Tan is said to have been General of the Southern City-wall [presumably of the imperial capital]. Since there was a Major (Szu-ma) in charge of each city-gate at Ch'ang-an (19 A: 22b), Wang Mang may well have considered that the dignity of the imperial capital required a generalissimo for each side of its city-wall. Liu Feng-shih points out that this Wang K'uang1d must have been a different from the Grand Master, Wang K'uang1a, for Wang K'uang1a is always mentioned by highest title of Grand Master. This cannot also have been Wang K'uang1b, who later from obscurity in the Yangtze region, nor can it have been Wang K'uang,1c a of Wang Mang who was not publicly acknowledged or brought to the capital until A.D. 21 (99 C: 11b). It was most likely some other person by the same name. Wang K'uang1d, 389WANG MANG, Ti-huang I 99 C: 6b, 7a has sent an official to examine and question those who A.D. 20 have presented [to the ruler] matters [concerning] grievous vicissitudes, [to examine] whether they intend to blind the throne's intelligence. For this reason, a reprobation has appeared in Heaven, in order that I might correct [matters by right] principlies, and stop these great prodigies." When Wang] Mang saw that the thieves and Military Regula- robbers in the four quarters were many, he again wanted to repress them, and so again sent out a message, 6b saying, "When my August Deceased Original tions Ancestor, the Yellow Lord, tranquillized the world, he led his troops as a First [Ranking] General and established the flowery baldachin and set up the Bushel Bowl [Standard].6.10 6.10 Ts'ui Pao, in his Ku-chin-chu, ch. 1: A: 4b, states, "The Flowery Baldachin was created by the Yellow Lord. When he fought with Ch'ih-yu in the wastes of Cho-lu [a mountain located, according to the Ta-ch'ing Yi-t'ung Chih 39: 7a, southeast of the present Cho-lu, the Ch'ing dynasty's Pao-an, Chahar], a many-colored cloud emanation with golden branches and jade leaves constantly stopped above the Lord, having the likeness of the corolla to a flower. Hence he followed this pattern and created the Flowery Baldachin." This legendary account probably gives a description of the covering. Yen Shih-ku explains, "Hsi1 is pronounced like hsi2 . It means the [constellation] K'uei of the [Northern] Bushel [the bowl of the Dipper, cf. 99 B: n. 21.1], together with [the constellation] Piao [the handle of the Dipper]. Its end is like a handle in shape." Here again the Bushel (cf. n. 2.4) is used as an imperial emblem and protection. Within [the imperial court] I6.11 6.11 Stange (p. 229) makes the Yellow Lord the subject of this sentence, not Wang Mang. But sudden unannounced changes in the unexpressed subjects of verbs are by no means uncommon in Chinese. The Book of Changes was moreover not believed to have existed in the time of the Yellow Lord, so that he could not have been the subject of this sentence. establish a General-in-[chief]; outside [the court I 7a also] establish five Commanders-in-chief, 25 Generalissimos, 8a 125 Lieutenant Generals, 1250 Major Generals, 12,500 Colonels, 37,500 Majors, 112,500 Captains,7.1 7.1 The Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. write (marquis) for (captain). The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. 225,000 Centurions, 450,000 Petty Officers, 390WANG MANG, Ti-huang I A.D. 20 and 13,500,000 soldiers, in order to respond to 99 C: 7a, b and accord with [the saying in] the Book of Changes, `[This gave] the benefit of bows and arrows, whereby they might [awe] the world by their majesty.'7.2 7.2 Book of Changes, III, ii, ii, 20 (Legge, p. 384). The passage says, "They bent wood by means of a string to make bows and sharpened sticks to make arrows; [this gave them] the benefit of bows and arrows, whereby they might [awe] the world by their majesty." I have obtained the writings of the mandate [of Heaven given through] portents and have examined [my enactments by the deeds] of earlier persons, since I desire that [my enactments] may be complete in detail." Thereupon there were established the positions of Commander-in-chief at the Van, at the Rear, at the Left, at the Right, and at the Center. [Wang Mang] granted to the various Provincial Shepherds the title of Generalissimo; Directors of Confederations,7.3 7.3 The Sung Ch'i ed. again "pulls a boner" in suggesting that should be emended to . Hereafter such notations will be neglected. Leaders of Combinations, and Grand Governors of commanderies became Lieutenant Generals; Prefects and Chiefs of Associations [became] Major Generals; and Rulers of counties became Colonels. Almost ten [groups of] commissioners in riding quadrigae daily passed through the commanderies and kingdoms. 8b 7a The granaries had no grain ready for supplying [their needs] and the chariots and horses in the post-stations could not be sufficient [for these many messengers, so the officials] levied and seized chariots and horses on the roads and requisitioned supplies from the common people. July/Aug. In the seventh month, a great wind damaged the Hall With the Royal Apartments, [so Wang Mang] again issued a message, saying, "Recently, on [the July 25 day] jen-wu, at the time for eating the afternoon meal, 7b there was the grievous vicissitude of a strong wind, with thunder and rain, which unroofed houses and 391WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii 99 C: 7b broke down trees. I was greatly excited. I was in- A.D. 20, July/Aug. An Ominous Portent spired with great fear. I was greatly terrified. I humbly reflected and after ten days the riddle was then solved.7.4 7.4 Yen Shih-ku points out that Wang Mang is alluding to the Book of History II, i, iii, 2 (Legge, p. 32), "[Shun] was received as the chief director [of the administration], and, amidst violent wind, thunder, and rain, he did not go astray." Cf. 99 A: n. 13.5. "Previously, the words of a mandate [granted by] The Heir-Apparent Changed portents [said, `Wang] An1a should be set up as the Hsin-hsien7.5 7.5 For the pronunciation of , cf. Glossary sub this title. This word and were interchanged. Li Tz'u-ming, 7: 16b, suggests that possibly the first word was always written in the HS and later changed to the second in most places but not all. King [(the King, the Immortal of the Hsin House); Wang] Lin1a should have Lo-yang as his state and should be the T'ung-yi-yang King [the King Controlling-the-line in which Right-principles Shine].7.6 7.6 Yang is the opposite of "shadow," i.e., "light." Wang Mang renamed Lo-yang to be Yi-yangb. Cf. also n. 11.5; Glossary sub this title. At that time, I was occupying [the post of] Regent and Acting [Emperor], so deferred and did not presume to [accept these titles], but made [my sons] Dukes. After that, there arrived the writing in the golden coffer. Those who discussed [these matters] all said, `[Wang] Lin1a's state should be Lo-yang; to be t'ung means to occupy the center of the Earth,7.7 7.7 Cf. HS 99 B: 23a. Wang Mang asserted he ruled by virtue of the element earth. to be [the continuer of] the dynastic line (t'ung) of the Hsin [House, (i.e., T'ung-yi-yang means to live in the center of the Earth and continue the dynastic line by which the right principles of the Hsin House shine)]. It is proper that he should be the Imperial Heir-apparent.' "After this [time, Wang] Lin1a was ill for a long time, and, altho he recovered, he was not entirely 9a well, so that when he appeared at court, he traveled borne suspended on a mattress.7.8 7.8 Han-chiu-yi B: 1b says, "The Empress and Favorite Beauties travel in imperial chariots; all others [of the harem] travel by being carried by four men holding up a mattress ." Chin Shao quotes the above passage and remarks, "Could that have been the present sedan chair and it have been spread with a mattress?" Shih-ku replies that he is mistaken, "This [passage] says directly that he sat on top of mattress [or cushion] and had four men in pairs hold up the four corners of the mattress, and so traveled." Prof. Duyvendak suggests that this was some sort of a stretcher. When he came 7b 392WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii A.D. 20, July/Aug. to an audience in the Hall With the Royal Apart- 99 C: 7b, 8a ments, he set up his bed in the Western Lateral Apartments together with the Central [Room] for 8a Changing Garments in the Rear Pavilion.7.9 7.9 Chin Shao explains, "Keng yi shih means the name of the room (shih) and building to which one goes for changing one's robes at the time of court felicitations." Cf. also 97 A: 11b4. The first two words of this phrase also mean "go to the toilet." Chou Shou-ch'ang suggests that the word (shih) has dropped out at the end of this phrase; it is read in the comment and in the repetition of the phrase a few lines further on. Because moreover the Empress was ill, [Wang] Lin1a temporarily left his original [rooms] and went to her dwelling. His Crown Princess and concubines were in the Eastern Long Lane. July 25 "[On the day] jen-wu, a strong wind did violence to the Western Lateral Apartments of [the Hall] With the Royal Apartments and the Central Room for Changing Garments in the Rear Pavilion; an elm tree, ten spans [or fathoms] in circumference, southeast of the pool at the Hall of Brilliant Peace, fell eastwards, striking the Eastern Pavilion. This Pavilion is the western wall of the Eastern Long Lane. All [these places] were destroyed. Tiles were broken, the roofs were taken off, and trees were uprooted. I was very much frightened. An Ominous Portent "The Office for Watching [the Heavens] moreover memorialized that the Moon has invaded the front stars of [the constellation] Hsin, which has an interpretation.8.1 8.1 Hsin was one of the names Wang Mang gave to his dynasty. The star in that constellation was moreover called the Heavenly King [Mh III, 343], so that portent meant that the Yin principle (the Moon, the principle of decay) was invading the Hsin dynasty's virtue. The moon passed within a degree of Antares in the early morning of Mar. 3, A.D. 20. I was very much worried by it. "I humbly considered the writing in the Tzu-ko-t'u, `The Supreme One and the Yellow Lord both obtained 393WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii 99 C: 8a auspicious presages and thereby became im- A.D. 20, July/Aug. mortals, and among their later generations a magnificent lord [Wang Mang] is due to ascend the Chung-nan [lit., he comes to his end to the south] Mountains.' What is meant by the Hsin-hsien King is that he is a descendant of the Supreme One and of 9b the Immortal of the Hsin [House] (Hsin-hsien). [What is meant by] the T'ung-yi-yang King is that he is a descendant of [the one] who uses the five dynastic principles (t'ung)8.2 8.2 Referring here probably to the five powers, each of which was supposed to set up a dynasty. and by means of the rules of proper conduct (li) and moral principles (yi) mounts up to the sunny side (yang [the south]) and becomes an immortal. "[Wang] Lin1a has an elder brother, but is called the Heir-apparent, so that his title is not correct. Duke HsÃ¼an-ni [As Recompense for Perfection (of Pao-ch'eng), Confucius,] said, `If titles are not correct, then speech will not be in accordance with [reality,' and so on], even to `punishments will not be appropriate' and `the common people will not know how to move their hands or feet.'8.3 8.3 Analects XIII, iii, 5, 6. "Verily, since I have ascended the throne, the Yin and Yang [principles] have not been harmonious, so that the wind and rain have not been timely, and [the country] has several times met withering drought, 8a locusts and caterpillars, which became [calamitous] visitations. The harvests of grain have been sparse or lacking, so that the people have suffered from famine. `The barbarians have troubled the Chinese and robbers and brigands have caused disorder outside and inside [the government,'8.4 8.4 Book of History II, i, v, 20 (Legge, p. 44), again quoted. so that] the common people are fearful and disturbed8.5 8.5 Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 38: 12b emends to Yen Shih-ku interprets the phrase as meaning, "Fearful and not at peace." The subsequent quotation is from Analects XIII, iii, 6. and `do 394WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii A.D. 20, July/Aug. not know how to move a hand or foot.' 99 C: 8a, b 8b "I have pondered deeply that the blame for this [lies] in titles not being correct. Let [Wang] An1a be set up as the Hsin-hsien King and [Wang] Lin1a be the T'ung-yi-yang King. I hope that thereby I may protect and preserve my two sons, that my descendants [may be numbered] by the thousands and millions, and that, without [the country], the barbarians of the four [quarters] may be driven away and within [the country] the Central States may be pacified." Another Ominous Portent In this month, the imperial tiger-striped [grave]clothes [of Emperor HsÃ¼an] in the Side Hall at the Tu Tomb, which had been set aside and stored in the 10a coffers of the [inner] chamber, went out and planted themselves upright outside [the inner chamber] in the Hall above.8.6 8.6 The Tu Tomb was that of Emperor HsÃ¼an; cf. Glossary sub voce. For a similar incident, cf. 12: 3b. HHS, Tr. 30: 10b, says: "[The Gentlemen] As Rapid As Tigers and the all [wear] the dark yellow pheasant cap and tiger-striped unlined clothes. [The county of] Hsiang-yi yearly offers woven and completed tiger-striped [cloth]." Shen Ch'in- remarks that these garments were probably those used in the Emperor's funeral and had all been stored in the funerary chamber at his tomb. After a quite long time they however fell to the ground. The officers and soldiers who had seen them therefore reported it [to the throne. Wang] Mang disliked it and so issued a message which said, "For the precious [throne] there is yellow and for the servitors there is red.8.7 8.7 Yellow was the color of earth, the power by virtue of which Wang Mang asserted he ruled; red was the color of fire, the power of the Han dynasty. He was earth (the Hsin dynasty's virtue) and degrading fire (the Han dynasty's virtue). Yellow was then used for the robes of higher officials and red for those of lower rank. Let it be ordered that the Gentlemen and the Imperial Retinue shall all wear carmine." Many of those who watched the [cloudy] emanations and made divinations said that there were phenomena of some signal achievements [to be done 395WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii 99 C: 8b, 9a by the virtue] of the Earth. [Wang] Mang more- A.D. 20, July/Aug. The Hsin Dynasty's Nine Ancestral Temples Begun over saw that the thieves and robbers in the four quarters were many and wanted to make it appear that he himself was tranquil and was able to be the founder [of a dynasty enduring for] ten thousand generations, so issued a message which said, "I have received the Mandate [of Heaven] and am meeting with the distresses of the nine dry years and the untoward occurrences in the 106 [years],8.8 8.8 Cf. 99 B: n. 21.2. when the government treasuries are empty and the people are exhausted. The [imperial] ancestral temples have not yet been prepared, [hence] I have temporarily made common ancestral sacrifices in the Grand [Ancestral] Temple of the Ming-t'ang. Day and night I have reflected long and have not presumed to rest. I pondered deeply that no blessing or prosperity is better than that to be had in the present year. I then divined by the tortoise-shell [concerning the region] north of the Po River and south of the Lang 8b Pool, and it was [divined as fit to produce] imperial sustenance. I also divined by the tortoise-shell 9a [concerning the region] south of the Chin River and west of the Ming-t'ang, and it was also [divined as fit to produce] imperial sustenance.9.1 9.1 These two sentences are in imitation of Book of History, V, xiii, 3 (Legge, p. 436f), where the Duke of Chou reports the divination concerning the location of the city he built, Lo. For the locations herein mentioned, cf. Glossary, sub vocibus. Legge (op. cit.) follows the K'ung An-kuo interpretation of the shih in the foregoing passage; for shih Wang Mang uses the phrase yÃ¼-shih , and Yen Shih-ku adopts the aforesaid interpretation in his comment to the present passage, stating that it means that the ink, smeared on the back of the tortoise-shell used in divination, was dried up by the heat, which was a favorable prognostication. K'ung Ying-ta, in a note to the Mao-shih Chu-su 4, i: 1b, quotes a gloss by Cheng HsÃ¼an (127-200), to the above-mentioned passage of the Book of History, in which the latter paraphrases and explains this passage as follows: "On [the day] yi-mao, I, [the Duke of Chou], arrived at the [future] capital at the city of Lo and looked at the places which the Duke of Shao [had determined upon as a result of] divination by the tortoise-shell. They are all able to be permanent homes for the common people and will make them devote themselves to cultivating the fields, from which [they and the ruler may secure] food (shih)." The last sentence is Cheng HsÃ¼an's paraphrase of the word shih in the text of the Book of History, hence he did not connect it with "ink" but with food. Chou-li 24: 13a (Biot, II, 79) sub the Chan-jen, says moreover, "Whenever [the Chan-jen] divines by the tortoise or by the stalks: for the prince, he divines by the form; for a grandee, he divines by the color; for a [low] official, he divines by the ink [Cheng HsÃ¼an says that "ink " means the width of the cracks in the tortoise-shell]; and when divines by the tortoise for [ordinary] persons, he divines by the cracks." Thus divination by "ink" was only for common officials, and would not be employed by an emperor such as Wang Mang. The phrase yÃ¼-shih moreover occurs in the Book of History V, iv, 18. Legge (p. ) translates it "the revenues of the empire." Ma Jung (79-166) in a note to the quotation of that passage in SC 38: 15, declares, "YÃ¼-shih is fine food ," and Cheng HsÃ¼an adds, "YÃ¼-shih is all [composed of] unusual delicacies ." In the Shang-shu Chu-su 12: 9a, K'ung Ying-ta (574-648) quotes what were probably ancient notes to this passage of the HS, which Yen Shih-ku (581-645), a contemporary of his, omitted from his edition, because he disagreed with these interpretations: "Chang Yen [prob. iii cent.], in a note to the HS, says, `YÃ¼-shih is unusual dainties .' Wei Chao [197-273] says, `The nobles have nothing but unusually fine food.' " Sun Hsing-yen (1743-1818) in his Shang-shu Ku-chin-wen Chu-su, in "Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 752: 5a, concludes, "YÃ¼-shih is as if it said good food . . . . Whenever in the Classics it says a yÃ¼ woman or a yÃ¼ color, the meaning is always that it is good ." Hence yÃ¼-shih denoted primarily the fine food of a prince, and secondarily land that was fit to produce such food. Cf. also Shang-shu Ku-chin-wen Chu-su, "Huang-ch'ing Ching-chieh" 759: 2a, b. I will now in 10b 396WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, vii A.D. 20, July/Aug. person9.2 9.2 For , the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed. and the Official ed. read . [begin to] build." Thereupon he accord- 99 C: ingly made plans [for buildings] south of the city of Ch'ang-an with a total acreage9.3 9.3 The meaning of t'i-feng has been debated. The first word of this phrase also written and . In a note to HS 23: 3a, Su Lin asserts that t'i is pronounced the same as tib (the Ching-yu and the Official ed. read ch'i for tib throughout) and "the people of the Ch'en-liu [Commandery] say that all its fields are its tib ." Li Ch'i declares, "T'i is chÃ¼ , to chÃ¼ all within four boundaries (feng) ." Yen Shih-ku adds that Li Ch'i is correct and Su Lin's pronunciation is erroneous. But Wang Nien-sun states that all the preceding explanations are mistaken, for the (by Chang Yi, fl. dur. 227-232) asserts that t'i-feng is tu-fan , which Wang declares is like the present , "generally," and is merely another phrase with about the same pronunciation. Cf. also the discussion in the Tz'u-t'ung, I, 1104. But "generally" does not appear to express the full meaning of the phrase , for this phrase is invariably used referring to some area of land, which fact is excellently illustrated by Wang Nien-sun's examples. For t'i-feng, Karlgren, Grammata , nos. 866n &amp; 1197i, moreover gives the archaic and T'ang pronunciations d'ieg or tieg-piung and d'iei- or tiei-piwong, respectively, and for tu-fan, (ibid., 45Ã© &amp; 625a), and tuo-biwom, respectively, so that the two phrases had different pronunciations. T'i-feng has moreover something to do with acreage. Cf. HS 23: 4a; 24 A: 7a; 65: 7a; HHS, Mem. 30 A: 11a. The crucial passage is HS 28 B ii: 49a, b, where the census totals of China are given, "The land is 9302 li [Han-chi (ii cent.) 30: 25a, reads 19,302 li] from east to west and 13,368 li from south to north, with a t'i-feng t'ien of 145,136,405 ch'ing, of which 102,528,889 ch'ing are towns, dwellings, highways, roads, mountains, streams, forests, and marshes, all of which cannot be cultivated, and 32,290,947 ch'ing are cultivatable [but] not cultivated [omitting the second ], and definitely cultivated t'ien of 8,270,536 ch'ing [Han-chi, ibid., reads 8,270,567 ch'ing]." (Of the total, 2,026,023 ch'ing are omitted from the itemization.) In this passage, t'i-feng t'ien must mean "total acreage." In a note to Pan Ku's "Fu on the Western Capital" in Wen-hsÃ¼an (Szu-pu Ts'ung-k'an ed.) 1: 10a, Fu Tsan is moreover quoted as follows: "In my opinion, an old explanation says, `T'i is "to pick it all up." It means, "A grand total of its acreage" .' " Hence I have translated t'i-feng as "total acreage." of a hundred ch'ing. 397WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, ix 99 C: 9a In the ninth month, on [the day] chia-shen, stand- A.D. 20, Sept. 25 Sept. 25 ing in a chariot, [Wang] Mang went to inspect [the work], and in person began it by pounding three times [on the earth in the forms for walls].

It would be proper to make the arrangements [of these temples] magnificent and to make [that fact] plainly known [to all] within [the four] seas, so as to bring it about that [even] after ten thousand generations, nothing in them should be changed around or despised."9.5 9.5 A reminiscence of Hsiao Ho's remark in HS 1 B: 12b (HFHD, I, 118). Thereupon [Wang] Mang summoned widely the artisans of the empire, and plans were calculated by means of geometry.9.6 9.6 Wang-(fa) () is a term frequently employed in the Chou-pi Suan-ching (ii cent. B.C. to i cent. A.D.) and refers to the method of calculating heights by geometrical means. Cf. op. cit. A: 17b. (Biot, in Jour.

The "Szu-pu Ts'ung-k'an" ed., 3: 6b moreover mentions a Ch'Ã¼an-t'ai Palace in the Shang-lin Park. This Palace is also mentioned in HS 45: 11b. Ta is here an error for ch'Ã¼an. Ch'u-yÃ¼an Palace, together with P'ing-lo [Lodge], Tang-lu [Lodge], and Yang-lu Lodge in [Shang-lin] Park west of the city [of Ch'ang-an], in all more than ten places, and took their materials 9a 11a and tiles to build the Nine [Ancestral] Temples. (In these months there was a great rain for more than sixty days.) It was ordered that common people who paid six hundred hu of grain might become Gentlemen, and that those who were Gentlemen or officials might be increased in rank or given a noble rank, [as high] as that of Sub-Vassal. The first of the Nine [Ancestral] Temples was called the Temple to the Aboriginal Founder [of the Hsin Dynasty], the Yellow Lord; the second was called the Temple Facing South to the First Founder [of the Hsin Dynasty], the Lord, YÃ¼ [Shun]; the third was called the Temple Facing North to the Dynastic Founder [of the Hsin Dynasty], King Hu of Ch'en, [Kuei Man]; the fourth was called the Temple Facing South to the Epochal Founder [of the Hsin Dynasty], King Ching of Ch'i, [Ch'en Ching-chung]; the fifth was called the Temple Facing 399WANG MANG, Ti-huang I 99 C: 9b North to the Kingly Founder [of the Hsin Dynasty], A.D. 20 King Min of Chi-po, [T'ien An]; (all [the foregoing] five temples were not to be discontinued [as succeeding generations of emperors included their immediate ancestors among the nine ancestors who are given separate fanes]); the sixth was called the Temple Facing South to the Honored Ancestor [of the Hsin Dynasty], King Po of Chi-nan, [Wang Sui]; the seventh was called, the Temple Facing North to the Honored Ancestor [of the Hsin Dynasty], King Ju of YÃ¼an-ch'eng, [Wang Ho4a]; the eighth was called, the Temple Facing South to the Close Ancestor [of the reigning Hsin Emperor], King Ch'ing of Yang-p'ing, [Wang Chin]; and the ninth was called, the Temple Facing North to the Close Ancestor [of the Reigning Hsin Emperor], King Hsien of Hsin-tuc, [Wang Wan]. The [main] halls [of these temples] were all many-storeyed buildings;9.9 9.9 Shuo-wen 6 A: 5a defines as a ch'ung-wu (a storeyed building). Chou-li 41: 15b, quoting the K'ao-kung Chi (Biot, II, 559) says, "The Yin dynasty had a ch'ung-wu" and Cheng HsÃ¼an glosses, "The ch'ung-wu was the main hall of the King's Palace, like the Great [Imperial] Apartments. . . . Ch'ung-wu is a double [set of] rafters ." Ancient Chinese important buildings seem generally to have had more than one story. that in the Temple to the Aboriginal Founder, [the Yellow Lord], from east to west and from south to north, in each [direction] was four hundred feet [long] and one hundred seventy feet high. The other Temples were half [that size]. They had bronze brackets,9.10 9.10 Yen Shih-ku explains, "Po-lu are the brackets on top of pillars, [on which cross-pieces the beams are supported]." and were adorned with gold, silver, and carved tracery, which reached the limit of the workmen's skill. Because they sat9.11 9.11 Wang Nien-sun suggests emending tai to hsi . In HS 36: 25b11 and 45: 3a7, where the word hsi is used, Yen Shih-ku each time interprets hsi by "yin ; it is as if one sat upon a mat (hsi)." In his interpretation of the present passage, he likewise interprets this tai by yin, so that his text of this passage must have read hsi. Wang Nien-sun remarks that in the li style, hsi is sometimes written , which is vulgarly written (Yen t'ieh Lun, 9: 7b6, ch. 52, writes it thus): by omission of the radical, tai was written. upon a high [place, the earth] around 400WANG MANG, Ti-huang I A.D. 20 10a them was raised. The expense of the work was 99 C: 9b, several ten thousand millions [of cash] and the conscripts 11b and criminals who died [on this work] were numbered by the ten-thousands. An Abortive Rebellion A man of ChÃ¼-lu [Commandery], Ma-shih Ch'iu, and others plotted to raise the troops of [the region comprised in the ancient feudal states of] Yen and Chao in order to execute [Wang] Mang. Wang Tana, an Officer to the Grand Minister of Works, discovered and reported it. [Wang] Mang sent some Grandees to the three highest ministers to apprehend and punish the cabal. Several thousand prominent persons in the commanderies and kingdoms were 9b involved. All were executed. [Wang] Tana was enfeoffed as the Marquis Supporting the State. From the time that [Wang] Mang acted out of accord with the ordinances for the seasons,10.1 10.1 Cf. HS 99 C: 6b. the people hated him, [yet Wang] Mang [acted] as if he was undisturbed by that [hatred. So] he again issued a message, saying, "Verily, ever since these temporary laws have been established, in the capital, Ch'ang2-an, with its six districts and great city, the warning drums have rarely sounded and robbers and bandits have decreased and become few. The people are satisfied with their habitations and yearly there have been [good] harvests. The foregoing [circumstances have been due to] the strength [coming from] the establishment of my authority. "[But] now the caitiff northern foreigners (Hu) have not yet been annihilated and executed, the southern and southwestern barbarians have not yet stopped burning [with rebellion], the Yangtze valley and the marshes of the sea-[coast] are boiling [with disturbance],10.2 10.2 Tz'u-t'ung, II, 1729, asserts that here ma is cursive for . It then means "bubbling up like rice-gruel." From this passage, ma-fei has now become a set phrase. and the thieves and robbers have 401WANG MANG, Ti-huang I 99 C: 10a, b not yet been completely routed and exterminated. A.D. 20 I have moreover taken in hand the great work of upholding the [imperial] ancestral temples and the altars to the gods of the soils and grains, so that the multitude of common people have been agitated. Now I again temporarily put these ordinances in effect, [but this practise] will stop with the end of the second year [of the period Ti-huang], in order that I may preserve the great multitude and save the 12a ignorant and wicked." In this year, the large and small cash were discontinued The Third Change in Coinage and in their place there were put into circulation currency spade money, which was two inches five fen in length, one inch broad, and was worth 25 currency cash. The currency cash were one inch in diameter, five shu in weight, each of which was worth one [cash].10.3 10.3 "Currency spade-money " and "Currency cash " were the names of Wang Mang's third coinage. Cf. App. I, HS 24 B: 26a. The two kinds [of money] were to circulate together. When anyone presumed to cast cash illicitly or only partly accepted the spade money as currency, [if any person] in a group of five [neighboring families] knew of it but did not discover and report it [to the authorities], all [of the five neighboring families were to have their property] confiscated10.4 10.4 The Sung Ch'i ed. states that the Shun-hua ed. (994-997) and the Ching ed. (probably the Ching-te Chien ed., 1004-1005) have the word after the . The Ching-yu ed. does not have it and Chou Shou-ch'ang declares that this word should not be inserted. HS 24 B: 26a (q.v. in App. I) dates this order in 14 A.D., and adds that by the sixth year after, the people should not be any more allowed to possess the former large cash. In this "Memoir", Pan Ku is hence recording this order for the change in the currency on the date when the old currency was finally outlawed, rather than on the date when the new currency was authorized. Penalties for counterfeiting were at the same time lightened. and to become government slaves or slave-women. The Grand Tutor, P'ing Yen, died, and the My 10b Forester, T'ang Tsunb, was made the Grand Tutor. 402WANG MANG, Ti-huang I A.D. 20 T'ang Tsun's Pose [T'ang] Tsunb said, "The state [treasury] is empty 99 C: 10b and the people are impoverished, the reason [for which is] prodigal extravagance." Consequently, he personally [wore] short clothes with small sleeves, rode on a chariot with stakes [and drawn by] 10a mares,10.5 10.5 Yen Shih-ku says, "A chariot with stakes is a wattled chariot [used by common soldiers]." It was despized by aristocrats and literati; Han-shih Wai-chuan 10: 9a, par. 11, says, "Coarse food and bad meat may be eaten; a jade for a horse and chariot with stakes may be ridden." Hu San-hsing adds, "While the Han dynasty flourished, those who rode on mares were prohibited and not allowed to gather together. If in the villages and lanes there was the same [custom, what was true about] the court and market-places can accordingly be inferred. [T'ang] Tsun belonged to the highest class of the highest ministers, yet he [a chariot drawn by] mares, which was in order to correct [the modernistic customs of] age." Cf. HS 24 A: 15b = Mh III, 545, &amp; n. 4. This tabu on riding mares is probably connected with the very ancient Chinese that the mare was closely connected with the gods of the soils (shÃª). Book of , App. I, ii, 3 (Legge, p. 214) says, "The mare is like the earth." Erkes (in T'oung Pao [1940], 58) argues that the Chinese Earth-goddess originally had the shape of a mare. slept upon a couch [made of] straw, [and ate from] tile dishes. He also used earthen dishes10.6 10.6 Li Tz'u-ming, op. cit. 7: 16b, suggests that li1 should be li2 . Where passage is repeated in HS 72: 25a, b, Fu Ch'ien explains li1 as "earthenware dishes." to send [food] to the ministers. When he went out, if he met any men and women who did not travel separately on the roads, [T'ang] Tsunb himself would get down from his chariot and, in accordance with [the principle of inflicting] punishments by altering the clothing, he would defile and dye their garments, [using] an ochre-red cloth.10.7 10.7 Ochre-red was the color of clothes used for condemned criminals. Yen explains that he soaked a strip of cloth with ochre-red liquid; cf. HFHD, II, 123-5. [When Wang] Mang heard of it, he was delighted with him, so issued an imperial edict instructing the ministers "to think of making themselves equal" with him,10.8 10.8 A phrase from Analects IV, xvii, `When we see men of worth, we should think equalling them." and enfeoffed [T'ang] Tsunb as the Marquis Equalizing Culture. 12b At this time, Chang Pac from Nan Commandery, Yang Mu and Wang K'uang1b from Chiang-hsia 403WANG MANG, Ti-huang I, II 99 C: 10b, 11a [Commandery], and others arose in the Lu-lin A.D. 20/21 Bandit Armies Arise [Mountains] of YÃ¼n-tu [County] and called themselves Troops from the Lower Yangtze [Region]. Their bands were all of more than ten thousand men. In the Chung-shui District of Wu-kung [County10.9 10.9 According to HS 28 Ai: 33b, Chung-shui District was in Mei-yang County. But the text of ch. 99 reads "Chung-shui District of Wu-kung." There were reasons that Wu-kung should have been enlarged. It bordered upon Mei-yang; in A.D. 6 it had produced a white stone portent, advising Wang Mang to take the throne. It had consequently been made the private estate of Wang Mang, and its name was changed to Han-kuang (the Han [dynasty's] brilliance); cf. 99 A: 26a. Under such circumstances it would naturally have been enlarged. Wang Mang later changed its name to Hsin-kuang (the Hsin [Dynasty's] brilliance), but probably kept the enlarged boundaries. Pan Ku is naming it, not by its name at the time of this incident, but, for clearness' sake, by its previous (and later) name. ] Portents three houses of the common people fell [in a subsidence of the earth and] became a pool. In the second year, the first month, because the II Provincial Shepherds had been given the rank of the A.D. 21 three highest ministers,10.10 10.10 Cf. 99 B: 24a. and so had become remiss January in inspecting and recommending [concerning matters Provincial Inspectors Established in their provinces], Shepherds' Superintendents and Associate [Shepherds] were established in addition [to the Shepherds], with the rank of First Officers, who were to wear the Bonnet of the Law and whose duties were to be like those of the Han [dynasty's] Inspectors. In this month, [Wang] Mang's wife died. Her Wang Mang's Wife Dies posthumous name was the Filial and Harmonius Empress. She was buried west of the Ch'ang-shou Park at the Wei Tomb. It was ordered that she should forever attend upon the [Empress Dowager] the Mother of Culture [nee Wang]. The name of her tomb was called Yi-nien (a hundred thousand years). Previously, because [Wang] Mang had more than once killed her sons, [Wang] Mang's wife had wept 11a until she lost her sight, [so Wang] Mang had ordered 404WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, i A.D. 21, Jan. Wang Lin's Plot and Execution his Heir-apparent, [Wang] Lin1a, to live at the palace 99 C: 11a and care for her. An attendant to [Wang] Mang's wife was [named] YÃ¼an-pi. [Wang] Mang had favored her and later [Wang] Lin1a also had relations with her. They were afraid that the matter would leak out, so plotted that they would together kill [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Lin1a's wife, [Liu] Yin3, was the daughter of the State Master and Duke [Honoring the Hsin 10b Dynasty, Liu Hsin1a]. She knew how to interpret the stars.11.1 11.1 Chou Shou-ch'ang points out that wei here has the meaning of , and parallel passages from HHS, Mem. 32: 18b8 and 33: 16b9. She told [Wang] Lin1a that soon there would be a meeting of [people wearing] plain clothes in the palace.11.2 11.2 Chou Shou-ch'ang explains that in Han times the garments of those who did not have official position were called po-yi (plain clothes), which phrase is found in HHS, Mem. 42: 10a11. He states that Wang Lin1a was delighted because he thought "plain clothes" meant mourning clothes, i.e., mourning for Wang Mang, not knowing that it really meant that the common people would congregate in the palaces, an of the turmoil when Wang Mang would be defeated. Chin-shu, 12: 3a, declares that there is a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, or of Saturn and Venus, there will be a meeting of people in plain clothes. There was a conjunction of Saturn and Venus on the evening of Feb. 13, A.D. 21. [Wang] Lin1a rejoiced, thinking that what he had planned would soon be achieved. 13a Later he was degraded to be the T'ung-yi-yang King and went out [of the palace] to his residence outside. He was [then] all the more apprehensive. It happened that when [Wang] Mang's wife became seriously ill, [Wang] Lin1a sent her a letter which said, "The Emperor has been extremely severe with his descendants. Previously when his sons, [Wang YÃ¼] Chang-sun and [Wang Huob] Chung-sun, were each in their thirtieth [year], they were [put to] death. Now your servant Lin1a has in turn come upon his thirtieth [year, and so I] truly fear that if some morning I am no [longer] protected by you, the Empress,11.3 11.3 Li Ch'i glosses, "Chung-shih [refers to Wang] Lin1a's mother." Yen declares he is mistaken, but Chou Shou-ch'ang replies that Li Ch'i is correct, saying that in Wang Mang's time the female members of the imperial family were called shih instead of kung as previously. Before the time of Wang Mang, the Empress was called the Inner Palace (chung-kung; cf. Glossary sub voce); here she is called the chung-shih, which has the same meaning as the former chung-kung. I shall not know whether I shall die 405WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, i 99 C: 11a, b or live." A.D. 21, Jan. [When Wang] Mang was waiting upon his wife in her illness, he saw this letter and became greatly incensed, suspecting that [Wang] Lin1a had some evil purpose. [Consequently Wang Mang] did not permit [Wang Lin1a] to join in the mourning ceremonies. After [Wang Mang's wife] had been buried, [Wang Mang] had YÃ¼an-pi and others arrested. They were examined and questioned, and they confessed everything about the adultery and the plans for [Wang Mang's] murder. [Wang] Mang wanted to have it kept secret, so sent to kill the commissioner [who had charge of] the case, who was an Attendant Officer of a Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], and had him buried in the jail, so that his family did not know where he was. 11b [Wang Mang] granted poison to [Wang] Lin1a, but [Wang] Lin1a was unwilling to drink it, so he stabbed himself and died. [Wang Mang] had the Palace Attendant, the General of Agile Cavalry and the Marquis of Like Delight, [Wang] Lin2, grant the ghost garments and the Kingly seal and apron [for the deceased].11.4 11.4 Shuo-wen 8 A: 9b, sub jung , defines it as "ghost garments (kuei-yi )"; YÃ¼-p'ien 28: 3a (by Ku Yeh-wang, 519-581) defines hsÃ¼eh as ghost garments (kuei-yi)." (Shen Ch'in-han declares that kuei should probably be hun , the word in the text here.) Chou-li 21: 9a, sub the Szu-fu (Biot, II, 12) states that at a grand mourning ceremony [for kings], the Szu-fu provides "the garments for making offerings ," and Cheng HsÃ¼an glosses, "The garments for making offerings are the present ghost garments (hun-yi), [which are put] upon the seat [prepared for the ghost of the deceased when sacrifices are made to him]." Ibid. 21: 9b, 10a, sub the Shou-t'iao, (Biot, II, 14) says, "Those garments that remain are stored away. When they are about to offer sacrifices, for each [ancestor], his garments are given to the representative of the deceased." Cheng HsÃ¼an glosses, "The garments that remain are those left over from the final enshrouding [of the deceased]." Thus the "ghost garments" were those used for enshrouding the corpses of kings, together with those remaining over after the enshrouding, which were preserved and later used by the representatives of the deceased at sacrifices made to him. (References from Shen Ch'in-han.) 406WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, i A.D. 21, Jan. [Wang Mang's] funeral eulogy11.5 11.5 The ts'e-shu was a special imperial document used at the appointment and death of vassal kings and the three highest ministers and at the dismissal of highest ministers for crime. At the death of vassal kings or of highest ministers in office, such a document contained a funeral eulogy and granted them a posthumous name. Special stationary, composed of tablets alternately two feet long (18 in. Eng. meas.) and one foot long, were used. (From Ts'ai Yung's Tu-tuan, quoted by E. Chavannes in "Les chinois avant le papier," Journal Asiatique, ser. X, vol. 5, 1905, pp. 24-25). Ying Shao, in a note translated on HFHD I, 318, n. 5.7, also mentions these documents. In that note I mistakenly followed Ch'ien Ta-hsin in denying the meaning of "funeral eulogy" to ts'e. It means "charter of appointment," "funeral eulogy," or "dismissal notice." The inclusion of the highest ministers with the vassal kings is probably a Later practise. It is not mentioned in HS 5: 5b, 6a. [for Wang Lin1a] 99 C: 11b said, "[According to] the writing in the mandate [of Heaven given through] portents, [Wang] Lin1a should have been set up as the T'ung-yi-yang King. This [phrase] means that 36,000 years after the House of Hsin had taken the throne, one who is a 13b descendant of [Wang] Lin1a is then due to rise up as the dragon sun.11.6 11.6 A reference to Tso-chuan, Dk. Wen, IV, (Legge, p. 23814, 239b) "The Son of being the sun (yang)." This phrase probably explains the meaning of yang in the peculiar title given Wang Lin1a; yang = t'ai-yang = the sun = the emperor. "Previously, when I erroneously listened to those who discussed [this matter] and made [Wang] Lin1a my Heir-apparent, there was the grievous vicissitude of a violent wind, so I immediately obeyed the mandate [from Heaven given by] portents and set him up as the T'ung-yi-yang King. Previous to this 11a [time] and after this [time], he did not act [in accordance with] sincerity and obedience and so did not receive any assistance from this [title], and at an untimely age his life was destroyed. Alas! How sad! [According to] his deeds and acts, I grant him a posthumous name; his posthumous name shall be King Miu (erring)." 407WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, i 99 C: 11b, 12a There was also an imperial edict to the State A.D. 21, Jan. Master and Duke, [Liu Hsin1a, to the effect that Wang] Lin1a did not originally understand the stars; Wang Mang's Last Legitimate Son Dies. the matter arose from [Liu] Yin3, [so Liu] Yin3 also committed suicide. In this month, the Hsin-hsien King, [Wang] An1a, died of an illness. Previously, [when Wang] Mang had been [a mere] marquis and had gone to his state, he had favored 5-2 B.C.11.7 11.7 Cf. 99 A: 3b. [some] attendants, Tseng-chih, Huai-neng, and K'ai-ming. Huai-neng had given birth to a boy, [Wang] His Children By Concubines Hsingb; Tseng-chih had given birth to a boy, [Wang] K'uang1c, and a girl, [Wang] Yeh6; and K'ai-ming had given birth to a girl, [Wang] Chieh6. All had been detained at [Wang Mang's] state at Hsin-tuc, for the reason that he did not want to make it known [that he had had relations with any women besides his wife]. When moreover [Wang] An1a had become seriously ill, [Wang] Mang was himself pained that he 12a would have no sons [remaining, so] he wrote a memorial for [Wang] An1a and had him send it to the throne. It said, "Although the mothers of [Wang] Hsingb and the others are humble in status, yet in their relationship [to you, my father, these young people] are still your Imperial Sons and Daughters, and so should not be discarded." The document was shown to the various highest ministers and they all said that [Wang] An1a was "fraternally loving to his [half]-brothers and sisters,"12.1 12.1 A quotation from Book of History V, xxi, 1 (Legge, p. 535). In Han times, the term frequently used for a younger sister was nÃ¼-ti , so that ti could stand for both brothers and sisters. so that it would be 14a proper, when the spring or summer arrived, to give them enfeoffments and noble titles. Thereupon kingly chariots were sent with commissioners to go and bring [Wang] Hsingb and the others [to the 408WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, i A.D. 21, Jan. court. Wang] Hsingb was enfeoffed as the Duke of 99 C: 12a Cultivated Merits, [Wang] K'uanglc as Duke of Established Merits, [Wang] Yeh6 as Baroness of Cultivated Concord, and [Wang] Chieh6 as Baroness of Attained Concord. Four Funerals in One Month [Wang Mang's] grandson, the Duke of Brilliant Merits,12.2 12.2 The first should be , to accord with the name of this dukedom. [Wang] Shou, became ill and died, so that within a full month [Wang Mang] had four funerals.12.3 12.3 Wang Mang's wife, his sons, Linla and Anla, and Wang Shou. [Wang] Mang destroyed the Temples of [Emperors] Hsiao-wu and Hsiao-chao of the Han [dynasty] and buried his sons and grandsons separately among these [temples]. Li Yen's Rebellion Li Yen, the Grand Governor of Wei-ch'eng [Commandery], had plotted with a diviner, Wang K'uang4b. [Wang] K'uang4b had said to [Li] Yen, "Since the time that the House of Hsin took the throne, the cultivated fields and slaves of the common 11b people were not allowed to be bought or sold, the cash and currencies have been changed several times, there have been numerous levies [of troops] and collections [of supplies], the armies have caused disturbances, the barbarians of the four [quarters] have simultaneously invaded, the people have cherished hatred [for Wang Mang], and thieves and robbers have simultaneously arisen [in various localities, so that] the Han dynasty is due to be restored. Your surname, sir, is Li. Li [rimes with] chih and [the note] chih is [equated with] fire.12.4 12.4 The Official ed. correctly emends to . Li had the archaic and the T'ang pronunciations *li?g, lji, while chih had the pronunciations *t?ig, ti; cf. Karlgren, Grammata Serica, #980a, 891a. Chih was the name of the fourth musical note. The Feng-su-t'ung (by Ying Shao, ca. 140-206), 6: , says, "I have carefully examined that Liu Hsinla's Book of Bells and Musical Pipes [says], `Chih is a blessing (chih ). When things become large and numerous, it is a blessing (chih). [Among] the five powers or elements, [chih] is [equated with] fire; [among] the five social usages, it is [equated with] the rules of proper conduct (li); [and among] the five actions it is [equated with] looking. As a whole it is concerned "with [state] affairs." ' " The last phrase is a quotation from Li-chi XVII, I, 5 (Legge, II, 94; Couvreur, II, 48). You are due to become a coadjutor to the Han [Dynasty]." 409WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 12a, b Hence [Wang K'uang4b] composed a book of revela- A.D. 21 tions for [Li] Yen. It said, "Emperor Wen has become indignant and is dwelling on the earth below where he is urging on armies: To the north, he has instructed the Huns and, to the south, he has instructed the people of YÃ¼eh [to attack]. In the center of the Yangtze [region], Liu Hsin4g will sieze his enemy, [Wang Mang], revenge [the Han dynasty], and restore and continue the ancient [line; in] the fourth year he is due to set his army in motion. Among the rivers and lakes there will be a robber 12b 14b who will call himself a tributary king [of the Han dynasty], his family name will be Liu. Ten thousand men will form ranks and will not accept an ordinance of amnesty, [because they] intend to disturb [the region comprising the former feudal state of] Ch'in and [the region of] Lo-yang. By the eleventh year, they are due to attack. When Venus scatters its light and Jupiter enters [the constellation] Tung-ching, [Liu Hsin4g's] commands are due to be obeyed." He also told of the good and evil fortunes of [Wang] Mang's great ministers, that each had his fated date. Altogether [the writing comprised] more than a hundred thousand words. [Li] Yen ordered a minor official to write out this book, [but] the official fled and gave information of it, [so Wang] Mang sent a commissioner immediately to arrest [Li] Yen [and his confederates], imprison them, and punish them. They all died. Robbers and bandits made trouble and arose in the three capital commanderies,12.5 12.5 Cf. p. 364. "Three capital commanderies" is here an anachronism, for Wang Mang established six such commanderies. But this was a set phrase for the region about Ch'ang-an and probably continued to be used, in spite of the change in their number. [so Wang Mang] 410WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 established the office of the Chief Commandant 99 C: 12b Siezing Robbers and ordered the Upholders of the Laws and the Internuncios to pursue and attack [the robbers] within Ch'ang-an. He established the banner for "beating the drum and attacking" thieves,12.6 12.6 A quotation from Analects XI, xvi, 2. with a commissioner following after it. He sent Ching Shang, the Second Brother Hsi to the Grand Master, and Wang Tang, the Commissioner Over the Army to the General of a New Beginning, with troops, to attack [the rebels] in Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ [Provinces, sent] Ts'ao Fang, the Second Brother Ho to the State Master, to assist Kuo Hsing in attacking Kou-t'ing, and had the 12a empire's grain and currency transported to Hsi-ho, Wu-yÃ¼an, So-fang, and YÃ¼-yang commanderies, to each by the millions [of cash worth], with the intention of attacking the Huns. Autumn In the autumn, a fall of frost killed the beans. There was a great famine and [a plague of] locusts 15a east of [Han-ku] Pass. Counterfeiters Sentenced to the Mint When the common people violated [the law against] casting cash, the people of five neighboring families were sentenced together, [their property] was confiscated by [the government], and they were made government slaves and slave-women, their men [went with] carts having cages and the children and women [went] on foot. They had iron locks and chains on [the rings about] their necks.12.7 12.7 Shuo-wen, 14 A: 4a, says, "A lang-tang is a so (chain or lock) ." Yes Shih ku says it is "a long chain (so)." But Wang Nien-sun points out that the lang-tang is here used as a verb. He thinks the so should be omitted, but Wang Hsien-ch'ien replies that the so is necessary. T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 644: 5a quotes this passage with the so; the Liu-tieh, the part by Po ChÃ¼-yi (772-846), 45: 22b, quotes it without the . Where this passage is repeated in HS 24 B: 26b, so is used without the lang-tang. commonly wore iron collars in token of servitude. Cf. HFHD, I, 122, and n. 3. convicts were chained to the prison carts they dragged. [Such 411WANG, MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 12b, 13a persons] were transported to the Office for Coinage A.D. 21, Autumn by the hundred thousands. When they arrived, 13a their husbands or wives were changed, and six or seven-tenths of them died of grief and suffering. When Sun Hsi,13.1 13.1 Chou Shou-ch'ang remarks that the Sung editions read hsi1 for hsi2 . The Official ed. 99 C: 12a accordingly reads hsi1. But the Ching-yu ed. (1035), p. 15a, the HS P'ing-lin, (1581) p. 15a, the Chi-ku-ko ed. (1642), p. 9b, and HS 99 C: 4b all write hsi2. Ching Shang, Ts'ao Fang, and Bandits Attacked the others attacked the robbers, they could not vanquish them. Their armies were allowed to do as they pleased, so that the people were doubly distressed. Since Wang K'uang4b's revelation had said that [the Han dynasty] is due to revive [in the region of the former state of] Ch'u in [YÃ¼'s province of] Ching, and that a Mr. Li would be the coadjutor [who brought about this revival,13.2 13.2 This prophecy seems to have become widespread; it is mentioned in HHS, An. 1 A: 2b5.6 and Mem. 5: 1b1. Wang] Mang wanted to repress [this belief], so installed the Palace Attendant and Grandee in Charge of Pasturing [Sacrificial Animals], Li Shen, as Generalissimo and Shepherd of Yang Province, granted him the given name Sheng (sage), and sent him, leading troops, to attack [the bandits] with all his energy. Ch'u Hsia, [a man] of Shang-ku [Commandery], in person begged [Wang Mang] that he wanted to persuade Kua-t'ien Yi [to surrender, so Wang] Mang made him a Gentleman-of-the-Household, and sent him to get [Kua-t'ien] Yi to leave [his banditry. Kua-t'ien] Yi wrote that he surrendered, but before he left [his banditry], he died. [Wang] Mang asked for his corpse, buried it, and built for him a grave-mound and a sacrificial temple, with the posthumous name, Baron Shang of Kua-ning. He hoped thereby 15b to induce the other [bandits] to come [and surrender]. But none were willing to surrender.13.3 13.3 Possibly they suspected that Kua-t'ien Yi had been done to death. In the intercalary month, on [the day] ping-ch'en, Oct. 22 412WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 a general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. 99 C: 13a, b 12b The heavy mouring of the empire [for Wang Mang's wife was done away with] and those common people who had been mourning for their own [relatives] previous to this written imperial edict were also freed [from their mourning]. A Second Marriage Ordered A Gentleman, Yang-ch'eng Hsiu, presented a mandate [from Heaven by] a portent saying, "In succession to [Wang Mang's wife] a mother should be set up for the people, [i.e., an Empress]." He also said, "Because the Yellow Lord had 120 women, he became 13b a supernatural immortal." [Wang] Mang hence sent Palace Grandees Without Specified Appointments and Internuncios, forty-five of each, by divisions, to inspect the empire and select widely from [families] that were esteemed highly in their native villages, who had "virtuous young ladies,"13.4 13.4 A phrase from Book of Odes, I, i, 1 (Legge p. 1). and send up their names [to the throne]. The Han Spirits Attacked [Wang] Mang dreamed that five of the bronze [statues of] men in the Ch'ang-lo Palace arose and stood up. [Wang] Mang hated it, and reflected that in the inscription on the bronze [statues of] men, there were the words, "The August Emperor has first taken possession of the whole world." [Wang Mang] immediately sent workmen from the Master of Recipes to chisel out and destroy the writing on the breasts of the bronze [statues of] the men, about whom he had dreamt.13.5 13.5 These bronze statues had been cast in 221 B.C. by the First Emperor of the Dynasty; the inscription was his. In Han times they were set at the gate of the Ch'ang- Palace. For an account of these statues and their history, cf. Mh II, 134, n. 1. Shiratori, in Memoirs of the Toyo Bunko, no. 5 (1930), pp. 39-44, also has an account them, which must however be used with caution. He was also excited against the supernatural spirits in the Han [dynasty's] Temple to [Emperor] Kao,13.6 13.6 Probably because of the incident of the mad woman recounted in 99 B: . (Suggested by Chou Shou-ch'ang.) 413WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 13b, 14a and sent [Gentlemen] As Rapid as Tigers and Men of A.D. 21 War to enter the Temple of [Emperor] Kao, draw their swords, throw and strike in all directions, destroy its doors and windows with axes, whip the walls of the building with ochre-red whips13.7 13.7 The last clause is chiastic. The peach is supposed to have the property of expelling demons. Ochre-red is the color of condemned criminals' clothes. On the apotropaic use of peach-wood and its extract, cf. App. III, ad finem. and sprinkle them with peach-water. He ordered a Chief Commandant 16a of Light Chariots to dwell in its midst and also ordered the [Colonel of] the Northern Encampment of the Capital Army13.8 13.8 Wang Hsien-ch'en declares that chung and po have been interchanged here. Yen Shih-ku's note speaks of the "Northern Army." HS 19 A: 22b says that the Colonel of the Capital Encampment (Chung-lei Hsiao-wei ) had charge of the gates and the walls of the Northern Army's [Po-chÃ¼n () lei] encampment; cf. Glossary sub voce. But this same phrase Chung-chÃ¼n po-lei appears again on 99 C: 19a, where it can hardly be interpreted as referring to the Colonel of the Capital Encampment; it is quite possible that Wang Mang changed the name of the Northern Army to the Northern Encampment of the Capital Army, a quite logical name, and Yen Shih-ku refers to it by its previous , the Northern Army. This interpretation is confirmed by the phrase "the Capital Chung-chÃ¼n" in 99 C: 23a. The term "Northern Army" is however used on 99 C: ; but that may merely be an anachronism. I do not therefore emend the text. to dwell in the funerary chamber of [Emperor] Kao. Someone said, "At the time of the Yellow Lord, The Flowery Baldachin Chariot he established the flowery baldachin in order that he might mount up [to become] an immortal." So [Wang] Mang had made a flowery baldachin in nine layers, eighty-one feet tall, with a golden claw-tip 14a and feather covering, and had it borne by a carriage with a hidden mechanism and four wheels14.1 14.1 Fu Ch'ien explains, "The baldachin was 80 feet tall and on the shaft all [nine covers] pivot hinges, so that they could be raised and lowered, bent and straightened." Evidently it was an umbrella-like arrangement. Yen Shih-ku adds, "It says that the was hidden and from outside people could not see it." Bishop White mentions umbrella-like canopy top in the Han tombs at Lo-yang. Cf. his Tombs of Old Lo-yang, p. 37. Such umbrella tops are pictured on Han chariots in the Han grave sculptures. yoked 13a to six horses and three hundred strong men with yellow clothes and [red] turbans.14.2 14.2 Wang Nien-sun declares that the word has dropped out before the , making it read, "Red turbans." T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan, 772: 9a, quoting this passage, says, "Wang Mang invented a chariot with four wheels drawn by 6 horses and 300 strong men with yellow garments and red turbans and yokes," and the HHS, Tr. 30: 11b, says, "Military officers regularly [wear] red turbans to make them awe-inspiring." Chu Yi-hsin (18461894) replies, "[Wang] Mang despised the Han [dynasty's] practises; I fear that he did not use red turbans. The [T'ai-p'ing] YÃ¼-lan is insufficient evidence [for Wang Mang's usages]. The HHS Treatises moreover [contain] the Han dynasty's ." Nevertheless Wang Mang continued the use of red for his Gentlemen and retinue (99 C: 8b), so that the T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan's quotation is probably correct. On the carriage 414WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 there was a man beating a drum. Those who pulled 99 C: 14a it all called out, "He will mount up to be an immortal." When [Wang] Mang went out, he ordered [this carriage] to go before him. The many officials [however] said secretly, "This is like a funeral cart, not a thing for an immortal."14.3 14.3 In a note to Chou-li 15: 12a (Biot, I, 349, n. 4), sub the Sui-shih, Cheng HsÃ¼an says, "The funeral cart . . . has four wheels. It hugs the ground when it moves," and Kung-yen adds, "It is a cart with solid wheels [used as a hearse], which has two that pass through four wheels." Shen Ch'in-han explains, "This [carriage of Wang Mang's] also had four wheels, hence they said it was like a funeral cart." The magical means Wang Mang used to make himself an immortal are recounted is HS 25 B: 22b-23b. Bandits Increase In this year, the band of Ch'in Feng in Nan Commandery [numbered] almost ten thousand persons. Ch'ih Chao-p'ing, a woman of P'ing-yÃ¼an [Commandery], was capable at explaining the Classic on the Playing Blocks,14.4 14.4 Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) glosses, "The Classic on the [Wei-ch'i] Playing (po-yi-ching ), which used eight sticks to throw." The present text reads ching-po, but Wang Nien-sun infers from the above gloss that Fu Ch'ien's text read po-ching, and suggests emending accordingly. Then the word yi was probably an interpolation in the gloss. Po-yi is mentioned in Analects XVII, xxii, whence this interpolation have come. Po (translated, "playing blocks") was an ancient game analogous to dice. Six sticks and twelve blocks were employed, half of them by each player. This variety of the seems to have used eight blocks. The classical accounts of this game (which is not clearly understood) are to be found in the notes to HS 64 A: 14a and HHS, Mem. 24: 9b. The Roman astragalen seems to have been a similar game; cf. H. BlÃ¼mner, Die Romischen PrivataltertÃ¼mer, "Handbuch d. Klassische Altertums-Wissenschaft," 4 Bd., 2 Abteil, 2. Teil, 1911, pp. 412-419. using eight [blocks] to a throw. She also collected several thousand men in the difficult 415WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 14a, b places of the [lower reaches of the Yellow] River. A.D. 21 [Wang] Mang summoned and questioned his various courtiers about stratagems for capturing the bandits, and [the courtiers] all said, "These [people] are Heaven's [condemned] criminals and walking corpses. Their lives will [last] only an instant." The former General of the Left, Kung-sun Lu, was 16b summoned to come and participate in the deliberations. Biting Criticism of the Ministers [Kung-sun] Lu said, "The Chief Grand Astrologer, Tsung HsÃ¼an, has had charge of prognostications by the heavenly bodies, and of interpreting the mutations in the emanations [and weather]. He has called the baneful fortunate, has in a disorderly fashion [reported] the astrological [phenomena], and has misled the court. The Grand Tutor, the Marquis Equilizing Culture, [T'ang Tsunb], has covered [his faults] by false pretenses, so that he has been able to treat lightly [the duties of] his title and his position and `has done ill turns to other men's sons.'14.5 14.5 A quotation from Analects XI, xxiv, 2. The State Master, the Duke 14b Honoring the Hsin [Dynasty, Liu Hsin1a,] has overturned the five Classics, has done away with the traditions [about the classics handed down from generation to generation] by his teachers, and has caused his students to doubt and be misled.14.6 14.6 HS 27 Ba: 2b, 3a seems to explain this charge when it says that, concerning the doctrine of the five powers or elements, Hsia-hou Shih-ch'ang transmitted his explanation to Hsia-hou Sheng, he to HsÃ¼ Shang, and on to Liu Hsiang4, whose account was similar to that of his predecessors; but Liu Hsin1a's account was different. Thus Liu Hsin1a had changed the traditional explanation of portents, probably to favor Wang Mang, and is here criticized for having done so. An example of his interpretation is quoted in HS 27 Ba: 3b (trans. in W. Eberhard, BeitrÃ¤ge z. kosmolg. Spekulation Chinas, p. 22, par. 2) where it is declared to be incorrect. The Baron of Brilliant Scholarship, Chang2 Han, and the Marquis of Geographical Arrangements, Sun Yang, have instituted the ching [system] of cultivated fields, [thus] causing the common people to neglect their occupation [in cultivating] the earth. The 416WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 Hsi-and-Ho, Lu K'uang, has set up the six monopo- 99 C: 14b lies and has thereby impoverished the artisans and merchants. The Marquis Delighting in Portents, Ts'ui Fa, has truckled and flattered in order to curry your favor and has brought it about that the feelings of inferiors have not been communicated to the throne. It would be proper to execute these several 13b persons in order to calm the empire." He also said, "The Huns should not be attacked, but peace and an alliance by marriage ought to be made with them. Your subject fears that the [proper] cause for the House of Hsin's anxiety does not lie with the Huns, but lies within the borders." [Wang] Mang became incensed and had a [Gentleman] As Rapid as Tigers assist [Kung-sun] Lu to leave. Nevertheless [Wang Mang] adopted his ideas to a certain [extent]. He demoted Lu K'uang to be the Director of a Confederation at Wu-yÃ¼an [Commandery], because the people hated and maligned 17a him. [Although] the six monopolies had not been set up by [Lu] K'uang alone, [yet Wang] Mang [wanted to] satisfy the ideas of the crowd, so sent [Lu K'uang] out [of the court]. Bandit Extermination Ordered Previously, because the four quarters [of the country] had all [suffered from] famine and cold, [the people] were impoverished and troubled, and so had arisen and become thieves and robbers, until gradually crowds gathered. They constantly thought that if the harvest would be good,14.7 14.7 The Southern Academy ed. and the Official ed. p. 13b change to to to the usual writing of this word in the HS. The Ching-yu ed. however reads the former. they would be able to return to their native villages. Although their bands were numbered by the ten-thousands, [their leaders] only called themselves attendants upon great persons, Thrice Venerables, or Libationers. They did not presume to take or to possess cities 417WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 14b, 15a or towns and went about foraging and seeking for A.D. 21 merely what food they would use up daily. When various Chief Officials, Shepherds and Administrators all themselves fought with them in a disorderly manner, were wounded by weapons, and died, it was not because the bandits presumed to intend to kill them.14.8 14.8 This paragraph is very likely taken from the report of the Officer of the Commander-in-chief; cf. next paragraph. But [Wang] Mang to the end did not understand the purposes of these [bandits]. In this year, an Officer of the Commander-in-chief 15a was in YÃ¼ Province, examining [into what had been reported in] a document, and was captured by the bandits, [whereupon] the bandits escorted and sent him to the county-seat. When the Officer returned and memorialized [his report], he wrote out the whole circumstance. Wang] Mang became greatly incensed, and sent him to prison because he considered [that the man] was falsifying [the situation] to deceive [his superiors]. Thereupon he issued a message reproving the seven highest ministers, which said, "Verily, to be an official [means] to bring about order.15.1 15.1 Here Wang Mang is giving his own etymology for li (*li?g, lji, Karlgren, Gram. Ser. #975g) by a pun with li (also *li?g, lji, ibid., #978d). To diffuse virtue and make favors manifest in order to shepherd the common people is the principle of benevolence. To repress the strong, control the wicked, and arrest and execute thieves and robbers are components of justice. "Now however [the situation] has been otherwise. 17b 14a When thieves appeared, they were not immediately apprehended, so they were able to form cliques and intercept and kidnap Ruling Officers from [government] riding quadrigae. An Officer who succeeded in getting free from them moreover himself said senselessly, `I questioned and reprimanded the robbers, 418WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 [saying], "Why do you do this [robbing]?" and 99 C: 15a the robbers replied, "Merely because we are impoverished and in need." [Then] the robbers protected and sent me away. At present, vulgar people who discuss [banditry say that the bandits] for the most part are like these [ones].' "I reflect [that, when people], out of distress from famine or cold violate the laws and do evil, the greater ones become groups of thieves and the lesser ones steal [by making] holes [in people's walls]. There are no more than these two kinds. But now they have conspired together and joined to form gangs of thousands and hundreds. This is the greatest disobedience and rebellion; how could it be spoken of as [due to] famine or cold? "Let the seven highest ministers strictly order the High Ministers, Grandees, Directors of Confederations, Leaders of Combinations, and `the heads of offices'15.2 15.2 Cf. 99B: n. 23.1. carefully to shepherd the good common people and hurriedly arrest and exterminate the thieves and robbers. If there are any who do not, with one mind and with mutual assistance, hate and drive out the bandits, and, if they say unreasonably that [the bandits] have been caused by hunger or cold, they shall immediately be arrested and held in prison, and [the officials] shall beg [me to pass sentence upon] their crime." Unwise Policies Thereupon the numerous subordinates [of the ruler] feared all the more and none presumed to speak of the bandits' circumstances. They also were not permitted to mobilize troops unauthorizedly. Because of this, the bandits were not restrained. Only the Leader of a Combination at Yi-p'ing [Commandery], T'ien K'uang, had for some time 18a past dared to mobilize the common people who were in their eighteenth year and above, [to the number 419WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 15a, b of] more than forty thousand persons, had furnished A.D. 21 them arms from the arsenals, and had given them 15b engraved stones as [signs of their] convenant. The Red Eyebrows had heard of it and had not presumed to enter his borders. [T'ien] K'uang impeached himself in a memorial, and [Wang] Mang reprimanded [T'ien] K'uang: "You have not been granted a tiger credential,15.3 15.3 Cf. HFHD I, 245, &amp; n. 2. yet have unauthorizedly mobilized troops. This is playing with weapons. This crime is that of negligence in raising [troops].15.4 15.4 This passage is probably a quotation from Wang Mang's decree. For this crime, ef. HFHD, II, 392, n. 7.11. Because you, K'uang, have reproved yourself [and 14b have said that you would] certainly capture and destroy the robbers, you are [however] temporarily not to be punished." Later [T'ien] K'uang himself begged to go out of the boundaries [of his commandery] and attack the robbers, [saying that] those against whom he turned would all be routed. [Wang] Mang used a message [stamped] with the imperial seal to order [T'ien] K'uang to be put in charge of the affairs of the Shepherds in the two provinces of Ch'ing and HsÃ¼. [T'ien] K'uang [memorialized] the throne, saying, "Although when thieves and robbers first start out, in the beginning they are very unimportant, yet they cannot be captured by the divisional officers and [the organization of] people in groups of five.15.5 15.5 Hu San-hsing explains that by "divisional officials" were meant the officials of a commandery division who were in charge of bandits, such as the commandery Department Head for Bandits, the county Commandant, and the Chiefs of Districts and Communes. The fault lies [in the fact that] the Chief Officials [of counties] do not give it a thought. The counties deceive the commanderies, and the commanderies deceive the [imperial] court. When in reality there are a hundred [robbers], they say ten; and when in reality there are a thousand, they say a hundred. 420WANG MANG, Ti-huang II A.D. 21 Then the court is negligent and does not immediately 99 C: 15b, supervise and punish15.6 15.6 Tu-tsÃª , "supervising [the acts of one's subordinates] and punishing [their delinquencies]" was a technical term from the Legalist School; cf. D. Bodde, First Unifier, p. 38 &amp; n. 3, 205-6. While I agree with his interpretation, I prefer "punishing" instead of "holding responsible" as a translation of tsÃª. Szu-ma Cheng, in a note to SC 87: 28, interpets tsÃª as ", punishing them by the [statutory] punishments." [the bandits], so that they even spread over adjoining provinces. "When moreover generals and lieutenants are sent, and many commissioners are sent out continuously to supervise and urge each other on, [the officials of] the commanderies and counties serve their superior 18b officials energetically, in answering and excusing themselves, in replying to questions, in offering wine and food, and in furnishing necessaries, in order to save themselves from being sentenced and beheaded, and so do not have [the time] again to think of the thieves or robbers or to perform their official business. The generals and lieutenants moreover are not able in person to lead their officers and soldiers, and so, when a battle [is fought, their troops] are routed by the bandits, their officers gradually [become] dispirited, and [the expedition] is merely an expense upon the people. "When previously [the bandits] fortunately received an order of amnesty and the bandits wanted to disband and scatter, some [of them] on the contrary were prevented [from returning home] and were attacked, so from fear they entered the mountains and valleys, and in turn told the others [about 16a it]. Hence the bandits in the commanderies and counties who had surrendered all changed [their attitudes] and became terrified, fearing that they would be destroyed by trickery. Because of the famine, they were easily moved, and within ten days there were again more than a hundred thousand men [in the bandit troops]. The foregoing is the reason 421WANG MANG, Ti-huang II 99 C: 16a that the thieves and robbers are so numerous. A.D. 21 "At present, east of Lo-yang, grain is two thousand 15a [cash per] picul. Your humble servant has seen a written imperial edict that it is intended to send the Grand Master, [Wang K'uang1a], and the General of a New Beginning, [Lien Tan, to attack the bandits]. They are important courtiers who are your military assistants. If their crowds of followers are multiplied, [these followers] will become exhausted [from lack of food] on the way; whereas if [their followers are] reduced [in number, these ministers] will have no way of overawing the distant quarters [of the empire]. "It would be proper to select promptly Shepherds and Governors or those [ranking] below them, make plain the rewards and punishments that they [can deal out], and [have them] collect together those people from scattered villages and small states [of nobles] that have no city walls, transport their old and weak [persons], putting them inside the large cities, [then] collect and store foodstuffs and mutually 19a assist in firmly guarding [these centers]. When the bandits come to attack the cities, they will then be unable to take them and [the places] by which they pass will have no food, so that their circumstances will not permit them to collect in bands. Under such [a situation], when they are summoned, they will certainly surrender, and when they are attacked, they will be annihilated. "If now generals and lieutenants are vainly sent out in numbers, the commanderies and counties will suffer from them more severely than from the bandits. It would be proper to summon back all the commissioners in riding quadrigae in order to give rest to the commanderies and counties, and entrust to your servant K'uang the thieves and robbers of [these] two provinces, for I will certainly tranquillize them." [Wang] Mang feared and dreaded [T'ien] K'uang, so secretly sent a substitute for him, and [also] sent a 422WANG MANG, Ti-huang II, III A.D. 21/22 commissioner to grant [T'ien] K'uang a message with 99 C: 16a, b the imperial seal. When the commissioner arrived and had audience with [T'ien] K'uang, he thereupon ordered the substitute to superintend [T'ien K'uang's] troops. [T'ien] K'uang followed the commissioner westwards. When he reached [the court], he was installed as the Metropolis Commandant Grandee. When [T'ien] K'uang had left, the region of [the former feudal state of] Ch'i was thereupon lost [to the bandits]. III In the third year, the first month, the roofing of A.D. 22 the Nine [Ancestral] Temples was completed and the The Hsin Ancestral Temples Dedicated spirit tablets were installed. [When Wang] Mang [went] to be presented [to the divinities there, he rode] in the grand carriage of state,16.1 16.1 For a description of the grand carriage of state, cf. HHS, Tr. 29: 11a-12b. to which were yoked six horses, [on which] were robes with dragon stripes made of vari-colored feathers, to which were affixed three-foot long horns. The carriage with a flowery baldachin and "ten large war chariots"16.2 16.2 A line from Book of Odes #177, (Legge, II, iii, iii, 4, p. 283.) 16b went before him. Thereupon he granted to the Minister Over the Masses, [Wang HsÃ¼n3], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Yi5], who had built the temples, to each ten million [cash]. The Palace Attendants, Regular Palace Attendants, and 19b 15b those of lower [rank] were all enfeoffed. He enfeoffed the Chief Workman, Ch'iu Yen, as the Sub-Vassal of Han-tan Hamlet. Mar./Apr. In the third month,16.3 16.3 The text reads "second month," but this date may be mistaken, for in that month there were no days such as those mentioned in the edict, according to the calendars of P. Hoang and Ch'en YÃ¼an. Such days occurred only in the first and third months. Han-chi 30: 18b dates this fire in the intercalary [second?] month, but Hoang and Ch'en have no intercalary month in this year. The mention of the vernal equinox fixes the fire in March, but March 30 (julian) is much too late for the equinox (cf. n. 16.6). Possibly there was an intercalary second month in this year, instead of the preceding year, as Huang and Ch'en have it. there was a visitation [of fire] at the Pa [River] Bridge. Several thousand 423WANG MANG, Ti-huang III, iii 99 C: 16b people sprinkled water to save it, [but the fire was] A.D. 22, Apr. The Pa River Bridge Burns not [thereby] extinguished. [Wang] Mang hated it, so issued a message which said, "Verily, the three August Ones typify spring, the Five Lords typify summer, the three [dynasties of] Kings typify autumn, and the five Lords Protector typify winter. The virtues of the August Ones and the Kings followed [one another] in a cycle. The Lords Protector [including the Ch'in dynasty] succeeded [to the rule of the world in] the vacancy and continued in the gap [between the periods ruled by the elements wood and fire]16.4 16.4 According to Liu Hsiang's theory of the succession of the five powers, by virtue of which successive dynasties ruled, between the period dominated by the powers wood (T'ai-hao, K'u, the Chou dynasty) and fire (Shen-nung, Yao, the Han dynasty), there was an intercalary period, during which there were disorderly rulers (Kung-kung, Chih, the Ch'in rulers); cf. n. 24.1; Ku Chieh-kang, Ku-shih-pien V, 452, diagram B. in order to complete the [full] number in a cycle; hence their ways were disorderly. "Verily, in Ch'ang2-an most of the imperial highways have taken their names from recent [events].16.5 16.5 Shui-ching-chu 19: 16b states that the Pa River "was anciently called the Tzu River. When Duke Mu of Ch'in [ruled 659-621 B.C.] was the Lord Protector (Pa), he changed the name of the Tzu River to be the Pa River, in order to exhibit his glory as a Lord Protector." Recently in the third month,16.3 16.3 The text reads "second month," but this date may be mistaken, for in that month there were no days such as those mentioned in the edict, according to the calendars of P. Hoang and Ch'en YÃ¼an. Such days occurred only in the first and third months. Han-chi 30: 18b dates this fire in the intercalary [second?] month, but Hoang and Ch'en have no intercalary month in this year. The mention of the vernal equinox fixes the fire in March, but March 30 (julian) is much too late for the equinox (cf. n. 16.6). Possibly there was an intercalary second month in this year, instead of the preceding year, as Huang and Ch'en have it. in the night of [the day] kuei-szu and on the morning of [the day] Mar. 28 chia-wu, fire burnt the Pa [River] Bridge from the Mar. 29 eastern side going westwards. By the evening of [the day] chia-wu, the Bridge was completely destroyed Mar. 29 by the fire. When the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Yi5], went to inspect it, he examined and questioned [persons], and someone said that shivering people dwelt below the bridge, and he suspected that they warmed themselves by a fire, which became this visitation [of fire]. "The next day was [the day] yi-wei, which was the Mar. 30 day of the vernal equinox.16.6 16.6 The vernal equinox occurred at Ch'ang-an in the evening of March 22 (julian), eight days before this date. Wang Mang's astronomers would hardly be so much in error about such an event; Wang Mang probably post-dated the equinox for the sake of giving a favorable interpretation to the fire. [From the time that] 424WANG MANG, Ti-huang III, iii, iv A.D. 22, Apr. I received the mandate [of Heaven] through the line 99 C: 16b, 17a of succession transmitted from the gods my sage ancestors, the Yellow [Lord] and YÃ¼ [Shun], down to the fourth year of [the period] Ti-huang, it will be the fifteenth year. Exactly at the end of winter in the third year [of the period Ti-huang], the bridge 20a which is [named] Pa (`tyrannical' or `Lords Protector') and [therefore] disorderly has been broken and destroyed. [Heaven] thereby intends to prosper and perfect the way the House of Hsin is to be unified in control [of the country] and preserved for a long [time]. "This is also a warning [from Heaven in that the breaking of] this bridge has placed a gap in the highway to the eastern quarter [of the empire]. Now in the eastern quarter the harvest has been lacking, the common people are starving, and the highways and roads are impassible [because of bandits. The Chief of] the Eastern Sacred Peak and Grand Master, [Wang K'uang1a], shall promptly [make] regulations 17a for opening the various granaries in the eastern quarter and giving or lending to the distressed [people, in order] to apply the principle of benevolence.17.1 17.1 Prof. Duyvendak points out that "benevolence " here is opposed to "pa (tyrannical)" in the preceding paragraph. 16a Let the name of the Pa Lodge be changed to be the Ch'ang-ts'un (Long-preserved) Lodge, and let the Pa [River] Bridge become the Ch'ang-ts'un Bridge." In this month, the Red Eyebrows killed Ching Shang, the Second Brother Hsi to the Grand Master. East of the [Han-ku] Pass, people ate each other. Apr./May In the fourth month, [Wang Mang] sent the Grand Master, Wang K'uang1a, and the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, eastwards. When, outside the 425WANG MANG, Ti-huang III, iv 99 C: 17a Capital Gate, they were sacrificing to the gods of the A.D. 22, Apr./May An Expedition Against the Bandits roads, Heaven [sent] a great rain which dampened their clothes,17.2 17.2 The Official ed. has emended to ; the other editions read the former. It may be a mistake for . and the elders sighed and said, "This is because [Heaven] weeps for the army."17.3 17.3 T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 328: 7a quotes the Liu-t'ao (iv or v cent. B.C.; this passage is not in the present Liu-t'ao, but is quoted in its appendix of fragments, p. 15b) as saying, "When rain dampens their clothes, it means they will be favored [lit. wetted ] weapons; when it does not dampen them, it means that it weeps silently for the weapons." Ibid. 11: 1b, 2a quotes Ts'ao Ts'ao's (155-220) Ping-shu Chi-yao as saying, "When a Generalissimo marches and the rain wets his clothes and bonnet, this means that he will spatter his weapons [with the enemy's blood] and that his army will secure felicitations. . . . If when a Generalissimo first marches, it rains but lightly, not dampening his clothes or bonnet, this means that Heaven weeps silently and that this general will have a great misfortune and his soldiers will be defeated and lost." Shen Ch'in-han accordingly remarks that the prognostications in this "Memoir" are different from those in the books on military affairs. [Wang] Mang said, "Verily, the distresses of the nine dry years conjoined with disastrous emanations have come to a climax in the past years, when withering droughts, frosts, locusts, and famines came as previously, so that the people are miserably poor, and wander scattered along the roads. In this spring, [the calamity] is especially pitiable. I have been very much saddened by it. "Now I am sending [the Chief of] the Eastern [Sacred] Peak and Grand Master, [Wang K'uang1a], who is a Specially Advanced and the Marquis as Recompense to [the House of] Hsin, to open the various granaries in the eastern quarter and give or 20b lend to those in distress. On those highways along which the Grand Master and Highest Minister does not pass, he shall separately send a Grandee or Internuncio to open the granaries simultaneously, in other to preserve the great multitude. "The Grand Master and Highest Minister, [Wang K'uang1a], shall thereupon, with the Chief Envoy and Director of Mandates from the Five Majestic [Principles], 426WANG MANG, Ti-huang III A.D. 22 ranking as Commander-in-chief of the Right, 99 C: 17a, b the General of a New Beginning and Marquis of Equalization and Standards, Lien Tan,17.4 17.4 Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggests that the words "Lien Tan" should be transferred to come after the word hou (Marquis). According to 99 B: 29a, the General of a Peaceful Beginning (which title had been changed to General of a New Beginning, cf. 99 C: 4b) was in charge of the western provinces, not the east. The subject of the phrase "to and control the region of which he is in charge" must be "the Grand Master," who was in charge of the east (99 B: 2b, 29a). As a matter of fact, both these officials went this expedition (99 C: 17b). I accordingly transfer these two words, as does (p. 259). go to Yen Province, to pacify [the region] of which he, [the Grand Master], is in charge. Moreover those who formerly have been lawless and the bandits in Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ [Provinces] who have not yet completely 17b dispersed or have later again assembled shall all be purified. I hope that thereby the myriad people may be pacified." The Grand Master, [Wang K'uang1a, and the General] of a New Beginning, [Lien Tan], together led more than a hundred thousand ardent soldiers, and wherever they went they did as they liked, so that the eastern quarter said about them, "It would be better to meet the Red Eyebrows, And not to meet the Grand Master. The Grand Master can however [be endured], [But the General of] a New Beginning 16b would kill me." [Thus] it was eventually as T'ien K'uang had said. Famine Relief [Wang] Mang also sent out many Grandees and Internuncios by divisions to teach the common people to boil grasses and [parts of] trees to make a vegetable juice,17.5 17.5 In a note to HS 24 A: 21b, Fu Ch'ien says, "They boiled the fruits of trees. Someone says it was something like the present thistle cakes ." Ju Shun adds, "They made something like an almond drink (hsing-lo )." Yen Shih-ku approves Ju Shun's interpretation. Chou Shou-ch'ang however objects that these things are scarce, and adds, "It was probably like in the present famine years when the common people cut up [the leaves and bark] of elm trees and made a gruel and take the juice of millet stalks to make soup, etc." Prof. Duyvendak has called my attention to the importance of this passage for the meaning of lo , mentioning the occidental literature. Karlgren (Philology &amp; Ancient China, p. 138) states that lo had the archaic pronunciation glak, which he uses as evidence for an ancient Turkish (Hunnish) stem, arak- or rak-, denoting kumyss or its forerunner, an alcoholic drink made of fermented milk, for which stem there is also good evidence in many modern Turkish dialects. Karlgren derives the English word "arrack," the Japanese sake, and cognate words in other languages from this stem word. (Cf. also his discussion of lo in Deutsche Literaturzeitung, 47 [1926], 1960-1962.) The relationship of this ancient Turkish stem rak- to the Chinese archaic glak, the present lo, is however not one of simple derivation, as Karlgren recognizes. The word lo was used by the Chinese with a more generalized meaning, seemingly before they became acquainted with kumyss. In ancient China, lo denoted three different kinds of drinks: First, Li-chi VII, i, 9; XVIII, ii, ii, 38; &amp; XXI, ii, 5 (Legge, I, 369; II, 160, 222 [he twice mistranslates lo as "cream"]; Couvreur, I, 504; II, 176, 293; Karlgren admits the first of these chapters as written in the iv cent. B.C.) uses lo to denote some kind of a sour cereal drink, possibly a sour alcoholic drink or a vinegar (Karlgren, Grammata Serica, 766 p., defines it as "A kind of acid soy made of rice or millet," which statement may however be merely an over-literal translation of one Chinese glossator's description of a sour liquor). Lo is used with li , in the phrase li-lo, which phrase is most naturally interpreted as "sweet and sour liquors." The aforesaid is the most ancient literary use of the word lo, and was its original meaning in Chinese literature. Secondly, the word undoubtedly denoted kumyss or some similar drink. Karlgren states that lo came to be used with this meaning because of the similarity in its ancient pronunciation and its first meaning with the ancient Turkish word from the stem rak- (archaic Chinese had no initial r- with the ending -ak). In 104 B.C., Emperor Wu established the office of Mare Milker (T'ung-ma ; HS 19 A: 13a), whose function, according to Ying Shao and Ju Shun, was to prepare a kind of kumyss. Shuo-wen 12 A: 6a, sub t'ung, defines it as "" (lit. "grab and pull," easily understood as an attempt, in a language unfamiliar with herdsmen's vocabulary, to express the notion, "to milk"), and adds, "The Han [dynasty] had the office of Mare Milker, who made ma-chiu (, kumyss)." Possibly kumyss was introduced to the Chinese in the time of Emperor Wu, when intercourse with the Huns became more frequent. HS 22: 36b moreover quotes a memorial by K'ung Kuang and Ho Wu, dated 7 B.C., which mentions "seventy-two apprentices who furnish the Grand Provisioner with kumyss (t'ung-ma-chiu)," of whom seventy were dismissed (probably because kumyss was not a classical drink). This beverage, according to the glossators, was anciently made from goat's and cow's milk as well as mare's milk. The Shuo-wen does not list the word lo; it is however found in Shih-ming 4: 6b, ch. 13 (by Liu Hsi, ca. 200 A.D.), where it is interpreted as . The word lo is used with this meaning in the lament of Liu Hsi-chÃ¼n, the Chinese Princess who became the Wu-sun Queen (in HS 96 B: 4a; written between 110 and 104 B.C.) and in Li Ling's letter to Su Wu (in Wen-hsÃ¼an 41: 2a = G. Margoulies, Le Kou-wen chinois, p. 94; possibly written 81 or 80 B.C.; but its authenticity is debated). There are various ancient Chinese names for this beverage: in addition to lo, , ma-chiu, and t'ung-ma-chiu, there are ju -lo, lo-su , and ti-hu or (the last two names are found in a quotation from the T'ung-su-wen [by Fu Ch'ien, ca. 125-195] in TPYL 858: 1a [which chapter deals largely with kumyss and contains interesting quotations]). Of these names, the last, ti-hu (for which Karlgren, Gram. Ser., 590e &amp; 49l, gives the archaic pronunciation ti?r-g'o), seems a purely phonetic reproduction of a foreign name, for its component words in this phrase are otherwise meangingless. Thirdly, lo was used to denote a drink made from fruits, etc., such as the " drink (hsing-lo)" mentioned by Ju Shun in his gloss to the HS passage, and to denote gruel made from bark recommended by Wang Mang. On the above meanings, cf. the Tz'u-hai, sub lo. The P'ei-wen YÃ¼n-fu, sub lo and the other phrases mentioned here, contains many interesting quotations. Lo was originally the name of a sour fermented liquor; when the Chinese came to know kumyss (which the glossators mention specifically as being sour), the Chinese naturally applied the native word for a sour fermented liquor to it, calling it lo. They likewise called other similar fermented beverages, such as those made from apricots and from bark, etc. lo. Whether this ancient word, glak, can be used as evidence for an ancient word with a similar pronunciation, is however not by any means sure, since there was anciently a quite different word meaning kumyss, ti?r-g'o, which seems more likely to have been the phonetic reproduction of its foreign name. There is however also the possibility that the Chinese took their word for sour liquor, glak, from the ancient name for kumyss, but that hypothesis would push the Chinese knowledge of kumyss much farther back than the literary evidence carries us. (Cf. also A. Conrady, "Alte westÃ¶stliche KulturwÃ¶rter," in Berichte Ã¼. d. Verhandl. d. SÃ¤chs. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Leipzig, Phil.-hist. Kl., v. 77 (1925), H. 3, pp. 9-10; W. Eberhard, "ÃÃ­n de kimiz ve yo?urdum (Ueber die Herstellung von Kumys in China)" in ÃlkÃ¼, Nov. 1940 [in Turkish].) [but] the vegetable juice could not be eaten, and [the sending merely] made much trouble and expense. 427WANG MANG, Ti-huang III 99 C: 17b [Wang] Mang issued a message which said, "Verily, A.D. 22 the common people are miserably poor, so that although 428WANG MANG, Ti-huang III A.D. 22 A Monopoly Revoked the granaries have been universally opened to 99 C: 17b give relief to them, I fear that nevertheless it will not be sufficient. Let the interdiction on the mountains and marshes of the empire be temporarily lifted, 21a and let those who are able to take things from the mountains or marshes and [who do so] in accordance with the ordinances for [the various] months [of the year] be freely allowed to do so, and let them not be ordered to pay any taxes [for doing so]. In the A.D. 49 thirtieth year [of the period] Ti-huang, [the restrictions 429WANG MANG, Ti-huang III 99 C: 17b, 18a shall be reapplied] as formerly. This [year] will A.D. 22 be the sixth year of [the period] Wang-kuang-shang-mou.17.6 17.6 Meng K'ang states that this is "the name of [a year-period in] the calendar made by [Wang] Mang." Mou is equated with earth, the element by virtue of which Wang Mang declared he ruled. He had his Grand Astrologer prepare the titles of year-periods for 36,000 years, with one change of the year-period every six years (99 C: 4a), so that names had been invented for all these year-periods. Chavannes, Documents chinois dÃ©couverts par Aurel Stein, p. 128 ff, no. 592, lists a tablet in which the date A.D. 20 is written with the ten words, Hsin Shih-chien-kuo Ti-huang-shang-mou, first year ." He also lists tablets with the date for A.D. 14 written, Shih-chien-kuo T'ien-feng, first year (nos. 307, 482) and for A.D. 17, Shih-chien-kuo T'ien-feng, fourth year (nos. 368, 369). Li-hsÃ¼ 2: 1b (by Hung Kua, 1117-1184) lists a captain's bell with the date, "Hsin Shih-chien-kuo Ti-huang-shang-mou, second year." Yung-chai Sui-pi 6: 1a, b (by Hung Mai (1123-1202) says, "In the family of Han [Tien] Chuang-min [lived 815-893] there was a bronze tou [measure] with the inscription, `Hsin Shih-chiew-kuo T'ien-feng-shang-mou, sixth year.' In [the period] Shao-hsing [1131-1162], Kuo Ching-chou secured a bell with the inscription, `Hsin Shih-chien-kuo Ti-huang-shang-mou, second year.' " Lo Chen-yÃ¼'s Cheng-sung-t'ang Chi Ku-yi-wen 15: 2a lists a captain's bell with the inscription "a captain's bell , weighing six catties five taels, made in Hsin Shih-chien-kuo Ti-huang VI." Here is evidence that, in Wang Mang's time, "Hsin Shih-chien-kuo" or "Shih-chien-kuo" (i.e. "[the House of] Hsin [having for the] first [time] established its state") was prefixed to the two words distinguishing a year-period, and shang-mou, lit. "[the dynasty that] exalts [the stem] mou [i.e., the element earth]" was added at the end. Wang Mang began the sexagenary cycle with the term mou-tzu (99 B: 25b). The names of the reign-periods that are listed in the HS, T'ien-feng and Ti-huang, are then cursive forms of the full names found in these contemporary documents. "If powerful and unruly officials or common people have committed crime and monopolized the [mountains and marshes, so that] the uninfluential common people have not received [any advantages], this has not been my intention. Does not the Book of Changes say, `When the superior's [privileges] are lessened and the inferior's are increased, The common people are boundlessly delighted'?17.7 17.7 Book of Changes, App. I, ii, Hex. 42, 1 (Legge, p. 247; Wilhelm, II, 173.) The Book of History says that when speech is not 18a 430WANG MANG, Ti-huang III A.D. 22 practical, this means that there will not be order [in 99C: 18a the state].18.1 18.1 Wang Mang is alluding to Book of History V, iv, 6 "[The virtue of] speech is practicality" and "Practicality produces good government." (Reference from Yen Shih-ku.) Legge, pp. 326, 327 translated ts'ung as "accordance with [the Way]." But the K'ung An-kuo gloss is, "This then can be followed (k'o ts'ung)," with which Cheng HsÃ¼an and Ma Jung agree. K'ung Ying-ta explains, "The second [activity] is speech, of which [the important circumstance] is that it can be used [in practise] k'o ." [Shang- Chu-su 12: 4b.]) Alas, that you, various highest ministers, should fail to be solicitous [concerning these matters]!" An Expedition Against the Bandits in the Yangtze Valley At that time the Troops From the Lower Yangtze [Region] were powerful, and Chu Wei, [a man from] Hsin-shih, Ch'en Mu, [a man from] P'ing-lin, and others had all again collected bands and were attacking villages,18.2 18.2 Cf. HHS, An. 1 A: 3a; Glossary sub Kuang-wu, Emperor. so [Wang] Mang sent the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles] and Generalissimo, K'ung Jen, [to be in charge of] the division, YÃ¼ Province, and the Communicator and Generalissimo, Chuang Yu, and the Arranger of the Ancestral Temples and Generalissimo, Ch'en Mou, to attack [the rebels] in Ching Province. Each one was followed by more than a hundred officers and soldiers. They rode in boats down the Wei [River] 17a into the [Yellow] River to Hua-yin, then left [the 21b boats and took] riding quadrigae. When they reached their divisions, they solicited soldiers. [Chuang] Yu said to [Ch'en] Mou, "To send a general and not to give him the credentials [for levying] troops, so that he must first beg [the emperor] and then only can he make a move, is like tying up a Hanh black hunting-dog18.3 18.3 Yen Shih-ku explains that han-lu was "the name of a dog in the ancient state of Hanh. A black color is called lu." This breed of dog is also mentioned in K'ung Ts'ung-tzu, ch. 17, sect. 8; 5: 20b. and yet demanding it to catch [game]." Summer In the summer, there was [a plague of] locusts which came from the eastern quarter. In flying they 431WANG MANG, Ti-huang III 99 C: 18a, b covered the sky. They came to Ch'ang-an, entered A.D. 22, Summer Locusts in Ch'ang-an the Wei-yang Palace, and crawled in its Halls and Pavilions. [Wang] Mang sent out officials and common people and established bounties for those who seized and killed them. Because the empire's grain was expensive, [Wang] Futile Famine Relief Mang wanted to depress [its price].18.4 18.4 HHS, An. 1 A: 21a states that, towards the end of Wang Mang's reign, when there were drouths and plagues of locusts, a hu of grain cost one catty of actual gold. For the Great Granary he established a guard with joined lances and named them Supporters of the Smaller Gates to the Beginning of Public Authority.18.5 18.5 The establishment of this guard seems to indicate that there had been disturbances by hungry people outside the government granaries even at the imperial capital. The vagrant people who had entered the passes [of Kuan-chung numbered] several hundred thousand persons, so [Wang Mang] established an Office for Maintenance and Relief, to feed them. [But] the commissioners who supervised and had charge of [the matter], together with the minor officials, together stole their grain allowances, so that seven- or eighth-tenths of them died of hunger. Previous to this [time, Wang] Mang had sent a Wang Mang Deceived Palace Attendant Within the Yellow Gate, Wang Yeh5b, to have charge of buying at the Ch'ang-an markets, and he took things at a low price from the common people, so that the common people suffered severely from it. [Because Wang] Yeh5b had achieved the merit of having economized expenses, he had been granted the noble rank of Sub-Vassal. 18b [When Wang] Mang heard that in the city there was a famine, he asked [Wang] Yeh5b about it, and [Wang] Yeh5b replied, "These all are vagrants." Then he brought some millet mush with meat and thick meat and vegetable soup which were being sold at the market, and showed them to [Wang] Mang, saying, 22a "The food of all the resident commoners is like this," [and Wang] Mang believed him. 432WANG MANG, Ti-huang III A.D. 22, Winter Winter In the winter, So-lu Hui of Wu-yen and others 99 C: 18b raised troops and siezed their city.18.6 18.6 Yen Shih-ku explains fan3-ch'eng as "to sieze a city in order to [start] rebellion (fan3). It is also said that fan3 is pronounced fan1 . When today are spoken of, they still say fan1-ch'eng." Lien Tan and Wang K'uang1a attacked and took it by storm, cutting off more than ten thousand heads, [so Wang] Mang 17b sent a General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Household, A Rebel City Taken by Storm bearing a message with an imperial seal, to congratulate [Lien] Tan and [Wang] K'uang1a. Their noble ranks were advanced and they became Dukes. More than ten of their officers and soldiers who had distinguished themselves were enfeoffed. The Red Eyebrows Defeat an Imperial Army A detached Colonel of the Red Eyebrows, Tung Hsien4a, and others, with a band of several ten-thousand men, were in Liang Commandery. Wang K'uang1a wanted to advance and attack them, [but] Lien Tan considered that [their own troops] had but newly taken a city by storm, so were utterly weary, and their men ought temporarily to be rested, in order to increase their prestige. [Wang] K'uang1a would not listen, so alone led his troops to advance, and [Lien] Tan followed after him. Battle was joined at Ch'eng-ch'ang. [The imperial] troops were Lien Tan Dies defeated and [Wang] K'uang1a fled. [Lien] Tan sent an official bearing his seals, apron, and tally credentials, to give them to [Wang] K'uang1a and say, "You, boy, may flee, but I cannot." Thereupon he stayed and died fighting.18.7 18.7 HHS, Mem. 18 A: 6a (which may have been taken from Pan Ku's account of the Later Han dynasty's rise) states that when Lien Tan, on his way east, "had reached Ting-t'ao, [Wang] Mang had sent an imperial edict after [Lien] Tan, which said, "The granaries are exhausted and the government arsenals are empty. You must now indeed "become enraged"* and must now indeed fight. You, General, have received the weightiest duty in the state. If you do not leave your body "in the midst of the waste,"** will not be able to repay [the state's] favors or to escape a reprimand." " Thus Wang Mang drove Lien Tan to his death. (The phrase marked * is an allusion to Mencius I, ii, iii, 6 (Legge, p. 156). "King Wen, in one burst of rage, gave repose to the people of the world." That marked ** is a quotation from Book of Changes, App. III, ii, ii, 22 (Legge, 385), which passage discusses methods of burial.) When his Colonels, Ju YÃ¼n, 433WANG MANG, Ti-huang III 99 C: 18b, 19a Wang Lung, and others, more than twenty persons A.D. 22, Winter [in all], who were fighting separately, heard of it, they all said, "Duke Lien is already dead. For whom should we live?" So they galloped rapidly at the bandits and all died fighting. [Wang] Mang was afflicted by it, so issued a written 22b message which said, "Verily, you, Duke, [Lien Tan], controlled many select gentlemen and picked troops. From all the fine horses, the grain in the storehouses, and the stores in the treasuries of the many commanderies, you might have made your own selection, but you cared not for documentary imperial edicts and separated yourself from the majestic credentials [of power]. Mounting a horse you shouted and [your followers] yelled and were killed by wild swords. Alas! How sad! I grant him the 19a posthumous name of Duke Kuo (Intrepid)." The State General, Ai Chang, spoke to [Wang] Mang, saying, "In the time of your August Deceased Original Ancestor, the Yellow Lord, when Chung-huang Chih was his General, he routed and killed Ch'ih-yu. Now your servant is occupying the post of Chung-huang Chih, and wishes to tranquillize [the region] east of the mountains." [Wang] Mang [accordingly] sent [Ai] Chang to gallop eastwards and join his forces with the Grand Master, [Wang] K'uang1a. He also sent Generalissimo Yang ChÃ¼n to 18a guard the Ao Granary. The Minister Over the Masses, Wang HsÃ¼n3, leading more than a hundred thousand [men], encamped at Lo-yang, where he garrisoned the Southern Palace. The Commander-in-chief, Tung Chung1b, instructed soldiers and practiced archery in the Northern Encampment of the Capital Army.19.1 19.1 Cf. n. 13.8. The Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi5, [was given] concurrently the duties of 434WANG MANG, Ti-huang III A.D. 22, Winter [all] the three highest ministers. 99 C: 19a, b An Ominous Portent When the [Grand] Minister Over the Masses, [Wang] HsÃ¼n3, first started out from Ch'ang-an and spent the night at the Pa-ch'ang Stables, he lost his yellow battle-axe. [Wang] HsÃ¼n3's Officer, Fang Yang, was ordinarily impetuously outspoken, but he 23a wept and said, "This is what the Classic means [when it says], `He has lost his sharp axe.' "19.2 19.2 Book of Changes, Hex. 57, 6 (Legge, p. 191; Wilhelm, I, 168). The conclusion of this passage is, "Firmness of mind will bring misfortune." No wonder Fang Yang left! Yellow was the color of Wang Mang's power, hence his ceremonial axes were yellow. For the HS's ch'i , the Book of Changes reads tzu . Legge and Wilhelm translate differently, interpreting tzu as "property," as they also do in ibid., Hex. 56, 4 where the phrase tzu-fu recurs (Legge, 188, Wilhelm, I, 163). YÃ¼ Hsi (ca. 285-360) in his Chih-lin Hsin-shu ("YÃ¼-han Shan-fang Chi-yi-shu" ed., p. 6a) declares, "Ch'i should be chai ; whenever an army leaves, [its commander] must fast and purify himself, enter [the imperial ancestral temple], and receive his axe. Hence it says chai (fast)." But Ying Shao, in a note to this passage of the HS, defines ch'i as li (sharp), and interprets, "He has lost his sharp axe (li-fu)." Ch'ien Chan (1744-1806) points out that tzu and ch'i were anciently interchanged. Erh-ya ch. 2 (Erh-ya Chu-su 3: 2b) says, "Chi (to cut) and chien (to cut off) are ch'i," and Kuo P'o (276-324) comments, "The people of the southern quarter call a chien-knife a ch'i-knife." Shen Ch'in- quotes the above explanations, concluding that YÃ¼ Hsi is mistaken and says, "The words ch'i-fu take their meaning from beheading and cutting off." Cf. also Tz'u-hai, hai, 154b, sub ch'i-fu and ibid., yu, 99d, sub tzu-fu. Ying Shao's interpretation must be accepted. He accused himself [of the loss] and left [the army. Wang] Mang had [Fang] Yang killed with a battle-axe. More Defeats The thieves and robbers in the four quarters, [whose bands] frequently [numbered] several ten-thousands of men, attacked cities and towns, killing [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs and under. The Grand Master, Wang K'uang1a, and others fought several battles, but unsuccessfully. [Wang] Mang knew that the empire had got out 19b of his control and rebelled, that matters were at a last extremity and some expedient was urgent, so he discussed sending the Grandee In Charge of Customs and Morals, Szu-kuo Hsien, and others, by divisions, to inspect the empire and to do away with the prohibitions against the ching [system of] cultivated 435WANG MANG, Ti-huang III, IV 99 C: 19b fields, [private] slaves and slave-women, [free use of] A.D. 22/23 mountains and marshes, and the [other] six monopolies, Wang Mang's Economic Measures to be Repealed The Han Army Arises. and that all the imperial edicts and ordinances since [Wang Mang] had ascended the throne, which were inconvenient to the common people, should be recalled. [While the messengers] awaited an audience, and had not yet been sent out, it happened that the [future] Epochal Founder, [Emperor Kuang-wu, Liu Hsiu4?]; with his elder brother, [Liu Yin4?] Po-sheng, [later] King Wu of Ch'i; Li T'ung, a man from YÃ¼an; and others led several thousand followers from Ch'ung-ling and induced Chu Wei and Ch'en Mu from Hsin-shih and P'ing-lin, and others to come. Together they attacked and took Chi5-yang by storm. At this time Chuang Yu and Ch'en Mou routed the Troops from the Lower Yangtze [Region, under] Ch'eng Tan, Wang Ch'ang2, and others, [to the number of] several thousand men, and they separately fled into the borders of Nan-yang [Commandery]. 18b In the eleventh month, a comet appeared in [the Nov./Dec. constellation] Chang. It traveled southeastwards for five days and disappeared.19.3 19.3 This is no. 55 in Williams, Observations of Comets. It is also listed in HHS, Tr. 10: 4a. [Wang] Mang 23b several times summoned and questioned his Chief A Comet Grand Astrologer, Tsung HsÃ¼an, and various diviners. They all answered falsely, saying, "The astrological phenomena are peaceful and good, so that the many bandits will soon be destroyed." Thereupon [Wang] Mang [felt] a little more tranquil. IV In the fourth year, the first month, the Han troops A.D. 23 secured [the Troops from] the Lower Yangtze [under] Jan./ Wang Ch'ang and others, and made them auxiliary Feb.19.4 19.4 Wang Mang had taken the second astronomical month for the first month of the year, whereas the Han dynasty took the third astronomical month as their first month, so that Wang Mang's first month was the same as the thirteenth month of the preceding year according to the Han calendar. The months of this year in this chapter are thus one month earlier than the corresponding months of the Han calendar, which latter is given in Hoang, Concordance. 436WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV A.D. 23, Jan./Feb. The Defeat of Chen Fou troops. They [together] attacked the Southern 99C: 19b, Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Chen Fou, and his Director of an Association, Liang-ch'iu Tz'u, and beheaded them both, killing several ten-thousands of their forces.19.5 19.5 For this famous battle, cf. HHS, Mem. 4, and Glossary, sub Liu Yin4?. The Illiterate Red Eyebrows Previously, the imperial capital had heard that the bands of bandits from Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ [Provinces] numbered several hundred-thousands of men, and yet that they had absolutely no written orders, banners, or marks of identification. [The people of the capital] all considered it a portentious prodigy and those who loved [strange] things19.6 19.6 A phrase from Mencius, V, i, viii, 1 (Legge, p. 365). For the ancient belief concerning the literacy of the Three Sovereigns, cf. HFHD, I, 124, paragraph 3. said furtively, "Are not they like the three ancient August Ones, who had no written messages or titles?" 20a [Wang] Mang also [considered] in his heart that it was wonderful and asked his various courtiers about it. None of the various courtiers answered, only Chuang Yu said, "This [circumstance] is not sufficient [to be considered] wonderful. From the time that the Yellow Lord, T'ang [the Successful] and [King] Wu led their armies, [armies] have always been provided with regiments, companies,20.1 20.1 Cf. Glossary, sub Captain. banners, and orders. These [people] who now do not have them are merely a crowd of thieves [produced by] hunger and cold, [like] dogs or sheep that have gathered together, who merely do not know how to formulate [such institutions." Wang] Mang was 24a greatly pleased and the various courtiers acquiesced completely. However later, when the Han troops [under] Liu [Yin4?] Po-sheng arose, [their leaders] all called [themselves] Generals. They attacked cities and 437WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV 99C: 20a overran territory. When they had killed Chen Fou, A.D. 23, Jan./Mar. they sent letters about, giving an account of [Wang Mang's crimes.20.2 20.2 Hu San-hsing in Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 39: 1b explains as "recounting [Wang] Mang's crimes." When Wang] Mang heard of it, he was worried and fearful. The Han troops took advantage of their victories and thereupon besieged the city of YÃ¼an. Formerly, [Liu HsÃ¼an2?] Sheng-kung, a second cousin of the Epochal Founder, [Emperor Kuang-wu], had previously been among the P'ing-lin Troops, 19a and, in the third month, on [the day] hsin-szu, the Mar. 11 first day of the month,20.3 20.3 HHS, An. 1 A: 4a dates this event in the second month; the difference is due merely to the fact that the HHS here uses the Han calendar, while this "Memoir" here uses Wang Mang's calendar; cf. n. 19.4. the P'ing-lin and Hsin-shih The Keng-shih Emperor Set Up [Troops] and the Troops from the Lower Yangtze [Region], led by Wang Ch'ang2, Chu Wei, and others, together set up [Liu HsÃ¼an2?] Sheng-kung as the Emperor. He changed the year-[period] to be the first year of [the period] Keng-shih and installed and established a bureaucracy. When [Wang] Mang heard of it, he was all the Wang Mang Marries Again. more afraid. He wanted to show to the world that he himself was calm, so he dyed his beard and hair20.4 20.4 Chou Shou-ch'ang remarks that this is the first time dying the beard and hair appeared in Chinese history. and promoted the "virtuous young ladies"20.5 20.5 Cf. 99 C: 13b and n. 13.4. whom he had summoned from the empire, setting up20.6 20.6 Wang Nien-sun declares that before there was originally the word ; T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983) 89: 11a and Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 39: 2a, in quoting this sentence, have this word. a daughter of the Shih clan at Tu-ling as his Empress. He sent her [family] as betrothal presents 30,000 catties of actual gold, [together with] chariots and horses, slaves and slave-women, variegated silks, and precious things, which were valued by the hundred 438WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iii A.D. 23, Mar./Apr. millions [of cash.20.7 20.7 The gold alone was worth (at the standard rate, 10,000 cash per catty, cf. 24 B: 22a) 300,000,000 cash, so that "hundred millions of cash" must refer to the other presents. The gold amounted to 235,343 oz. troy or 7,320,000 g. Wang] Mang in person wel- 99 C: 20a, b comed her between the two stairs to the Front Hall and completed the ceremonies of the common [marriage] meal above in the Western Hall.20.8 20.8 For the ceremonies, cf. the Yi-li, ch. III (J. Steele, trans.). For these parts of the ancient house, cf. plan in T'zu-yÃ¼an, sub . [The prescribed number of] Harmonious Ladies, Spouses, Beauties, and Attendants were all complete. The Harmonious Ladies were three [in number]; their 20b rank was equal to that of the highest ministers. The Spouses were nine [in number; their rank] was equal to that of the high ministers. The Beauties were twenty-seven [in number; their rank] was equal to that of Grandees. The Attendants were eighty-one [in number; their rank] was equal to that of First 24b Officers. Altogether there were a hundred twenty women. All wore seals with aprons at their girdles, and held bowcases.20.9 20.9 In accordance with Li-chi IV, i, ii, 9 (Legge, I, 259; Couvreur, I, 341 f), "In this month [the second month of spring, Wang Mang's third month], the swallows arrive. On the day of their arrival, a suovetaurilia is sacrificed to the Eminent Deity of Marriage and Birth. The Son of Heaven attends in person, and the Queen Consort leads the nine Spouses and the Attendants. Then a ceremony is performed for those [ladies] who have attended [in person] upon the Son of Heaven. They carry bowcases and are given bows and arrows before the Eminent Deity of Marriage and Birth." [Wang Mang] enfeoffed [Shih] Shen, the father of the Empress, as Marquis of Harmony and Peace, and installed him as General of a Peaceful Beginning. [Shih] Shen's two sons were both [made] Palace Attendants. On that day, a great wind blew [off] roofs and broke trees. When the many courtiers offered congratulations, they said, "Verily, on [the day] keng-tzu, Mar. 30 rainwater sprinkled the highways, and on [the Mar. 31 day] hsin-ch'ou, they were clean and pure, without any dust. That evening, the life-giving valley 439WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iii 99 C: 20b wind20.10 20.10 An allusion to Book of Odes, I, iii, x (Legge, I, 55); the phrase denotes the east wind. The valley wind was supposed to blow gently and bring all genial influences. blew swiftly and promptly from the north- A.D. 23, Mar./Apr. east. Hsin-ch'ou is the day of [the musical note] 19b kung belonging to [the hexagram] sun.20.11 20.11 Ch'ou was connected with the note kung. Chu Chen (1072-1138), in his Han-shang Yi-kua T'u, B: 23b, basing his calculations on the Yi-chuan of Ching Fang (B.C. 77-37), asserts that the hexagram sun, in the cyclical combination hsin-ch'ou, is equated with the power earth (which is equated with the note kung). The same equation is found in San-yi Pei-yi 6: 5b (by Chu YÃ¼an-sheng; fl. 1211; in T'ung-chih-t'ang Ching-chien, vols. 14 &amp; 38). Thus this equation was based upon earlier documents and has passed into the stream of interpretation for the Book of Changes. Sun-erh was the ancient good of the wind, and the hexagram sun was itself equated with wine. Sun [indicates] wind and [indicates] obedience. [Thus] the principles of an Empress are made plain and the way of motherhood is secured. [The whole is due to] the influence of your geniality and kindness. The Book of Changes says, `He will receive this great blessing from his [Queen], the Royal Mother [of the country].'20.12 20.12 Book of Changes, Hex. 35, 2 (Legge, p. 132; Wilhelm, I, 103). Yen Shih-ku explains wang-mu as chÃ¼n-mu , i.e., the principal wife, which is a case of tecnonymy become a set title; cf. HS 99 A: 9a3, C: 13a12. The [Yi-li] says, `May you receive Heaven's blessing and myriad happinesses without bounds.'20.13 20.13 Yi-li I, ii, 17, c (Steele, I, p. 15). That text has however " receive" for the HS's " ten-thousand." Those who intend to attach themselves to the abolished Han [dynasty], the Liu [clan, which depends upon the virtue of] fire, shall all be flooded, disappear like melting snow, and extirpated, without any remaining fragments. All the grains shall be bountiful and plants shall grow abundantly. The great multitude will be glad and rejoice and the myriad common people will have the blessings that 25a come from being good,20.14 20.14 An allusion to Mencius VI, A, vii, 1 (Legge, p. 404): "With good harvests most people are good." so that the world will be greatly favored [because of you]." [Wang] Mang was daily in the harem with persons versed in the magical arts, Chao-chÃ¼n, from Cho Commandery, and others, testing magical and technical 440WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iii A.D. 23, Apr. arts and giving himself up to lustful pleasures. 99 C: 20b, 21a A Price Put Upon the Head of Liu Yin Po-sheng A general amnesty [was granted] to the empire. [Wang Mang] however said [in a message], "The descendants of the Marquises of Ch'ung-ling [under] the former Han dynasty, Liu [Yin4?] Po-sheng, with the members of his clan, his relatives by marriage, and his cabal, have falsely spread groundless rumors to delude the crowd into a treasonable rebellion 21a against Heaven's mandate. They have by their own hands killed the General of a New Beginning, Lien Tan, the Southern Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Chen Fou, and his Director of an Association, Liang-ch'iu Tz'u. [To them], together with the northern barbarian caitiff,21.1 21.1 Ti was the classical (Chou period) general designation for the barbarians in the present northern China and north of it, while hu was the general designation in the Han period for the barbarians outside the northern border. Wang Mang, imitating classical models, here uses ti in order to be classical and has to add hu to make his meaning clear to his contemporaries. Yen Shih-ku explains as meaning "and"; the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. read . the rebel [LÃ¼an-ti] YÃ¼, and the southwestern barbarian caitiffs Jo Tou and Meng Ch'ien, this message [of amnesty] shall not apply. Whoever are able to sieze these persons [Liu Yin4? Po-sheng, etc.], will all be enfeoffed among the highest ranking of the dukes, will be given the income of an estate of ten thousand households, and will be granted fifty million [cash] of the valuable currency." Expeditions Ordered Against the Rebels There was also an imperial edict [saying], "The Grand Master, Wang K'uang1a, the State General, Ai Chang, the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], K'ung Jen, the Shepherd of Yen Province and Director of the Confederation at Shou-liang, Wang Hung, and the Shepherd of Yang 20a Province, Li Sheng, shall quickly send forward the troops of the provinces and commanderies in the regional divisions which are their charge; altogether a force of three hundred thousand [men], in order to 441WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iii 99 C: 21a, b pursue and arrest the thieves and robbers in Ch'ing A.D. 23, Apr. and HsÃ¼ [Provinces]. The Communicator and General, 25b Chuang Yu, the Arranger of the Ancestral Temples and General, Ch'en Mou, the General of Chariots and Cavalry, Wang HsÃ¼n2, and the Eastern Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Wang Wu2, shall quickly send forward the troops of the provinces and commanderies in the divisions which are in their charge, a force of altogether a hundred thousand men, to pursue and arrest the band of caitiffs in the Southern Neighboring Commandery, [Liu Yin4?, Liu Hsiu4?, etc.]. Inform them clearly with trustworthiness [like that of a painting done in] cinnabar and azurite,21.2 21.2 The phrase "tan-ch'ing-chih-hsin " was a set expression in Han Times. 5 B: 1a, sub ch'ing, says, "Tan-ch'ing-chih-hsin [means] certainly ." Juan Chi's (210-263) "Yung-huai Shih" (Wen-hsÃ¼an, 23: 3b, not trans. by von Zach) has the lines, "[Like a painting done in] cinnabar and azurite, our oath has been made plain, Which for an eternity of ages we shall never forget." Li Shan comments, "[A painting done in] cinnabar and azurite does not change, hence be used it to liken to his oath." Li Shan moreover quotes an edict of Emperor Kuang-wu from the Tung-kuan Han-chi (lost), "Establish plainly with trust worthiness [like that in a painting done in] cinnabar and azurite and open wide the road which restricts Our action." This edict is also referred to with this phrase in HHS, Mem. 3: 19a. Yang Hsiung, in his Fa-yen, 12: 2a, b, ch. "ChÃ¼n-tzu," uses this phrase similarly: "Someone asked, `Are the words of a sage as brilliant as [a painting done in] cinnabar and ?' I replied, `Ha! What kind of words are that? At first [a painting done in] and azurite is brilliant; after a long time it changes. [Do a sage's words] ?' " The fact that a phrase from painting had already become widely used as a phrase in Former Han times illustrates the prevalence and antiquity of Chinese painting. that [if they surrender, they shall] live, [but] if they are again deluded and do not disperse, [these leaders] will all join forces, attack unitedly, and extirpate them. "Previously, when the Grand Minister of Works, the Duke Prospering the Hsin [Dynasty, Wang Yi5], a relative and member of the imperial clan, as the Tiger Teeth General, went east and pointed [at them], rebellious caitiffs were routed and ruined; when he went west and attacked, seditious bandits 21b 442WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iii, iv A.D. 23, Apr./May were ground to powder. He is thus a majestic and 99 C: 21b precious minister of the Hsin House. If the crafty bandits do not disperse, I will send the Grand Minister of Works, leading an army of a million [men], to make a punitive military expedition [against them and] exterminate them." Wei Ao Flees. [Wang Mang] sent Wei Ao, an Executive Officer of one of the Seven Highest Ministers, [Liu Hsin1a], and others, seventy-two persons [in all], by divisions, to issue the ordinance of amnesty and plainly instruct [the people. When Wei] Ao and the others had left [the court], availing [themselves of this opportunity], they escaped. Apr./May In the fourth month, the Epochal Founder, [Liu Hsiu4?], with Wang Ch'ang2 and others, separately attacked Ying-ch'uan [Commandery] and caused 26a K'un-yang, Yen, and Ting-ling to surrender. When [Wang] Mang head of it, he was all the more fearful, 20b and sent the Grand Minister of Works, Wang Yi5, Wang Yi's Great Army Gathers. riding a galloping quadriga, to go to Lo-yang, with the [Grand] Minister Over the Masses, Wang HsÃ¼n3, to mobilize the troops of numerous commanderies, [to the number of] a million [men], calling them the Tiger Teeth [Troops and] the Troops of the Five Majestic [Principles], in order to tranquillize [the region] east of the [Kuan-chung] mountains. [Wang Yi5] was permitted on his own authority to raise [persons] to the nobility. [The power of] making final decisions concerning government [business was also given] to [Wang] Yi5. [Wang Mang] appointed to office the [various] persons skilled in methods of the sixty-three schools of military arts whom he had summoned.21.3 21.3 HS 30: 64a lists "altogether books on military matters from 53 schools, in fascicles," and Pan Ku's note adds, "I have omitted [and transferred to another place the books of] 10 schools, in 271 fascicles." Wang Hsien-ch'ien accordingly concludes that Liu Hsiang's Ch'i-lÃ¼eh Pieh-lu (now lost) recorded 63 schools of military methods. HHS, An. 1 A: 4b also says, "63 schools." Each one bore his charts and writings, 443WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, iv-vi 99 C: 21b, 22a received military implements and armor, and A.D. 23, Apr./July acted as a military officer. [Wang Mang] emptied the government storehouses in order to send out [Wang] Yi5 provided abundantly with precious things and wild beasts, with the purpose of showing the exceeding wealth [of the imperial forces,] in order to frighten [the region] east of the [Kuan-chung] mountains. When [Wang] Yi5 reached Lo-yang, the provinces and commanderies each selected their picked troops, led by their Shepherds and Administrators in person. Those for whom a rendezvous had been appointed [numbered] more than four hundred twenty thousand men and [marched] on the highways in a continuous [stream]. From the [most] ancient [times] that armies had set forth, [such] magnificence in chariots, armor, men, and horses had never before been [seen]. In the sixth month, [Wang] Yi5 and the [Grand] 22a Minister Over the Masses, [Wang] HsÃ¼n3, started June/July from Lo-yang, intending to go to YÃ¼an. Their road The Rout at K'un-yang went out of Ying-ch'uan [Commandery] past K'un-yang. At that time, K'un-yang had already surrendered to the Han [troops], and the Han troops were defending it. Chuang Yu and Ch'en Mou had joined [their troops] with [those of] the two highest ministers. When the two highest ministers [were about to] launch their troops to besiege K'un-yang, Chuang Yu said, "[The rebel] who has been called by the imperial title, [Liu HsÃ¼an2? Sheng-kung], is below [the walls of] YÃ¼an, [besieging it]. It would 26b be proper to hasten and advance [to that place]. If he is routed, the various [other] cities will of their own accord be tranquillized." [Wang] Yi5 replied, "Wherever an army of a million passes, it is due to annihilate [the enemy]. We will now massacre [the defenders of] this city, trample in blood,22.1 22.1 I take here meaning (1) for this phrase from HFHD I, 222, n. 2, since meaning (2) does not seem to fit this case. and then 444WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vi A.D. 23, June/July advance [to YÃ¼an]. The van will sing and the rear 99 C: 22a will dance; would not that be enjoyable?"22.2 22.2 HHS, An. 1 A: 5b gives a different and less bombastic explanation for Wang Yi's refusal to advance, namely that Wang Yi5 had previously been tried and reprimanded because, when he had surrounded Chai Yi, he had not taken him alive. Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 39: 3b adopts this explanation. Cf. Glossary, sub Kuang-wu, Emperor. Thereupon they surrounded the city several tens [of men] deep. [The defenders] in the city begged [for permission] to surrender [on terms], but [permission] was refused. Chuang Yu also said, " `When an army [wishes] to return [home], do not stop it; in besieging 21a a city, [leave] an opening for them.'22.3 22.3 Yen Shih-ku asserts that this sentence is a saying from the standard Military Methods. Ts'ao Ts'ao, in his comment to Sun-tzu, 7: 40a, quotes the Szu-ma (iv. cent. B.C., later added to; this passage is not in the present text of that book) as saying, "Surround three sides of it, and open one side of it, as a means of showing them that there is a way [to save their] lives." In accordance with the Military Methods you might cause them to be permitted to escape and leave [the city], and thereby frighten [the attackers of] YÃ¼an."22.4 22.4 Hsia is sometimes a meaningless suffix, used to make a binom out of a place-name composed of only one word; cf. HFHD, I, 310, n. 33. But hsia can also mean "below [the walls of]," cf. HS 99 C: 26a10-11, 28b3, or "just outside [a wall, door, or gate]," cf. 99 A: 1b11, 9a2, B: 14b2, 17b4, C: 23a12, 26b7. Again [Wang] Yi5 would not listen. It happened that when the Epochal Founder, [Liu Hsiu4?], mobilized all the troops in Yen and Ting-ling, to the number of several thousand men, and came to rescue [the defenders of] K'un-yang, [Wang] HsÃ¼n3 and [Wang] Yi5 made light of it. They themselves led more than ten thousand men and reviewed their battle-array. They ordered that the various encampments should all to be retained and that the regiments [therein] should not to be permitted to move. [Then Wang HsÃ¼n3 and Wang Yi5] by themselves [went to] meet the Han troops. When they were not successful in battle, their great army did 445WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vi 99 C: 22a, b not presume on its own authority to rescue them.22.5 22.5 Hsiang cannot here have the meaning found in the dictionaries, "mutual; reciprocal; direction towards." Hsiang can only be equivalent to a pronoun object. It very often has this meaning, frequently being equivalent to a preposition plus a pronoun object. Cf. 99 C: 29a3, "hsiang ," which cannot mean "ate each other," but only "ste them," i.e., "others." A.D. 23, June/July The Han troops took advantage of their victory and killed [Wang] HsÃ¼n3. Simultaneously the [Han] troops inside K'un-yang came out and fought. [Wang] Yi5 fled and the army was in confusion. A great22.6 22.6 The present text reads, "Heaven's wind blew tiles off," which is the reading of the important texts. The Official ed., which I here follow, has emended to , in accordance with HHS, An. 1 A: 6b. wind blew away tiles, and the rain was as if water were being poured down, so that the great band [of soldiers] collapsed in ruin. The shouting [made even] the tigers and leopards tremble with fear in their haunches. [Wang Mang's] soldiers fled hastily, 27a each returning to his own commandery. [Wang] Yi5, with only the several thousand brave and daring men 22b from Ch'ang-an whom he commanded, returned to Lo-yang. When [the people] in Kuan-chung heard of it, they quaked with fear and thieves and robbers arose simultaneously. Since it was moreover reported that the Han troops said that [Wang] Mang had murdered Emperor The Metal Bound Coffer Opened Hsiao-p'ing by poison, [Wang] Mang thereupon assembled, in the Hall With the Royal Apartments, the ministers and those [ranking] below and opened the metal-bound document in which he had begged [to substitute his own] life for that of Emperor P'ing.22.7 22.7 Cf. 99 A: 24b. He wept silently as he showed it to his various courtiers. He commanded the Baron of Brilliant Scholarship, Chang2 Han, to state and explain the virtue [of the A Clever Augury power, earth, which brought] him, [Wang Mang, to the throne], together with the mandates [given him 446WANG MANG, Ti-huang, IV, vi A.D. 23, June/July through] portents. Thereupon [Chang2 Han] said, 99 C: 22b "The Book of Changes says, `He hides his weapons in a thicket (mang), Mounts (sheng) a high mound (kao-ling), And in the third year he will not prosper.'22.8 22.8 Book of Changes, Hex. 13, 3 (Legge, p. 86; Wilhelm, I, 42). Mang is the personal name of the Emperor; sheng 21b means Liu [Yin4?] Po-sheng; kao-ling means Chai Yi, the son of the Marquis of Kao-lingb, [Chai Fang-chin]. It means that Liu [Yin4? Po]-sheng and Chai Yi will have troops with "hidden weapons in" [the reign of Wang "Mang"],22.8 22.8 Book of Changes, Hex. 13, 3 (Legge, p. 86; Wilhelm, I, 42). the Emperor of the Hsin [House], but yet will be extirpated and "will not prosper."22.8 22.8 Book of Changes, Hex. 13, 3 (Legge, p. 86; Wilhelm, I, 42). The courtiers all called out, "Long life!" Pretended Execution of the Rebels [Wang Mang] also ordered carriages with cages to transport several men from the eastern quarter [of the empire], saying that [these men] were Liu [Yin4?] Po-sheng and the others. All of them underwent the grand exposure [of their corpses. But] the common people22.9 22.9 The Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed. and the Official ed., for Wang Hsien-ch'ien's " courtiers," read " common people," which latter reading I adopt. knew that it was false. 27b Previous to this, the General of the Guard, Wang ShÃª, had kept a gentleman versed in the ways of magic,22.10 22.10 Tao-shih did not yet mean predominately a Taoist practicioner. Huan T'an (ca. 40 B.C.-A.D. 29), in his Hsin-lun (lost; quoted in T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 720: 5b), calls Hsi-men ChÃ¼n-hui a "gentleman possessing magical recipes, fang-shih ," and states that Wang Ken (the father of Wang ShÃª) had kept him in order to cultivate methods of securing longevity. Hence tao-shih at this time denoted a fang-shih. Cf. , sub tao-shih. Hsi-men ChÃ¼n-hui. [Hsi-men] ChÃ¼n-hui loved astrology and prophetic accounts. He said to [Wang] ShÃª, "A comet has swept in the [Heavenly] Palace,22.11 22.11 This comet is not mentioned in Williams' list. The constellation Ying-shih is meant. This reference is confirmed by the sentence below, referring to it as a zodiacal constellation. Chin-shu, 11: 14b, says, "The two stars of [the constellation] Ying-shih are the palace of the Son of Heaven." [hence] the Liu clan is due to be restored. 447WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vi 99 C: 22b, 23a [The next emperor] will have the surname and given A.D. 23, June/July An Astrological Portent and Prophecy for Liu Hsin name of the State Master and Highest Minister."22.12 22.12 The State Master was Liu Hsin1a, who had previously changed his name to Liu Hsiu4a, which name is not used in the HS, since it was the same as the tabooed personal name of Emperor Kuang-wu, Liu Hsiu4?. Hsi-men ChÃ¼n-hiu was prophesying that a Liu Hsiu (which may mean either Liu Hsin1a or Emperor Kuang-wu) would come to the throne. [Wang] ShÃª believed his words, and spoke of them to the Commander-in-chief, Tung Chung1b, who urged that they both go to the private apartments of the State Master, [Liu Hsin1a], in the [Palace] Hall and talk to him about the zodiacal constellation. [But] the State Master did not respond. Later [Wang] ShÃª went alone to him. He wept silently before [Liu] Hsin1a and said, "I really wish with you, Duke, to bring peace to our clans. Alas, 23a why will you not believe me, [Wang] ShÃª?" Thereupon Wang She's Plot [Liu] Hsin1a said to him that, [according to] the astrological phenomena and human affairs, [the insurgents] in the eastern quarter, were bound to succeed. [Wang] ShÃª said, "Marquis Ai of Hsin-tuc, [Wang Wan, Wang Mang's father], suffered from illness when he was young, and the Baronetess of Apparent Merits, [Wang Mang's mother], habitually loved wine. I suspect that the Emperor was not in his origin a child of my clan.23.1 23.1 Ju Shun's judgment upon this incident is interesting: "He said that [Wang] Mang's mother was in decayed circumstances, loved wine, and gave herself lascivious liberty, so conceived [Wang] Mang, [hence] he was not a child of the Wang clan. [Wang ShÃª] put forth this fraud in order to separate himself [from Wang Mang, with the aim of] not receiving execution [when Wang Mang would be destroyed]." His excellency Tung [Chung1b] has charge of the picked troops in the Palace Encampments. I, [Wang] ShÃª, command the Palace Guard; the Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu Tieh], is in charge inside the [Palace] Hall. If we unitedly cooperate in the plot, together sieze the Emperor by force, and surrender to the Son of 448WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii A.D. 23, July/Aug. Heaven in Nan-yang [Commandery] to the east, 99 C: 23a 22a [Liu HsÃ¼an2? Sheng-kung, we] will be able to preserve our clans. If not, we will all be executed and 28a our clans annihilated." The Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu Tieh], was [Liu] Hsin1a's eldest son. He was a Palace Attendant and General of the Fifth Rank Gentlemen-at-the Palace. [Wang] Mang habitually loved him, [but Liu] Hsin1a held a grudge [because Wang] Mang had killed three of his children,23.2 23.2 In 11 A.D., Wang Mang had executed two of Liu Hsin's sons, cf. 99 B: 16a; in 21 A.D. he also executed Liu Hsin's daughter, cf. C: 11b. and also feared that the great calamity [of execution] would come upon him. Consequently he plotted with [Wang] ShÃª and [Tung] Chung. When they wanted to act, [Liu] Hsin1a said, "We must wait until [the planet] Venus appears,23.3 23.3 According to SC 27 : 50 = Mh III, 371, Venus "presides over executions. When a person who has done wrong is killed, that punishment is initiated by Venus." SC 27: 57 = Mh III, 378 moreover declares: "When Venus is invisible and troops are put into the field, the troops will suffer calamity." This astrological interpretation explains Liu Hsin1a's reluctance to act until Venus again became visible. According to calculation by the tables in K. Schoch, Planeten-Tafeln fÃ¼r Jedermans, Venus had been in superior conjunction on Oct. 25, A.D. 22 (Julian) and became visible as an evening star at Ch'ang-an on Dec. 4, 22. Venus was last visible as an evening star on Aug. 2, 23 and first became visible as a morning star on Aug. 20, 23. What evidently happened was that, when the conspirators finally decided to act, Venus had become invisible. Liu Hsin1a, who accepted the above astrological interpretation of Venus' influence and who knew that at inferior conjunction this planet is only invisible for a few days, consequently suggested they wait until Venus reappears. He probably did not know that, at this time, Venus would be invisible for the longest period of time in which it can remain invisible at this latitudeâeighteen days. While awaiting its reappearance, possibly expecting the period would not be long (sometimes Venus does not disappear at inferior conjunction), Tung Chung1b took Sun Chi into his confidence, with the result that the plot was revealed and the conspirators, including Liu Hsin1a lost their lives. Pan Ku's dating of the plot is not exact. He does not mention any date until he notes the revelation of the plot and includes in the events before the seventh month Liu Hsin1a's proposal to delay acting until Venus reappears. Evidently Pan Ku knew only the date the plot was memorialized to the throne, that this event occurred during the seventh month, which was July 7 to Aug. 5. But Venus was still visible as an evening star during most of the sixth month. (The possibility is excluded, with great probability, that Pan Ku's source was using the Han dynasty's months, which set the seventh month a month later, i.e., Aug. 6 to Sept. 3. For Pan Ku's information about the plot and its revelation could hardly have come elsewhere than from Wang Mang's court. It was most probably taken from Sun Chi's memorial, giving information about the plot.) Since Venus disappeared first on Aug. 3, Liu Hsin1a's proposal to delay could only have been made during the last three days of the seventh month, i.e., Aug. 3, 4, or 5. Sun Chi hence was persuaded by his wife and brother-in-law to reveal the plot on the same or the next day after that on which he was taken into Tung Chung1b's confidence and acted immediately. This inference is confirmed by the circumstance that only by revealing such a plot immediately that he knew of it could Sung Chi have escaped implicating himself in the plot. It is thus not surprising that the conspirators did not suspect they had been betrayed and obeyed Wang Mang's order to come to the Palace. and then only may we [act]." Because the Director of 449WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii 99 C: 23a the Palace and Grand Keeper of the Robes, the A.D. 23, July/Aug. Marquis Raising Military Power, Sun Chi, also controlled troops, [Tung] Chung1b also plotted with [Sun] Chi. When [Sun] Chi returned to his home, the color of his face had changed and he could not eat. When his wife marvelled and asked him about it, he told her the circumstances. His wife told it to her younger brother, Ch'en Han, a man from YÃ¼n-yang, and [Ch'en] Han wanted to give information about July/Aug. it. In the seventh month, [Sun] Chi and [Ch'en] The Plot is Revealed. Han together gave information [about the plot. Wang] Mang sent commissioners separately to summon [Tung] Chung1b and the others. [Tung] Chung1b was just at that time teaching military [methods] at a grand review [of his troops]. His Commissioner Over the Army, Wang Hsien2d, said to [Tung] Chung1b, "Your plot has been made for some time but no action has been taken, so that I fear it has been divulged. It would be better immediately to behead the commissioner, take command of your troops, and enter [the Palace to carry out the plot." But Tung] Chung1b did not listen [to him], and consequently joined [Liu] Hsin1a and [Wang] ShÃª outside the gate of the inner [Palace] apartments. 450WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii A.D. 23, Aug. [Wang] Mang ordered Tai YÃ¼n to interrogate 99 C: 23a, b them under torture, and all confessed. Palace Attendants Within the Yellow Gate, all with swords 23b drawn, conducted [Tung] Chung1b and the others to an antechamber. [Tung] Chung1b drew his sword with the intention of cutting his own throat. A Palace Attendant, Wang Wang, reported that the 28b Commander-in-chief, [Tung Chung1b], had rebelled. [The Palace Attendants Within] the Yellow Gate had drawn their swords, and jointly fought with and Tung Chung Killed killed [Tung Chung1b. The people in] the inner [palace] apartments frightened one another by the report that troops under a command would arrive. [The Gentlemen] in the Gentlemen's quarters all drew their swords and cocked their crossbows. The General of a New Beginning,23.4 23.4 Previously (p. 20b), Shih Shen was made General of a Peaceful Beginning; Liu Feng-shih states that the text may be in error here; Wang Ming-shen thinks that the text should be emended. Lien Tan had been General of a New Beginning and had been killed in the winter of 22 A.D.; the title of General of a New Beginning seems to have been the higher title (cf. Glossary); possibly Shih Shen had been promoted. He is again noted with this title on p. 26b, so that I see no need to emend the text. Shih Shen, visited the various quarters and informed the Gentlemen and officials, saying, "The Commander-in-chief, [Tung Chung1b], had [a spell] of insanity come upon him; 22b he has already been executed. All are ordered to unbend their weapons." [Wang] Mang wanted to repress any baneful influence, so had the [Gentlemen] As Rapid As Tigers use a sword for beheading horses23.5 23.5 Professor Duyvendak calls my attention to the mention of this sword in HS 67: 6a, b, where Chu YÃ¼n, in a memorial to Emperor Ch'eng, dated during the decade beginning 20 B.C., declares, "Your servant would be willing to be granted a sword for beheading horses from the Master of Recipes, to cut off the head of one flattering courtier, in order to stimulate the others." The name of this article, which seems originally to have been merely a large sword, accordingly acquired the connotation of an article specially used to behead flatterers. to cut off [Tung] Chung1b's [head], put it in a bamboo vessel, and sent it about [the empire, with a label] saying, "A rebellious caitiff who has 451WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii 99 C: 23b left [his office]." A.D. 23, Aug. [Wang Mang] issued a message of amnesty to the officers and soldiers belonging to the office of the Commander-in-chief, who had been led into error by [Tung] Chung1b, had plotted to rebel, and had not yet been discovered. He had the clan and relatives of Tung Chung1b arrested, and buried them together in one pit with strong vinegar, poisonous drugs, foot[long] naked two-edged blades,23.6 23.6 Professor Duyvendak suggests emending ch'ih-po1-ren to ch'ih-po2 , which latter Couvreur, Dict. Class., defines as short for san -ch'ih po2-ch'ou , the cord granted by the throne to erring officials by which to strangle themselves. While this emendation is attractive and has the advantage of not breaking the rhythm of two-word phrases, the phrase ch'ih-po2 does not seem to have been used in ancient times, nor can I find any ancient example of this practise. Ch'ih-po2 is moreover used in Chan-kuo-ts'e, ch. 20, sect. 14 ("Szu-pu Pei-yao" ed., 20: 11a; "Szu-k'u Ts'ung-k'an" ed., 6: 74b) and denoted "a foot of silk cloth," used for making a cap, which meaning is clearly unsuitable here. Professor Duyvendak also suggests rendering ch'ih separately by "footrule," perhaps in the sense of the footrule used to bastonnade criminals. He doubts the whole passage. In Han times, the requirements of parallelism and rhythm were not yet strict, so that a three-character phrase might be allowed to occur along with a series of two-character phrases. Ch'ih is used in various compounds to denote a "one-foot long" article; cf. Tz'u-hai sub ch'ih. Ch'ih-tao is used in HS 54: 12b10. This phrase still denotes a dagger. Po1-ren is used in the Doctrine of the Mean, ix (Legge, p. 389). Ch'ih-po1-ren represents merely the combination of these two anciently well-known phrases. The ancient Chinese sword was three feet long; cf. HFHD I, 142 &amp; n. 3. Since the ancient Chinese conceived ghosts as quite small beings, dagger-blades would naturally be sufficient to put into a grave with the bodies of dangerous criminals, along with poisonous drugs and thorns, in order to prevent their ghosts from rising. For a parallel to the magical use of vinegar, cf. HS 100 A: 14b &amp; n. 14.5 (in the Preliminary Volume). and a thicket of thorns.23.7 23.7 The Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. read instead of , which reading I adopt. The phrase "thicket of thorns" is from Book of Changes, Hex. 29, 6; Legge, p. 119; cf. also HS 45: 18b. For the use of thorns, cf. HS 97 B: 19b. Liu Hsin1a and Wang ShÃª both committed suicide. Liu Hsin Executed [Wang] Mang considered that [one] of these two persons was [of the same] flesh and blood [as himself and the other was] a minister [who had been in office] for a long [time, so,] because [Wang Mang] disliked [it to be known] that these [persons] within 452WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii A.D. 23, Aug. [the court] had been infected [with evil], he kept 99 C: 23b, 24a their execution secret. Because moreover the Marquis of Yi-and-Hsiu, [Liu] Tieh, had constantly been circumspect and [Liu] Hsin1a had finally not informed [Liu Tieh of the plot], he was merely dismissed [from his posts as] Palace Attendant and General of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, and was changed to be a Palace Grandee Without Specified Appointment. Liu Hsin's Ghost Appears. A day later, in the [Palace] Hall, beside the palm [of the hand] of the immortal on the hill of earth [in the park under the charge of] the Intendant of 29a the Imperial Palace Parks,23.8 23.8 Mr. Cheng (fl. dur. 220-317) glosses, "The immortal held in his palm a vessel for receiving dew." Professor Duyvendak calls attention to the fact that HS 25 A: mentions "the bronze pillar and the immortal's palm for receiving dew [on] the Po-liang [Tower]" (q.v. in Glossary) made at the order of Emperor Wu about 120 B.C. Su glosses, "The immortal held in the palm of his hand an uplifted basin to receive sweet dew." The Po-liang Tower however burnt down in 104 B.C., so that in Wang Mang's time this was another statue. The San-fu Ku-shih (iii-v cent.; lost) is quoted by Shih-ku as saying, "The basin for receiving dew in the Chien-chang Palace was 200 feet high [the hight of the Po-liang Tower; the San-fu Ku-shih seems to have confused the location] and seven spans in circumference. It was made of bronze. Above it there was an immortal's palm to receive dew, which [latter] was mixed with jade powder and drunk [as an elixir of immortality]." This tradition was derived largely from some lines in Chang Heng's (78-139) "Fu on the Western Capital" (in Wen-hsÃ¼an 2: 15b), which refer to the immortal's palm on the Po-liang Tower (this passage was quoted in the San-fu Ku-shih passage): "He set upon a stalk [referring to the Tower] an immortal's palm For receiving the pure dew from the tips of the clouds, [Which, with] fine jade powder, was used for a morning drink at the conclusion of the meal, [So that the Emperor] would certainly be able to transfer his life [from this world to the next, i.e., become an immortal]." there was a white-headed 24a old man in cerulean clothes. The Gentlemen and officials who saw it said privately that it was the State Master and Highest Minister, [Liu Hsin1a]. The Marquis of Vast Merit, [Wang] Hsi3a, was usually good with the hexagrams, [so Wang] Mang had him to interpret its divination. He said, "One should be careful about weapons and fire."24.1 24.1 Professor Duyvendak remarks that fire is the power or element of the Han dynasty. But red was not officially adopted as the color of the Han dynasty until A.D. 26 (Teng Chan, fl. ca. 208, in a note to HS 25 B: 23b). In the time of Emperor Kao down to the time of Emperor Wen, the Han dynasty was supposed to have succeeded to the virtue of the Ch'in dynasty, whose virtue was the element water. Its color, black, is however nowhere said to have been adopted. However, down to the end of the Former Han period, Palace Attendants wore black sables (HS 98: 15a). Kung-sun Ch'en and Chia Yi argued that because earth overcomes water, the Han dynasty's virtue was earth, whose color is yellow. The appearance of a yellow dragon at Ch'eng-chi in 165 B.C. caused the dismissal of Chang Ts'ang, who upheld the theory that water was the Han dynasty's virtue. Yellow was not however adopted as the official Han color until 104 B.C. (HS 6: 31b). Liu Hsiang and Liu Hsin1a later argued that the order of the powers (and consequently the succession of the dynasties) was not to be considered as that in which one overcomes the other , but rather that in which they produced each other , since the ancient (legendary) rulers did not conquer their predecessors, but each one yielded to and resigned in favor of his successor. This theory was supported by verses in Book of Changes, App. V, 8, 9 (Legge, 425; in the "Explanation to the Trigrams," a section which was "discovered" during 73-49 B.C.) and so became widely accepted. According to this theory, the virtue of the Han dynasty was that of fire, whose color is red. The Ch'in dynasty was not given any virtue in this succession of powers, merely being counted as an intercalary dynasty, with the intercalary virtue of water, placed between the rule of the virtues wood (the Chou dynasty) and fire (the Han dynasty). The brevity of the Ch'in period was accounted for by the fact that it had no real virtue, only an apparent virtue. Wang Mang and his time (including Pan Piao) accepted this theory, hence thought of the Han dynasty's virtue as being fire and its color as being red, although that view was not officially adopted until the Later Han period under Emperor Kuang-wu. The story of the Eminent Founder having killed the snake (HFHD I, 34-36) clinched the of this theory. But it was probably invented in the first century B.C., so that it was interpolated into the SC (Mh II, 331). Cf. HS 25 B: 23b; Ku Chieh-kang in Ku-shih-pien V, 423-500, 560-636. For Wang Tzu-ch'iao, cf. Glossary, s.v. 453WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii 99 C: 24a [Wang] Mang replied, "How did you, boy, get this A.D. 23, Aug. erroneous explanation? This is indeed my august ancestor's younger uncle, [Wang] Tzu-ch'iao, who has wanted to come and invite me [to become an immortal]." When, outside [the court, Wang] Mang's armies Wang Yi Made Heir-Apparent had been routed and, inside [the court], his greatest ministers had rebelled, so that none of those about him could be trusted, he could no longer deliberate [with them] about matters at a distance in the commanderies 454WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vii A.D. 23, Aug./Sept. and kingdoms. When he wanted to summon 99C: 24a [Wang] Yi5 and make plans with him, Ts'ui Fa said, "[Wang] Yi5 is habitually cautious. Now that 23a he has lost a large force, if he is summoned, I fear that he will grasp his credentials and commit suicide. It would be proper that you should in some great manner console his feelings." Thereupon [Wang] Mang sent [Ts'ui] Fa in a galloping quadriga with verbal instructions for [Wang] Yi5, [saying], "I am aged and have no24.2 24.2 The Official ed. has emended to . son by my legitimate wives. I wish to transmit the empire to you, Yi. It is ordered that you shall not need to beg pardon [for your defeat] and when I receive you in audience you shall not again speak [of the past]." [When Wang] Yi5 arrived, he was made the Commander-in-chief. The Grand Prolonger of Autumn, Chang2 Han, became the Grand Minister Over the Masses. Ts'ui Fa became the Grand Minister of Works. The Director of the Palaces and Shelterer 29b of Long Life, Miao Hsin, became the State Master. The Marquis of Like Delight, [Wang] Lin2, became the General of the Guard. [Wang] Mang was so distressed and worried that he could not eat. He only drank wine, ate shellfish,24.3 24.3 Ts'ao Ts'ao also liked to eat shellfish. Su Shih (1036-1101), in his "Shellfish Song (Fu-yÃ¼ Hsing)" (in the Tung-p'o Hsien-sheng Shih-chi-chu 30: 33b) has the apt couplet, "Two strong men who alike robbed the Han dynasty In what they liked were also shoulder to shoulder." (Reference from Wang Hsien-ch'ien). and read books on military matters. When he was tired, he would rest [his head] upon his stool and sleep without again seeking his pillow. Magical Defenses By nature, [Wang Mang] loved the numerology of lucky times and days.24.4 24.4 The phrase hsiao-shu is also used in HS 30: 40a, which says, "But when those who restricted themselves to [the school of Yin and Yang] concerned themselves with [this subject], they tied themselves to prohibitions and abstentions, and became mired in numerology (hsiao-shu)." When moreover matters 455WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, vi 99 C: 24a, b became urgent, he merely repressed them by incanta- A.D. 23, Aug./Sept. tions. He sent a commissioner to destroy the screening walls at the gates to the parks of the Wei Tomb and the Yen Tomb, saying, "Do not cause the common 24b people to think of the Han [Dynasty] again."24.5 24.5 A magical play on words. "think again" was another writing for , "screening wall"; cf. HFHD, I, 250, n. 3. Wang Nien-sun points out that after there has dropped out the word , which is still read in T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 89: 11b &amp; 185: 8a, Han-chi 30: 19a, and Shui-ching Chu 16: 17b, sub the Ku River. He also used black to defile the color of their surrounding walls.24.6 24.6 Prof. Duyvendak remarks that this blackening of the walls was to remove the red color of the Han dynasty. He entitled his generals,24.7 24.7 Chou Shou-ch'ang says that a Sung ed. in small characters (xii or xiii cent.) reads for . The Southern Academy ed. also has this good reading. The Ching-yu ed. reads the latter. "The general for whom [the planet] Jupiter rests in [the cyclical sign] shen and [the element] water is an assistant,"24.8 24.8 This seems to be one of the first times the cyclical characters were used to denote a year. But A.D. 24, not A.D. 23, has the cyclical character shen. Professor Duyvendak remarks that shen corresponds to the power metal, so that the emphasis was upon the power, rather than upon the year. "the Colonel who honors [the cyclical sign] keng and injures [the element] wood,"24.9 24.9 Professor Duyvendak points out that keng also corresponds to the power metal. and "the Chief Commandant who sets [the cyclical sign] ping in front and glorifies [the element] metal."24.10 24.10 Professor Duyvendak remarks that ping corresponds to the power fire, the Han dynasty's virtue. He also [gave titles] reading, "[The military leader] holding a great axe to chop down withered wood," [and, "The military leader] causing great waters to run, extinguishing any fire that has arisen."24.11 24.11 Professor Duyvendak notes that "axe" is also metal and that "fire" denotes the Han dynasty. The emphasis throughout these titles is on the power metal, which was believed to govern the sending out and movements of the imperial army, the punishment of rebels and traitors, and the ending of violence and disturbance; cf. HS 27 A: 17b; W. Eberhard, "BeitrÃ¤ge zur kosmologischen Spekulation der Chinesen der Han-Zeit," p. 19. The things of this sort [that he did and said are too many] to be recorded completely. 456WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV A.D. 23, Sept. Autumn In the autumn, Venus moved into [the constel- 99 C: 24b lation] T'ai-wei, and lighted the earth like the light of the moon.24.12 24.12 HHS, Tr. 10: 5a, b lists this circumstance and interprets it, "Venus carries out military deeds; [the constellation] T'ai-wei is the court of Heaven. Venus was victorious and went north, entering T'ai-weiâthis [circumstance] is the general-in-chief entering the court of the Son of Heaven." The first star of T'ai-wei, ? Leo, was then in R.A. 141Â°; Venus reached this R.A. on the evening of July 4 and again on Sept. 29, according to calculation by the tables in C. Schoch, Planeten-Tafeln fÃ¼r Jederman. At that time it had attained a declination of 13.9Â° north of the equator, confirming the phrase "went north." It had a magnitude of -4.2âso bright that it could easily be seen in daytime by anyone who knew where to look for it, hence it is not surprising that it was said to have lighted the earth like the moon. "Autumn" began with the first day of the seventh month, which was Aug. 6 of this year, so that "autumn" is confirmed. Venus was again in T'ai-wei when Wang Mang was killed and with an even greater brillianceâit is not surprising that this apt astrological interpretation should have made an impression. Rebellion in the West Wei Ts'ui and his elder brother, [Wei Yi, men from] Ch'eng-chi, together kidnapped the Grand Governor [of T'ien-shui Commandery], Li YÃ¼5?. 23b They made their elder brother's son, Wei Ao, their General-in-chief, and attacked and killed the Shepherd of Yung Province, Ch'en Ch'ing, and the Director of a Confederation at An-ting [Commandery], 30a Wang HsÃ¼n1,24.13 24.13 HHS, Mem. 3: 4b names this man, "the Grand Governor of An-ting [Commandery], Wang Hsiang ." and joined his force [with their own]. They sent a letter to the commanderies and counties enumerating [Wang] Mang's crimes and wickednesses, [saying that they were] ten thousand [times the number of those committed by] Chieh and Chou.24.14 24.14 This letter is quoted in HHS, Mem. 3: 2a-4b. Cf. Glossary sub Wei Hsiao. Attack from the South In this month, Teng Yeh and YÃ¼ K'uang, men from [the prefecture of] Hsi5, raised troops at Nan-hsiang [to the number of] more than a hundred men. At that time, the Ruler of Hsi5 led several thousand troops and garrisoned the Ch'iao Commune to defend the Wu Pass. [Teng] Yeh and [YÃ¼] K'uang said to 457WANG MANG, TI-huang IV 99 C: 24 b, 25a the Ruler, "An Emperor of the Liu [clan] has already A.D. 23, Sept./Oct. been set up. Why do you, sir, not recognize the mandate [of Heaven]?" The Ruler [thereupon] begged [permission] to surrender, [and so Teng Yen and YÃ¼ K'uang] secured all of his band. [Teng] Yeh called himself the General of the Left Supporting the Han [Dynasty] and [YÃ¼] K'uang [called himself] the General of the Right [Supporting the Han Dynasty]. They took Hsi5 and Tan-shui by storm. When they attacked the Wu Pass, the Chief Commandant [of the Pass], Chu Meng, surrendered. 25a They advanced and attacked the Western Neighboring Commandery Grandee, Sung Kang, and killed him. Then they went west and took Hu2 by storm. [When Wang] Mang was all the more worried and did not know what to do, Ts'ui Fa said, "[According to] the Chou Offices and Mr. Tso's [Commentary on] the Spring and Autumn, whenever a state has a great visitation, [the ruler] should weep, in order to repress [the evil].25.1 25.1 Tso-chuan, Dk. HsÃ¼an, XII, (Legge, p. 311, 316), says, "When the Viscount of Ch'u had besieged Cheng to the seventeenth day, the people of Cheng divined by the tortoise whether they should end their struggle, [and the reply] was unfavorable. Then they divined by the tortoise whether they should lament in the Grand [Ancestral] Temple and set out their chariots in the streets, [and the reply] was favorable, so the people of the state held a great lamentation and the defenders of the parapets all wept." Ibid., Dk. Chao, XXI, (Legge, 68611, 689) records that in the state of Lu, Shu Ch'Ãª wept for the eclipse of the sun in 520 B.C. Chou-li 26: 6b, sub the Female Shaman (nÃ¼-wu) (Biot, II, 104) says, "Whenever in the country there is a great visitation, [the Female Shamans] sing and weep in order to beg [the divinities]," and Cheng HsÃ¼an explains, "Some sing and some weep. They hope to move the gods in heaven and earth to pity." Hence the Book of Changes says, `He at first wails and cries out, but later laughs.'25.2 25.2 Book of Changes, Hex. 13, 5 (Legge, p. 86; Wilhelm, I, 42). It 30b would be proper to cry out and sigh, in giving information to Heaven, in order to seek for rescue." [Wang] Mang himself knew that he would be defeated, but he led his courtiers to the Southern Place 458WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV A.D. 23, Sept./Oct. for the Suburban Sacrifice [to Heaven], set out his 99 C: 25a mandates [by means of] portents from first to last, 24a looked up to Heaven, and said, "Since thou, August Wang Mang Appeals to the Gods and Weeps. Heaven, hast given thy mandate to thy subject, Mang, why doest thou not immediately order extirpated the bands [of troops] and the robbers? But if thy servant Mang has done wrong, I wish that thou wouldst send down thy thunderbolt to execute thy servant Mang." Thereupon he struck his heart with his palm and wept loudly. When his breath was exhausted, he prostrated himself and knocked his head [upon the ground]. He also composed a document giving information to Heaven, setting out his own important achievements, in more than a thousand words. The various Masters and uninfluential common people met in the mornings and evenings to weep, and for them he established repasts of congee. Those who were [really] melancholy, together with those who were able to recite the words of his document, were made Gentlemen.25.3 25.3 Han-chi 30: 19a says that these persons were entitled Crying and Sighing Gentlemen . [They numbered] more than five thousand persons. Tai YÃ¼n led them. [Wang] Mang installed nine persons as Generals, all of whom had "tiger" as their title. They were called the Nine Tiger [Generals]. They led several ten-thousand picked soldiers from the Northern Army and went eastwards. Their wives and children were taken into the palaces, to serve as hostages. His Stinginess and Wealth At this time, in the inner apartments [of the Wei-yang Palace], ten thousand catties of actual gold were put into one chest and there still remained sixty chests.25.4 25.4 Gold was cast into square cake-shaped ingots an inch on a side, weighing a catty (24 B: 1b) and worth ten thousand cash. At 244 g. per catty (HFHD, I, 280) a chest contained 2,440,000 grams or 78,448 oz. troy, worth, at present prices, U. S. $2,745,680. Sixty chests, if full, contained 146,400,000 g. or 4,706,880 oz. troy. With this huge treasure may be compared the amount of gold brought to Spain from the Americas between 1503 and 1660, which E. J. Hamilton (American Treasure and the Price Revolution in Spain, p. 42) finds to have been 181,333,180 g., or 5,829,996 oz. troy. For the reliability of this statement, cf. App. II, p. 479ff. In each of [the offices] of the Yellow 459WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV 99 C: 25a, b Gate and of the Intendant of Palace Parks in the A.D. 23, Sept./Oct. storehouses, and [in the workshop of] the Empress's Master of Recipes, there were [also] several chests. In the Imperial Wardrobe at the Ch'ang-lo [Palace], the Empress's Wardrobe and the storehouses of the 25b 31a [Bureau of] Equalization and Standards in the capital25.5 25.5 Yen Shih-ku remarks that the Imperial treasury was under the Privy Treasurer. The Empress was called the Inner Palace; cf. Glossary sub voce. Yen Shih-ku explains, "The was the treasury of the Empress." The Bureau of Equalization was under the Grand Minister of Agriculture (the state treasurer), called by Wang Mang the Communicator. there was [in addition] very much cash, silk, pearls, jade, and valuables. [Wang] Mang became [even] more parsimonious with them, and granted [only] four thousand cash to each of the soldiers of the Nine Tiger [Generals].25.6 25.6 Contrast the thousand catties of actual gold given to Tou Jung a little later under similar circumstances, probably at the solicitation of Wang Yi5; cf. HHS, Mem. 13: 1b. Their troops were greatly discontented, so that they had no intention of fighting. The Nine Tiger [Generals] reached the Hui Gorge Kuan-chung Invaded at Hua-yin and blocked the defiles to the north along the [Yellow] River and south to the mountains. YÃ¼ K'uang, with several thousand crossbow [men], mounted the [Feng-ling] mound to provoke a battle. Teng Yeh, leading more than twenty thousand men, went south from Wen-hsiang Highroad and came out of the Tsao-[hsiang] Highroad and the Tso-ku [River valley], routed one division [of soldiers], went north, 24b came out behind the Nine Tiger [Generals], and attacked them. Six Tiger [Generals] were defeated and fled. [Of these six], Shih Hsiung and Wang K'uang4a came to the [Palace] portal [and asked for pardon and permission] to return home to die.25.7 25.7 For this phrase, cf. Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, III, (Legge, 4195, 420b); HHS, Mem. 5: 2a9. 460WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV A.D. 23, Sept. [Wang] Mang sent a messenger to reproach [them, 99 C: 25b, 26a saying], "How is it that those who should be dead are [still] alive?" so they both committed suicide. Four [defeated] Tiger [Generals] fled. Three Tiger [Generals], Kuo Ch'inb, Ch'en Hui, and Ch'eng Chung, collected the scattered troops and took refuge in the Capital Granary. 26a Teng Yeh opened the Wu Pass and invited in Li Sung, the Han [dynasty's] Director of Service to the Lieutenant Chancellor. He led more than two thousand 31b men and came to Hu2. With [Teng] Yeh and the others, they together attacked the Capital Granary. When it did not surrender, [Teng] Yeh made a Division Head of Hung-nung [Commandery], Wang Hsien4, his Colonel. [The latter] led several hundred men north, crossed the Wei [River], and entered the territory of Tso-p'ing-yi [Commandery], making cities surrender and overrunning territory. Li Sung sent a Lieutenant General, Han Ch'en, and others, to go across westwards to Hsin-feng, where [Han Another Defeat Ch'en] fought a battle with [Wang] Mang's General of the Po River, [Tou Jung. The General of] the Po River fled.26.1 26.1 According to HHS, Mem. 13: 1b, Tou Jung had been installed as General of the Po River and was stationed at Hsing-feng. Ch'ien Ta-hsin remarks that when Pan Ku was preparing his History, the Tou clan was very powerful, hence he did not mention this name. Cf. Glossary, sub Tou Jung. Han Ch'en and the others pursued the fleeing [troops], and so they came to Ch'ang-men.26.2 26.2 The present text reads, "Ch'ang-men Palace." But this Palace was inside the city of Ch'ang-an (cf. Glossary sub Ch'ang-men). There was a place by the name of Ch'ang-men near Ch'ang-an, but nothing is said of any palace located there; HHS, Tr. 10: 5b, in quoting this passage, omits the word for "Palace." This word seems to have been an interpolation made by someone who knew about the Palace and did not know the place-name. Wang Hsien4 went north to P'in-yang, and wherever he passed, [the people came out] to welcome him and 461WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV 99 C: 26a, b surrender. [People] of the powerful clans, Shen A.D. 23, Sept./Oct. The Kuan-chung People Welcome the Invaders. Tang of YÃ¼eh-yang and Wang Ta of Hsia-kuei, both led their bands to follow [Wang] Hsien4. From counties in [the capital commanderies], Chuang Ch'un from T'ai, Tung Hsi from Mou-ling, Wang Meng4b from Lan-t'ien, Ju Ch'en from Huai-li, Wang Fu2b from Chou-chih, Chuang Pen from Yang-ling, T'u-men Shao from Tu-ling, and the like, whose bands all [numbered] several thousand men, took 25a titles and called themselves Generals of the Han [dynasty]. At this time, Li Sung and Teng Yeh considered that although the Capital Granary was a very small [place], if they had not yet been able to make it surrender, how much more [this would be the case with] the city of Ch'ang-an, so that it would be necessary for them to wait until the great army of the Keng-shih Emperor arrived [before attacking Ch'ang-an]. When they thereupon led their armies to Hua-yin 32a to prepare implements for attacking [Ch'ang-an], troops from [places] neighboring Ch'ang-an however assembled from all quarters below the [Ch'ang-an] Ch'ang-an Attacked city walls. It was reported that the troops of the Wei clan from T'ien-shui [Commandery]26.3 26.3 Wei Ao and his followers, among whom were Pan Piao and Pan Ku; cf. HHS, Mem. 30 A: 1a. They had then taken An-ting Commandery, just over the border in the present Kansu, on the upper reaches of the Ching River; cf. HHS, Mem. 3: 4b. would presently arrive, so they all rivaled [one another], wanting to be the first to enter the city, for they were covetous of the profit [they would gain by] achieving the great glory [of executing Wang Mang] and from kidnapping and plundering [in the palaces]. [Wang] Mang sent commissioners separately to amnesty the convicts in the various prisons within the city and gave them all arms. [The commissioners 26b had] some swine killed, and had [the former A Convict Army Flees. convicts] drink the blood [of the swine, thereby] making an oath with them, saying, "If there is 462WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, x A.D. 23, Oct. 4, 5 anyone who is not for the House of Hsin, may the 99 C: 26b gods of the soils and the spirits remember it." The General of a New Beginning, Shih Shen, led them. They crossed the Wei [River] Bridge and all scattered and ran, [so that Shih] Shen returned empty[handed]. The Hsin Tombs Opened and its Temples Destroyed The bands of troops dug up the tomb-mounds of [Wang] Mang's wife, sons, father, and grandfather, and burnt their coffins and grave-vaults, together with his Nine [Ancestral] Temples, the Ming-t'ang, and the Pi-yung. The fire shone into the city. Someone said to [Wang] Mang, "The soldiers at the city gates are people from the east, so that they cannot be trusted." [Wang] Mang [accordingly] changed them and mobilized men from the Picked Cavalry to be the guards [for the city gates], establishing one Colonel at each Gate with six hundred men. Oct. 4 In the tenth month, on [the day] mou-shen, the Ch'ang-an Entered first day of the month, the troops entered by way of the HsÃ¼an-p'ing City Gate, which among the common people is called the Capital Gate. Chang2 Han was inspecting the city gates, happened upon the troops, and was killed. Wang Yi5, Wang Lin2, Wang HsÃ¼n2, Tai YÃ¼n, and others separately led troops to 32b resist the attack outside the Northern Portal [of the Palace]. The Han troops were ambitious for enfeoffment [in reward for killing Wang] Mang and more than seven hundred of them fought strenuously. When it happened that the sun went down, [the people in] the government yamens, the lodges 25b [for the commanderies and kingdoms], and the residences [adjoining the Palace] had all run away and fled. Oct. 5 On the second day [of the month, the day] chi-yu, The Palace Set on Fire some young people from within the city [of Ch'ang-an], Chu Ti, Chang YÃ¼2, and others, who had feared that they would be kidnapped or robbed, and had shouted vehemently in response to [the invaders], 463WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, x 99 C: 26b, 27a set fire to the Artisans' Chamber Gate [an inner gate A.D. 23, Oct. 5 in the northwestern part of the Wei-yang Palace], and hacked open a side door of the [Hall] of Reverence for the Law, calling out, "You rebellious caitiff, Wang Mang, Why do you not come out and surrender?"26.4 26.4 There is a rime or assonance between the last words of these two lines: , mang &lt; mwÃ¢ng &lt; *mwÃ¢ng, and , hsiang &lt; yÃ¥ng &gt; *g'Ã´ng (Karlgren, Gram. Serica, #709a, 1015a). The fire reached to the Ch'eng-ming [Hall] in the Lateral Courts, where the Princess of the Yellow Imperial House dwelt. [Wang] Mang fled from the fire to the HsÃ¼an Room, and the fire in the Front Hall immediately followed him. The Palace Maids and women wailed, saying, "What must we do?" 27a At that time [Wang] Mang had on uniformly Magical Defenses purple garments,27.1 27.1 Yen Shih-ku explains, "Kan is a color that is a deep blue, showing a red [tinge] ." Dr. Duyvendak notes that purple is the color corresponding to the Pole Star, the imperial symbol. Mh III, 340 gives the name "the Lilac Purple Palace (tzu-kung )" to the four asterisms about the Pole Star. The Supreme One, the divine ruler of the universe, has his regular habitation in the Pole Star (Mh, III, 339), so that the color of this area is appropriate to the human ruler of all under heaven. Kan (deep purple) was a deeper purple than tzu (lilac purple). By wearing the color of the Supreme One, Wang Mang was by sympathy attracting protection from this supreme power. was girded with his imperial seals and apron and held the Lord of YÃ¼, [Shun's], dagger with a spoon on the end of its hilt; an Astrological Gentleman held a diviner's board before him,27.2 27.2 The Official ed. has emended an1-shih1 to an2-shih2 . Yen Shih-ku's comment reads, "A shih1 is what is used to divine the seasons and days," hence his text read shih2. Chou-li 26: 9a, sub the Grand Astrologer, (T'ai-shih) (Biot, II, 108 &amp; n. 5), says, "When the great army [starts out, the Grand Astrologer] holds [the board for determining] Heaven's times, and [travels] in the same chariot as the Grand Master [of Music]." Cheng Chung glosses, "When a great army starts out, then the Grand Astrologer has charge of holding the diviner's board, in order [to be able] to tell Heaven's times and to determine whether they are lucky or unlucky." The bibliography in HS 30: 72a sub the school of the Five Powers, lists, "[Mr.] Hsien-men's Method [of Using] the Diviner's Board, in 20 rolls and [Mr.] Hsien-men's Divining Board, in 20 rolls." (For Hsien-men Tzu-kao, the immortal, cf. Mh II, 165, n. 1; III, 432, 436). The Ta-t'ang Liu-tien 14: 27b, sub the T'ai-p'u Ling, contains a description of the board used in T'ang times. It had the zodiacal constellations engraved on it. At the Wang Hsu Tomb and at the Painted Basket Tomb in Korea a set of Han divining boards were found; a photograph is found in Plate 6 to W. C. Rufus, "Korean Astronomy," in Trans. of Korea Br. Roy. As. Soc'y, vol. 26. and for the day and hour he added [the appropriate] layout [on the board. Wang] Mang had turned about 464WANG MANG, Ti-huang, IV, x A.D. 23, Oct. 5, 6 his mat and sat according to [the position] of the 99 C: 27a, b handle to the [Heavenly] Bushel, saying, "Heaven begat the virtue that is in me. The Han troopsâ what can they do to me?"27.3 27.3 He made magical use of Confucius' saying in time of danger, "Heaven begat the virtue that is in me. Huan T'uiâwhat can he do to me?" Analects, VII, xxii. 33a For some time, [Wang] Mang had not eaten, which had lessened his energy, so that he had become exhausted. On the morning of the third day [of the Oct. 6 month, the day] keng-hsÃ¼, when it was light, a group Wang Mang Flees to The Tower Bathed by Water. of courtiers supported [Wang] Mang from the Front Hall southwards down the Zanthoxylum Stairs, and westwards out of the White Tiger Gate. The Duke of Peace to [the House of] Hsin, Wang Yi6, had charge of the chariot and drove it outside the [Palace] Gate. [Wang] Mang went in the chariot to the 27b Tower Bathed [by Water], intending to rely upon the water of the pond [as a magical defence],27.4 27.4 Water, the element in the pond, puts out fire, the Han dynasty's element, represented by the attackers. and planning to hold in his arms the mandates [given through] portents and majestic tou-[measures]. The 26a ministers, Grandees, Palace Attendants, [Attendants of] the Yellow Gate, Gentlemen, and Royal Retinue, who were still more than a thousand persons, followed him. Wang Yi5 had been fighting day and night and was extremely fatigued; when his men had almost all been killed or wounded, they galloped into the Palace and, by a difficult and roundabout route, reached the 465WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, x 99 C: 27b Tower Bathed [By Water. When Wang Yi5] saw his A.D. 23, Oct. 6 son, the Palace Attendant, [Wang] Mu, taking off his robes and bonnet, with the intention of escaping, [Wang] Yi5 scolded him, ordering him to return, [so that the two], father and son, together defended [Wang] Mang. When the men of the army entered the [Palace] Halls, they called out, "Where is the rebellious caitiff, Wang Mang?" and a Beauty came out of a room and said, "He is in the Tower Bathed [By Water]." The bands of soldiers pursued after him, and surrounded it several hundred deep. Those on the Tower also exchanged shots with them, using bows and crossbows, but gradually dropped out and left [off shooting]. When their arrows were exhausted, so that they had no way of returning shots, they met [the attackers] with their short weapons. Wang Yi5 and his son,27.5 27.5 For , the Ching-yu ed., the Southern Academy ed., and the Official ed. read . Wang Yi5's father, Wang Shang, had died in 11 B.C. [Wang Mu], Tai YÃ¼n, and Wang HsÃ¼n2, 33b died fighting, [whereupon Wang] Mang entered the room [on top of the Tower]. In the very late afternoon,27.6 27.6 HS 26: 46b, in enumerating the periods of the day, lists the period hsia-pu as the period before sunset and after the period pu , which latter was about 3 to 5 p.m. the bands of soldiers went up the tower. Wang Yi6, Chao Po, Miao Hsin, T'ang Tsunb, Wang Sheng, the Regular Palace Attendant Wang Ts'an, and others all died on top of the Tower. Tu Wu,27.7 27.7 The San-fu Chiu-shih (attributed to Wei Piao, d. A.D. 89; book lost) collected fragments, p. 15b, says, "A butcher, Tu YÃ¼ , killed [Wang] Mang by his own hand." The Tung-kuan Han-chi (A.D. 58-225; book lost, fragments collected) 23: 4a also writes "Tu YÃ¼." But HHS, Tr. 10: 5b, copying this sentence, says, "A man from Shang, Tu Wu killed [Wang] Mang." Chou Shou-ch'ang remarks that anciently wu and yÃ¼ interchanged. Shang was a place along the road through the Wu Pass to Ch'ang-an, that this man probably came with the forces attacking the capital. Wang Mang Killed a man from [the prefecture of] Shang, killed [Wang] Mang and took his [seals]27.8 27.8 The word "seals " has probably dropped out before . Previously (p. 27a), it said that Wang Mang wore his seals; nowhere else is it said that anyone else secured the imperial seals before they passed into the possession of Wang Hsien4 (p. 28a). The seal-cords were threaded through the seals, so that it would be difficult to take the cords without also taking the seals. and cords. A Colonel 466WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV, x A.D. 23, Oct. from Tunghai [Commandery], Kung-pin Chiu, who 99 C: 27b, 28a had formerly been a [Gentleman] Dealing With the Rites, [a subordinate of] the Grand Messenger, saw [Tu] Wu and asked him where the owner of the seal-cords was. He replied, "In the room, in the northeast corner." [Kung-pin] Chiu recognized [Wang] Mang and cut off his head.27.9 27.9 Tung-kuan Han-chi 23: 4a says, "Kung-pin Chiu secured his head and transmitted and took it to YÃ¼an, [where the Keng-shih Emperor was], and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Hua." The men of the army cut [Wang] Mang's body to pieces. His members 28a and his flesh and bones were sliced and divided.28.1 28.1 Yen Shih-ku quotes the San-fu Chiu-shih (lost), as saying that luan is "to cut into a thousand pieces." HsÃ¼ Ling (507-583), in his "Letter to [the Northern Ch'i] Supervisor [of the Masters of Writing] Yang, [Tsun-yen]," in his works, HsÃ¼ Hsiao-mu Chi 4: 6a, says, "Wang Mang was mutilated by a thousand strokes." (Reference from Shen Ch'in-han.) "Those who killed each other in the struggle [to secure parts of Wang Mang's body numbered] several tens of persons."28.2 28.2 This sentence is identical with the similar statement at the death of Hsiang YÃ¼: cf. SC 7: 73 = Mh II, 320. It may have been a merely literary addition in Kung-pin Chiu's report of his deeds; cf. HFHD, III, 97. Kung-pin Chiu bore [Wang] Mang's head to Wang Hsien4. [Wang] Hsien4 called himself a Han Generalissimo and the troops in the city, [numbering] several hundred 26b thousand [men], were all subordinate to him. Wang Hsien's Fate He dwelt in the Eastern Palace, treated [the women in Wang] Mang's harem as his wives, rode in [Wang Mang's] carriages [and wore Wang Mang's] robes. Oct. 9 On the sixth day [of the month, the day] kuei-ch'ou, Li Sung and Teng Yeh entered Ch'ang-an. Generals Chao Meng and Shen-t'u Chien also arrived. Because Wang Hsien4 had received the imperial seals and cords and had not immediately sent them [to the Keng-shih Emperor], had taken many 467WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV 99 C: 28a, b of the women in the palace, and had set up the drums A.D. 23 and flags of the Son of Heaven, he was arrested and beheaded [for aspiring to the throne. Wang] Mang's 34a head was transmitted to the Keng-shih Emperorand was hung up in the market-place at YÃ¼an. The people all together picked up [things] and threw them at it. Some cut out and ate his tongue. The troops of [Wang] Mang's Shepherd of Yang28.3 28.3 The Southern Academy ed. and Official ed. emend to the more correct . The Ching-yu ed. reads the former. The Fate of Wang Mang's Officials: Li Sheng K'ung Jen Province, Li Sheng, and of the Director of Mandates [from the Five Majestic Principles], K'ung Jen, were defeated east of [the Kuan-chung] mountains. [Li] Sheng fought and was killed. [K'ung] Jen led his band and surrendered. Afterwards, he sighed and said, "I have heard that he who eats another's food must die in his service," so he drew his sword, stabbed himself, and died. The Department Head and Superintendant of a Division, Tu P'u, the Grand TuP'u Shen Yi Governor of Ch'en-ting [Commandery], Shen Yi, and the Leader of a Combination at Chiu-chiang [Commandery], Chia Meng, all moreover defended 28b their commanderies, did not surrender, and were executed Chia Meng by the Han troops. When the Grand Governor of Shang-tu [Commandery], Wang Ch'in, and Wang Ch'in Kuo Ch'in Kuo Ch'inb, who were defending the Capital Granary, heard that [Wang] Mang was dead, they surrendered. The Keng-shih [Emperor] [considered them] as righteous, and enfeoffed them both as marquises. The Grand Master, Wang K'uang1a, and the State Wang K'uang Ai Chang Chuang Yu Ch'en Mou General, Ai Chang, surrendered at Lo-yang. They were transported to YÃ¼an, where they were beheaded. After Chuang Yu and Ch'en Mou had been defeated below [the walls of] K'un-yang, they fled to Ch'iao in P'ei Commandery. They called themselves Han Generals and summoned and assembled officials and common people. [Chuang] Yu gave them an account, saying that Wang Mang had 468WANG MANG, Ti-huang IV A.D. 23 usurped the throne, that he would die at the time 99 C: 28b [allotted to him by] Heaven, and that the sage Han [dynasty] would revive again; [meanwhile Ch'en] Mou prostrated himself and wept. When they heard that the former Marquis of Chung-wub [under] the Han [dynasty], Liu Sheng5e, had collected a band in Ju-nan [Commandery] and was [going to be] entitled 34b by the imperial title, [Chuang] Yu and [Ch'en] Mou 27a surrendered to him. He made [Chuang] Yu his Commander-in-chief and [Ch'en] Mou his Lieutenant Chancellor. [After] more than ten days, he was defeated [by the Keng-shih Emperor's Generalissimo, Nov./ Liu Hsin4?, and Chuang] Yu and [Ch'en] Mou Dec.28.4 28.4 Cf. HHS, Mem. 1: 3a. both died. The commanderies and counties all offered their cities [to the Keng-shih Emperor] and surrendered, so that the whole empire returned to the Han [dynasty]. Ts'ui Fa Previously, Shen-t'u Chien had once served Ts'ui Fa [as a disciple, studying] the Book of Odes. When [Shen-t'u] Chien arrived, [Ts'ui] Fa surrendered to him, [but] later he again gave an [apologetic] account [of Wang Mang,28.5 28.5 This apology was preserved; Emperor Kuang-wu had Yin Min rebut "a comparison written in behalf of Wang Mang by Ts'ui Fa"; HHS, Mem. 69 A: 10a. Cf. HFHD, III, 95-96. so Shen-t'u] Chien directed the Lieutenant Chancellor [of the Keng-shih Emperor], Liu Tz'u4?, to behead [Ts'ui] Fa in order that he might accompany [his master, Wang Mang], in Shih Shen Others death. Shih Shen, Wang Yen2, Wang Lin2, Wang Wu2, and Chao Hung also surrendered but nevertheless were killed. Previously those soldiers who had taken titles every one hoped to be enfeoffed as a marquis, [but] because Shen-t'u Chien had beheaded Wang Hsien4 and also spread about [a report] that treacherous [persons from] the three capital commanderies had together 469WANG MANG, Keng-shih II, III 99 C: 28b, 29a killed their lord, [Wang Mang], the officials and com- A.D. 23-25 mon people [of Ch'ang-an] became afraid and the counties subordinate [to Ch'ang-an] assembled [troops, hence Shen-t'u] Chien and the others were unable to make them surrender. He galloped and advised [the Keng-shih Emperor of the situation]. In [the period] Keng-shih, the second year, the II second month, the Keng-shih [Emperor, Liu HsÃ¼an2? A.D. 24 Sheng-kung], reached Ch'ang-an. He issued an imperial March edict [granting] a general amnesty, [stating The Keng-shih Emperor Reaches Ch'ang-an that], except for the sons of Wang Mang, all others' crimes were expunged. Hence the [former imperial] Wang clan was able to be preserved and the three capital commanderies all became calm. The Keng-shih [Emperor] made Ch'ang-an his capital and lived in Ch'ang-lo Palace. The government 29a repositories were all intact. Only the Wei-yang Palace had been burnt. After [Wang] Mang [had been attacked] for three days and he had died, [the people of the capital commanderies] had lived peacefully in their homes and [everything] was as previously.29.1 29.1 Tung-kuan Han-chi 23:2b states that after the Keng-shih Emperor reached Ch'ang-an, "the bells and drums, the women and eunuchs of the [imperial] apartments, the several thousand offices and yamens, and [the people of the various] wards were peacefully as formerly. The Keng-shih [Emperor] ascended [the throne] in the Front Hall [of the Wei-yang Palace]." Hence there was sufficient left of even the audience in the Wei-yang Palace for the imperial throne to be set up in its former location. After the Keng-shih [Emperor] had arrived for a 35a year and more, his governmental instructions were no III [longer] obeyed. In the next year, in the summer,29.2 29.2 The Red Eyebrows entered Kuan-chung in Jan./Feb., A.D. 25, defeated the Keng-shih Emperor's generals in Feb./Mar. and Apr./May, set up Liu P'en-tzu as the Emperor in July/Aug., and entered Ch'ang-an in Oct./Nov. The Keng-shih Emperor fled and to them in Nov./Dec., upon the promise of a kingdom. He was probably murdered not long afterwards. Cf. Glossary, sub Fan Ch'ung &amp; Liu HsÃ¼an2?. A.D. 25 after the Red Eyebrows,29.3 29.3 A T'ang manuscript fragment of this chapter has been preserved, which consists 2Â½ leaves, 38 columns of the passage at the end of this chapter. The words shih and ming, which were the personal name of the Grand Exemplar of the T'ang dynasty, Emperor Wen, (reigned 627-649), lack a stroke. This manuscript furthermore contains Yen Shih-ku's comments, hence it was written after 641, when Yen Shih-ku completed his work. The word Sung, the personal name for the Condescending Exemplar, (the Shun-tsung, reigned 805), is written correctly. In T'ang times, the names of the Eminent Founder and the Grand Exemplar and of the seven emperors immediately preceding the reigning emperor were tabooed, hence this manuscript was written some time in 641-804 or 860-907 A.D. A photographic reprint is published in vol. 4 of the Ku-chi Ts'ung-ts'an, under the editorship of Lo Cheng-yÃ¼. The other manuscripts in this volume are from the cave at Tun-huang, hence this one probably also came thence, although nothing is specially said to that effect. Its variant readings exhibit a tendency to improve the literary quality of the writing. In this manuscript, the word is regularly written , which variant reading is now occasionally found in the HHS.

The Keng-shih [Emperor] surrendered to them. The Red Eyebrows thereupon burnt the palace-buildings, market-places, and wards in Ch'ang-an, and killed the Keng-shih [Emperor]. The common people starved and [even] ate others, so that the dead [numbered] several hundred thousand, Ch'ang-an became a waste, and inside the city walls there were no people going about.29.4 29.4 The T'ang mss. interchanges the words to read , a more literary reading. The [imperial ancestral] 27b temples, funerary parks, and tomb mounds were all dug up; only the Pa Tomb and the Tu Tomb were preserved intact. Aug. 529.5 29.5 HHS, An. 1 A: 15b. In the sixth month, the Epochal Exemplar, [Emperor Emperor Kuang-au Enthroned Kuang-wu], had ascended the throne, and thereafter the [imperial] ancestral temples and the mounds to the gods of the soils and grains were re-established [at Lo-yang], the empire was well governed and at peace. The Eulogy In eulogy we say: Wang Mang first arose [because he was one of] the maternal relatives [of Emperor 471WANG MANG 99 C: 29a, b Ch'eng].29.6 29.6 In the T'ang mss., after the , there are the words ", an offshoot of." He humbled himself and acted energetically, in order to seek for fame and reputation, so that his clan praised him as filial and his teachers and associates attributed benevolence to him.29.7 29.7 Cf. HS 99 A: 1b. When he occupied [a high] position and acted as [chief] assistant in the government, [during] the time in [the reigns of Emperors] Ch'eng and Ai, he toiled 7 B.C. diligently for the state and "pursued a straightforward course,"29.8 29.8 A saying of Confucius, from Analects XV, xxiv, 2âhigh praise of Wang Mang . [so that whenever he] acted, [his deeds] were reported in detail. Was he not [the sort of person] referred to [in the sayings, "Such a man] will certainly be heard of in his clan; he will certainly be heard of in his state," and "He assumes the appearance of benevolence, but his actions are contrary to it?"29.9 29.9 Sayings of Confucius, from Analects XII, xx, 6, with minor changes. Since [Wang] Mang did not [possess] benevolence, 35b but had a talent for flattery and evil and also took advantage of the power his four uncles, [Wang Feng, Wang Yin, Wang Shang1b, and Wang Ken, had exercised for] successive generations,29.10 29.10 Instead of , the T'ang mss. reads . and [because] it happened that the Han [dynasty] became weak in the midst [of its period] and the dynastic succession was thrice broken, so that in her old age the Empress 29b Dowager [nee Wang] became the mistress of the [imperial] clan, hence [Wang Mang] was able to give free rein to his viciousness and thereby to bring to pass the calamity of his usurpation [of the throne]. If we speak of [the situation by] investigating it from this [aspect], it was29.11 29.11 After , the T'ang mss. inserts the word . a time [set by] Heaven and not brought about by human effort. When he had stolen the throne and faced south, 472WANG MANG so that he occupied [a position which] he should not 99 C: 29b have seized, the influences29.12 29.12 The T'ang mss. reads for . which would overthrow [such a person] were more dangerous [in his case than in the cases of] Chieh and Chou, yet [Wang] Mang was tranquil and considered himself a second appearance of the Yellow [Lord] and YÃ¼ [Shun]. Then for the first time he gave rein to his desires29.13 29.13 In a note to HHS, Mem. 42: 2b11, Li Hsien says, "Tzu-hui is an attitude of being unwilling to heed the exhortations of others ." and displayed his tyrannousness and deceitfulness, being scornfully [hypocritical] towards Heaven29.14 29.14 An allusion to Book of History, I, iii, 11 (Legge, p. 24). The reference is to the Provider of Works of whom Yao says, "He appears to be respectful, [but he is actually] scornful of Heaven." The Han interpretation of this passage is found in SC 1: 29 MH I, 50. and oppressive towards the common people, exhausting 28a [the possibilities of] banefulness, and [attaining] the limit of evil. His poison diffused itself among all Chinese and [his power of causing] disorder [even] extended to the southern and northern barbarians, but this did not yet satisfy his desires. For this reason, [all] within the four seas29.15 29.15 The T'ang mss. omits the words and . murmured sadly and lost their joy in life. Within and outside [the country, people] were filled with resentment, [braves] far and near [the capital] all mobilized, his city-wall and moat was not defended, so that his members were cut to pieces. Thereupon he caused the cities and towns of the empire to become wastes, [while peoples'] grave mounds were [moreover] dug into, so that he injured all living people, and 36a his crimes reached [even] to rotten bones. Of the rebellious ministers and evil sons and of the unprincipled men who are recorded in books and records, if we investigate the calamities [they produced] and the ruin [they wrought], there have not been any as severe as [those produced by Wang] 473WANG MANG 99 C: 29b Mang. Anciently [the First Emperor of] the Ch'in [dynasty] burnt the Books of Odes and of History in order to establish his private proposals, while [Wang] Mang chanted the six canons in order to gloss over his wicked words. "They came to the same result but by different paths;"29.16 29.16 A quotation of Book of Changes, App. III, ii, 31 (Legge, p. 389). both thereby [came to] destruction.29.17 29.17 After , the T'ang mss. adds the word . They were both "dragons [who had flown] too high"29.18 29.18 An allusion to Book of Changes, App. II, Hex. 1, 6 (Legge, p. 267; Wilhelm, II, ), "A dragon [that has flown] too high will have to repent it; a state of fullness cannot long." The Official ed. and the Southern Academy ed. write for the , to accord with the reading in the Book of Odes, but the T'ang mss., the Ching-yu ed., and the Chi-ku-ko ed. confirm the reading in the latter reading. and whose breath was cut off, which was not the destiny [originally bestowed upon them by Heaven's] decree. They were [like] a purple color29.19 29.19 Ying Shao explains that purple is a mixed color. Professor Duyvendak notes the reference to Analects XVII, xviii, where Confucius states he dislikes purple and parallels it with obscene music. Professor Duyvendak explains that purple pretends to be red without being red. or a croaking sound,29.20 29.20 Ying Shao explains, "Wa is an evil sound." In his Yen-shih Chia-hsÃ¼n, ch. 17, . 16; B: 20a, Yen Chih-t'ui explains, "It probably means that it is not a blue color, [that of heaven], nor a yellow color, [that of earth], and that it is a sound which does not agree with the [twelve] musical tubes." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Wa is a disorderly sound in music, not [appropriate to] correct songs. Recent students say however that wa means merely the croaking of frogs,* [thus] mistaking its meaning. They also wish to change the wa-sheng of this eulogy to be `the sound of blue-flies (ying)', and quote the Book of Odes [I, viii, i, 1; Legge, p. 150]: `It was not the cock that was crowingâ It was the sound of blue flies,' thus following their caprice still further." Professor Duyvendak explains that wa may denote "a croaking sound which is a parody of music." At the sign *, after the word wa, the T'ang mss. adds the word , making the meaning clearer. I have compared the variant readings of this T'ang manuscript with those of five other editions of the HS: the Ching-yu ed. of 1035, the Wang Wen-sheng ed. of 1546, the Chi-ku-ko ed. of 1642, a Te-fan-tsui-lo-hsien ed., prob. between 1457 and 1573, and Wang Hsien-ch'ien's ed. of 1900. Including items in the Chinese notes (which are not mentioned in my notes), there are nineteen differences between this T'ang manuscript and other editions. In each case, these other five editions agree against the T'ang manuscript. In many cases, it can be seen that the T'ang manuscript is endeavoring to make plainer or easier the original text (cf. my notes 29.4, 29.9, 29.11, and the preceding paragraph of this note); in other cases they are errors of transcription. Evidently this scribe was not careful in his work and his variants are textually unimportant. or the leftover 474WANG MANG minutes [that are given] the place of an inter- 99 C: 29b, 30a 30a calation,29.21 29.21 Fu Ch'ien explains, "It means that [Wang] Mang did not obtain the real [Heavenly] decree of a [true] king, as the left-over parts of the months in a year make an intercalation." which are driven out by a sage-king.30.1 30.1 A phrase also found in SC 16: 38,9 = Mh III, 49. Su Lin explains that in this case the sage-king was Emperor Kuang-wu. 475 APPENDIX I THE PASSAGES IN "THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS" DEALING WITH WANG MANG The following two passages are the most important accounts of Wang Mang in the HS outside of his "Memoir" and are necessary in order to understand his period, hence they are translated here in full. They occur at the end of the first and second parts of this "Treatise." There are a few additional passages dealing with this period: the section in the "Memoir on the Huns" (HS ch. 94) is translated in de Groot, Die Hunnen der vorchristlichen Zeit, ch. XX-XXII. The few scattered matters in the "Memoir on the Western Frontier Regions" (HS ch. 96) are to be found in his companion volume, Chinesischen Urkunden zur Geschichte Asiens (cf. his index sub Wang Mang). The passage (about a page) in the "Memoir on the Southwestern Barbarians" (HS ch. 95) is translated by A. Wylie in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, vol. 9 (1879/1880), p. 64, 65. There is also a brief section at the end of the "Treatise on the Suburban Sacrifices and State Offerings to the Spirits" (HS ch. 25, which is not translated; it deals with Wang Mang's alterations in the state sacrifices and his attempts to secure immortality). Other passages dealing with this period, found in the various biographies of the HS and HHS, are abstracted in the Glossary. With these accounts, the reader should be able to secure a well-rounded view of Wang Mang and his period. After this translation had been prepared and sent to press, there appeared a translation of these two passages in Food &amp; Money in Ancient China, Han Shu 24, by Nancy Lee Swann (Princeton University Press, 1950). The difficulty of altering a proof which was already in page form has however prevented me from referring to this translation. 476 THE HISTORY OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter XXIV THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS PART A 24A: 20b After Emperor P'ing died,20.1 20.1 This statement is all that the Treatise says concerning the period when Wang Mang was ruling for Emperor P'ing. Wang Mang occupied 19a 15b [the post of] Regent and thereupon usurped the A.D. 6 throne. Wang Mang profited from the Han [dynasty's] Conditions at the End of the Former Han Dynasty estate, inheriting its peacefulness: the Huns had pronounced themselves its tributaries and the many barbarians had submitted respectfully, so that wherever boats or carriages could go, all [people] were its male or female subjects,20.2 20.2 Cf. 99 A: n. 26.9. and its yamens and treasuries [exhibited] "the richness of its host of officers,"20.3 20.3 A quotation from Analects XIX, xxiii, 3. with the result that the empire was at 21a rest. In one morning, [Wang] Mang possessed them [all, but] his mind and intentions were not yet satisfied. Wang Mang Changes Titles and Arouses Resentment. He despised the institutions of the Han dynasty, considering them to be lax. Emperor HsÃ¼an had first granted the [Hun] Shan-yÃ¼ an imperial seal like that of the Son of Heaven, and [the Marquis of] Kou-t'ing, [Wu Po], a southwestern barbarian, had been entitled a king. [Wang] Mang however sent a commissioner to change the seal A.D. 921.1 21.1 Cf. 99 B: 11b. of the Shan-yÃ¼ [to be an ordinary official seal] and degraded the King of Kou-t'ing to be a marquis. 16a Not until then did these two quarters become resentful A.D. 10/11 and trespass the borders. [Wang] Mang thereupon Dec./ raised an army, mobilizing a multitude of three Jan.21.2 21.2 Cf. 99 B: 14a ff. hundred thousand [men], intending to go out [of the 477THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 A: 21a country] simultaneously by ten routes and at one A.D. 9 stroke to annihilate the Huns. He solicited and 19b mobilized the empire's convicts, freemen, and armed Armies Mobilized soldiers, to transport supplies and bring military implements. From the seacoast, the Yangtze and the Huai Rivers, to the northern borders, commissioners, [riding in] galloping quadrigae, supervised and urged them, [so that all] within [the four] seas were disturbed.21.3 21.3 A sentence also found in 99 B: 14b. Moreover, whenever [Wang Mang] acted, he desired to imitate ancient [practises], and did not consider what was appropriate to the times,21.4 21.4 A statement characteristic of the Legalists (Bodde, China's First Unifier, p. 214f); perhaps also of the Confucianists. Mencius says that Confucius was timely (V, ii, i, 5). so he divided up the provinces and commanderies, altered the duties [of officials], and created [new] offices. He issued an ordinance,21.5 21.5 This ordinance is quoted in a more elaborate form in 99 B: 8a-9a, q.v. which said, A.D. 921.5 21.5 This ordinance is quoted in a more elaborate form in 99 B: 8a-9a, q.v. "The Han dynasty reduced and lightened the land Land and Slaves Not to be Bought or Sold tax, taking [only] one-thirtieth, [but in addition] there were regularly [required] conscript service and capitation taxes, which [even] the sick and aged were all required to pay,21.6 21.6 A T'ang manuscript of HS 24 A has been preserved in Japan in the HÃ¶jÃ¶in of the Shimpuku Temple in Nagoya. Yang Shou-ching (1839-1915) had a tracing of it made in 1895; it was edited by Li Shu-ch'ang (1837-1897) and published as vol. 21 of the "Ku-yi Ts'ung-shu", under the title, Ying T'ang-hsieh-pen HS Shih-huo Chih. Unfortunately, this tracing is not always accurate. Dr. Takao Yamada has published a photolithographic facsimile, under the title, Han-sho Shokka-shi , under the auspices of the Koten Hozon-kai . This manuscript taboos the words shih-min (they usually lack a stroke; occasionally, as on folio leaf 7, reverse [b], column 7 of the facsimile, and 8a1,5, the word is written for min [this latter form of taboo is not in Ch'en YÃ¼an's list]). Shih-min was the personal name of Emperor Wen , the Grand Exemplar (the T'ai-tsung) of the T'ang dynasty. This manuscript also taboos the word chih , which was the personal name of Emperor Ta , the Eminent Exemplar (the Kao-tsung). The words tan (6a4) and yu (5a3, 10a3), which were the personal names of the Penetrating Exemplar (the Jui-tsung) and the Dynastic Exemplar (the Tai-tsung), respectively, are however written correctly. The word yung (16a9, 18b8, 19a2, 19b2, 20a7), which formed part of the personal name of Li K'o-yung, the founder of the Later T'ang dynasty, is also written correctly. At its inception, the T'ang rulers were quite lenient concerning taboos of imperial names. But as Confucianism became more and more influential, the observance of these taboos became more and more stressed, until, in the period of the Five Dynasties, which followed upon the fall of the T'ang dynasty, imperial taboos were observed strictly. (Cf. Ch'en YÃ¼an, Shih-hui ChÃ¼-li, p. 95b.) In the T'ang period, there were tabooed the personal names of the seven immediately preceding generations of emperors, and also those of the dynastic founders, as well as that of the reigning emperor, i.e., those of the Eminent Founder (the Kao-tsu), the Grand Exemplar, the Eminent Exemplar, the seven emperors immediately preceding, and the reigning sovereign. (Cf. ibid., p. 49b.) From the above noted phenomena, this manuscript was written in either of two periods: (1) between 650 (when the Eminent Exemplar began his reign) and the reign of the Penetrating Exemplar, i.e., 684 (when he was first enthroned) or 710 (when he began his independent reign), or else (2) after the seventh reign after that of the Dynastic Exemplar, down to the end of the T'ang period, i.e., in 847-904. On the back of this scroll there has been transcribed the Buddhist Amida Sutra, with a colophon stating that it was written in the second year of the period Kaho , a Japanese date corresponding to 1095. The scroll is doubly boxed. On the outer box is written the words, " Handwriting of Tachibana no Hayanari." The inner box also has this attribution inscribed on it; on the cover of this box is the signature of Kohitsu RyÃ´han (1827-1853), who came of a family for generations acknowledged to be authorities on matters of ancient handwriting, so that this attribution is very likely from him. Hayanari went to China in the closing years of the Enriki period (782-805) and after his return served in the court, being noted for his calligraphy. At the end of the scroll is a vermillion seal, that of the Office of Civil Affairs, used on official documents from 770 to some date before 864. It is then quite possible that this manuscript was written in the middle of the ix century by Hayanari, after his return from China. In that case it represents an exemplar then preserved in Japan. Hayanari was made Governor of Tajima Province in 840; the date of his death is unknown. Dr. Yamada however seems to place little reliance upon the attribution of this scroll to Hayanari. He and his colleagues believe that this scroll comes from the early Nara period (646-710). (I thank Dr. Shio Sakanishi, formerly of the Library of Congress, for the above information.) There is the further possibility that this manuscript is a copy by Hayanari or some other Japanese scribe of a Chinese exemplar then preserved in Japan. Dr. Sakanishi states that no Japanese would have taken any liberties in copying an old Chinese manuscript, not even altering the writing to conform to Chinese taboos that had arisen after the exemplar had been written. If so, this exemplar was written between 650 and 684 or 710 and the present manuscript was written between 650 and the first part of the ninth century, to possibly about 820, when that seal ceased to be used. At this point, this T'ang manuscript omits the word after the . while powerful common people 478THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 9 beset and encroached upon21.7 21.7 The T'ang manuscript reads for , and omits the word , although space is left for it.

The rich were proud21.8 21.8 The Official ed. has emended to , but the T'ang mss. and other texts read the former word. and did evil, and the poor became destitute and acted wickedly. Both [of them] fell into crime, so that the punishments [had to be] employed and could not be set aside. "Now I am changing the names of the cultivated 21b fields in the empire to be `the King's fields,' and of male and female slaves to be `private adherents.' All are not to be permitted to be bought or sold. Let it be that those [rich families with] eight males or less, who have more cultivated fields than those in one ching [900 mou], shall divide the cultivated fields that are in excess [of those in one ching] and give them to their nine [classes of] relatives or to [people in] their neighborhood." The punishment of those who violated this ordinance was as great as death. The institutions and regulations were moreover not 20a fixed, and the officials utilized [that fact] to do evil, so that the empire kept murmuring,21.9 21.9 The T'ang mss. reads only one , but in quoting Yen Shih-ku's note, it reads two. and those who fell into punishment were multitudes. The third year21.10 21.10 The T'ang mss., the Ching-yu ed., and the Official ed. read ; the Chi-ku-ko ed, and Wang Hsien-ch'ien read . This edict is also found in 99 B: 20a. afterwards, [because Wang] A.D. 12 Mang knew that the common people hated [his 16b arrangements], he issued an imperial edict, [saying], The Order Rescinded "Those who enjoy the income from the King's fields together with [those who have] private adherents, are all to be permitted to sell or buy them, and are 480THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D.12-22 not to be restricted by the law." His punishments 24 A: 21b, 22a were however very severe, and in other22.11 22.11 For the T'ang mss. writes , a graphic variant not found in the HS. [respects] his government was contrary to reason and disorderly. The People Suffer The troops at the border, [numbering] more than two hundred thousand men, relied upon the imperial government for food and clothing; [since Wang Mang's] means were insufficient, he repeatedly [exacted] unreasonable poll-taxes and imposts, so that the common people became all the more poor and impoverished. They constantly suffered from withering droughts, and there were no abundant harvests, so that the prices of the grains soared and were high. In his last years, robbers and bandits arose in great numbers, and when he mobilized armies to attack them, the generals and officials acted with free license outside [the capital], so that at the northern borders and in the regions of Ch'ing and HsÃ¼ [Provinces], A.D. 21 people ate each other. At Lo-yang and east of it, grain was two thousand [cash per] picul,21.12 21.12 Taken from T'ien K'uang's memorial in 99 C: 16a. [so A.D. 22 Wang] Mang sent [one of] the highest ministers and a general to open the various granaries in the eastern quarter, and to give and lend to those who were in extremity or indigent.21.13 21.13 Repeated from the edict quoted in 99 C: 17a. He also sent out by divisions grandees and internuncios to teach the common people to boil [parts of] trees and make a vegetable juice, [but] the vegetable juice could not be eaten, 20b [and the sending merely] made much trouble and 22a disturbance.21.14 21.14 Repeated in 99 C: 17b. The vagrant common people who entered the passes [of Kuan-chung numbered] several hundred thousand persons, [so Wang Mang] established an Office for Maintenance and Relief,22.1 22.1 Where this sentence is repeated in 99 C: 18a, is used for the here. in order to distribute [grain] to them, [but] the officials 481THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 A: 22a robbed them of their grain allowances, so that seven or eight-tenths of them died of hunger.22.2 22.2 For the of the other texts, the T'ang mss. writes . I have compared this T'ang manuscript with the Ching-yu ed. of 1035, with what seems to be a copy of the 1131 Szechuan large character ed., also a YÃ¼an reprint of a Sung Academy ed., the Te-fan-tsui-lo-hsien ed. (betw. 1457 &amp; 1573), the Wang Wen-sheng ed. of 1546, the Chi-ku-ko ed. of 1642, and the Wang Hsien-ch'ien ed. of 1900. In the part translated here, there are ten differences between the T'ang manuscript and these other texts. Except for the difference noted in n. 21.10, in every case these other editions agree against the readings of the Japanese T'ang manuscript. Its variants are then textually unimportant. No significent variations occur and some are sheer blunders. Cf. also Pelliot, BEFEO, 2 (1902), 335. [Wang] Mang was ashamed [to recognize that His Excuses these events] had arrived because of his [mis]government, so he issued imperial edicts which said, "I have met with the distresses of the nine dry years and [the untoward] occurrences in the 106 [years], of withering droughts, frosts, locusts, famines, repeated arrivals of `barbarians who have troubled the Chinese,' robbers 17a and bandits [who follow] a wicked course, and people who become vagrants and fall into [crime]. I am greatly saddened by it. This injurious emanation will [soon] end." Year by year he produced this explanation, until he came to ruin.22.3 22.3 This passage does not seem to be a quotation from any single edict, but merely a summary; cf. 99 B: 21a, 28a; C: 8b, 17a for such utterances. "Barbarians who have troubled the Chinese" is a phrase from Book of History II, i, 20, Legge, p. 44. 482 PART B 24B: 21a 19a 16a When Wang Mang acted as Regent, he changed A.D. 7 the Han institutions. Because in the Chou [dynasty] June its cash were larger and smaller coins21.1 21.1 Cf. HS 99 A: 30a for the complementary account. which July21.1 21.1 Cf. HS 99 A: 30a for the complementary account. acted as standards for each other,21.2 21.2 Cf. HS 24 B: 2b, 3a. The reference is to Kuo-yÃ¼ (iv or iii cent. B.C.) 3: 13b-15b, sect. 5, (de Harlez, Jour. Asiat., ser. 9, vol. 3 [Jan.-Feb. 1894], pp. 58-61) which says, "In the twenty-first year of King Ching [524 B.C.], when [the King] was about to have large cash cast, [seemingly for the purpose of securing more revenue], Duke Mu of Shan said, `It should not be done. Anciently, when Heaven's visitations descended, thereupon [the ruler] evaluated [the state's] merchandise and currency, and standardized the weight [of the currency] in order to assist the common people. When the common people suffered [because the currency was too] light, then he made heavier currency in order to make [the lighter ones] circulate, whereupon the larger ones (mu) acted as a standard (ch'Ã¼an) for the smaller ones (tzu) and [the smaller ones] circulated, so that the common people secured [the benefits of] both [denominations of coins]. However, when [business conditions] would not support the heavier [coins], then [the ruler] made many lighter [coins] and circulated them, and also did not suppress the heavier ones, whereupon the smaller [coins] (tzu) acted as a standard (ch'Ã¼an) for the larger ones (mu) and [the larger ones] circulated so that [both] the smaller and larger [coins] were beneficial. If now you, King, abolish the lighter [coins] and make heavier ones, and the common people lose their property, will they be able not to default [on their taxes]?' ... But the King did not listen and eventually cast larger cash." Chi-chung Chou-shu (possibly forged from ancient materials after the Han period), 2: 7b, 8a, also refers to this incident: "When the currency for the land tax was too light, [King Wen] made larger [coins] in order to make the smaller ones circulate and altered the price of merchandise, in order to adjust it for travelers, so that [merchandise] might have no obstacles [in trade]." Ying Shao explains this economic policy as follows (in a note to HS 24 B: 2b, 3a): "The mother (mu) is the heavier one. It is a moiety larger, hence it is the mother (mu). The son (tzu) is the lighter. It is lighter and lesser by half, hence it is the son (tzu). When the common people suffered by the lightness of the currency and the expensiveness of goods, [the ruler] made heavy currency in order to equalize the [prices] and temporarily circulated these [coins] in order to do away with the light [coins]. Hence it is said, `The mothers (mu, heavier ones) act as standards for the sons (tzu, lighter ones),' which is like saying that the heavier ones are used as the weights by which to weigh the lighter ones. The common people all secured them. Whether they were farmers or merchants, had or had no [property], they all secured benefits from them." Meng K'ang adds, "The heavier ones were the mothers (mu) and the lighter ones were the sons (tzu). It is like the selling of an article for eighty cash: the mother (mu [original cost]) was fifty [cash] and the son (tzu, [profit]), thirty [cash], comes from it." This same precedent was used to justify paper money in YÃ¼an times; cf. HJAS 2: 317 (the phrase mentioned there, tzu-mu hsiang-ch'Ã¼an erh hsing, is from the Kuo-yÃ¼.) [Wang Mang] 483THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24B: 21a thereupon changed [the currency] and [additionally] A.D. 7, June/July Four Denominations of Money coined large cash, with a diameter of an inch and two fen, a weight of 12 shu, and a legend which reads, "Large cash (ta-ch'ien) [worth] fifty [cash]."21.3 21.3 Cf.

Glathe, The Origin and Development of Chinese Money, p. 30, nos. 151-161, 163-167. Mr. H. F. Bowker of Oakland, Cal., an officer of the U. S. Navy, has loaned me a 50-cash coin of this issue which weighs 6.19 g. and is 27 mm. in diameter, as compared with the 7.68 g. and 27 mm. of the text. He also coined graving-knife (ch'i-tao) [coins] and [gold] inlaid knife (ts'o-tao) [coins]. The circular [heads] of the graving-knife [coins] are like the large cash; their bodies are shaped like knives and are two inches long. Their legend reads, "a graving-knife [coin], worth five hundred [cash]."21.4 21.4 Cf. E. Chavannes, Documents chinois, no. 709; Glathe, op. cit., p. 29, no. 103. The graving-knife coins in Lockhart, ibid., nos. 152, 153, are both probably fakes: no. 152 because of the defective writing of the words for "five hundred" and no. 153 because of its size and the more modern form of the word ch'i. In this matter I am glad to have the concurrence of the numismatist, Mr. H. F. Bowker. Chin-shih-so, Chin, 4: 29a, b, contains diagrams of the graving-knife and inlaid-knife coins. Mr. Bowker has very kindly loaned me an excellently-preserved specimen of a graving-knife coin, obtained from Gakuyo Katsuyama of Tokyo, a highly esteemed Japanese archeologist, who guaranteed its authenticity. It corresponds exactly with the description in the HS text and with Chavannes' illustration. The cutting edge of the knife-blade has been sharpened by filing from both sides (with almost all of the bevel on the obverse side), so that the coin would actually cut. It weighs 15.80 g. or a little less than 25 shu (16.0 g.), which latter figure may have been its original weight. The circular head of the coin is 28 mm. in diameter (exactly corresponding to the text's "1 inch 2 fen" for the diameter of large cash; cf. HFHD I, 279 for equivalents), with a hole 13 mm. square; the blade is 46 mm. long (exactly 2 of Wang Mang's inches, as the text states). Mr. Bowker has also loaned me what is plainly the circular head of a graving-knife coin, from which the blade has been broken off and the break smoothed, thus making a round cash out of the coin. It weighs 9.48 gm.; about two-thirds of the graving-knife coin's metal was in its head. Since the edges of cash were smooth and not milled, such a mutilation would be unnoticed until the inscription was read, which is "ch'i-tao (graving-knife)." Mr. Bowker has also loaned me three other coins which are similar round heads of inlaid knife-coins. Cf. Glathe, ibid., p. 30, no. 162. Chang Yen (iii cent.) plainly knew only these broken-off knife-coin heads, for he glosses this passage as follows: "In my opinion, in shape and substance, the graving-knife [coins] and inlaid knife-[coins] which are extant today are like [Wang Mang's] large cash, but the raised edges to their circumferences and holes are thickâdifferent from those of these large cash. In shape [these knife-coins] are like the rings on swords. The shape of the body of the graving-knife [coins] is round, not two inches long. The legend to the left [of the hole] reads, `ch'i (graving),' and to the right reads, `tao (knife),' and they do not have the words, `wu-po (five hundred [cash]).' " Yen Shih-ku (581-645) states that Chang Yen is mistaken and that the Wang Mang knife-coins of his day tallied with the description in the text. Chang Yen seems merely not to have known unmutilated knife-coins. (Cf. also the end of n. 21.5). The inlaid knife 484THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 7, June, July [coins] are inlaid with actual gold. Their legend 24 B: 21a, b reads, "One knife [coin], worth five thousand 21b 16b [cash]."21.5 21.5 Cf. Glathe, op. cit., 29, no. 104. Mr. Bowker has also kindly loaned me a well-preserved Wang Mang inlaid knife-coin, also obtained from and guaranteed by the same archeologist. It corresponds with the description in the text (except for the substitution of p'ing for chih, which is discussed later). This coin weighs 23.74 g. (a little less than 38 shu [24.32 g.]), so that these coins probably originally weighed about 40 shu. The cutting edge of the blade has been filed sharp, with an even bevel on both sides. Its dimensions are exactly the same as those of the graving-knife coins, except that it is thicker and heavier. On the field of the circular part of the coin, above and below the hole, are the words, "yi-tao (one knife-[coin])," in seal characters, engraved into the body of the coin and inlaid with gold, level to the field of the coin. This gold inlay is mentioned in the HS text, without specifying what is inlaid. The blade of the coin bears the words, "p'ing wu-ch'ien (standardized at five thousand [cash])" in raised bronze characters, like the legends on other Han coins. The reverse of the coin is bare of any legend. In the account of the legend on these coins, for "worth," the text reads the word chih . But this coin has p'ing . I suspect that the chih in the HS text is an error, from attraction to the word chih in the legend on the one-cash coins in Wang Mang's coinage of A.D.9. P'ing, which meant "standardized," denoting the establishing by the government of a fixed value for an article, is much more appropriate for these coins, which were really fiat money. Liu Feng-shih (1041-1113), the Sung Ch'i ed. (xi or xii cent.), and Ch'ien Chan (1744-1806) moreover all quote the legend on these coins with the word p'ing. The latter of these writers noted that the words yi-tao are engraved and inlaid with gold, while the rest of the legend is raised. Lockhart's inlaid knife-coins, ibid. nos. 146-152, seem all either to have been fakes or counterfeits or to have been copied incorrectly from Chinese numismatic books. He nowhere mentions the gold-inlaid characters, which are the most striking feature of these coins and are testified to as early as by Chang Yen in the third century. Mr. Bowker remarks that Lockhart "obviously did not have these coins or he would have mentioned the gold characters." The word p'ing in Lockhart's drawings is not correctly formed (except perhaps in no. 147); the vertical line should project below the bottom horizontal line. Mr. Bowker writes me, "I have never seen a specimen like no. 148, and am sure it is a fake. The same applies to no. 147, on account of the incused line around the blade on both sides, not to mention the smallness of the characters." No. 149 comes closest to Mr. Bowker's specimen, but the proportions are somewhat incorrect. Chang Yen knew only the circular heads of these inlaid knife-coins, from which the blades had been broken off. His gloss (trans. in n. 21.4) continues, "The inlaid knife[coins] are moreover engraved with characters, which are filled with actual gold. Their legend, above [the hole], reads, `yi (one),' and, below [the hole], reads, `tao (knife-[coin]).' " This description agrees with Mr. Bowker's specimens. The heaviest of these heads weighs 15.97 g., so that about two-thirds of the metal was in the head. The amount of gold inlaid in the two engraved characters is negligible, so that it was not worth gouging out. When Wang Mang ascended the throne and dispossessed the Han dynasty, these knife-coins became nefastus, unpropitious, since they denoted the Han surname, Liu (cf. p. 245f). After Wang Mang demonetized them, their possession probably became a mark of loyalty to the Han dynasty. Wealthy nobles, who had obediently exchanged their gold for these knife-coins, found them now not only worthless, but even dangerous to possess. Probably many nobles did not dare to melt down their knife-coins, for someone in their household would be sure to inform the ever-watchful government of the deed, and counterfeiting was a serious crime. Hence the blades were broken off these coins, making them into round cash. As such they would have been worth their weight in bronze or (perhaps more likely) they may have circulated on a par with the fifty-cash coinsâthe owners lost 99% of their money by turning a 5000-cash coin into a 50-cash coin, but that doubtless seemed better than losing the whole value of these coins and being punished for possessing them! In the Ch'Ã¼an-pi , issue 1, July, 1940 (pub. at Shanghai), Mr. Ts'ai Chi-hsiang publishes a photograph of a 10,000-cash coin, shaped like a circle with a square attached to it, with the legend, "Worth ten thousand [cash from] the chests of gold in the state's treasure ." Mr. Ts'ai decides that it is a Wang Mang coin from the issue of A.D. 11. I cannot agree with him. If it was from Wang Mang's age at all (the use of the word chih, instead of p'ing, raises doubts), it must have been intended for the issue of A.D. 7. At that time, Wang Mang "nationalized" gold, paying for it probably at the rate of 10,000 cash per catty (the value he set in A.D. 11), so that a 10,000-cash coin was really needed in making this exchange. The round shape denotes heaven and the square shape denotes earth. Mr. Ts'ai argues that the word kuei (chest) in its legend was the name for 10,000 catties of gold in Wang Mang's time (cf. HS 99 C: 25a), just as Kuan-tzu (ch. 5, "Shen-ma," sect. "Shih, nung, kung, shang"; Szu-pu Ts'ung-k'an ed. 1: 12b) states, "A hundred yi of actual gold [make] one ch'ieh (box)," and Nan-shih, 53: 25b "Memoir of the King of Wu-ling, Hsiao YÃ¼an-cheng," states, "One catty of actual gold makes one ping (cake) and a hundred ping make a ch'ou (secondary unit)." (Gold was cast into cake-shaped ingots; Mr. Ts'ai publishes photographs of such ingots from Chou and Former Han times.) This 10,000-cash coin is not mentioned in any Chinese history. It was needed in A.D. 7, but if such coins had been issued, they would have been used plentifully in purchasing the nobles' gold and would not be so rare and unmentioned. But in the issue of A.D. 7, the coins of a higher denomination than one cash were all multiples of five: 50, 500, and 5000 cash. (Five, along with the other odd numbers, is the number of Heaven, not Earth; cf. Book of Changes, App. III, i, 49; Legge, p. 365.) Emperor P'ing was sickly; the knife-coins, with their symbolism of metal and knife [HS 24 B: 21b] denoted the Liu house; similarly the use of the number five, denoting Heaven [the Emperor was the Son of Heaven] was probably also magic to strengthen the Emperor.) It would have been unlikely that a 10,000-cash coin (denoting both Heaven and Earth) would have been added to this (purely Heavenly) series. In the issue of A.D. 11, the denominations increase by tens to 50, then by hundreds to 1000; it would have been unlikely that a 10,000-cash coin would have been added to such a series, leaving so great a gap between it and the next lower coin. The largest denomination in the issue of A.D. 14 was 25-cash, so that this 10,000-cash coin could not have belonged to that series. In my opinion, if this coin is really from Wang Mang's mint (concerning which I have no evidence), it can only have been a mint sample for the issue of A.D. 7, which coin was rejected because it spoiled the symmetry and magical effect of that issue. (Cf. also the Tung-yang Huo-pi Tsa-chih , no. 218.) Together with the five-shu cash, altogether 485THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 21b four denominations [of money] were to circu- A.D. 7, June/July late at the same time. 486THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 9, 10 A.D. 921.6 21.6 As a matter of fact, this coinage was not all begun at the same time. The previous coinage was abolished, except for the twelve-shu large fifty-cash coins, in the spring of A.D. 9, when there were also first coined the one-shu diminutive cash coins, so that these two denominations circulated together (99 B: 7b). Then in A.D. 10 (99 B: 15a), Wang Mang added the other 26 denominations of this coinage. When compiling this "Treatise," Pan Ku evidently forgot that this coinage was not all enacted at the same time. When Wang Mang became actual [Emperor], he 24 B: 21b considered that in the writing for the word Liu [there are the words] metal and knife, so he abolished the A.D. 1021.6 21.6 As a matter of fact, this coinage was not all begun at the same time.

[Later] he changed and Six Kinds of Valuable Currency: made [six] kinds [of money]: gold, silver, tortoise[shells], cowries, cash, and spade-money, [giving them] the name, "Valuable currency (pao-huo)."21.7 21.7 Wang Mang took this name from that said to have been given by King Ching of the Chou dynasty to his large cash; cf. HS 24 B: 3a. The diminutive cash (hsiao-ch'ien) are six fen in diameter, one shu in weight, and their legend is, Cash "Diminutive cash worth one [cash]."21.8 21.8 Cf. Lockhart, ibid., no. 145; Terrien de Lacouperie, Catalogue of Chinese Coins in the British Museum, p. 367, nos. 341-343; Chin-shih-so, Chin, 4: 28b. The next 487THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 21b, 22a are seven fen [in diameter] and three shu [in weight, A.D. 10 with the legend], "Young cash (yao-ch'ien) [worth] ten [cash]."21.9 21.9 Cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 368, nos. 1711, 1712. The next are eight fen [in diameter 22a and weigh] five shu, [with the legend], "Small cash (yu-ch'ien) [worth] twenty [cash]."22.1 22.1 Cf. Ku-chin Ch'ien-lÃ¼eh, by Ni Mo (1750-1825), 16: 6b; Glathe, op. cit., p. 30, no. 171. The next are nine fen [in diameter and weigh] seven shu, [with the legend], "Medium cash (chung-ch'ien) [worth] thirty [cash]."22.2 22.2 Cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 369, nos. 1713, 1714; Glathe, op. cit., no. 170. The next are one inch [in diameter and weigh] nine shu, [with the legend], "Adult cash (chuang-ch'ien) [worth] forty [cash]."22.3 22.3 Cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., nos. 344, 1715, 1716; Glathe, op. cit., no. 169. [The use of] the previous large cash [worth] fifty [cash] was [also] continued.22.4 22.4 Cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 370; Lockhart, nos. 136-143. These were the six denominations of cash currency, each of which are valued according to its legend. Actual gold weighing one catty was [declared to be] Gold worth ten thousand cash. Shu-shih silver weighing eight taels made [one Silver unit], (a liu), and was [declared to be] worth 1580 [cash].22.5 22.5 Shu-shih was a prefecture in Chien-wei Commandery, which mined fine silver. For location, cf. Glossary, sub voce. One liu of other silver was [declared to be] worth one thousand cash. These were the two denominations of silver currency. Sovereign's tortoise-[shells], the edges of whose Tortoiseshells carapaces reached a foot and two inches were [declared to be] worth 2160 [cash] and were [made the equivalent of] ten pairs of large cowries.22.6 22.6 Meng K'ang glosses, "Jang [means] the border of tortoise shells.... They measured the edge of the two sides of their backs as a foot and two inches." Li Tz'u-ming, in his HS Cha-chi 2: 6a, adds that jang should be , which is defined in the Shuo-wen 13 B: 2b as, "The edge of a tortoise carapace.... [The edge of] great tortoise shells used for] the Son of Heaven is a foot and two inches; for the nobles, it is a foot; for grandees, it is eight inches; and for gentlemen, it is six inches." Meng K'ang seems to have had this latter word in mind. The Shuo-wen is quoting the ancient text of the Lost Book of Rites (now lost), which is quoted by name in Ch'u-hsÃ¼eh-chi 30: 30a. Li-chi XVII, ii, 26 (Legge, II, 114; Couvreur, II, 82) says, "[The standard] bordered with blue and black was that [on which were represented] the Son of Heaven's precious tortoise-[shells]." The "precious" tortoise-shells were those used for divination. Kung-yang Commentary, 26: 3b, Dk. Ting. VIII, says "The treasures of Chin were...tortoise[shells] with blue borders," and Ho Hsiu glosses, "Tortoises [which live to] a thousand years have blue beards." (References from Shen Ch'in-han.) 488THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 Duke's tortoise-[shells, the edges of which reached] 24 B: 22a, b nine inches [or more],22.7 22.7 Wang Nien-sun asserts that after there were originally the words , to agree with the statements concerning the size of the next two sizes of tortoise-shells; K'ung Ying-ta, in a note to Li-chi, ch. VIII, i, 6, in his Li-chi Chu-su 23: 4a, and the Ch'u-hsÃ¼eh-chi 30: 32b quote this passage with these words; the T'ung-tien, ch. 8: 11a, (Com. Pr. ed. p. 47) quotes it without them. were [declared to be] worth 17a five hundred [cash] and were [made the equivalent of] ten pairs of big cowries. Marquises' tortoise-[shells, 20a the edges of which reached] seven inches or more were [declared to be] worth three hundred [cash] and were [made the equivalent of] ten pairs of small cowries. Viscount's tortoise-[shells, the edges of which reached] five inches or more were [declared to be] worth a hundred [cash] and were [made the equivalent of] ten pairs of little cowries. The [foregoing] were the four denominations of tortoise-[shell] currency. Cowries Of large cowries (ta-pei), four inches eight fen or more [in length], two made one pair (p'eng), and were 22b [declared to be] worth 216 [cash]. Of adult cowries (chuang-pei), three inches six fen [in length] or more, two made one pair, and were [declared to be] worth fifty [cash]. Of little cowries (yao-pei), two inches four fen [in length] or more, two made one pair and were [declared to be] worth thirty [cash]. Of diminutive cowries (hsiao-pei), an inch two fen [in length] or more, two made one pair and were [declared to be] worth ten [cash]. Those which were not fully an inch two fen and so were outside of these regulations were not permitted to make pairs and were [declared to be] generally worth three [cash] 489THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 22b, 23a apiece. The [foregoing] were the five denominations A.D. 10 of cowry currency. "Large spade-money (ta-pu)," the "next-[largest] Spade-Money spade-money (tz'u-pu)," the "third [largest] spade-money (ti-pu)," "adult spade-money (chuang-pu)," "medium spade-money (chung-pu)," "smaller [than medium] spade-money (ch'a-pu)," "[still] smaller [than medium] spade-money (hsÃ¼-pu),"22.8 22.8 Ts'ai YÃ¼n (d. ca. 1820), in his Pi-t'an 3: 8b, 9a, asserts that the text's hou should be hsÃ¼ . He points out that the six denominations of cash were named "diminutive," "little," "young," "medium," "adult," and "large." There were ten denominations of spade-money, hence between "large" and "adult" there were added and , both of which words mean "next"; and between "medium" and "young" there were added and hsÃ¼, both of which also mean "next." Hou, "thick," does not fit the meaning at all; in the seal character, hou and hsÃ¼ are very similar. A specimen of this "Still smaller than medium spade-money," loaned me by Mr. Bowker, bears plainly the seal-character form of the word hsÃ¼, which is practically identical with that found for hsÃ¼ in the Shuo-wen, and is not the word hou. "young spade-money (yu-pu)," "little spade-money (yao-pu)," and "diminutive spade-money (hsiao-pu)" [were also coined]. The diminutive spade-money was one inch five fen long, weighed fifteen shu, and its legend was "Diminutive spade-money [worth] a hundred [cash]."22.9 22.9 Cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 303, no. 1580. From the diminutive spade-money on upwards, each [denomination] was one fen longer and one shu heavier, and the legend of each [gave] the name of [that denomination of] spade-money, and each [denomination] was worth a hundred [cash] more [than the preceding denomination], up to the large spade-money, which was two22.10 22.10 The Ching-yu ed. and the Official ed. read the obviously correct for Wang Hsien-ch'ien's . inches four fen long, weighed one tael, and was worth 20b a thousand cash.22.11 22.11 For these spade-coins, cf. de Lacouperie, ibid., pp. 302-306; Ku-chin Ch'ien-lÃ¼eh 16: 7b-9a and Chin-shih So, Chin, 4: 30b-32a illustrate a complete set. The Yokohama Numismatic Society's , no. 9 (1912) and Glathe, op. cit., pp. 28, 29, nos. 90-99 print a photograph of these ten spade-coins. The legend on these 1000-cash pieces is " large spade-money valued at a thousand [cash]," for which legend there is ancient testimony. Ni Mo, in his Ku-chin Ch'ien-lÃ¼eh 16: 9b, points out that the word huang in this legend is a cursive form of heng1 , and that heng1 is used for heng2 , with which it was anciently interchanged. Heng2, like p'ing , meant "to weigh," hence "to standardize at a given value." Karlgren, Grammata Serica 707a &amp; m, lists huang and heng1 as having had the same archaic and ancient pronunciations. The fact that Wang Mang asserted he ruled by virtue of the element earth, whose color is yellow, huang, aided in forming this cursive form of heng1. Mr. Bowker has loaned me a complete set of these spade-coins, secured by him from Gakuyo Katsuyama. Herewith a comparison of these coins with the statements in the HS: Denomination (in cash) Legal weight according to the HS (in grams) Actual weight (in g.) Legal length according to the HS (in mm.) Actual length (in mm.) 100 9.60 7.0 35 35 200 10.24 7.86 37 38 300 10.88 9.44 39 40 400 11.52 8.09 42 42 500 12.16 9.38 44 44 600 12.80 14.15 46 50 700 13.44 12.02 48.5 51 800 14.08 15.31 50.8 52.5 900 14.72 13.37 53.1 54 1000 15.25 8.42 55.4 53 It is to be noted that the first five and the 900-cash coin correspond very well with the sizes indicated in the HS, although their age has caused them to lose weight. The other four are, in my judgment, very likely ancient counterfeits or later fakes. Since the Han weights and measures were gradually increased to their present size, a later faker would make coins in accordance with the weights and measures of his own epoch, so that they would be larger and heavier than the Han standards required. Such seems to be the case with Mr. Bowker's 600-, 700-, and 800-cash coins. The 1000-cash coin may be an ancient light-weight counterfeit. The outstanding feature of Wang Mang's bronze coinages is that as the nominal value of the coins increased, the amount of metal per cash decreased, so that the larger coins were the more depreciated.

On the origin of spade-coins, cf. Richard SchlÃ¶sser, "Der Ursprung der Chinesischen Pu-mÃ¼nzen," Artibus Asiae, 1928, no. 1, pp. 12-34. This article contains photographs of more ancient spade-coins (of which Wang Mang's coins were imitations), also of a complete set of Wang Mang's coins. Cf. also his, "Die MÃ¼nzereformversuche des Wang Mang," Sinica V (1930), 25-37. The [foregoing] were the ten denominations of spade-money currency. Altogether 23a the "valuable currency" was made of five substances with six names, and [included] twenty-eight 490THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 denominations. 24 B: 23a In casting and making cash and spade-money, all [denominations] used copper and mixed it with lead 491THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 23a ore and tin.23.1 23.1 Meng K'ang glosses, "Lien1 is another name for tin," but Li Ch'i declares, "The name for lead and tin ore is lien1." Yen Shih-ku asserts that both are mistaken, because the Shuo-wen 14 A: 1b says, "Lien2 is [the same] sort [of thing as] copper." Shen Ch'in-han however replies that Li Ch'i is correct; the Shuo-wen is merely speaking in general terms; the Kuang-ya and the YÃ¼-p'ien both state that lien2 is lead ore. F. C. Chang asserts that zinc was called lien; Journal of Science 8, 233-243; 9, 1116-1127 (in Chinese). Certain Sung cash are found, upon analysis, to be copper with a considerable proportion of lead, a small proportion of tin, and a minute amount of zinc, the latter arising from the impurity of the ore used. In their obverse and reverse and in A.D. 10 17b their raised rim all around, they imitated the Han [dynasty's] five-shu cash. In this [currency], the gold and silver were mixed with other substances, and the alloy was not pure and good. Tortoise[shells] not fully five inches [in size], and cowries not fully six fen [in length] were all not permitted to be considered as valuable currency. Large tortoise-[shells 492THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 were named] Ts'ai [shells],23.2 23.2 Ju Shen quotes Analects V, xvii, in which a tortoise is called a t'sai, and states that the state of Ts'ai produced large tortoises. Hence large tortoises were named Ts'ai. and were not 24B: 23a, b what the four [orders of] common people23.3 23.3 Ku-liang Commentary 13: 1b, Dk. Ch'eng, I, enumerates the four orders of common people as gentlemen, merchants, farmers, and artisans. HS 24 A: 2a however enumerates them as gentlemen, farmers, artisans, and merchants. The Han dynasty, following the Ch'in practise, degraded merchants. were allowed to store up. Those who had them took them to the Grand Augur and received their value. Penalties for Using Other Coins The people were confused and troubled [by this coinage, so that Wang Mang's] currency did not circulate. The common people privately used five-shu cash in the markets and in purchases. [Wang] Mang was troubled by it and so issued an imperial edict that those who presumed to oppose the ching [system of] cultivated fields or hoard five-shu cash were misleading the multitude and `should be thrown out to the four frontiers [and be made] to resist the 21a elves and goblins."23.4 23.4 Cf. 99 B: 8b, 9a and n. 9.1. Thereupon farmers and merchants lost their business, food and goods were both rendered useless, and the common people wept and cried in the market-places and highways. Those who were sentenced for selling or buying fields, residences, slaves or slave-women, or for casting cash, and [thus] fell into crime, from the ministers and grandees down to ordinary people, could not be estimated or counted. 23b [Wang] Mang knew that the common people hated All but Two Denominations Rescinded [his arrangements], so he only had the two denominations of diminutive cash worth one [cash] and the large cash worth fifty [cash] circulate together; the tortoise-[shells], cowries, spade-money, and the like were temporarily abandoned. [Wang] Mang by nature was irascible and irritable, and could not [bring himself to a state of] nonactivity. Every time there was something that he 493THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 23b initiated or invented, he always wanted it to be in A.D. 10 The Five Equalizations accordance with ancient [practises and tried to] secure the words of [some] classic [as a model]. The State Master and Highest Minister, Liu Hsin1a, A.D. 1023.5 23.5 Cf. 99 B: 12b. The numbers in square brackets in the margin and text, here and on pp. 24b, 25a, b are the same as those in the enumeration of the six monopolies in 99 B: 12b. There was no fixed order, so I use that list as a reference point. said that the Chou [dynasty] had a government Office for Money,23.6 23.6 Chou-li 15: 3b f (Biot, I, 326-328) lists as one of the Chou offices an Office for Money, which "collected what goods are not sold in the market-place, goods [whose sale] is slow, but which are used by the common people. [The Yamen] writes their selling-price on a post, in order to be ready for those in need who would buy them." which collected what was not sold 18a and gave to those who needed to obtain [such things], which was precisely what the Book of Changes means by "the right administration of wealth, correct instructions [to the people], and prohibitions to the common people against wrong-[doing."23.7 23.7 A quotation from Book of Changes, App. III, ii, 10 (Legge, 381). Wang] Mang accordingly issued an imperial edict, saying, "Verily, the Chou Offices contains [regulations for] selling on credit and lending on interest,23.8 23.8 Chou-li, 15: 4a (Biot, I, 327), sub the Office for Money (Ch'Ã¼an-fu), says, "Whoever buys on credit, for [purposes of] sacrificing, shall not exceed ten days [without paying interest], and for mourning ceremonies, shall not exceed three months [without paying interest]. Whenever common people wish to borrow on interest, [the head of the Office for Money] shall discuss it with his heads of departments and then only shall pay out [the loan; the people shall pay] interest in accordance with [the taxes paid] as their service to their state," [i.e., if the tax was a tithe, the interest would be a tithe per year]. the Yo-yÃ¼ 21b contains [an account of] the five equalizations,23.9 23.9 Cheng Chan (fl. ca. 208) glosses, "The Yo-yÃ¼ are sayings on the origin of music, which King Hsien of Ho-chien, [Liu TÃª, d. 130 B.C.], transmitted [to Emperor Wu]. It speaks of the matter of the five equalizations." This book has been lost; the only quotations from it that have been preserved are three brief paragraphs in the Po-hu-t'ung (relating to other matters) and the following one: Fu Tsan glosses, "Its words are, "When the Son of Heaven takes land from his nobles and uses it to establish the five equalizations, then in the market-places there are no two [different] prices [for the same thing, so that] the four [orders of] common people are constantly equalized [in their power]. If the strong are not permitted to oppress the weak and the rich are not permitted to use force upon the poor, then the government shows additional kindness to the unimportant common people." Shen Ch'in-han declares that this statement is based on the Chi-chung Chou-shu, 4: 7a, ch. 39, (possibly this latter book, which seems to be a later forgery, took them from the Yo-yÃ¼) which says, "When in the market-places there were the five equalizations, then morning and evening [prices] were the same. [This office] accompanied the departing, invited those who are coming, assisted the distressed, and rescued the impoverished." and all the books and records speak of controls. Now that I open [offices for] selling on credit and lending [6] on interest, set up the five equalizations, and establish 494THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 the various monopolies (controls), it is in order 24 B: 23b, 24a that the crowd of people may be made equal and those who take concurrently [the advantages of other classes] may be repressed."23.10 23.10 Cf. HFHD, II, 68, n. 17.2. Thereupon at Ch'ang-an and at five [commandery] capitals there were established Offices for the Five Equalizations. The name of the Prefects of the Eastern and Western Markets at Ch'ang-an, together with the Chiefs of the Markets at Lo-yang, 24a Han-tan, Lin-tzu, YÃ¼an, and Ch'eng-tua were all changed to be the Masters in Charge of the Five Equalizations at the Markets.24.1 24.1 Wang Nien-sun points out that the word ch'eng after the is an interpolation by attraction for the subsequent use of this word. This title is quoted without the word ch'eng in HS 91: 11b (Master in Charge of the Capital Market) and in sundry quotations of this passage: Wen-hsÃ¼an 21: 23a, in a note to Pao Chao's "Yung-shih Shih"; ibid., 36: 22a, in a note to the "Yung-ming, XI Nien, Ts'Ãª Hsui-ts'ai Wen"; ibid., 53: 20b in a note to the "YÃ¼n-ming Lun"; T'ung-tien 11: 22a (Com. Pr. ed. p. 65); and Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 37: 8b. Wen-hsÃ¼an 1: 8b, in a note to the "Hsi-tu Fu", however quotes this passage with the word ch'eng. At the Eastern Market, in the title [of this official, the word] Capital [was used]; at the Western Market, in his title [the word] Court [was used]; at Lo-yang, in his title, [the word] Central [was used]; at the remaining four capitals one of [the words] Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern, [respectively, was used] in his title. At each [place] there were established five Assistants for Exchange, and one Assistant for the 18b Office for Money. Artisans and merchants who 495THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 24a had been able to collect gold, silver, copper, lead ore, A.D. 10 The Offices for Money tin, to whom tortoises had presented themselves,24.2 24.2 I.e., those who had found tortoises. Ju Shun explains, "Tortoises have supernatural power , hence it says that they present themselves ." or who had gathered cowries, all themselves testified [their value to the Assistant for] the Office for Money of [the Master] in Charge of the Market, and he took them in accordance with the emanations of the seasons. [Wang Mang] also [ordered], "In accordance with the [system of] taxing the common people in the Chou Offices,24.3 24.3 Chou-li 13: 9a (Biot, I, 279 f) says, "All residences which are denuded [of vegetation] have the hempen-cloth [tax] for occupied land; all fields which were not plowed, pay grain for a house [occupied by three families]; all common people who do not have an occupation, pay the contribution of service for a head of a household." This passage enumerates the three types of taxes mentioned in Mencius VII, ii, xxvii, 1 (Legge, p. 491). all fields that are not plowed are `unproductive [fields,' hence] shall pay taxes for three 22a heads of households; residences inside the inner or Unused Land and Idle People Taxed outer city walls that are not planted [with fruit-trees] or cultivated [for garden produce] are `denuded of vegetation,' and shall pay the hemp-cloth [tax] for three heads of households; common people who wander about and have no occupation must pay [the tax of] one roll of hemp-cloth for a head of a household. Those who are not able to pay the hemp-cloth [tax] shall work at incidental occupations for the imperial government and shall be clothed and fed An Income Tax on Hunters, Fishermen, Sericulturists, Artisans, Professional Men and Merchants by it. "Those who collect articles of any kind, birds, beasts, fish, turtles, or the various insects from the mountains, forests, streams, or marshes, together with those who rear or care for domestic animals, women who collect mulberry leaves, rear silkworms, weave, spin, or sew, laborers, artisans, physicians, shamans, diviners, invokers, together with [people who have] other recipes or skills, peddlers, traders, merchants who sit down and spread out [their wares] 496THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 or who arrange them at stopping-places, or who visit 24 b: 24a, b houses, shall all and each themselves, at the places 24b where they are, testify to the imperial government what they do, exclude their principal, calculate their [net] profit, divide off from it one-tenth, and use this one-[tenth] as their tribute. Those who presume not to testify themselves, or who themselves in testifying do not accord with the facts shall have all that they have collected or taken confiscated and paid [to the government] and shall work for the imperial government for one year. "The [Masters] in Charge of Markets shall regularly, in the second month of [each of] the four seasons, determine the true [prices] of the articles that they take care of and make high, middle, and 22b 19a low prices [for the respective grades of these goods]. Equalization of Prices At the Five Market Centers Each [Master] shall himself use [these prices] at his own market to equalize [prices there] and shall not restrict himself [by the prices] at other places. When the mass of common people have sold and bought the five [kinds of] grains or articles of hempen-cloth, silk cloth, silk thread, or silk wadding, which are used everywhere among the common people, whenever any has not been sold, and the office for equalization has examined and inspected the reality of that [fact, the office] shall take those [articles] at their cost price, so as not to cause [the people] to lose a cash. When [any of] the myriad things rise [in price and become] expensive, so that they surpass by one cash [the prices at which they have been] equalized, then [the accumulated stock] shall be sold to the common people in accordance with the price at which they have been equalized. If the price goes down and becomes cheap, below [the price at which it is to be] equalized, the common people shall be permitted to sell [goods] amongst each other at the market-place, in order to prevent any from storing [goods] up [for the purpose of keeping them until they become] expensive.24.4 24.4 The procedure seems to have been that the Master fixed his prices for equalization as the fair prices for his market, and bought goods that were unsold in the market-place at their cost to the producer or at the current price, providing that this price was below his price for equalization. Then he sold those goods at the price for equalization whenever the market-price surpassed his price by one cash. 497THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 24b, 25a "If any of the common people wish to sacrifice or A.D. 10 Government Loans to the People perform funeral and mourning ceremonies, and have not the means, the Office for Money shall give to them on credit, without requiring interest, whatever laborers or merchants have paid in as tribute,24.5 24.5 I.e., as income-tax (cf. p. 24a). [in the case of] sacrifices, for not more than ten days, [and in the case of] mourning ceremonies, for not more than three months. If any of the common people are lacking and have no [means] or wish to borrow on interest in order to establish a productive occupation, [the money] shall be impartially given to them, and, after their expenses have been deducted, they shall calculate what [profit] they have made, and shall pay interest [to the amount of] not more than one-tenth [of his income] per year."24.6 24.6 HS 99 B: 12b states however that interest was 3% per month. The usual rate of interest was 20% per year (91: 6a); so that the government was charging more than the current rate. This passage adds that borrowers were not to pay more than 10% of their income as interest to the government. The Hsi-and-Ho, Lu K'uang, said, "The controls 23a of [5] the famous mountains and great marshes, [2] salt and [3] iron, [4] cash and spade-money currency, 25a [6] the five equalizations, selling on credit and lending Liquor Monopolized on interest, are in [the hands of] the imperial government. Only [1] the selling of fermented drinks alone is not yet monopolized. Fermented drink is the most beautiful happiness from Heaven, whereby the lords and kings have nourished the country. Meetings for offering sacrifices, for praying for blessings, for succoring the decrepit, for caring 19b for the sick, and all the rites, cannot be carried on without fermented drink. 498THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10 "Hence the Book of Odes says, 24B: 25a, b `If I have no fermented drink, I buy it, do I,'25.1 25.1 Book of Odes (no. 165), II, i, v, 3 (Legge, 255). but the Analects says, `[Confucius] would not drink purchased fermented drink.'25.2 25.2 Analects X, viii, 5. These two are not contradictory. "Verily, the ode refers to [a time when] peaceful reigns succeeded [each other, when] the fermented drink purchased at a [government] office was harmonious, agreeable, and suited to people, so that it could be offered [to others]. [In the time of] the Analects, Confucius [lived] in [the period when] the Chou [dynasty] was decaying and in disorder, so that the sale of fermented drink was in [the hands of] the common people, [and hence] was of poor quality, bad, and not free from adulteration. For this reason [Confucius] suspected it and would not drink it. "If now the empire's fermented drink is cut off, then there will be no means of performing the rites or of cherishing others. If permission is given [to anyone to make it] and no limit is set [to its manufacture], then it will consume wealth and injure the common people. [Hence] I beg that you will imitate ancient [practises] and order the [government] offices to make fermented drink, taking 2500 piculs as one standard [unit] and accordingly open one shop25.3 25.3 Ju Shun explains, "When a liquor-seller opens a shop and waits for guests, he puts up a wine-jar. Hence a wine-jar (lu ) is used as the name for the shop." Yen Shih-ku denies this plain interpretation, but Liu Feng-shih points out that Ju Shun must be correct. HS 91: 7a states, "A large capital which communicates with [surrounding] towns sells a thousand fermentations in one year." to 25b 23b sell [this quantity]. If the selling of fifty fermentations is taken as one standard [unit]; one fermentation requires two hu of coarse grain and one hu of yeast, [from which] is obtained six hu six tou of finished fermented drink. If for each [fermentation] one counts up together the price of the three hu of grain and yeast, according to [the price at] the 499THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 25b, 26a market-place on the first day of the month, divide it A.D. 10 20a by three, and take one part as the average for one hu of [material for] fermented drink, if one deducts the original price of the grain and yeast and counts up the profit, then seven parts in ten will be paid to the government. The three [other parts], together with the lees, vinegar, ashes, and charcoal may be given to the workmen for the expense of the utensils and firewood." The Hsi-and-Ho, [Lu K'uang], established [officials, The Monopolies Cause Trouble ranking as] Mandated Officers, to supervise the five equalizations and the six monopolies. [In each] commandery there were several [such] men. Everywhere he employed rich merchants, [such as] Nieh Tzu-chung and Chang Ch'ang-shu from Lo-yang, Hsin Wei from Lin-tzu, and others. [Traveling] in riding quadrigae, they sought for profit and made numerous contacts [all over] the empire, and, availing [themselves of their opportunities], they communicated their wickedness to the commanderies and prefectures, and made many false accountings. The yamens and storehouses were not filled, and the people suffered all the more. [Wang] Mang knew that the common people suffered from these [measures, so he] again issued an 24a imperial edict, which said, "Verily, [2] salt is the An Edict Justifying Them greatest of foods; [1] fermented drink is the chief of all medicines and the best feature of auspicious assemblies; [3] iron is the fundamental [thing] in [the cultivation of] fields25.4 25.4 Ch'ien Ta-chao says that should be ; the Official ed. has made this emendation, and I have followed it. and in agriculture; [5] the famous mountains and the great marshes are storehouses of abundance; [6] the five equalizations and 26a and [the system of] selling on credit and lending on interest [are means by which] the people may receive the equalization of high [prices], in order to give assistance 500THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 10, 14 [to the people against profiteers]; [4] cash26.1 26.1 Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that the Fukien ed. (1549) has emended to , which seems correct, since iron was previously mentioned. 24 B: 26a and spade-money, and the casting of copper make wealth circulate and furnish [what is needed] for the common people's use. These six [matters] are not [things that] the enrolled households of equal common people26.2 26.2 In a note to HS 24 B: 17a, Ju Shun glosses, "Ch'i is `of the same rank .' When there are no honorable or inferior [grades] they are called the equal common-people (ch'i-min ), just as at present we say p'ing -min." Chin Shao however declares, "They are Chinese instructed and regulated (ch'i-cheng ) common people." Chavannes (Mh III, 588 = SC 30: 35), who did not have Ju Shun's gloss available, follows Chin Shao, but Yen Shih-ku approves of Ju Shun's interpretation. are able to make in their homes, so that, if [the prices of these goods] are high in the market-place, although [these things] may be several times as expensive [as usual, the people] inevitably have no alternative but to purchase them, [hence] eminent common people and wealthy merchants can thereupon coerce the poor and weak. The ancient 20b sages knew that it would be so, hence they made controls (monopolies) of these [matters]." Penalties for Violation For each control (monopoly) he established rules and precepts to interdict and prohibit [violations of the monopoly]; the penalties for violation extended to capital [punishment].26.3 26.3 This sentence is a doublet (except for verbal differences) of one in 99 C: 1b; that sentence seems however to refer to a second issuance of these rules. Wicked officials and cunning common people both at the same time encroached upon the mass of people, so that every [person] was disquieted with life. The fifth year after, in [the period] T'ien-feng, the A.D. 14 first year,26.4 26.4 HS 99 C: 10a mentions this enactment under the date A.D. 20, because it was not to take full effect until that time. Cf. 99 C: 10a &amp; n. 10.4. [Wang Mang] again sent down [a Two Denominations of Money message], increasing and decreasing considerably the price and value of gold, silver, tortoise-[shell], and cowry currency, and abolishing the large and small cash. Instead he made "currency spade-money (huo-pu," 501THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 26a two inches five fen in length and one inch in A.D. 14 width, with their heads eight fen and a fraction long and eight fen wide, their circular holes two fen and a 24b half in diameter, their feet eight fen long, their opening [between the feet] two fen wide, their legend, on the right reading, "Currency (huo)" and on the left reading, "Spade-money (pu)."26.5 26.5 Cf. Lockhart, ibid., nos. 155, 156; de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 306, nos. 112-115; Glathe, op. cit., p. 29, no. 101; Chin-shih-so, Chin, 4: 32a. Prof. P. M. L. Linebarger of Duke University has loaned me a well-preserved ho-pu coin of this issue, weighing 15.53 g. (legal weight, according to the HS, 16.0 g.); length, 57.7 mm. (legal, 58 mm.); width, 23.5 mm. (legal, 23.1 mm.); length of feet 19 mm. (legal, 18.5 mm.); width of opening, 4.8 mm. (legal, 4.6 mm.). Their weight was twenty-five shu, and they were worth twenty-five of the currency cash. The currency cash (huo-ch'Ã¼an) were one inch in diameter, and weighed five shu. Their legend on the right reads "Currency (huo)" and on the left reads "Cash (ch'Ã¼an)."26.6 26.6 Cf. Lockhart, ibid., nos. 162-182; de Lacouperie, ibid., p. 384, nos. 365-400; Glathe, op. cit., p. 30, nos. 173-75; Chin-shih-so, Chin, 4: 29a. HHS, An. 1 B: 23b says, "When Wang Mang had usurped the throne, he feared evil [because] the Liu clan had used the word ch'ien [as the word for `cash'] and [the word for Liu ] contains [the words for] metal (chin ) and knife (tao ), hence [Wang Mang] changed [the coinage and the word for `cash'] and made it `currency cash (huo-ch'Ã¼an ).' [But] someone considered that the words huo-ch'Ã¼an were `The immortal of the White River (Po-shui chen-jen)'." Ying Shao, in his Han-kuan-yi (lost; quoted in T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 835: 6b, 7a) also remarks this circumstance, and adds, "This was an auspicious presage of the restoration under the Epochal Founder, [Emperor Kuang-wu]." The word ch'Ã¼an is composed of the words po and shui , and huo is composed of jen and chen , which make-up is particularly evident in the seal form on these coins, in which the jen extends all along the left side of the character. The White River was a stream which arises 50 li northeast of the present Tsao-yang, Hupeh (Shina Rekidai Chimei Yoran, p. 531); Emperor Kuang-wu came from the city of Ts'ai-yang, which was located southwest of the present Tsao-yang (HHS, An. 1 A: 1a); hence it was not surprising that these coins issued by Wang Mang were later understood as a prophecy of Emperor Kuang-wu. One [such] was worth one [cash]; it and the currency spade-money [formed] two denominations, which circulated concurrently. Moreover, because the large cash had circulated 502THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 14 for a long time, [Wang Mang] abolished them, fearing 24 B: 26a, b that the common people would keep them and not stop [using them].26.7 26.7 The "large cash" weighed 12 shu and were nominally worth 50 cash (B: 21a), i.e., 0.24 shu per cash; the spade-money of 14 A.D. weighed 1 shu per cash and the round cash weighed 5 shu per cash; Wang Mang was trying to drive out light coins, something that rulers have always found difficult or impossible, because of the facts summed up in Gresham's law. So he ordered that the common people should only temporarily circulate the 26b large cash, and that one [such large cash] should be worth one of the new currency cash, that their concurrent A.D. 20 circulation should be ended in the sixth year, and that [people] should not [then] be any more allowed to possess the large cash.26.8 26.8 Since the "large cash" had been worth 50 cash, and the new cash were worth 1 cash, such a valuation meant losing 49/50 of their nominal value. Yet the large cash weighed more than twice as much as the new cash, so that private melting down and counterfeit casting became inevitable. Penalties Make the People Suffer Each time that the money was changed, the common people were thereby ruined financially and fell into serious punishment. Because so many were those who violated the laws and [whoever] privately cast cash had to die and [whoever] criticized or put obstacles [in the circulation of] the valuable currency should be thrown out to the four borders, with the result that [their sentences] could not be entirely carried out, [Wang] Mang therefore changed and lightened these laws: those who privately cast or made cash or spade-money were confiscated with their wives and children and became government slaves or slave-women. Officials and the group of five [families, of which the culprit was a member], who knew of [the crime] and did not bring it forward or denounce it, [were tried] with [the culprit as having committed] a like crime. As to those who criticized or put obstacles [in the circulation of] the 21a valuable currency: common people were to be punished [by being made] to work for one year and 503THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 26b officials were to be dismissed from their offices. When A.D. 14, 19 violations became the more numerous and [the people in the group of] five [families who were held responsible] 25a were sentenced together with them and all were Counterfeiters Enslaved to the Mint confiscated to [the government penal service], the commanderies and kingdoms, with accompanying [guards], sent them in carts with cages, with iron locks [about their necks], to the Office for Coinage at Ch'ang-an. Six or seven out of [every] ten [of these people] died from the hardships and suffering. The sixth year after the currency spade-money had A.D. 19 been issued,26.9 26.9 Cf. 99 C: 4b. the Huns made great incursions and A Great Levy and Taxation robberies, [hence Wang] Mang made a great solicitation of the empire's prisoners, convicts, and people's slaves, naming them, "Boar braves who are porcupines rushing out." He temporarily taxed the officials and common people, taking one-thirtieth of their property. He also ordered that the ministers and those of lower [rank, down] to the officials in the commanderies and counties who wore yellow seal-cords,26.10 26.10 Cf. 99 C: n. 4.10. should all guarantee the rearing of horses for the army, and the officials all in turn gave [these horses to] the common people [to care for them]. Whenever the common people moved their hands, they ran upon a prohibition. They could not plow or cultivate silkworms, for the corvÃ©e service was troublesome and distressing, and withering droughts and [plagues of] insects and locusts26.11 26.11 Wang Nien-sun points out that huang-ch'ung was originally ch'ung-huang. He quotes the parallel expressions ch'ung-ming in Li-chi IV, iv, ii, 18 (Legge, I, 306; Couvreur, I, 345); in Yi-li 7: 8a (Steele, I, 50); in Tso-chuan, Dk. Hsiang, XVIII, autumn (Legge, 47611); in the HsÃ¼n-tzu; the present expression ch'ung-; ch'ung-huang in HS 27 Ca: 2b10; the present huang-ch'ung, which he says was originally ch'ung-huang (cf. Ching-yi Shu-wen) in Li-chi IV, iii, 21 (Couvreur, I, 358); and ch'ung-huang in Shuo-wen 13 A: 8b, sub . The HS uses huang just as the Tso-chuan uses ch'ung (as indicating an insect plague), so that it does not make sense to add a ch'ung after the huang, for the phrase ch'ung-huang means that the plague consisted of other insects in addition to the huang. HS 27 Bb: 20a, b lists plagues of ming and huang from 130 to 89 B.C., hence in HS 75: 4a4 Hsia-hou Sheng summed them up by saying that ch'ung-huang arose, i.e., both locusts and other insects appeared; the present reading of HS 75: 4a, huang-ch'ung, which means only locusts, is thus inexact. People did not understand the meaning of ch'ung-huang, so changed it to huang-ch'ung. Hence the phrase huang-ch'ung was originally ch'ung-huang in SC 106: 121 = HS 35: 7b5, HS 75: 4a4, HS 90: 17a10 (which is quoted in a note to HHS, Mem. 67: 10a11 without the ch'ung). followed each other. 504THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS A.D. 19 27a Moreover, because [Wang Mang's] establishment 24 B: 27a Private Illicit Taxation [of rites] and composition [of music] had not been settled, from the dukes and marquises on the one hand to the minor officials on the other, they all could not secure their salaries, so they made private taxations and collections, and goods and bribes flowed up from them. Criminal trials and litigations were not settled, officials employed tyranny and violence in order to establish their power, and utilized [Wang] Mang's prohibitions to encroach upon and oppress the unimportant common people. Banditry When the wealthy were not able to protect themselves 25b and the poor had no way of keeping themselves alive, they arose and became thieves and robbers. Since they relied upon the fastnesses of the mountains and marshes [for refuge], the officials were not able to capture them, hence covered and hid the [fact], and the infection spread daily. Thereupon in the regions of Ch'ing, HsÃ¼, Ching, and Ch'u [Provinces, people] often by the ten-thousands battled and 21b died, were taken captive at the borders by the various barbarians, fell into criminal punishment, or suffered from famine and epidemics, so that people ate each Depopulation other. Before [Wang] Mang had been executed, the population of the empire had been reduced by half.27.1 27.1 H. Bielenstein, BMFEA, no. 19, pp. 125-163, in an illuminating paper, "The Census of China during the Period 2-742 A.D.," (esp. pp. 135-145), shows that, between 2 B.C. (when the population was 56.7 million) and A.D. 140, there was a decrease of 8 or 9 million, i.e., about 15%. The population of northwestern and northeastern China had decreased nearly 18 million, whereas that of south China, especially the present Hunan, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, and Szechuan, had increased by roughly 9 million. When we make allowance for the natural population increase in the subsequent century, Pan Ku's statement, that by A.D. 25 the population fell to half its former figure, is roughly corroborated, but for north China only. He seems to have been unaware that millions had emigrated into central and southern China, so that the total loss in population was not as great as he believed. 505THE TREATISE ON FOOD AND GOODS 24 B: 27a In the fourth year after the "Boar braves who are A.D. 23, 25 A.D. 23 porcupines rushing out" had been mobilized, the Han troops executed [Wang] Mang. The second year afterwards, the Epochal Founder, [Emperor A.D. 25 Kuang-wu], received [Heaven's] mandate, washed away these vexatious [ordinances] and tyrannous [punishments], restored the five-shu cash, and gave a new beginning to the empire.27.2 27.2 HHS Tr. 13: 10b says, "In A.D. 30, boys in Shu circulated a saying, `A yellow bull with a white belly, The five-shu [cash] must be restored.' At this time Kung-sun Shu had usurped the [imperial] title in Shu. At that time, people said secretly that Wang Mang had taken yellow [for his color; Kung-sun] Shu wanted to succeed him, hence he took white [for his color]. The five-shu cash were the currency of the Han dynasty, [so that this saying] made plain that the Han dynasty must be restored. [Kung-sun] Shu was thereupon executed and destroyed." Thus even a reference to a particular coinage had political implications. (Reference from Chou Shou-ch'ang.) 506 APPENDIX II WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS The economic changes made by Wang Mang constitute one of the very interesting experiments man has made with his social environment. In studying these reforms, we must recognize that they sprang from the Confucianism of that age. While Wang Mang was himself interested in changing government institutionsâhe liked nothing so much as to show his superiority by bringing about an improvementâyet the crucial test of any proposed change was whether it was classical, i.e., whether it had been practised or approved by some of the sages, as their deeds and sayings were recorded in the Classics and interpreted by the scholarly traditions of the time, handed down in the various schools. Wang Mang had moreover added certain books to the official Confucian canon: the Tso-chuan, the Chou Offices, the ancient text (since lost) of the Book of History, the lost chapters of that Book, etc. (99 A: 19a). The Chou Offices, for example, seems to have been prepared, in part at least, by idealistic Confucian antiquarians, who, consciously or unconsciously, wrote into the past their own conceptions of an ideal government. In these new canonical books there were naturally many traditions concerning economic matters. Wang Mang had acquired his popularity among the intelligentsia, which had brought him to the throne, by his complete conformity to Confucian ideals; when he ruled in person, he was then obligated to put into practise these Confucian ideals. Wang Mang was, first and foremost, a complete Confucian; the credit for his remarkable reforms must be given rather to the Confucian literati than to him. Wang Mang was also a scheming courtier who wormed his way into power by clever intrigue. He came of a clan that had enriched itself, beyond all other clans, through imperial grants and through profiting from the perquisites of power. While Wang Mang himself held his acquisitive propensities severely in check, in order to appear liberal (99 A: 1b), yet at heart he was grasping and stingy (99 C: 1b). Hence he saw to it that his reforms benefited the throne. In his rule, he showed himself callous to the true interests of his people, with the result that their economic condition deteriorated, until, as a result of misgovernment, oppression, famine, banditry, and civil war, the population was reduced by half (24 B: 27a). Such a result was however quite contrary to Confucian idealism, which 507MONETARY REFORMS was sympathetic with the people. To Confucians, it was axiomatic that all reforms which accord with the Classics will benefit the state and the people. Consequently, when any of Wang Mang's reforms brought discontent and economic disorganization, the conclusion was drawn that it was not really classical. Wang Mang did not follow classical precedents slavishly; he improved on them. The tradition was that King Wen had coined two denominations of money (24 B: n. 21.2), so Wang Mang instituted twenty-eight denominations (24 B: 23a), only later reducing them to two. Wang Mang found the word "controls (kuan)" in the Classics (24 B: 23b), whereupon he used this word as a justification for his monopolies; later, when these monopolies were seen to have oppressed the people, the term "controls" was interpreted otherwise and monopolies were held to be unclassical. As a result of Wang Mang's failure, Confucianism was not discarded by many intelligentsia, it was merely reinterpreted; the Later Han dynasty was at first more Confucian than the Former Han. But sceptical thinkers (even some members of Wang Mang's own clan, such as Wang Chi7 [a distant cousin, cf. HHS, Mem. 9: 1a]) began now to be repelled by Confucianism and were attracted to Taoism, so that at this time there began the re-emergence of this doctrine after a century of almost total eclipse. Wang Mang's own grasping nature was an important reason for the failure of his reforms, in spite of their Confucian nature. We shall consider his economic changes in the following order: (1) his monetary reforms, (2) his policy regarding land and slavery, (3) his monopolies and taxes, and (4) his attempt to speculate in staples and to loan money. His monetary reforms came soon after he became Acting Emperor (A.D. 6). A tradition had been preserved that in Chou times, in order to compensate for fluctuations of prices, there had been two denominations of bronze coins, not merely one, as in Han times. (HS 24 B: 2b, 3a, 21a &amp; n. 21.2). This tradition made varied coinage a Confucian practise, since a fundamental Confucian principle was the imitation of the ancient sages. Wang Mang accordingly coined four denominations of bronze coins, with the values of 1, 50, 500, and 5000 cash. The first two denominations were round cash; the latter two were in the form of knives. The fifty-cash coins had only 1/20 as much metal per cash as the one-cash coins, and the others were proportionately lighter (about 1/100 and 1/625 as much metal per cash as the one-cash coins), so that there was much profit for the government in this coinage. In its early years, the Han dynasty had experimented with depreciating the coinage, but there had arisen opposition to that practise, and, for the last century and 508WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS a quarter, there had been no change in the weight of coins, so that the evil effects of this depreciation were probably not anticipated. One result was a great increase in counterfeiting. In addition, Wang Mang "nationalized" all gold, that is, he permitted only vassal kings to possess actual gold, other nobles and people being required to bring their gold to the Emperor's wardrobe, where they were to be given its value in bronze cash. Pan Ku states that they were not given its full value. Very probably they were paid in light-weight knife-coins of high denominations. Thus Wang Mang made much profit out of manipulating coinage and gold. When in A.D. 9, Wang Mang became titular emperor and established his own dynasty, he had to do away with the knife-coins, because the Chinese word for knife, , forms part of the word Liu , the surname of the Han dynasty. Since a change in currency was thus necessary, he first did away with the knife-coins, only two denominations remaining (A.D. 9), and later (A.D. 10), added other denominations to make twenty-eight in all. Sixteen of these were of bronze. The others, in gold, silver, tortoise-shells, and cowries, were not coined, so that this legislation amounted to fixing a price for these four articles. An important motive in this bronze coinage was undoubtedly to make a profit for the government. We are informed concerning the weight and value of each denomination (24 B: 21a-23a). The light-weight fifty-cash pieces were retained, but the heavy one-cash pieces were replaced by new cash weighing only one-fifth as much as the former one-cash pieces. The higher denominations were in the shape of trousers-cash or spade-money. The weights of these bronze coins were so arranged that the one-cash pieces contained proportionately the largest amount of metal, each higher denomination containing proportionately less metal, until the highest denomination, that of a thousand cash, contained only 2.4% as much metal per cash as the one-cash pieces (cf. 24 B: n. 22.11). This coinage was thus an issue of metal fiat money. People who had previously used the heavy one-cash pieces would hardly want to give them up in exchange for the new light coins. In order to make the coins of large denominations circulate, Wang Mang ordered that all persons who passed the likin stations at the passes, fords, and elsewhere must show large spade-coins of high denominations along with their passports; officials who used the government posts or who entered the palaces, must also show spade-money in order to be admitted (99 B: 15a). Since cash were cast, instead of being struck, counterfeiting was easy and many people were driven to it in order to preserve their wealth. To stop counterfeiting, Wang Mang made the possession of copper and charcoal an offense (99 B: 509MONETARY REFORMS 7b). This law proved too drastic and was moreover ineffective; it was consequently abolished in A.D. 13 (99 B: 22a). When the people refused to use the new coins, Wang Mang issued an edict that all those possessing the older heavy cash would be executed or exiled. Pan Ku says that as a consequence farmers could not sell their produce nor merchants their goods, and the common people wept in the market-places and highways, while uncounted people and officials, even of the highest ranks, were sentenced for crime (24 B: 23a). When we note that the mere possession of the heavy coins was made a crime, and that an informer was given half of the illicit wealth seized as a result of his information, we can well believe Pan Ku's statement. In order to maintain a semblance of authority over the coinage, Wang Mang had to abandon all but two denominations of these new coins, and retain only the light one-cash pieces and the fifty-cash pieces (24 B: 23b). Some years later (A.D. 14), Wang Mang again changed the coinage. The light-weight one-cash pieces had probably so disarranged prices that there had been a loud clamor for the restoration of the previous heavy cash. The people had been paying taxes in the light cash, and the officials had probably found that taxes and their salaries (which were payable half in coin) did not yield as much value as previously. The former coinage was therefore abolished and the previous heavy one-cash pieces, weighing five times as much as the light one-cash pieces, were restored. But the light one-cash coins were not exchanged for the new heavy cash; they were merely dropped. The one-cash pieces in circulation were thus demonetized. An edict was issued which declared that the previous fifty-cash coins (weighing two and one-half times as much as the new large one-cash coins) were to be worth as much as one of the new one-cash pieces (24 B: 26b), i.e., the government would take a former fifty-cash coin in place of a new one-cash coin. The people were given six years in which to make this change; after that time, possession of the former fifty-cash pieces was to be forbidden. The result may easily be imagined. A person who had any large amount of money in fifty-cash pieces and who used it in accordance with the law, lost 49/50 of his money. What he had in one-cash pieces became worth only so much metal. Few people could afford to make the exchange. By melting down cash, on the other hand, a person may have lost comparatively little, for cash were then probably worth approximately their weight in metal. All that was needed was new cash to use as models, clay for moulds, and a charcoal stove to melt the coins. It is not surprising that counterfeiting became ubiquitous. To stop it, people were grouped in lots of five families, who were responsible for each other; if one 510WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS family was caught counterfeiting, all five families were punished. So many people, however, violated the law that the punishments could not be carried out. Wang Mang had to lighten the punishment for counterfeiting to enslavement of the counterfeiter to the government, together with his wife and children and those in his group of five families. These unfortunates were transported to the mint at the capital to work out their sentences. Pan Ku states that six or seven out of every ten died from the hardships and suffering (24 B: 26b). There were also coined new twenty-five-cash pieces (in the shape of trousers-cash or spade-money), which contained one-fifth as much metal per cash as the new one-cash pieces. Thus the former principle was continued, of profiting by coining light-weight pieces of high denominations. Light-weight coins of high value would be a boon to anyone who must transport money, if their value could be maintained. But there is no evidence that the government did anything to maintain their value. The fact that the coins of high denominations in the second coinage were dropped and that the coins of high value in the third coinage were only twenty-five-cash pieces, instead of fifty-cash pieces as in the first coinage, would seem to indicate that the value of these coins was not maintained and that they depreciated in usage. We must resort to inference in order to determine the precise economic effects upon Chinese society of Wang Mang's three changes in coinage and his nationalization of gold. The latter decree probably succeeded in mulcting the wealthy, especially the Han dynasty's nobility, who were the only persons likely to have possessed much gold. They needed gold for their yearly contribution to the throne (HFHD II, 126-128). Since Wang Mang allowed the highest nobles (the vassal kings) to retain their gold, he did not, even in A.D. 6, take gold completely out of circulation; the enactment of A.D. 10, which made gold one of the articles of currency, rescinded the prohibition against possessing gold. At that time, gold was not coined, but circulated in the shape of square cakes an inch (0.9 in., Eng. meas.) on a side and weighing a catty (then 7.84 oz. troy, 244 g.; HFHD, I, 280). Such a catty of gold was worth ten thousand cash; imperial grants of gold were usually transmitted in terms of their equivalent in bronze cash. Ten catties of gold was the value of the property belonging to a median family (HS 4: 21a). By exchanging depreciated inlaid bronze knife-coins for actual gold, Wang Mang deprived all but his highest nobles of much of their wealth. His use of such knife-money in making grants saved him about 99.8% of the metal he would otherwise have disbursed. For the first three years after their gold had been taken away, the nobles probably did not feel the 511ECONOMIC REFORMS lossâthey merely paid their annual required contribution in the form of gilded knife-money. When, however, in A.D. 9, these knife-coins were demonetized and suddenly became worth only their value in metal, the nobles found themselves mulcted and had to get rid of these knife-coins to show their loyalty to the new dynasty. Thus, by a clever trick, Wang Mang deprived the Han dynasty's nobility of much their wealth, before he dismissed them and set up his own nobility. Wang Mang seems to have hoarded most of the gold he obtained. He was miserly, and failed to use his treasure, even in emergencies (cf. his payment to soldiers, 99 C: 25b). Pan Ku reports that when Wang Mang was finally killed, he still had much treasure. Ten thousand catties of gold made a chest and there were sixty chests of gold in the imperial apartments, as well as several chests in other offices of the palace, besides cash, silk, pearls, jade and valuables (99 C: 25a, b). This nationalization of gold seems merely to have withdrawn much of the empire's gold from circulation and to have concentrated it in the imperial palace. The nobles had been given depreciated bronze coins, nominally of the same value, but probably exchangeable in trade for far less, and these coins were soon demonetized, after which time gold was again allowed to circulate. Sixty chests of gold, if all the chests were full, would be 146,400,000 grams or 4,706,867 oz. troy. There were also "several chests" in each of three other offices, so that the total amount, if correctly reported, must have been about 5,000,000 oz. of gold. Where did this huge amount of treasure come from? If the report is correct, it was a greater quantity than the entire visible stock of gold in Europe of the middle ages, which is estimated as not over 3,750,000 oz.1 1 Joseph Kitchin, Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, art. "Gold." The reliability of this report concerning the gold is probably quite high. Pan Ku was too careful a historian to insert such a statement into his account if he had no documentary source for it. He had no motive in exaggerating Wang Mang's wealth. This statement probably came from the report to the Keng-shih Emperor made in A.D. 23 by the captors of Ch'ang-an. They may indeed have exaggerated their report of Wang Mang's wealth. "Sixty" is a round number and so may not be exact. But the captors would not have exaggerated very much, for they would be held accountable if any large amount of treasure was missing. The Wei-yang Palace, in which were located the inner apartments containing this large treasure, was burnt in the attack upon Wang Mang, but Pan Ku says specifically that the government treasuries were nevertheless maintained intact (99 C: 29a). Proof that Wang Mang had possessed a 512WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS large amount of gold is also afforded by his betrothal present to the family of his second wife, nee Shih, which was 30,000 catties of actual gold or 235,343 oz. (7,320,000 g.; 99 C: 20a).2 2 SC 30: 11 (= Mh III, 553 = HS 24 B: 8a) also states that in 123 B.C. (possibly in this and the preceding years since 135 B.C., when Emperor Wu began his war against the Huns) Emperor Wu gave out more than 200,000 catties of actual gold in rewards to his victorious troopsâan amount over 1,568,000 oz. or 48,800,000 g. There may have been a set monetary grant for each head or prisoner taken (cf. 6: n. 7.8) or Emperor Wu may have been over-liberal in his grants. They seem to have exhausted the imperial treasury, for at this time a new military aristocracy was established, ranks in which were to be used in the future to reward victorious troops. In 135 B.C., Emperor Wu then possessed at least 1,600,000 oz. or 50,000,000 g. of gold, while in 23 A.D. Wang Mang had three times as much. It is attractive to speculate that in a century and a half the gold stock of China may have tripled. (It should however be noted that Emperor Wu did not attempt to monopolize his country's gold in the way Wang Mang did.) Thus Wang Mang must at one time have had about five million ounces of gold. China had never produced any large quantity of gold;3 3 While gold is very widely distributed in China, it has nowhere been mined in very large amounts, and ancient references to gold production in China are quite uncommon. There seems to be only one in the HSâ28 Aiii: 42b states that ten-odd li west of Wu-yang District in P'o-yang County of YÃ¼-chang Commandery there was a gold placer (this phrase is interpreted "where gold is taken"). Wu-yang was fifty li east of the present P'o-yang. (This placer is also mentioned in Shui-ching-chu 39: 17b.) But HS 28 Bii: 67a reports, "YÃ¼-chang [Commandery] produces actual gold, but very little. The things that can be gotten with it are inadequate in exchange for the expense [of getting it]." Probably other Chinese deposits were likewise poor. Shui-ching-chu 27: 12b mentions gold in the mountains along the Han River below the Hou-ching Rapids below Ch'eng-ku , and also on the southern bank of the Yangtze, below its junction with the Hsiang River (ibid. 35: 4a), but neither of these places seems to have produced much gold. Curiously enough, Kiangsi is not at present credited with any gold production. Evidently its deposits were anciently exhausted. (Cf. New Atlas &amp; Commercial Gazetteer of China; Chinese Year Book, 1938-1939, pp. 488-490.) According to a news release from the China Information Committee, dated Aug. 7, 1939, although efforts had been made to stimulate gold production by modern methods, for many years previous to 1938-9, gold production in China and outlying territories had averaged only 130,000 ounces yearly. (Communicated by Prof. T. T. Reed of Columbia University School of Mines.) With ancient primitive methods of mining, even if all the modern lodes were known in ancient times (which is not at all likely), the amount of production would have been very much less. If there had been any large production of gold in ancient China, we would undoubtedly have been informed of it. Ancient Chinese production cannot explain Wang Mang's hoard of gold. Outside of the above few references, gold production is mentioned in the HS only in two regions outside the Chinese area: in Chi-pin (Kabul or northern India) and in Wu-yi-shan-li (Seistan; HS 96 A: 24a, 29a = de Groot, Die Westlande, pp. 87, 91; for identification, cf. Tarn, Greeks in Bactria, pp. 340 ff, 347). But Tarn (ibid. p. 103-4) indicates that these regions produced no gold; their gold was an importation from Siberia. The HS says nothing, either in its "Treatise on the Principles of Geographical Arrangements" (ch. 28) or elsewhere, about any gold washings in YÃ¼nnan or elsewhere, such as those mentioned by Marco Polo (II, ch. 47-48). HHS, Tr. 23 A: 24a however notes gold produced in the southern borders of Po-nan County in Yung-ch'ang Commandery, which is the present Yung-ch'ang , YÃ¼nnan. This gold seems however to have first become known between the time Pan Ku wrote in 58-84 A.D. and the age in which Szu-ma Piao (ca. 240-306) compiled the HHS Treatises. According to the Hua-yang Kuo Chih (by Ch'ang Ch'Ã¼, fl. dur. 302-347), 4: 5b, chap. "Nan-chung Chih," this gold seems to have been produced abundantly only after the conquest of this region in A.D. 225. Hence the gold of YÃ¼nnan did not contribute to Wang Mang's hoard. While it is always dangerous to argue from negatives, yet the HS is careful in mentioning outstanding products and seems to be interested in deposits of gold. We are hence probably safe in concluding that nowhere in the Chinese world of Han times were there produced any large amounts of gold, so that Wang Mang's store must have been largely imported from outside China. whence could he have obtained all this treasure? 513MONETARY REFORMS It undoubtedly came to China in return for Chinese exports, the chief of which was silk. Gold has indeed a tendency to form hoards. Siberia was then the largest and nearest source of gold. Much of the gold possessed by ancient oriental empires seems to have come from this region. Parthia, Bactria, Sogdiana, and India produced little or no gold, although Bactria was famed in ancient times for its gold.4 4 W. W. Tarn, The Greeks in Bactria and India, p. 107 f, points out that the Greeks had to teach the Indians about gold and silver mining and that the Greek invaders got no gold in India (ibid. 108; 106, n. 6). In Darius' inscription, no gold came from Sogdiana. Yet in legend, Bactria had been a golden land (e.g., the golden Treasure of the Oxus in v and iv cent. B.C.); from Bactria the Persian empire had drawn its gold; but Bactria itself produced no gold. After Euthydemus (d. ca. 189 B.C.), no Greek king of Bactria coined any gold, although gold coinage was prized. Even in India, no Greek or Saca king coined any gold (ibid. pp. 104 f). Bactrian and Indian gold was an importation chiefly from Siberia or the Mediterranean world. An abundance of golden articles has however been found in Scythian graves in South Russia and Siberia. In the fifth century, the Massagetae, who were northern neighbors of Bactria, had so much gold that they used it to make bits and trappings for their horses.5 5 Herodotus I, 215. Probably most of this gold came from placer mining along the headwaters of Siberian rivers; even at the beginning of the present century, the main Siberian sources were the washings along the Lena and Amur. Possibly the Obi and Yenisei systems also furnished gold; new gold fields are said to have recently been discovered near the head waters of both rivers. Probably gold was obtained over a very large area; Siberia is today asserted to have larger amounts of gold 514WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS than any other country.6 6 Most of this information is taken from Tarn, Greeks in Bactria, pp. 105 f. There may also have been gold mines in the Urals and Altai, but mining was so laborious in comparison with washing that most of the gold probably came from the rivers. Anciently this supply must have seemed inexhaustible. The Chinese probably obtained a goodly share of this Siberian gold by trade with their northern neighbors. Although these peoples did not wear silk, yet their leaders would want it as an article of luxury; other Chinese articles of luxury were likewise exported to these peoples. The Chinese traded actively with the Huns and other northern neighbors (except when they were at war with them) along the whole northern border, and (at least during the first century B.C.) Chinese envoys traveled regularly through much of southern Siberia, along with whom went merchants, who took advantage of the envoy's escort and probably paid his expenses. Gold was also mined in Europe and possibly in Asia Minor. There were important gold mines in Transylvania, where the Romans obtained much gold.7 7 E. H. Minns, Scythians and Greeks, p. 7. Once silk became available, the Romans eagerly sought for it, just as they imported large quantities of Indian spices and other goods. In Wang Mang's time, the silk trade with Greek Asia and India via the Tarim basin had been actively carried on for some centuries. We know little of it before the time of Emperor Wu, but the fact that Chang Ch'ien reported conditions in Bactria shows that before the Chinese conquered the Tarim basin, trade was going on between the Greek orient and China. After that conquest, with the establishment of peace, trade doubtless increased several-fold. In 67 B.C., a Protector-General was established for the Western Frontier Regions and in 48 B.C. the army of the Mou-and-Chi Colonel was established there to maintain order. At the same time, silk was becoming more and more popular in Rome. Julius Caesar (d. 44 B.C.) is reported to have possessed silken curtains, but the introduction of silk to Rome in quantities began only in the reign of Augustus (27 B.C.-A.D. 14) and may be traced to Marcus Antonius, who communicated with the Bactrians. Tiberius (A.D. 14-37) censured the wearing of silk by both sexes and forbad its wearing by men. Gaius (37-41) revived the wearing of silk, at least by the emperor. But clothing made wholly of silk was rare until Elagabalus (218-222) set the example, this material normally being woven into linen or woolen fabrics after importation. At the same time that they were using silk, the 515MONETARY REFORMS Romans were importing much larger quantities of goods from India; Pliny says that at the lowest computation, India, Seres, and Arabia drained from the Roman empire a hundred million sesterces (over five million dollars-worth) annually, more than half of which went to India.8 8 E. H. Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India, p. 175, 41, 42, 274. Thus wealthy Romans began to use a certain amount of silk in the last century of the Former Han period; in the time of Wang Mang, sumptuary legislation was enacted against it, and in Later Han times its use became common among the wealthy. Before silk became sought after in Rome, its use had probably become likewise popular in the kingdoms of central and western Asia and in India. As early as the time of Emperor Wu, traders were taking silk to India by sea (HS 28 Bii: 68b); this sea-borne trade seems however to have represented a drain of gold rather than an accession of it. There was also some trade to India via YÃ¼nnan and Burma. But these two routes can hardly have carried any large quantities of trade; the geographical obstacles were too great. The chief route of export was by way of the Tarim basin, which led into Sogdiana and Bactria, and thence to India or to the Mediterranean world. It is doubtful whether there was much return trade to China in goods by this route. The road was so long and difficult that only goods which combined high value with small bulk would be profitable to carry. In Europe, silk was worth its weight in gold. Some jewels (including pearls from India) and a few Hellenistic works of art seem to have been all that the Chinese imported. But their appeal was limited, so that large quantities would hardly be carried to China. Hence the return trade was largely in gold, which alone, together with silk, fulfilled the conditions for profitable trade. Thus China may have drained the Hellenistic Euthydemids of gold in the first century B.C., just as in the time of Wang Mang the Roman use of silk threatened the Roman stock of gold. It is an interesting fact that, although gold was mined in Europe, in late antiquity, accumulated stocks of gold seem to have disappeared from that region. Much of this gold found its way to India, but some must have come to China. Large hoards of gold coins dating from Hellenistic and Roman times have been found in India, but finds of such coins are extremely rare in Chinese territory. Trade between the Roman empire and India went direct; that between the Roman empire and the Chinese seems only to have been carried by middlemen, until Later Han times. The Chinese were furthermore accustomed to using gold in the form of bullion squares, so that they melted down Greek and Roman coins. In China there was a customary ratio between gold and cash (10,000 cash to 1 catty of gold, 130 to 1). Wang Mang's stock of gold probably came 516WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS chiefly from Siberia, somewhat from Hellenistic Asia and India, and some from Europe. At the beginning of the Former Han period, gold seems to have been used in China freely in exchange; imperial grants were frequently in "actual gold." By the latter part of that period, actual gold seems to have been used much less frequently. Probably the opening of the copper mines in the lower Yangtze region and elsewhere had made bronze cash so plentiful that even large sums were transferred in the form of cash. In A.D. 3, Wang Mang was given 40,000,000 cash and 23,000,000 cash as betrothal presents for his daughter (99 A: 10a). With large quantities of cash available, it would have been natural that gold should have accumulated in the treasuries of the wealthy, who were chiefly the nobles. When Wang Mang demonetized gold, these nobles would have been especially careful to deliver up their stores of gold, in order to avoid the punishment (dismissal and confiscation) for retaining any of it. Thus Wang Mang probably secured much of the gold in China, which country had been draining gold from Asia and Europe. The changes in the bronze coinage probably affected Han China much less than a similar depreciation would have done in modern times. China had already changed from a barter economy to a limited money economy. The land tax was still payable in kind, but money was exacted for the numerous other taxes. The salaries of officials were quoted in so many piculs of grain, and were paid, half in grain and half in money (HHS, Tr. 28: 14b, 15a). Poll-taxes, levied upon all adults and all children over their seventh year, were in cash. Artisans and professional men paid an income tax in money, (established by Wang Mang; 24 B: 24a, b). The Han satrapies each sent an annual accounting to the imperial government, and probably at the same time remitted a certain proportion of the taxes they had gathered. Nearer commanderies remitted at least a portion in the form of grain. We hear of corvÃ©e service for the transportation of grain and of a special canal to Ch'ang-an dug for its conveyance. Distant commanderies probably remitted cash or valuables. An effort seems to have been made to transport to the capital no more grain than was necessary to feed the people in that region. The capital region had been irrigated, and had been one of the most productive areas in the empire. Hence taxes could largely be remitted in money, which had been used to purchase grain in the capital area. Each city had its market-place (or bazaar); the capital had two. There was thus a large sum of money in circulation for purposes of taxation and trade. The farmers probably used very little money. They stored their grain and used it themselves or sold small amounts in order to purchase articles 517MONETARY REFORMS in the markets. The farmers who possessed money were probably only those who had accumulated surplus wealth. The poorer people affected by Wang Mang's changes in coinage were chiefly those who were in debt. Interest rates were quite high. We have no way of knowing how many farmers were involved in debt, for we hear nothing of farm debts. Since merchants were prohibited from owning cultivated fields, they would hardly lend money on farm land, for they could not foreclose such a mortgage. A real, though limited money economy was only a few centuries old in the China of Wang Mang's time, so that a mortgage system may have not yet developed. The only moneyed people besides merchants were nobles and officials. Some decades previously, the Grandee Secretary, Kung YÃ¼, (d. 43 B.C.) had memorialized the throne that the court officials should not be allowed to buy or sell or to make money off the people, but this memorial had not been acted upon (HS 72: 14a). Hence some wealthy officials did actually engage in business, but that procedure was frowned upon and was not considered proper. There had been a long-standing prejudice and prohibition against merchants entering government positions. The higher nobles undoubtedly considered it beneath their dignity to engage in business. Some of the wealthier ones however maintained "guests," i.e., persons of ability who came voluntarily to their house, became part of their household, receiving support from them, and in return executed various commissions for them. We hear of guests who gave clever advice, of others who wrote books for their host, of still others who avenged their host's feud, and even of guests who robbed for their host, bringing their booty into his house and being protected by him. Some nobles had guests who engaged in business for their hosts. But here again the aristrocratic prejudice against merchants probably prevented this carrying on of business by proxy from becoming a very common practise. We hear of one wealthy merchant who sent his slaves out to conduct businesses (91: 10a), and of a wealthy family that lent money, but these loans were to other merchants or artisans (91: 9b). When Wang Mang established an office for making loans, his enactment implies that debts were incurred chiefly for the performing of religious sacrifices (especially burials) and for buying farm land or setting up businesses (24 B: 24b). In an emergency, a certain wealthy man made loans to those newly enfeoffed nobles who needed supplies for a military expedition against rebels (154 B.C.; he exacted a tenfold repayment; 91: 11b). But nowhere do we hear of any extensive loans to farmers, except those 518WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS made by the government in time of drought or calamity. The government would sometimes settle landless people on vacant or newly opened land, giving them seed, food, and oxen for plowing. They were expected to repay these debts, but this provision was frequently waived by an imperial act of grace. The only large farm debts may have been of this variety; but on such debts, the government, if it wished, doubtless found means whereby a change in coinage would not diminish its revenues. Wealthy land-owners probably exacted their rents in terms of grain, rather than money, as is still the case in rural China. Hence farmers (except the wealthy ones) were probably little affected by the depreciation of money. Merchants and other wealthy persons (who were probably bureaucrats or their descendants) were the ones who felt the deprecations of the coinage, for they possessed most of the money not in the hands of the government. The policy of the Han dynasty was to discourage trade and foster agriculture in every possible manner. Trade was penalized drastically. Merchants were considered parasites and were compelled to pay larger taxes than farmers. They and their descendants were not ordinarily allowed to hold official positions. How far the depreciations of the coinage actually deprived merchants of their wealth is difficult to determine. The extremely rich, settled merchants, who had large establishments, probably found it possible to melt down their cash promptly and recoin it into the new forms. They may even had made money by the change, just as did the government. Wealthy officials probably kept most of their property in the form of goods or jewels. Those who suffered were the smaller merchants and pedlars, who did not have facilities for counterfeiting, and whose small shops could easily be watched. The worst suffering was among the unfortunates who were caught counterfeiting; they were punished with their innocent neighbors who had failed to report the crime. The chief effect of the changes in coinage was probably the transfer of wealth from the smaller merchants to some rich merchants and especially to the government. Wang Mang had incurred great expenses, and his income was inadequate for the government expenses. It was thus only natural that he should have depreciated the coinage in order to secure money. Government loans had not yet been thought of. The circumstances occasioning the monetary changes and the nature of the changes in the coinages were such that Wang Mang could hardly have had any genuine revolutionary policy in mindâhis purpose was probably to make money for the government by a change in coinage which superficially had classical sanctions. 519LAND AND SLAVERY In his land policy, Wang Mang encountered similar difficulties. Population had increased considerably during the peaceful years of the Han dynasty. North China (then the only thickly populated part of the country) is a region of periodic droughts and floods; many poor farmers, unable to keep reserves enough to tide them over a drought, had been forced to sell their hand in bad years, in order to get food. It had been the policy of the Han government to maintain great granaries for famine relief, to make loans to the poor, and to settle landless refugees upon vacant lands. Nevertheless large holdings of land and tenancy had increased and had long been a problem, because tenants could scarcely accumulate the reserves necessary to tide them over a famine. A famine year inevitably produced great hordes of vagrants, who died on the roads and thronged into regions where there was food. Since the government levied poll-taxes upon adults and children over seven years of age, in addition to the land-tax, this vagrancy meant not only human suffering, but also a great loss of income to the government. In the year that he took the throne (A.D. 9), Wang Mang reformed the tenure of land by establishing the ching system (99 B: 8a, b; 24 A: 21a, b).9 9 Cf. also K. A. Wittfogel, "Foundations and Stages of Chinese Economic History," Zeit. f. Sozialforschung, 4 (1935), p. 44 f. The Confucian tradition was that this system had been universal in Chou times in all flat regions, and that other types of terrain had been parcelled out proportionately (HS 24 A: 3a). According to this system, an area one li or about 1350 feet square (Eng. meas.). was divided into nine equal squares. One of the outer squares, containing 100 mou or about 4Â½ acres, was given to each of eight families to cultivate for its own use. (For the size of the li and mou, cf. 99 A: n. 9.7.) Each family also cultivated one-ninth of the central square (Â½ acre), the produce of which was to be paid to the government in lieu of taxes. The remaining ninth of the central square was reserved for houses and buildings. Thus the farmer paid as taxes only one-tenth of his produce, and paid it in kind, not in money. Land was moreover distributed according to the needs of the people, so that one household, containing five persons and one male worker, cultivated one unit. A youth received land in his twentieth year and returned it to the government in his sixtieth year. (Cf. Pan Ku's account, in HS 24 A: 2a ff.)10 10 In estimating the areas of land concerned, I have used the Han figure for the li; the length of the Chou li and size of the Chou ching are uncertain. Since however the underlying unit was the pu or double-pace (300 pu made a li), which is a natural and not an arbitrary unit, the difference in these two larger measures between Chou and Han times may not have been large. The Chou foot was one or two inches (Eng. meas.) shorter than the Han foot, but the Chou pu contained eight Chou feet while the Han pu contained only 6 Han feet (cf. 99 A: n. 9.7), so that the two pu seem to have been about the same length. 520WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS This ching system looks excellent on paper; but its practical difficulties make doubtful its use without changes over any large area. Land cannot always be divided into exact squares; streams, hills, and roads interfere with such a division. Five acres could not support a family except on the best soil; Pan Ku, in describing this system (24 A: 2b), states that two or three times as much land of the poorer varieties was necessary for a family. A tax amounting to only a tithe of the produce would provide very little for the officials in poor years, when they needed a larger income than in good years. This sum was furthermore too small for the requirements of a developed government, which maintained an expensive and luxurious court, an elaborate bureaucracy with post-roads and post-stations, a standing army, government schools, a government university, etc., etc. Hence there had been added to the tax on land other taxes, such as a regular conscript system, which required three days a month service at the distant frontiers (regularly commuted to a money payment for substitutes, who became a standing army). In addition, there were heavy poll-taxes of various sorts. Tung Chung-shu said, in a memorial to Emperor Wu (24 A: 16b), that farm tenants paid out five-tenths of their income to their landlords. In Han times, money had come to be the usual medium of exchange, so that the payment of all taxes in kind was a special boon granted by the throne to the farmers only on special occasions, when grain was extraordinarily low in price. Thus the ching system seems to have been a dream of idealistic scholars; it had probably been tried only in a restricted area and in much simpler times, and, if applied literally, was quite impractical in a society like that of Han China. (In recent centuries, it has been considered by orthodox Confucian authorities as a practise suitable only for Spring and Autumn times. That conclusion is however probably a consequence from the experience of Wang Mang and others with this scheme.) The ching system had however the great merit of doing away with tenancy and large land-holdings, from both of which China suffered. This system had great authority, for it had been urged by Mencius (III, A, iii, 13-20; Legge, 243-5) and was said to have been the system employed by the Confucian sages. Tung Chung-shu, the great Confucian authority, had urged it upon Emperor Wu (24 A: 17a), and Shih1 Tan, 521LAND AND SLAVERY another Confucian, had urged it upon Emperor Ai in 7 B.C. (24 A: 20a), probably because they felt that the land needed redistribution and taxes were too onerous. Wang Mang, who had secured the throne because he followed Confucian practises whole-heartedly, naturally ordered its enactment. In order to prevent any increase in tenancy, he at the same time nationalized all land. He named all cultivated fields, "the King's fields, wang-t'ien ," and ordered that they could not be bought or sold. Thus farmers were deprived of the opportunity to alienate their land, even in extremities. The amount of land that one family could hold was also limited. A family containing nine adult males or less was allowed to possess a maximum of 900 mou (102 acres or 41.5 ha.) of arable land; any family with less than that number of adult males and more than that amount of land must distribute its excess land to relatives or neighbors. Thus land ceased to have any market-value and wealthy land-owners were compelled to get rid of all but a small part of their land. Wang Mang must have realized the extremely drastic nature of this reform and the resentment it would arouse, for he added that anyone who dared even to criticize the ching system would be exiled beyond the frontiers or suffer execution. At the same time, slavery, which had also been disapproved by Confucians, was to be abolished. Tung Chung-shu had urged its abolition more than a century previously (24 A: 17a). As a consequence of Shih1 Tan's proposals in 7 B.C., it had actually been ordered that vassal kings might own only 200 slaves, marquises and princesses only 100 slaves, and others only 30 slaves, but this law had been dropped and had never been enforced (11: 3a). Wang Mang now produced a text from the Confucian canon, which was interpreted to assert that slavery was lawful only for the government, i.e., there should be no slaves except those in penal servitude to the government. Private slaves were renamed "private adherents " and were not to be bought or sold. The limitation of land holdings was a specifically Confucian measure. Tung Chung-shu had advocated the limitation of the amount of land that could be held by an individual (24 A: 17a). Shih1 Tan had repeated that statement (24 A: 20b). When Emperor Ai had agreed, his officials suggested that kings and marquises should be allowed unrestricted amounts of private land within their kingdoms or marquisates; outside these areas they should be restricted to 3000 mou (342 acres or 136 ha.). It was also proposed that the number of slaves be restricted. The Emperor's maternal relatives had however found this restriction inconvenient, and prevented it from being put into effect (11: 3a; 24 A:20b). The 522WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS ching system and the limitation of land had the backing of Confucian tradition and sentiment. A customary practise, like the free ownership of land, cannot be changed overnight. Land had been bought and sold freely in China for several centuries. After Wang Mang's edict was published, it was but natural that the wealthy should seek to convert their excess land and slaves into money. Pan Ku reports that countless people, nobles, ministers, and commoners, were sentenced for purchasing or selling land or slaves (99 B: 9a). It is not surprising that two years later the prohibition against buying or selling land or slaves was rescinded (24 A: 21b). In A.D. 17, a tax of 3600 cash per slave was levied upon all slave-owners, including nobles (99 C: 1b). The intent of this tax was not to eliminate slavery, but merely to obtain money. Since rich households depended upon slaves for domestic service, this law bore chiefly upon the wealthy nobles and high officials. In the abolition of slavery and the restriction of land holdings, Wang Mang was undoubtedly making a needed reform. It is possible that the more thoroughgoing nature of this enactment, as compared with previous proposals of the kind, indicates a genuine altruism on his part and a desire to help the poor. The severity with which violations of his enactment were punished may have also been merely a general characteristic of his government. He very likely conceived of himself as altruistic. The drastic nature of his enactments may however have been merely his conception of the lengths to which a new and thoroughly Confucian dynasty should go in carrying out supposedly ancient practises and an expression of his sense of power. This latter supposal is moreover more in harmony with the rest of his deeds. Certainly he seems to have shown no pity for those who suffered from his reforms. Since these reforms were all rescinded within two years, someone was evidently able to bring so much pressure upon him that he had to revoke this reform of land tenure and slavery. We are not told who it was, so shall be compelled to resort again to inference. No large part of the population in China has ever been enslaved except by a general conquest. Slaves have rarely, if ever, been used for agricultural work. Skilled artisans, who are able to make money by plying their trades, tend to become freemen; free labor is more efficient than slave labor and clever slaves purchase their freedom. Chinese slavery was limited chiefly to domestic service and rough labor. The government was undoubtedly the largest slave-owner; criminals were frequently condemned to forced labor for a period of years or for life and were put to work in the government offices. (C. M. Wilbur, Slavery in China During 523LAND AND SLAVERY the Former Han Dynasty, pp. 241-44.) The menial labor at the various bureaux was performed by these slaves. Thousands of such enslaved criminals were employed in the government iron and salt monopolies. A capital sentence could sometimes be commuted, at the culprit's request, to castration, whereupon he became a eunuch in the imperial palaceâa eunuch government slave. Many, perhaps most of the palace eunuchs must have originated in this manner. We hear of thousands of slaves in the imperial palace and occasionally even of a highly educated slave-girl, such as Emperor Ch'eng's inamorata, Ts'ao Kung (HFHD, II, 369). Government slaves were freed when their terms were completed. Government slaves were sometimes bestowed upon imperial relatives or favorites; occasionally at least, they were sold (Wilbur, op. cit., p. 446). There may have been hereditary slaves, but there is some evidence that children of slaves were automatically free, at least by the fourth generation, unless (as must have very commonly been the case) they were, as children, sold or given into slavery by their parents, in order that they might be reared. The Huns captured large numbers of Chinese in their raids upon the borders; these people were often sold, many, in all probability, to Chinese. The slave-market was however chiefly maintained from children sold by their poor parents or from children or adults kidnapped by powerful people (perhaps given actually unjust, but technically legal sentences of enslavement). Criminals who were enslaved by the government would rarely be of high caliber and would be suitable chiefly for rough labor; for entertainers and other trained domestic slaves, the nobles and wealthy had to depend chiefly upon the slave market.11 11 Concerning slaves in agricultural colonies in A.D. 275, cf. HJAS 9, 161. This agricultural slavery was probably little different from other agricultural colonies, except that in this case the colonists were criminals made to farm. Outside the government service, the largest number of slaves were in the noble houses. The nobles maintained slaves as entertainers as well as domestic servants. Rich merchants also had such slaves; sometimes slaves were used for manufacturing. The prohibition of the sale or purchase of slaves would have limited severely the supply of high quality domestic slaves and it would have made the government the only remaining source of slaves. At the time, it produced little immediate change, except among merchants who had bought slaves for resale. We may well conclude that it was Wang Mang's nobles, probably his close relatives, who persuaded him to rescind this measure, for these nobles would have 524WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS found it impossible to replenish the high quality slaves in their households. Since the revocation came so soon, the measure had a negligible effect upon slavery. Just how Wang Mang put the ching system into effect is not told. He could not cut the land up into regular squares; probably he did not change the boundaries of fields, but merely limited to 900 mou the amount of land one family might possess. The Han land-tax was one-fifteenth, so that the introduction of the ching system probably meant an increase in the land tax to one-tenth. The other taxes, such as the poll-tax on adults, (suan), the poll-money (levied on children), the military taxes (fu), likin duties (collected at the Wu Pass and probably at the other passes), were probably continued. Then the actual effect of the ching system was very likely limited to prohibiting the sale of cultivated land, limiting land holdings, and an increase in the land tax. The ban on selling cultivated land was probably a benefit to the poor farmers. It prevented them from losing their land in time of drought. Hence they were compelled to fall back upon the government for relief and to become vagrants when that relief was not available. We are not told about any mortgages upon farm land. This prohibition of the sale of farm land merely fixed the existing farm population upon the farms they then occupied. It was rescinded within two years and so had little actual effect. The limitation of the amount of cultivated land that could be owned by a single small family was plainly an attempt to diminish tenancy and distribute the land more widely among the people. It only affected large land-owners. These large land-owners were chiefly the bureaucrats and nobility (these two classes were largely identical, since the Han nobilities had been mostly discontinued and Wang Mang's nobles were his relatives and officials); merchants were not allowed to own farm land. The reason that the nobles would wish to own large private farm estates requires explanation. The Han dynasty's full marquises (which Wang Mang replaced by four degrees of nobility: marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons) all had their noble estates located outside of Kuan-chung (the capital region, roughly the present central Shensi), some at considerable distances from the capitalâin the present southern Honan, Hunan, Shantung, or Hopei. The nobles had little control over their fiefs; these estates were managed by chancellors, who were appointed by the central government; in practise, nobles received merely the income from these estates in the form of 200 cash per household or its equivalent in grain, out of which they had to pay their annual contributions to the imperial court (91: 6a). But the 525LAND AND SLAVERY transport of grain or even of bronze cash from a distance to the capital presented difficulties because of banditry, and sometimes cost more than the value of the grain itself. It may have been impossible to make regular deliveries to the capital from the noble estates, because of the distance. Most of the nobles, moreover, lived at the imperial capital, Ch'ang-an, the center of culture, civilization, and political power. Hence it became the practise for such nobles to purchase private land in Kuan-chung, the income of which they used for their expenses. Such neighboring lands could be watched, and rents brought to the capital with ease. The largest private land-owners were the same rich nobles who had large numbers of slaves. Wang Mang's uncles are described as having, at the time of Wang Mang's childhood, "several tens of concubines in their harems, slaves by the thousands or hundreds, musicians, singers, actors, dogs, horses, large residences with earthen mountains inside, cave gates, high verandas and pavillions, double passage-ways," etc. (98: 7b). To keep up such extravagent establishments, large estates were essential. Wang Mang did not interfere with the feudal estates of his nobles, he merely required them to distribute their excess private fields among their relatives or neighbors. It would not have been difficult for some nobles to find members of their clans to take these excess cultivated fields, manage them, and remit part or most of the proceeds to the original owner. There was, however, the danger that these new owners would cease paying rents to the original owner. Those nobles who could not or would not use such subterfuges and who did not have adequate official salaries would be compelled to retire from the court to their feudal estates. That meant, however, leaving civilization to live in the "sticks," the abandonment of one's social life and of the source of political perquisites. Exclusion from the capital was a penalty considered more severe than dismissal from office; it was visited upon officials who had become obnoxious to the court. Wang Mang had suffered three years of such exile and knew its bitterness; his intimates and the members of his clan probably reminded him of the suffering he was preparing for them and of the ease with which certain nobles were circumventing his enactment. So much pressure was brought upon him (in all probability, practically the whole court, except the conscientious Confucians, were unanimous in this matter) that he had to rescind his enactment. In the end, this reform of land tenure amounted to nothing. We can only speculate concerning Wang Mang's motive in attempting to alter land tenure. He might have been moved by compassion for the miserable condition of the peasant farmers, but in my opinion, any such attitude on his part is doubtful. He did not commonly indulge in compassion; 526WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS his great increases in taxation would seem to preclude any real concern for the poor. His concern was rather to carry out Confucian policies. The ching system was one of the outstanding Confucian economic policies; if he had not attempted to put into practise a policy recommended by Mencius, Tung Chung-shu, and other outstanding Confucians, he would have appeared lukewarm, so that one important source of his unusual popularity would have been gravely undermined. Statecraft and ambition, not compassion, were his driving ambitions. *â*â* The third group of economic measures enacted by Wang Mang were the six monopolies (established A.D. 10; 99 B: 12b; C: 1b) and increased taxes. Government monopolies were by no means new in China. More than half a millennium earlier, in the first half of the seventh century B.C., Duke Huan of Ch'i is said to have made himself powerful through a government monopoly in the manufacture of salt and iron. (Maspero rejects this tradition; Karlgren defends it.) The Ch'in dynasty, which first unified China under a single government, continued these two monopolies (24 A: 16b). Emperor Wen (180-157 B.C.) had allowed the common people to evaporate salt, smelt iron, and coin money (Discourse on Salt and Iron, Gale, p. 28), but Emperor Wu had withdrawn these privileges. Tung Chung-shu had protested against these monopolies without avail (24 A: 17a). In the famous discussion of 81 B.C. (reported in the Discourses on Salt and Iron), when the economic policies of the government were reviewed, the Confucian literati likewise protested against these monopolies (HS 7: 5a). In 44 B.C., Emperor YÃ¼an, who was attempting to be a good Confucian, abolished these monopolies, but the loss of revenue compelled him to reestablish them three years later (41 B.C.; HS 9: 6b, 9a). Confucianism in general opposed government monopolies, so that these measures can hardly be said to have been Confucian. Wang Mang, however, found references in Confucian literature to something called controls or kuan, or , so he changed the name of these monopolies to "controls," and continued them as Confucian enactments. He needed money too much to dispense with them. A third monopoly was that in fermented liquors. Originally established by Emperor Wu in 98 B.C., it had been abolished in 81 B.C., because of popular criticism. The people were then permitted to brew liquors upon payment of a tax. A high official of Wang Mang produced texts from which one could infer that a government monopoly of liquor was an ancient institution approved by Confucius; he pointed out to Wang Mang that a 70% profit could be made in brewing and selling liquor (24 B: 25a, b). Wang Mang therefore included it as one of his 527MONOPOLIES AND TAXES "controls," and established it as another government business. A fourth monopoly was that of coinage, which probably included the mining and smelting of copper. In this enterprise, Wang Mang was continuing a long-standing Chinese practise. In 175 B.C., Emperor Wen had indeed allowed free coinage (4: 12b), but the consequent depreciation of the currency had caused his son, Emperor Ching, to rescind this privilege in 144 B.C. and to establish a death sentence for counterfeiting (5: 7b). The fifth monopoly was concerned with the products of the mountains and marshes; these included forestry, fishing, hunting, and the taking of other wild products, such as wild honey, etc. Such occupations had been the resource of the poor in ordinary times and of all in time of famine. (The mining of copper and or iron were probably included in the monopolies of coinage [which was of bronze] and of iron, respectively.) For these monopolies too, Wang Mang could cite classical texts. The Chou Offices mentions a Forester of the Mountains , whose duty it was to enforce the prohibitions concerning these regions, keeping people out of the forests at improper times. He had a subordinate who collected the revenue from the forests. Thus it is implied that there had been a tax upon those who cut trees. This book also lists a Forester of the Marshes , who had the local people go into the marshes and waters at the proper times to take the articles of those places, delivering the proper amount to the imperial treasury (as a tax) and keeping the rest for themselves (Chou-li 16: 6b-8b; Biot, I, 370-375). Li-ki III, iii, 11 (Legge, I, 227; Couvreur, I, 293) says, "Anciently, [people] went into the forests at the foot of the mountains and the waters of the marshes at the [proper] seasons without being prohibited," in which statement the qualification "at the proper seasons" implies that there were prohibitions against cutting trees at certain seasons of the year (Chou-li 16: 7a [Biot, I, 372] specifies spring and autumn), and so implies a government supervision of these regions with an impost upon those working there, to support that supervision. Elsewhere, the Li-chi (IV, i, iii, 12; iv, ii, 21; Legge, I, 265, 301; Couvreur, I, 350, 396) mentions a Forester of the Wastes and a Forester of the Waters , whose duties were to prevent the cutting of trees at certain times and to collect the revenues from rivers, springs, ponds, and meres. Thus there was ample classical precedent for a taxation of forests and marshes. Wang Mang merely broadened these precedents into a government monopoly and made it cover all forests and marsh products. The Ch'in dynasty had actually made the rivers, marshes, mountains, and forests a government monopoly (24 A: 16b). In Han times, the 528WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS revenue from the mountains, streams, parks, ponds, market-places, and shops had been reserved for those overlords who were enfeoffed as their private estates with the regions containing these places, such as kings, marquises, baronets, and princesses. From regions not given in fief, this revenue was reserved for the imperial private purse, in charge of the Privy Treasurer, and was not put into the imperial public treasury, in charge of the Grand Minister of Agriculture (HS 24 A: 9b = Mh III, 541 f). The Privy Treasurer could hardly supervise these regions throughout the empire, hence it is probable that, except for certain areas near the capital, especially Kuan-chung, which he could conveniently supervise, the mountains and waters in most of China had been actually free to the people. Hunting had been prohibited in the imperial parks, which were hunted and fished by government agents; it may not have been restricted elsewhere, especially outside Kuan-chung. Wang Mang seems then to have extended systematically throughout the whole country the Ch'in and Han practise of taxing mountains and waters, and to have made all the occupations related to forests and marshes government monopolies, permitted only to those who paid certain fees. (Possibly only certain of such occupations had previously been taxed.) In A.D. 22, in a time of famine, the mountains and marshes were freely opened to the people (99 C: 17b), possibly because they could not be kept from utilizing these resources. Detailed laws were made for each of these monopolies; the penalties for violation were as severe as death (99 C: 1b), in which latter respect too, Wang Mang was following classical precedentâChou-li 16: 7b mentions execution in this connection (Biot, I, 374 softens this word to "chÃ¢timents"). These monopolies were opposed. When the Communicator (the state treasurer), Feng Ch'ang, remonstrated against them, Wang Mang became extremely incensed and summarily dismissed him from office (99 C: 2a). There had been successive years of drought, and there was much banditry. In A.D. 18, a new governor, Fei Hsing, was appointed for a province in the Yangtze valley. When asked what would be his plans upon reaching his province, he replied that these people made much of fishing; the monopolies and taxes on the mountains and marshes had taken away peoples' profits, so that they were starving; he would summon back to farm land those who had taken to banditry and would exempt them from taxes, loan them seed and food, and thus bring peace to the region. Wang Mang was incensed at the covert criticism of his monopolies and dismissed Fei Hsing (99 C: 2b, 3a). The economic effect of these five monopolies was chiefly to raise and stabilize the price of certain necessities. This objection had been made 529MONOPOLIES AND TAXES to monopolies by the Confucians in the famous debate of 81 B.C. They said that the price of salt had become so high that people had to forego it, and that the iron implements made by the government manufactories were inferior and unsuitable. Similar objections were made to the liquor monopoly. The effect of these three monopolies, together with coinage, was, indeed, to put into the hands of the government the most profitable manufacturing enterprises of the time. Only the monopoly in liquors was new in the time of Wang Mang. Its effect was to take away the livelihood of those merchants who had engaged in brewing and liquor dealing, except for those who now became government agents. It probably also raised the price of liquor to the common people. There was no thought of restricting its use. The abuse of alcoholic liquors has rarely become an important problem in China. The effect of the fifth monopoly, that on the mountains and marshes, was to deprive of their livelihood the country's poor, who had engaged in hunting and fishing, or to compel them to pay for the privilege of continuing their occupations. These monopolies constituted an additional tax upon the poor. As a whole, these monopolies were thus means of obtaining additional revenue for the government. I can find no other purpose in them. They were a burden upon the poor and common people, since they were a tax upon necessities. They could be counted on to bring in revenue, and were in no sense revolutionary. This policy of mulcting the people for the benefit of the government also showed itself in Wang Mang's new taxes. A special tax upon merchants and artisans had previously been attempted by Emperor Wu (119 B.C.), compelling them to testify to the total amount of their property and to pay a tax of 9Â½% and 4Â¾% respectively, upon their capital (HFHD, II, 65, n. 15.13; 24 B: 13a, b). This tax had, however, soon been abolished (24 B: 20a). In A.D. 9, Wang Mang imposed an income tax upon all hunters, fishermen, sericulturalists, artisans, and professional men. They were each to testify to their income for the year, and pay a tithe of it as a tax. Those who refused to testify to their income or who testified falsely were to be sentenced to a year at penal servitude (24 B: 24b). At the same time, it was ordered that all uncultivated fields, whether inside or outside the city, should pay three times the usual land tax. This latter provision was taken from the classical Chou-li (13: 9a; Biot, I, 279f; HS 24 B: 24a &amp; n. 24.3). Wang Mang moreover attempted to systematize the previous practise, begun by Emperor HsÃ¼an (8: 6b &amp; n. 6.4), that official salaries were reduced in time of flood or drought. He enacted 530WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS that salaries were to be reduced proportionately each year, according to the state of the harvest in each part of the empire (99 B: 29a, b). This system proved cumbersome, for officials hence did not know what their salary was to be until the year was almost over. They therefore made various collections and exactions (24 B: 27a). When they were suspected of having accumulated much property, in A.D. 18, Wang Mang ordered that all but the lowest officials should be required to deliver up four-fifths of their wealth, for the use of the army at the borders. Pan Ku states that inquisitors galloped all over the empire, persuading slaves and subordinates to inform on their masters or superiors (99 C: 3a). We can imagine the limitless opportunities for blackmail and bribery, the repaying of old scores by inquisitors and informers. In the same year, when a serious attempt was made to put down the bandits and rebels, a levy was made, consisting of 1/30 of all property. This levy was immediately repeated, because property had not been assessed at its full value (99 C: 4b, 5b). All officials were also required to make additional contributions out of their salaries, for the rearing of horses (99 C: 4b). It is not surprising that when serious rebellion finally arose against Wang Mang, the bureaucracy did little to stop it. Wang Mang's fiscal policy seems to have been one of exploiting all the sources of revenue he could find, regardless of the effect his measures had upon the empire. While some of them mulcted the rich, other measures burdened the poor. It is but natural that the enthusiasm for him, which was so abundantly evident before he took the throne, should have evaporated rapidly once he attained unchecked rule. He incurred large and unusual expenses, which were aggravated by the corruption of his officials. His fiscal measures show a remarkable lack of tact and a phenomenal disregard of their effect upon the empire. *â*â* The most interesting of Wang Mang's economic experiments was the sixth control, which he called the "Five Equalizations," by which fluctuations of prices in staple goods were to be prevented and loans were to be made by the government. These measures, too, had had their predecessors. Four centuries earlier, Li K'uei, a student of Confucius' personal disciple, Tzu-hsia, became Chancellor to Marquis Wen of Weih (reigned 424-387 B.C.) and attempted to equalize the price of grain. In good years, the state of Wei4 purchased grain in large or small amounts according to the state of the crop, while in poor years, it sold grain, thus attempting to prevent fluctuations in its price (HS 24 A: 7b-8b). Unfortunately, we are given no information concerning the success of this policy of 531SPECULATION AND MONEY-LENDING speculating in grain, except that it is said to have made "the state of Weih wealthy and powerful." This policy was again tried in 54 B.C., when Keng Shou-ch'ang, the Palace Assistant Grand Minister of Agriculture under Emperor HsÃ¼an, built Constantly Equalizing Granaries in the border commanderies. These granaries purchased grain when its price was low and sold it when the price was high (24 A: 19b). Granaries were not built at the imperial capital, probably because irrigation had eliminated bad seasons in that region. These Constantly Equalizing Granaries seem to have become sources of expense rather than of benefit to the people; they were abolished by Emperor YÃ¼an in 44 B.C., ten years after being built, in a fit of imperial economy, when other expensive government projects were also abolished, such as the imperial ateliers for silk and metal manufacture and the government monopolies of salt and iron (9: 6a, b; 24 A: 20a). When moreover, in 115 B.C., Emperor Wu needed money, Sang Hung-yang, an official who had come from a mercantile family, suggested speculation in goods. Prices differed widely in different parts of the empire; Sang Hung-yang had the government purchase goods where they were cheap and transport them to places where they were dear, thus making a profit (24 B: 19b). Since the government had built roads and set up a system of posts, and since criminals sentenced to penal servitude could be used to supply the necessary labor, the government had an advantage over private traders and could make great profits in this manner. The system also prevented undue fluctuations in prices; when prices rose in one region, goods were brought in from other places. We are not told that this system was abolished. It was complained of in 81 B.C., but not abolished; probably the increasing freedom of intercourse led to an approximate equalization of prices in different regions, so that this method of equalization became unprofitable and gradually ceased to function. At least we hear nothing of it after the reign of Emperor Chao. Wang Mang directed the Masters in Charge of the Five Equalizations to neglect prices at other markets (24 B: 24b), so that in his time the government had plainly ceased to transport goods. Liu Hsin1a, who brought the Chou Offices to people's attention and induced Wang Mang to make it an officially recognized classic, pointed out to Wang Mang that the Chou dynasty, according to this classic, had a government Office for Money (24 B: 23b). This book recounts that in the Chou period there was an office for the collection of goods unsold in the market-place of the capital and for their storage until people wished to buy them. There was also an office which lent money without interest for a period of three months to people who needed it for ancestral sacrifices 532WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS or mourning ceremonies, after which time, they paid 10% interest per year (Chou-li 15: 3b f; Biot, I, 326-328; HS 24 B: n. 23.6, 23.8). The Yo-yÃ¼ (now lost), which was a commentary on the Classic of Music, told of an institution called the Five Equalizations, by which prices were stabilized, probably for the five fundamental commodities (HS 24 B: 23b &amp; n. 23.9). It is impossible to tell whether these measures had ever been actually put into practise; they were very likely the inventions of Confucians who were idealizing the past. When Wang Mang came to the throne in A.D. 9, he accordingly established offices for lending and for the Five Equalizations. At the imperial capital and at five other large cities in the empire, Lo-yang, Han-tan, Lin-tzu, YÃ¼an, and Ch'eng-tu, there were set up Masters in Charge of the Five Equalizations at the Markets, each with five Assistants for Exchange and one Assistant for the Office for Money. Storehouses were built at these places. In the middle of each quarter, the Master at each market was to determine a price for equalization for each of three grades of goods (high, middle, and low). These prices were to apply to the five kinds of grains (hemp and similar seeds, glutinous millet, panicled millet, wheat, and beans), linen cloth and silk cloth, thread, and wadding. When any of these goods remained unsold in the market (as they were brought in by farmers), the office for equalization was to buy them at cost or at the market price (provided that price was lower than the price for equalization), so that the people would lose nothing by being compelled to receive a lower price in the market. When the price rose above the price for equalization by one cash, the office for equalization was to sell its goods at the price for equalization. Fluctuations of prices in the market were thus to be prevented, merchants were not to be allowed to corner goods or fleece the country people, and the farmers were to be assured of a market for their goods. People who needed money for sacrifices or for mourning ceremonies were to have what they needed lent them, from the payments of the income-tax, without interest for ten days or three months, respectively. Others who needed money for working capital were to be given loans, paying interest at 3% per month. It was an interesting and idealistic experiment. Hu Shih says that Wang Mang's exposition of his monopolies and of the Five Equalizations was "the earliest conscious statement of the theory of state socialism in the history of the social and political thought of mankind" (JNChRAS, 59 [1928]: 229). How far that statement is true may be gaged from the information here given. The credit for this experiment should not however be given to Wang Mang, but to the Confucian author of the passage 533SPECULATION AND MONEY-LENDING in the Chou Offices dealing with these matters, and in some degree to Liu Hsin1a. Rich merchants were selected to operate these offices. Few others would be capable of controlling, without great loss, offices essentially intended for speculating in goods and lending money. Pan Ku says that these merchants communicated their wickedness to various places in the empire and made many false accountings; that the offices and storehouses for goods were not filled (24 B: 25b). If they had been well stocked with goods, their very presence would have kept prices down, without actually purchasing any more goods, until a scarcity arose. Since however these storehouses were not filled, and since they utterly failed to prevent the rise of prices in time of famine (99 C: 16a), this attempt to control prices probably achieved very little, except for providing certain sinecure positions in the bureaucracy. It is not difficult to discover the reason that this attempt to speculate in goods had only slight economic effects. If the price for equalization was set too high, the storehouses would be filled with goods unsalable at the current price. Hence the Masters, to protect their offices from losing money, probably set their prices for equalization low, with the result that they refused to take goods from the common people, because the current price was too high. Then farmers would not bring their goods to the storehouses except under stress of necessity. We are told that the storehouses remained empty. When a scarcity was impending, the grain remaining in these storehouses was probably sold rapidly, before famine actually arrived, for goods had to be sold at the price for equalization plus one cash. In times of abundant harvest, because the prices for equalization were set every quarter, these prices decreased before the harvest was reaped, since grain was expected to become plentiful. Thus the farmers were not helped, unless there was a sudden and unexpected fall in prices, such as that caused by a glut on the market. Such gluts were perhaps the only economic situations in which farmers were regularly benefited. The Masters knew that Wang Mang needed money, and they undoubtedly looked upon the storehouses as means of making profits, just as with the other monopolies. They did not accordingly dare to risk a loss. The Masters were former merchants, who hence took the same attitude to the farmers that the merchants did. It is therefore only natural that the farmers should not have been greatly benefited. The loans made to needy persons were to be taken out of the payments for income-taxes made by professional men. We are not told how much money was loaned. The rate of interest, 3% per month, was however 534WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS much higher than the usual commercial rate, which was 20% per year (91: 6a), so that few loans were probably made, except for short terms, for which periods the commercial rate was probably also high. There was furthermore a provision that the borrower was not to pay more than 10% of his net income as interest, so that the Masters probably refused to make large loans. These storehouses and lending agencies benefited few except their managers. Their purpose was undoubtedly goodâthat of preventing exploitation of the farmers by the merchants. In view of the fact that the Chinese state had been carrying on at least two businesses (the manufacture and sale of salt and iron) for several centuries, Wang Mang's measures can hardly be called state socialism or revolutionary. The Five Equalizations was merely another measure to benefit the people, advocated by the Confucians with the same motive as the ching system and other economic plans. This motive on the part of the Confucians who first invented these proposals does not however mean that Wang Mang had any strong urge to benefit the people. His chief purpose was undoubtedly to follow Confucian traditionâthe practise by which he first secured his popularity and as a result of which he was able to ascend the throne. He was morally obligated to put Confucian policies into practise. Had he really been deeply concerned for the people, he would have removed the monopolies on salt and iron, which pressed most severely upon them. But he showed no inclination to do so; on the contrary, he dismissed any official who manifested an inclination even to relax these monopolies. *â*â* Wang Mang was in no sense a revolutionist. He was merely a clever intriguer, who found a new way of gaining popular approval and who clung to it tenaciously. He achieved the throne by playing upon the Confucian attitude of the educated class and becoming a whole-hearted Confucian. Confucianism is an idealistic philosophy that sought to benefit the whole people, and the Confucian literati were in close touch with the common people of their own clans, so that they largely reflected the attitude of the common people to the government. When Wang Mang actually came to the throne, he proceeded to enact various Confucian proposals, but his decrees were not based upon a clear knowledge of the people or of their needs. He had passed his life as a member of the governing clan, which gained wealth and position merely because it was related to the reigning Emperor. He made his way to leadership by intrigue and secured popularity by espousing the popular Confucian religion of the educated class. 535THEIR NET EFFECT When chance made him the dictator of the government and regent for an infant, people found no difficulty in interpreting Confucian teachings so that they were thought to require his enthronement. He then had to put into practise the economic policies embodied in the Confucian tradition, including the particular Confucian books he had newly accepted as authoritative. His economic policies proceeded from the Confucian tradition, not from any need of the people. His forced colonization of Kokonor (99 A: 24b) and his increased taxation demonstrate his utter callousness to the real needs of the people. His changes in the coinage were a means of mulcting the merchants and moneyed class. His nationalization of land, the establishment of the ching system, the restrictions on large holdings of land and on slaves proved onerous even to his own relatives and followers. These measures were therefore quickly rescinded, even though they were in accord with Confucian tradition and would have proved helpful to the common people. The first four monopolies were plainly means of seizing for the government the most profitable private enterprises, a procedure that had long been a government policy. It was especially oppressive under Wang Mang, because he added to the number of enterprises taken over by the government and to the severity of the punishments for offending against these monopolies. They put added burdens upon the poorer people, virtually taxing necessities. The fifth monopoly was clearly directed against the poorer people and was in effect a direct tax on certain occupations. The Five Equalizations, an attempt to stabilize prices and make loans to those who needed them, was inexpertly planned and failed to achieve anything of note. Thus Wang Mang's economic policies were either futile or oppressive in their operation. He seems to have oppressed all the economic classes in the empire. When, in the winter of A.D. 22, the whole empire was in rebellion and Wang Mang at last realized the extremity of the situation, it was decided to rescind all the imperial edicts and ordinances that had been made since he had ascended the throne, especially the economic reforms we have been discussing. Messengers were prepared to be sent out (99 C: 19b). Such an act would have meant a drastic loss of face. The imperial forces, however, achieved a preliminary minor success, and the messengers were not actually dispatched. Such a drastic proposal is evidence that Wang Mang was at last driven to recognize the unpopularity of his economic reforms. Thereafter events happened too rapidly. The rebels continued to gain, and by October of the next year, the capital had been captured and Wang Mang killed by the people of the capital itself. Thus 536WANG MANG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS his phenomenal popularity changed within fifteen years into the most bitter hatred. His economic measures must bear much of the blame for that reversal of public opinion.12 12 An account of Wang Mang's policies is also to be found in Hans O. Stange, Leben, PersÃ¶nlichkeit und Werk Wang Mang's, Inaugural-Dissertation zur Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤ts zur Berlin, 1934, which is not always quite carefully done. Cf. also Dr. Stange's Die Monographie Ã¼ber Wang Mang, kritisch bearbeitet, Ã¼bersetzt, und , Leipzig, 1939. O. Franke, Geschichte des Chinesischen Reiches, I, 375, likens Wang Mang to Richard the Third in Shakespeare; his economic reforms are described on pp. 379-383. O. Franke, "Staatssozialistische Versuche im alten und mittelalterlichen China," SPAW (1931), Phil.-hist. Kl., 218-242, touches upon Wang Mang in passing. An excellent summary of economic matters during the Han period is to be found in W. Eberhard, "Zur Landwirtschaft der Han-Zeit," MSOS, 35 (1932): 74-105; K. A. Wittfogel, "Foundations and Stages of Chinese Economic History," Zeit. f. Sozialforchung, vol. 4 (1935), pp. 26-60.

Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) glosses, "The kang-mao [amulets] are made in the first month, on a mao day, and are worn at the waist. They are three inches1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien's text reads ; the Ching-yu and the Official ed. read . long, one inch wide, and foursquare [in cross-section].

Yen Shih-ku (581-645) adds, "Today frequently in the soil there are obtained jade kang-mao [amulets]. According to my opinion, as regards their size and their inscriptions, the explanation of Fu [Ch'ien] is correct." Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) however glosses, "The kang-mao [amulets] are one inch long, five fen broad, and four-square [in cross-section]. In the center, there is a hole made lengthwise, in order that it may be threaded3 3 The text reads ; the Official ed. has emended it to .

HHS, Tr. 30: 13a, b (by Szu-ma Piao, ca. 240-306) says, "The girdle ornaments are a pair of seals7 7 These amulets were probably called seals because they were worn at the waist just as seals were. one inch two fen long and six fen square.

But it is better to read without emending or changing. Shen Ch'in-han, in his HS Su-cheng 36: 9b, quotes the Han-shih Wai-chuan 10: 8b (ed.

"Ku-ching-chieh Hui-han") and thinks that ling -shu denotes the tao -shu, the peach-wood baton, which was a popular apotropaic implement. , Shuo-wen 3 B: 6b defines hai as follows: "The hai-szu is a large kang-mao [amulet]. It is used to expel influences and demons." (From Shen Ch'in-han.) Chi-chiu-p'ien 41b, a word-list written by Shih Yu during 48-33 B.C., contains the following line: "The Shih-ch'i [lit., "the shooter of infantlike demons"] and the Pi-hsieh [lit., "the expeller of perversities"] eliminate the many banefulnesses ," and Yen Shih-ku explains, "Shih-ch'i and Pi-hsieh are both the names of supernatural animals. The ch'i is a demon [in the shape of] a small infant. Shih-ch'i means that it is able to hit and drive away infant-like demons. Pi-hsieh means that it is able to expel and ward off monstrosities and perversities. [These terms] refer to [articles made of] precious jade and the like. The forms of [these] two animals were used to hang on [peoples'] girdles to drive away baneful calamities and to protect their persons. "It is also said that shih-ch'i refers to the large kang-mao [amulets]. Gold, jade, and peach-wood were carved to make them. Another name for them is hai-szu. On top of them there was an inscription and on their sides a hole was pierced, which was threaded with many-colored silk. They were used to attach to the forearm and were also a means of expelling influences and animal-shaped demons." (Yen Shih-ku's error about the location of the inscription and hole on these amulets indicates that he had never seen them; he is merely summing up the literary tradition about them.) Hui Tung (1697-1758) confirms Fu Ch'ien's implication that the day mao was evil, by quoting Tso-chuan, Dk. Chao, IX (Legge, p. 626), "If the day is tzu or mao, it is called an evil day." Motze, ch. 31 (Mei, p. 170) however mentions the day ting-mao as a propitious day for sacrifices. The difference was that there were both kang (severe)-mao and jou gentle)-mao days, and the day ting-mao belonged to the latter group. T'ao Tsung-yi (fl. 1360), in his Cho-keng-lu 24: 5a-7b, discusses these kang-mao amulets and states that they were called , great firmness." Hence the word kang may refer to the hardness of the material used for them, this hardness implying their strong power to ward off disease. The Kang found in the inscription on them says that they ward off kang (severe) diseases. Kang also has a third meaning. Li-chi 3: 8b (Legge, I, 94; Couvreur, 60) says, "For external matters, a kang (odd) day should be used, and 540THE KANG-MAO AMULETS for internal affairs a jou (even) day should be used." K'ung Ying-ta explains, "Kang [refers to] the odd (chi ) days. In ten days there are five odd and five even (ou ). The five odd [days] chia, ping, mou, keng, and jen are kang (strong). External affairs [need] strong (kang) purposes, hence kang days are used. . . . The five even [days], yi, ting, chi, hsin, and kuei are jou (gentle)." Kang and jou are also used in the Book of Changes to refer to the undivided and divided lines of the hexagrams. Thus the term kang-mao has a number of meanings upon which diviners undoubtedly rang the changes. Kang refers to the strength of the amulet, the hardness of its material, the severity of the disasters it warded off, as well as the odd days in the decenary cycle of stems and certain lines of the hexagrams. In Han times, the word mao had a special significance. The character liu , which was the surname of the imperial clan, is made up of the three characters mao, chin (metal), and knife (tao), as Wang Mang notes (cf. 99 B: 7a &amp; n. 7.2). Hence mao denoted the Han imperial house. The continuance of this interpretation is to be found in the biography of Liu Fang , who in A.D. 586 was executed for conspiracy against the newly enthroned Emperor Wu, the founder of the Sui dynasty. Liu Fang is declared to have said, "My surname is mao, metal, and knife, and my given name is `one, ten-thousand, and days ,' so that the Liu clan will infallibly rule as kings and be the sons of Heaven [emperors] for ten thousand days." (Pei-shih 74: 3b; Sui-shu 38: 4a). It is then not surprising that Wang Mang and the Wei dynasty did away with these kang-mao amulets and that the Han emperors wore them. Wu Ta-cheng (1844-1902), in his Ku-yÃ¼ T'u K'ao, pp. 130 &amp; 132, presents drawings with a discussion of four jade kang-mao amulets from Han times. He remarks that their construction and inscriptions are very similar and that many of the words are written in a cursive manner or with borrowed characters. The inscription on them all is as follows: "[When] the yu-month kang-mao [amulet] is in the center [an unreadable word, possibly "it influences"] the four quarters. Red, blue, white, yellow, these four colors are my defense. The Lord commanded to hold and complete it. Of the many epidemics and severe sicknesses, (three characters unreadable) mao, none will presume to touch me." , . Wu Ta-cheng asserts he has seen no kang-mao amulets of the dimensions Fu Ch'ien speaks of, and states that his amulets are of the size described by Chin Shao. Possibly Fu Ch'ien's amulets were what the Shuo-wen calls "large kang-mao [amulets]." These kang-mao amulets were part of the regular Han court costume 541THEIR APOTROPAIC USE during the Wang Mang and Later Han periods at least, and were worn in the center of the girdle ornaments. They were worn by all grades of officials, even students in private schools. Their function was frankly that of being amulets intended to ward off disease demons. Even the emperor and his highest officials wore them, which circumstance illustrates vividly the prevalence of superstition among the most educated persons of the age. We do not know when they first became popular. Wei Hung (fl. ca. 25), in his Han-chiu-yi A: 1b, declares, "In the Ch'in and earlier [periods], the common people all wore seal-cords on their girdles, with seals, an inch square, made of gold, jade, silver, bronze, rhinoceros [-horn], or ivory, each one wearing what he liked." While the passage concerns itself with actual seals, yet these amulets were also called seals, so that they may date back to Chou times. They seem to have gone out of fashion some time after the Later Han and before the T'ang period, for Yen Shih-ku had not seen them and they are not mentioned in the Sung books on rites, such as Nieh Ch'ung-yi's San-li-t'u (presented 962) and Ch'en Hsiang-tao's (1053-1093) Li-shu. Yen Shih-ku states that there were kang-mao amulets made of peach-wood. The peach is indigenous to China, so that it was naturally used for apotropaic purposes. The Tso-chuan (Dk. Hsiang, yr. XXIX; Legge, pp. 5442, 547b) recounts that when, in 544 B.C., Duke Hsiang of Lu was required to go in person to present shrouds to the deceased King K'ang of Ch'u, he first had shamans asperse the corpse with peach-wood and broom-straw in order to drive away the dead king's ghost and other evil spirits, so that no harm should come to the Duke. This book also (Dk. Chao, yr. IV; Legge, pp. 5923, 596a) states that when stored ice was brought out of the ice-house, a bow of peach-wood and thorn arrows were used to drive away evil influences. It likewise (Dk. Chao, XII; Legge, 63718, 641a) reports that when the first ancestor of the Ch'u line, Hsiung-yi, who was supposed to have lived at the time of King Ch'eng of the Chou dynasty, waited upon that King, he bore a peach-wood bow and thorn arrows. Tu YÃ¼ (222-284) states that these implements were for apotropaic purposes (Tso-chuan Cheng-yi 45: 19a). Chou-li 32: 8b (Biot, II, 248) states: "[The royal companion of the right in the war-chariot (jung-yu)] assists [at the making of a solemn oath by holding] the ox's ear, [which is cut off to secure blood for making the oath, and he assists by using] peach-wood and broom-straw [to asperse this blood and drive away any harmful influences]." Since peach-wood thus came to have the meaning of driving away harm, sword-makers were entitled "the Peach-wood Clan (t'ao-shih)" in the K'ao-kung-chi, which was appended 542THE KANG-MAO AMULETS to the Chou-li (Biot, II, 491, 496). In Han-shih Wai-chuan 10: 11b (by Han Ying, fl. 179-141 B.C.), Duke Huan of Ch'i (685-643 B.C.) is represented as having met, while on a trip, an old man on foot, carrying a peach-wood baton (t'ao-shu). When the Duke asked him about it, he replied, "This is named a double [strength] peach-wood [implement]. The way peach-wood acts is called `to destroy.' . . . The warning to plebeians [against destructive conduct] lies in peach-wood batons." The story continues, "By the first month of the next year, the plebeians [at the Duke's court] all wore [these peach-wood batons]." Shen Ch'in-han, in his HS Su-cheng 36: 9b, 10a (my attention was called to this passage by P. van der Loon), quotes this passage and concludes, "In my opinion, this was the origin of wearing kang-mao [amulets]." It appears to me, however, to have been more probably a rationalization, written in Han times, for a practise common then. Wang Su's (195-256) Sang-fu Yao-chi (this book is lost and the passage is quoted from T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan 967: 3b by the Han-Wei Yi-shu Ts'ao, 2b) said, "When Duke Ai of Lu (494-468 B.C.) was sacrificing preparatory to the funeral of his father, . . . Confucius asked [Duke Ai], `Would it not be better to use triply [extracted] peach-wood water?' [The Duke] replied, `No. [The use of] peach-wood [water] arose when Duke Ling of Weis [534-493 B.C.] had a daughter who was married to [the prince of] Ch'u. Her nurse was accompanying her to her husband's household, when she was a newly [wedded] wife, and on the way she heard that her husband had died. The nurse wanted to have the new wife return [home. But] the new wife replied, "A woman has the three obediences. Now I belong to this man. He has died and I must complete the mourning." Thereupon she had a plain chariot yoked with white horses and proceded to her husband's house. She made some triply [extracted] peach-wood water and used it to wash the hair of the deceased. She went out of the eastern gate at the northern corner [of the eastern wall of the city] and completed the ceremony with three bows, in order to make the deceased not hate her. My father has nothing to hate. What would be the use of triply [extracted] peach-wood water?' " Here is given a classical sanction for apotropaic implements and ceremonies put into the mouth of the greatest of sages. It is also a mere rationalization of a later practise. Evidence that kang-mao amulets were placed upon doors (as are the present door-gods) in Han times is furnished by HHS, Tr. 5: 4b-5a: "In the central month of summer [the fifth month], all things are then flourishing and the sun comes to its summer maximum [northward 543THEIR ORIGIN AND END journey]. The yin emanations [thereupon] begin to work, so that it is to be feared that things will not [continue to] grow. The [proper] rites for this [situation] are to employ scarlet cordage plants joining strong smelling vegetables, to exorcise injurious insects, rodents (?), black magic (ku), and noises (?), and to use peach-wood seals, six inches long and three inches square, vari-colored, on which are written characters according to the regular procedure, and display them on gates and doors. "The [various] dynasties used as ornaments [articles] they esteemed according to [the elementary powers by which they ruled]. The clan of the Hsia sovereigns [had as their elementary power] metal. Their roads were made of the stalks of rushes, meaning that essences should mingle [and the people be fruitful]. The Yin people had water as their [elementary] virtue. They used snail shells, stressing cautiousness, that their closing up [against evil emanations] should be like that by snails. The Chou people had wood as their [elementary] virtue. They used peach-wood for apotropaic purposes, meaning that emanations should be blocked [from operating] upon them. In Han [times] all were used. Hence on the fifth day of the fifth month, scarlet cordage plants and varicolored seal-[shaped blocks of peach-wood] were used as ornaments for gates and doors in order to present obstacles and block evil emanations." Huang Shan (fl. 1915) quotes the Shih-wu Chi-yÃ¼an (by Kao Ch'eng, fl. 1078-1085, book later greatly added to) as recording, "In the Han [period, people] used scarlet cordage plants joining vari-colored kang-mao [amulets] as decorations for their gates and doors." According to the passage from HHS, Tr. 30 translated above, the kang-mao amulets worn at people's waists were also called "seals," so that these large "seals" on doors were likewise kang-mao amulets. Liu Chao (fl. dur. 502-520) glosses HHS, Tr. 5: 5a as follows: "The peach-wood seals were originally a Han institution and a means of reinforcing [the power of] the mao-metal-[knife clan, i.e., the Han dynasty]. The Wei [dynasty] did away with them." Perhaps Liu Chao's statement is as far as we can go concerning the origin of these amulets. 544 APPENDIX IV ECLIPSES DURING THE RULE OF WANG MANG i. In ChÃ¼-shÃª I, x (the tenth month), on the day ping-ch'en, the first day of the month, an eclipse of the sun is recorded (99 A: 29b; Han-chi 30: 7b). Hoang equates this date with Nov. 10, A.D. 6, but there was no eclipse on that date. In the 12 years between the previous eclipse of A.D. 2 and the next correctly recorded eclipse in 14 A.D., there were 28 solar eclipses, of which three were visible in China.1 1 Besides those charted by Oppolzer, the following partial eclipses were located near the south pole: nos. 2889, 2890, 2899, 2900, 2909, and 2916. The following were calculated by Oppolzer's elements and shown plainly invisible in China: nos. 2891, 2898, 2901, 2908. The following umbral eclipses were also calculated by Oppolzer's elements and found invisible: nos. 2895, 2896, 2903, 2904, 2910, 2911, 2915. These three were all calculated by Neugebauer's tables, and the following results were reached: The eclipse of Apr. 8, 4 A.D. was invisible in Ch'ang-an, but at the present Peking it reached a magnitude of 0.15 at 4:06 p.m., local time. The eclipse of Sept. 11, A.D. 6 reached a magnitude of 0.95 at Ch'ang-an at 3:59 p.m., local time. Hoang and Chen Yuan (Comparative Daily Calender) both equate this date with ChÃ¼-shÃª I, vii, last day, ping-ch'en. Then is an error for and is an error for or, since these calenders might have been a day in error, the eclipse might well have happened on the first day of the eighth month, so that is an error for . The eclipse of June 30, 10, was invisible at Ch'ang-an and Peking, but at So-fang, the present Ning-hsia, it reached a magnitude of 0.46 at sunset. In view of the nearness in time and the magnitude of the eclipse, the eclipse of 6 A.D. is undoubtedly the one referred to in the text; it requires merely a slight emendation in the text, an error that may have been in Pan Ku's source. ii. On T'ien-feng I, iii, jen-shen, the last day, a second eclipse is recorded. (HS 99 B: 23a; Han-chi 30: 13b.) Hoang and Yuan both equate this date with Apr. 18, 14 A.D., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2917. It was merely partial; calculation according to Neugebauer's tables shows that at Ch'ang-an it reached a magnitude of 0.30 at 6: 19 a.m. local time. 545A CALCULATED ECLIPSE iii. On T'ien-feng III, vii, mou-tzu, the last day, a third eclipse of the sun is recorded (HS 99 B: 29b; Han-chi 30: 14b). Hoang and Yuan both equate this date with Aug. 21, 16 A.D., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2923. He charts the path of totality as passing through the present Canton and the Philippines. In the two years since the preceding recorded eclipse, 5 solar eclipses occurred, of which one was visible in China.2 2 Two were merely partial; #2919 was located near the south pole; the other, #2918 was calculated by Oppolzer's elements and found invisible as far south as China. This one occurred on Sept. 2, 15 A.D. Calculation shows that it was invisible in Ch'ang-an, but at the present Peiping it reached a magnitude of 0.07 at 9: 10 a.m., local time. In the 9 years from the time of this recorded eclipse to the first eclipse recorded by the HHS in the reign of Emperor Kuang-wu, which occurred on Feb. 6, 26 A.D., there were 24 solar eclipses, of which only one was visible in China.3 3 Eleven were merely partial; nos. 2926, 2929, 2935, 2936, 2945, 2946 were located near the south pole. Of the others, nos. 2927, 2928, 2930, 2932, 2934, 2937, 2939, 2944, 2947 were so far outside of China that a rough calculation by Oppolzer's elements was sufficient to determine them to be invisible in China. The remaining one, not charted, no. 2937, on Nov. 23, 21, was calculated by Neugebauer's tables and found to have been too far north to have been visible in China. The eclipse of Feb. 16, 25 was listed in the Ku-chin Chu (about 300 A.D.), according to a note to HHS, Tr. 18: 1a. (It is not in the present text of that book.) Oppolzer calculated his eclipse no. 2944 for that date, and both Hoang, Catalogue des eclipses, and Chu Wen-chin, Li-tai Jih-shih K'ao, list this eclipse among Chinese eclipses. Calculation by Neugebauer's tables shows that on the morning of Feb. 17 it was visible in Alaska. western United States and Canada, and the eastern Pacific Ocean. But it was invisible in China. It was merely partial. This eclipse could not have been observed, and must have been calculated by Chinese astronomers. The listing of this eclipse by Hoang and Chu shows how dangerous it is to assume an eclipse to have been observed, without calculating its circumstances, especially when it was merely partial. Of the umbral eclipses, those on June 10, 20 and Nov. 23, 21 seemed promising; they were also calculated by Neugebauer's tables, and both found invisible in China. The first one was located too far south, and the other too far north. This one occurred on Dec. 15, 19 A.D. Calculation by Neugebauer's elements shows that it was invisible in Ch'ang-an and north China, but at the present Canton it reached a magnitude of 0.03 at 7:47 a.m., local time, so that it was hardly visible in China. 546 APPENDIX V SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD The results derived from an examination of the eclipses reported in the HS are here summarized. During this period of 230 years (including the reign of Wang Mang) there occurred 559 solar eclipses, of which 98 or 17.5% were visible in some part of China. Fifteen of these were very small eclipses or were invisible in the capital, so that we should not expect Chinese astronomers to have noticed them. Of the remaining 83 solar eclipses, 55 or almost two-thirds seem to have been recorded by Chinese astronomers. In order to examine this unusually good record, I present here a list of the solar eclipses visible in China from 206 B.C. to A.D. 23, with my conclusions.1 1 The visibility of these eclipses has been computed by the method discussed in HFHD I: app. III. Both P. Hoang, Catalogue des Ã©clipses de soleil et de lune relatÃ©es dans les documents chinois et collationÃ©es avec le Canon de Th. Ritter v. Oppolzer, "VariÃ©tÃ©s sinologiques," no. 56, and Chu Wen-hsin, Li-tai Jih-shih K'ao are not altogether reliable, since they do not discuss these eclipses in detail and sometimes list an eclipse that was invisible in China as the one referred to by the Chinese historian. In dating these eclipses, capital roman letters refer to the year of a reign or year-period, small roman letters to the (lunar) month, and arabic numbers to the day of the month. European dates are given by the Julian system, as in Oppolzer, but years are B.C., not astronomical years. (Hoang uses the Gregorian calendar for dates B.C., but the Julian for the first millennium A.D.) In references, arabic figures followed by a colon denote chapters of the HS, app. denotes appendices of those chapters, and small roman numbers particular eclipses in those appendices. As sources for these eclipses recordings, there is (1) the SC, which contains very few of these recordings, so that its value is almost negligible. (2) The "Annals" and ch. 99 of the HS constitute a second source, giving only the dates of these eclipses. (3) HS ch. 27, "The Treatise on the Five Powers," near the end, contains a list of solar eclipses, which partly duplicates the information contained in the "Annals" and partly amplifies it by noting a few additional solar eclipses, giving the heavenly location of many eclipses, sometimes other information, and often presenting their astrological interpretation. This list ends with the reign of Emperor P'ing, so that the eclipses during A.D. 6 to 23 are only mentioned in ch. 99 of the HS. (4) The Han-chi seems to be an entirely secondary 547THE LIST OF ECLIPSES source, and has copied its dates from the HS Annals. Since however it was written in the second century A.D., it constitutes an early check upon the text of the HS, and very occasionally furnishes additional information. The information found in these four sources is discussed in the appendixes of the various chapters concerning eclipses, and need not be repeated here. SOLAR ECLIPSES VISIBLE IN CHINA, 206 B.C. to A.D. 23 206 B.C., July 6. Not noticed. 205, Jan. 1. Not noticed. 205, Dec. 20. Recorded correctly (HFHD, I, 165, i). 201, Oct. 8. Possibly recorded (ibid., ii); if so, as for all eclipses not noted as "recorded correctly," the Chinese date must be emended. 198, Aug. 7. Recorded correctly (HFHD, I, 166, iii). 197, July 26. Not noticed. 195, June 6. Not noticed. 194, May 26. Not noticed. 192, Sept. 29. Probably recorded (HFHD, I, 188, i). 188, July 17. Recorded as total (HFHD, II, 189, ii). A false solar eclipse is listed for July 26, 186 (HFHD, I, 211-12, i). 184, May 6. Hardly visible and seemingly not noticed (ibid.). 181, Mar. 4. Recorded correctly, total at the capital (HFHD, I, 212, ii). 178, Jan. 2. Recorded correctly (HFHD, I, 284, i). A small partial eclipse, only reaching a magnitude of 0.20 (totality = 1.00) at the capital. The SC notes a solar eclipse for Jan. 17, 178, which was actually the date of a lunar eclipse (ibid., ii). 178, Dec. 22. Recorded correctly (ibid., iii). 176, June, 6. Probably recorded (HFHD, I, 285, iv). 174, Oct. 10. Not noticed. 173, May 4. Not noticed. 169, July 17. Not noticed. 167, May 28. Not noticed 166, May 17. Not noticed. 164, Mar. 26. Hardly visible, magnitude 0.02 (ibid.). 162, Mar. 5. Hardly visible. Invisible in the north (ibid.). 161, Aug. 16. Possibly recorded (HFHD, I, 286, v). 155, Oct. 10. Possibly recorded (ibid., vi). 154, Apr. 4. Recorded (HFHD, I, 335, i). The three sources here all disagree on the day of the eclipse. An eclipse listed for 153 may have been dittography for the eclipse of 145 (ibid., ii). 548SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD 152, Aug. 8. Hardly visible (ibid.). Invisible at the capital; magnitude of 0.08 at Peiping. 151, Feb. 2. Hardly visible (ibid.); magnitude of 0.03 at the capital. 150, Jan. 22. Recorded correctly (ibid., 336, iii). 149, June 7. Very probably recorded (ibid., iv). An eclipse listed for Oct. 22, 148 is almost certainly dittography for the eclipse of 147 (ibid., 337, v). 147, Nov. 10. Recorded correctly (ibid., vi); almost total (0.77). 145, Mar. 26. Possibly recorded (ibid., 338, vii); if so, reported from the tip of eastern Shantung. 144, Sept. 8. Recorded correctly (ibid., viii). 143, Aug. 28. Recorded correctly (ibid., 339, ix). The SC states that in the month Nov. 16-Dec. 14, 142, "the sun and moon were both eclipsed and red for five days." The HS does not mention this eclipse, which may have been a dust storm (ibid. x). 141, July 8. Possibly recorded (HFHD, II, 136, i). 138, Nov. 1. Recorded correctly (ibid., ii). 136, Apr. 15. Probably recorded (ibid., iii). 135, Apr. 5. Probably recorded (ibid., 137, iv). 134, Aug. 19. Recorded correctly (ibid., 138, v). 127, Apr. 6. Recorded correctly (ibid., vi). 124, Feb. 3. Hardly visible and that only in southern Mongolia (ibid. 139, vii). 123, Jan. 23. Very probably recorded (ibid.). 122, July 9. Recorded correctly (ibid., viii). 115, Aug. 19. Reached a magnitude of 0.28 at 11:21 a.m. at the capital, so that it was not conspicuous. But smaller eclipses were recorded (ibid., 140). 112, June 18. Recorded correctly (ibid., ix). 108, Apr. 6. Possibly recorded; reached a magnitude of 0.32 at the capital (ibid., x). 107, Sept. 19. Invisible at the capital; reached a magnitude of 0.34 at Peiping at sunrise, where it was conspicuous. Not mentioned (ibid.) 104, July 19. Not mentioned; reached a magnitude of 0.62 at the capital (ibid.). 103, Dec. 3. Not mentioned; reached a magnitude of 0.12 at the capital (ibid.). 101, May 17.

Recorded correctly, if Hoang's calendar is corrected by altering the intercalary month according to a recently excavated 549THE LIST OF ECLIPSES contemporary calendar (ibid., 141, xi). 93, Dec. 12. Recorded correctly (ibid., xii). 90, Oct. 11. Not conspicuous; reached a magnitude of 0.17 at sunrise at the capital (ibid., 142, xiii). 89, Sept. 29. Recorded correctly (ibid.). 84, Dec. 3. Recorded correctly (HFHD, II, 178, i). 82, May 18. Not mentioned (ibid., 179). 81, May 6. Not mentioned; invisible at the capital, but reached a magnitude of 0.47 shortly after sunrise at Peiping (ibid.). 80, Sept. 20. Recorded correctly; almost total at the capital and total in the provinces, from which its totality was reported (ibid., 178, ii). 75, Jan. 3. Visible only in south China (HFHD, II, 275, i). 73, May 8. Not mentioned (ibid.) 69, Feb. 25. Not mentioned (ibid.). 68, Feb. 13. Recorded correctly, although at the capital it only reached a magnitude of 0.10 at 4:20 p.m. (ibid.). 68, Aug. 9. Not mentioned (ibid., 276). 61, Sept. 20. Not mentioned (ibid.). 58, July 20. Not mentioned (ibid.). 57, July 9. Not mentioned (ibid.). 56, Jan. 3.

Not mentioned (ibid.). 42, Mar. 28. Recorded correctly (ibid.). 40, July 31. Recorded correctly (ibid., ii). 39, July 20. Hardly visible; only reached a magnitude of 0.07 at the capital (ibid., 355, iii). 38, Jan. 14. Hardly visible; only reached a magnitude of 0.02 at sunset at the capital (ibid.). 36, Nov. 12. Not mentioned. Reached a magnitude of 0.29 at sunrise at the capital (ibid.). 35, Nov. 1. Recorded, with an error of a year in the date. The record indicates that it was a sunset eclipse of large magnitude; this is the only eclipse of the sort within many years (ibid.). 29, Jan. 5. Recorded correctly (HFHD, II, 419, i). 28, June 19. Recorded correctly; total near the capital; the Annals say 550SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD it was total, but the Treatise says it was almost total (ibid., ii). 26, Oct. 23. Recorded correctly (ibid., iii). 25, Apr. 18. Recorded correctly (ibid., 420, iv). 24, Apr. 7. Recorded correctly (ibid., v). 16, Nov. 1. Recorded correctly (ibid., vi). The Treatise says it was seen only in the capital. At that place it only reached a magnitude of 0.08 at 4:29 p.m.; its small magnitude prevented it being noticed elsewhere. It could only have been seen by using a mirror, smoked glass, or other special means. The court astronomers must have been watching carefully for eclipses. 15, Mar. 29. Recorded correctly (ibid., 421, vii). The Treatise states that clouds prevented this eclipse being seen in the capital, but it was seen elsewhere, proving that reports of eclipses were sent in to the central government. 14, Mar. 18. Recorded correctly (ibid., viii). 13, Aug. 31. Recorded correctly (ibid., ix). 12, Jan. 26. Recorded correctly (ibid., 422, x). It only reached a magnitude of 0.07 at the capital and lasted only 67 minutes. 2, Feb. 5. Recorded correctly (HFHD, III, ch. 11: app. II, i). Almost total at the capital. 1 B.C., June 20. Recorded with an error in the day (ch. 11: app. II, ii). It only reached a magnitude of 0.06 at sunset at the capital. A.D. 1, June 10. Recorded correctly (12: app., i). 2, Nov. 23. Recorded correctly (12: app., ii). It is stated to have been total, but its totality was visible in northern Shensi and Honan, so that this fact was reported from outside the capital. 4, Apr. 8. Hardly visible; invisible at the capital, and at Peiping reached only a magnitude of 0.15 (99: app. IV, i). 6, Sept. 11. Recorded with a slight textual error in the date. It reached a magnitude of 0.95 at the capital (ibid., 544, i). 10, June 30. Hardly visible. Only visible in present Ninghsia (99: app. IV, i). 14, Apr. 18. Recorded correctly (ibid., ii). 15, Sept. 2. Hardly visible; invisible at the capital; at Peiping it only reached a magnitude of 0.07 (ibid., 545, iii). 16, Aug. 21. Recorded correctly (ibid.). 19, Dec. 15. Hardly visible. Visible only in south China; at Canton it only reached a magnitude of 0.03 (ibid.). From a study of the above material, there emerge several interesting conclusions: 1. The records of eclipses in Former Han times are predominatingly 551THE HISTORY'S REMARKABLE ACCURACY reliable. More than two-thirds of the recorded eclipses, some 38 in all, are recorded correctly in the present text. Considering the length of time since the HS was written in the first century A.D., and the many opportunities for mistakes, both by astronomers and annalists before the HS was compiled and the opportunities for errors in transmitting the HS text, this is an excellent record. Fourteen other eclipses can be fitted into the actual dates, usually by only slight changes in the text. Only at most three recordings are hopelessly erroneous; two of these are due to errors in the transmission of the data. When we consider how very easy it is to write mistakenly the number of a month or the cyclical day, the essential correctness of the HS is a marked evidence of the care that was exercised in compiling it and in preserving and copying faithfully its text. It does not seem to have been the case in Han times, as was sometimes later the case, that the dates given in the history were those on which the emperor was informed of an event, rather than the dates on which events occurred. The eclipse of 15 B.C. is said to have been reported from outside the capital and to have been invisible in the capital, so that some days must have elapsed between its occurrence and its being reported to the throne. But it is dated correctly. 2. In the case of some eclipses that are not listed correctly, it is plain that the errors of dating occurred before the HS was compiled. In other cases the evidence is not so clear, but it looks as if the same thing happened. The description of the eclipse of 35 B.C. as being large and ending at sunset is such that the actual eclipse can be unmistakeably identified by calculation. In the chronological account of events in the Annals, this eclipse is put more than a year later than it actually happened; between the actual date and the date at which the Annals put it, several events are recorded. Hence it is plain that when Pan Ku composed the "Annals," this eclipse was already misdated. In the eclipses of 192 and 141, it also seems very likely that the error of dating occurred before Pan Ku prepared his HS. He or his sources probably had somewhat illegible astronomical records of eclipses, which were easily misread. As a whole, there seem indeed to have been made more errors of dating before the HS was written than have occurred in the transmission of the text since that time. In other cases, minor changes have plainly been made since the HS was composed. With the eclipse of 192, there seems to have been later conflation between the account in the "Annals" and that in the "Treatise." A later correction of a date has possibly been made in connection with the eclipse of A.D. 1. For the eclipse of 154, three different cyclical dates are given by our three sources. 552SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD Dittography in Pan Ku's sources seems to have been responsible for the eclipse listed for 153, and almost certainly for that listed for 148. The reign of Emperor Ching (157-141 B.C.) was the worst period in accuracy of eclipse recordings. During this period there are five eclipses incorrectly dated, two dittographies, and only four correctly recorded eclipses. The "Annals" for this period are also the least satisfactory of all the "Annals" in the HS. The original sources for this reign seem to have been defective. 3. Ch'ang-an, the imperial capital, was not the only place from which eclipses were observed. The remarks in the HS in connection with the eclipse of 15 B.C. establish by direct testimony the fact that eclipses were reported from outside the capital. The eclipses of 136, 135, 80, and 56 must also have been reported from outside the capital. It is hence dangerous to take the capital as the sole point of observation, as Hoang and others have done. Nothing less than the whole of China should be taken as the possible locus of observation. For Han times, there is however some evidence that eclipses were not reported to the capital from central and southern China; the eclipse of 2 B.C. was total in the present southern Szechuan, southern Hunan, and Foochow, but no statement of its totality got into the HS. 4. During long periods of years, all eclipses plainly visible in China (and some quite small ones) are reported, while during other periods, groups of eclipses are missed. The following table indicates the number of eclipses not mentioned in the HS and the number of years after the last unreported and plainly visible eclipse during which all plainly visible eclipses were reported: Number of missed eclipses 2 1 3 5 1 3 1 1 2 4 4 1 Years in which all plainly visible eclipses were recorded 1 1 18 51 9 8 6 7 1 2 9 61 It is especially remarkable that there were two periods of over half a century during which all plainly visible eclipses were recordedâfrom 166 to 115 B.C. and from 35 B.C. to the first eclipse correctly recorded in Later Han times (A.D. 26). What could have been the reason for such periods of complete success followed by periods of failure? For example, the five plainly visible eclipses between 174 and 166 B.C. were all missed, then all plainly visible eclipses during 51 years down to 115 B.C. were recorded. Bad weather could hardly be the reason; eclipses were reported from outside the capital, so that local bad weather would hardly prevent an eclipse visible to the naked eye from being recorded. There is however a small correlation between the number of eclipses missed and the time 553WHY WERE SOME MISSED? of the year: months Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Number of eclipses missed in the month 1 1 0 0 7 2 5 3 1 3 1 1 Number of eclipses recorded in the month 6 3 3 8 3 6 4 6 5 3 5 4 Aver. number of overcast days in month at Ch'ang-an2 2 The data for overcast days are for the years 1924-1936 and have been very kindly reported to me by Fr. E. Gherzi, S.J., Director of the Siccawei Observatory. 9 8 9 12 9 9 7 10 9 10 10 10 The missed eclipses seem to be concentrated during the summer months, especially May and July, more than half coming during four consecutive months. Yet the correlation between the number of eclipses missed in each month and the number recorded is only -0.34, with a probable error of Â±0.17. There is thus only a very moderate degree of association between the number missed and the number recorded, and the number of instances is too low to make the correlation reliable. The correlation between the number of eclipses missed and the average number of overcast days is -0.39 Â± 0.17, a negligible amount. It however looks very much as if the interest taken in the observation of solar eclipses by the responsible observers determined whether eclipses were or were not observed. To be conspicuous (so that an eclipse could not be missed by ordinary people) an eclipse must reach a magnitude of 0.75 when the sun is high or a magnitude of 0.33 when the sun is near the horizon. Many of the eclipses recorded in the HS are much smaller than these magnitudes, so that they could not have been perceived unless astronomers were expecting them and used special means to observe them. Hence the attitude of the responsible observers or astronomers probably had much to do with the observation or non-observation of solar eclipses. 5. The Chinese used special means to observe eclipses and watched for them during the two or three days at the end and beginning of the Chinese months when solar eclipses were to be expected. Unless an 554SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD eclipse is conspicuous, it is easily missed; under other circumstances, the diminution of light is too small to be perceived. Unless the sun is near the horizon or is covered by light clouds, it cannot moreover be watched with naked eyes. The necessary diminution of light can be obtained by looking through smoked mica or at the reflection of the sun in water or in a mirror. (Smoked glass may have been available at the time, mica was actually used as a screen, cf. 99 B: 16b.) Some of the recorded eclipses were so small that such special means were certainly used by Chinese astronomers. The eclipse of 178 only reached a magnitude of 0.20; that of 68 only a magnitude of 0.10; that of 16, only 0.08; that of 12, only a magnitude of 0.07 lasting only 67 minutes; that of 1 B.C., only a magnitude of 0.06. That such small eclipses were recorded demonstrates that eclipses were expected and watched for, using special means. There was an office at the capital entitled the Office for Watching the Heavens (cf. Glossary, sub voce), the members of which probably scrutinized the sun for eclipses. Probably this practise of watching for eclipses was however confined to the capital; the eclipse of 16 B.C. was not reported from outside the capital, although at the present Peiping it reached a magnitude of almost twice that at the capital. Thus astronomical activity reached high levels at the capital and was largely confined there. 6. As is to be expected, the method of calculation given by Neugebauer shows itself remarkably accurate when its results are compared with Chinese records. In the eclipse of 181, Chinese records show that at Ch'ang-an the eclipse was total; calculation by Neugebauer's tables reaches that result, but Oppolzer and Ginzel both reach a different result. For the eclipse of 89, Chinese records give its time, late afternoon, which also checks, to a reasonable degree of accuracy, with the results of calculation by Neugebauer's tables. In this case, the eclipse seems merely not to have been noticed until some time after it began. By Neugebauer's tables, the time of an eclipse may be determined to within fifteen minutes and the magnitude to within 0.03.3 3 A. Pogo, "Additions and Corrections to Oppolzer's Canon der Mondfinsternisse," the Astronomical Journal, 1938, no. 1083. The eclipse of 136 may have actually been observed at the capital, although, according to Neugebauer's method of calculation, the capital was just outside the area of visibility. 7. The differences between the statements about eclipses in the "Annals" and in the "Treatise on the Five Powers" (HS ch. 27) indicate that the latter probably represents the list of eclipses kept by the astrologers at the capital, while the "Annals" also employ reports from outside 555FALSIFIED ECLIPSES the capital. In three cases, in the eclipses of 188, 80, and 28, the "Annals" state that the eclipse was total, while the "Treatise" says it was almost total. In each case, calculation demonstrates that at Ch'ang-an it was almost total, while at some other places in China it was total. Thus we can identify the "Treatise" with the reports of the astronomers at the capital. Yet the astrologers at the capital sometimes utilized reports from elsewhere. The "Treatise" specifically mentions the observation of an eclipse in other parts of China, in connection with the eclipse of 15. It lists the eclipse of 135, which was not visible at the capital, as well as that of 136, which was close to the borderline of visibility there. The "Treatise" also records the eclipse of A.D. 2 as total, whereas calculation shows that at Ch'ang-an it was not quite total. 8. It is possible that the eclipse listed for 186 was a deliberate fabrication for the purpose of warning the ruler, the Empress of Emperor Kao, that Heaven disapproved of her acts. This listing seems hardly explicable by any other means. The eclipse discussed under the date 155 is also either a fabrication or else an actual eclipse dated a few years ahead. The eclipse of 201 is likewise doubtful. That only these three eclipses, all near the beginning of this period, should be doubtful, is a high testimony to the accuracy of Chinese recordings at this time. According to Chinese law, it was a serious and capital crime to report falsely a prodigy (such as an eclipse of the sun, cf. HS 100 A: 5b, to be translated in the Preliminary Volume of this series). 9. There is no evidence that the Chinese by calculation reached the dates of any eclipses recorded in the period. In the most promising cases, those of 201, 184, 155, and 145 B.C., I tried to calculate these eclipses by the methods that might have been used, and in each case reached negative results. For the mistakenly dated eclipse of 201, I counted forwards from the date given for this eclipse to the end of the Former Han period by the Han eclipse period of 3986? days, by the Han chang of 6939 61/81 days, and by the saros of 6585.3 days, without coming upon any solar eclipses. Since it might have been possible for Chinese astronomers to know that there is a lunar period lasting one month, during which two solar eclipses and one lunar eclipse or two lunar eclipses and one solar eclipse may occur (although no evidence of this knowledge is found in Han records), I also took periods of one lunation from the dates found by this counting, but came upon no solar eclipse visible in China. This eclipse could thus hardly have been a calculation and its date must merely have been an error of some sort. 556SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD In the case of the eclipses listed in 186 and 145, I performed a similar calculation, with similar negative results. For the actual eclipse of 145 (not the mistaken date given in the "Annals," which does not correspond to any actual eclipse), I counted forwards and backwards for the whole Former Han period by the Chinese eclipse period of 3986? days. At each date thus found, an eclipse had occurred, but most of these eclipses were invisible in China. The second eclipse period after was the date of the eclipse of 123, the sixth was that of the eclipse of 80, the eleventh, that of 25, and the twelfth, that of 14 B.C. In addition, the eclipses of 167, 58, 47 B.C. and A.D. 19 occurred in this series, but these four eclipses are not recorded in the HS. The four recorded eclipses do not occur in any regular sequence, so that the probabilities are decidedly against this eclipse having been calculated by the Chinese eclipse period. I made a similar calculation, using the Han chang of 6939 61/81 days, but no recorded eclipse was found, only the missed eclipse of 164 and two invisible eclipses. Calculation by the saros of 6585.3 days, used by Greek astronomers, brought the eclipses of 181, 145, 127, and 1 B.C., the missed eclipse of 73, together with invisible eclipses. The saros does not however seem to have been known to the ancient Chinese. Thus even calculation of a difficultly visible eclipse from the actual date of that eclipse does not bring any results that would seem to encourage the computation of eclipses or to make probable the hypothesis that they were computed by the ancient Chinese. It is however interesting that the first eclipse listed for Later Han times, dated on Feb. 16, A.D. 25, was almost certainly calculated. It is not found in the list of eclipses in the relevant "Treatise" of the History of the Later Han Dynasty, which was compiled by Szu-ma Piao, who lived ca. 240-306. This eclipse is listed in the Ku-chin Chu, written about A.D. 300. Calculation shows that this partial eclipse was invisible in Asia, and was confined to Alaska, western North America, and the eastern Pacific Ocean (cf. p. 509, n. 3). This date cannot thus have been the result of any Chinese observation; since the Chinese listing agrees with the date of the actual but invisible eclipse, it must have been calculated. Both Hoang and Chu Wen-hsin however include it in their lists of Chinese eclipses. This eclipse shows how dangerous it is to accept an eclipse listing without scrutiny. Perhaps the most peculiar eclipse is that of 145 B.C., which was visible only at sunrise at the tip of the Shantung peninsula. I have pointed out that for it calculation was quite unlikely; since it was visible to the naked eye, it was probably observed and reported to the capital. 10. The court astronomers seem to have kept lists of lunar eclipses as 557THE CALENDARS OF CORRESPONDENCES well as of solar eclipses, although no such lists have come down to us. One such lunar eclipse got into the SC (that of 178), probably because Szu-ma Ch'ien or his source misread the word for "lunar" as "solar" in his source. Eclipses of the moon were not believed to portend anything important, so were not recorded in the histories. 11. Where the dates in the Chinese text do not correspond to any actual eclipse, slight emendations nearly always enable us to show what was the original date. The eclipse of 35 B.C. shows that such emendations actually reach the original dating. In this case, the eclipse is described in such a way that there is no doubt which eclipse is denoted by the recording. To reach the correct date, it is necessary to change a 5 in the year to a 4, a 6 in the month to a 9, and a jen-shen in the date to a ting-ch'ou , all of which are mistakes easily made in copying records. These mistakes occurred before Pan Ku compiled his History. In other cases, slighter or greater changes are necessary. They have been noted in the appendices dealing with those eclipses. Altogether the dates of thirteen eclipses were rectified with a considerable degree of probability; those of 192, 176, 161, 149, 145, 141, 136, 135, 123, 108, 35, 1 B.C., and A.D. 6. The eclipses of 201, 151, and 155 also present difficulties. 12. The calendars of correspondences between Chinese and European dates are essentially correct. Hoang, who prepared the best of the calendars dealing with this period, based his tables largely on previous Chinese studies and partly on the correctly recorded eclipses, as is quite proper. He also published a table of Chinese eclipses, indicating the correspondence between astronomically calculated and Chinese dates, which he took as the basis for his calendar. In those eclipses for which I have been able to identify the original of a now incorrect date, and in which the correct date was unknown to Hoang, it is possible to test Hoang's calendar. In every case it is shown to be reliable (within close limits) for the Han period. The most interesting case is the eclipse of 96, in which a change in the intercalary month from one year to the next (which is required by a contemporary calendar for this year discovered by Stein in the desert; cf. Chavannes, Documents chinois, p. 71) furnishes, unknown to Hoang, a date from his calendar correct within one day to that obtained from astronomical calculation. Thus modern science justifies Chinese calendrical calculations. There are however slight discrepancies. These never amount to more than three days (except for the intercalary month mentioned above), so that the essential accuracy of Hoang's table is maintained. More recent 558SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FORMER HAN PERIOD calendars are no better; concerning the eclipse A.D. 6, which is misdated in the text by two months, and is said to have occurred on the first day of the month, both Hoang and Chen Yuan's Comparative Daily Calendar (Chung-hsi-hui Jih-li) equate the actual date with the last day of the month, so that both these calendars seem to be a day in error here. Because of inaccuracies in Han calculations, it is quite possible that months which our present calendars calculate as having 29 days actually had 30 days, so that modern calendrical computations may in some years be a few days in error. Such seems actually to have been the case. Hoang's calendar requires minor reworking. 13. In 37 cases, the position of the sun at the time of a solar eclipse is given. By the use of Neugebauer's Sterntafeln, the positions of the stars mentioned in the Chinese sources have been calculated for the date of these eclipses. The comparison of these records with the calculated position of the sun does not furnish any convincing proof that these positions were the result of any observation. In partial eclipses, the stars could not have been observed; almost all of these eclipses were observed as partial. For the total eclipse of 181, when the stars could have been observed, the position is 14Â° in error. For erroneously dated eclipses, the position, if given, is grossly in error, and corresponds more to the (erroneous) date than to the actual position of the sun at the time of the actual eclipse. For the five eclipses whose dates are corrected and in which positions are given, the errors in the dates are 3 yrs. 9 mo., 3 yrs. 4 mo., 1 yr. 7 mo., 10 mo., and 1 yr. 8 mo., while the errors in the position are 103Â°, 130Â°, 66Â°, and 105Â° respectively. Towards the end of the Former Han period, these positions are no longer given exactly in degrees, only the constellation being given. It looks as though someone had calculated the position of the sun from the date in the calendar at some time towards the end of the Former Han period, possibly about 27 B.C. (Liu Hsiang?), at which time the dates of many eclipses were already in error. Yet more of the positions are fairly correct. Of the 37 eclipses for which positions are given, 24 are correct to 8Â° or less in R.A.; seven more are in error only 10 to 14Â°. (Since Chinese astronomical observations were always made with reference to the equator, not the ecliptic, celestial positions are reduced to right ascension for purposes of comparison.) The other six are grossly in error, from 42Â° to 105Â°. These are the eclipses of 201, 192, 176, 161, 141, and 80. The first five of these are incorrectly dated in the HS. For the others whose dates are correct, there possibly has been some corruption in the original names of the Chinese constellations. 559THEIR HEAVENLY LOCATIONS These positions cannot have much significence and may be neglected. Their use in Han times was astrological; the various parts of the sky were taken to correspond to various localities on earth, hence an eclipse in a certain part of the sky indicated something in the corresponding locality on earth. It is possible that the heavenly location of the eclipse was falsified in order to make the eclipse interpret some earthly event. In however only six cases in the whole period are we given an interpretation of the eclipse in terms of its heavenly location. Much more common was an interpretation in terms of its month or day. Of the eclipses whose location is grossly erroneous, only those of 201 and 141 were interpreted in terms of their location. Hence it is not likely that many of the erroneous heavenly locations were deliberate falsifications. In conclusion: The outstanding impression left by the Chinese recordings of eclipses in the Former Han period is their high degree of fidelity to fact. The Chinese were not to any great extent interested in fabricating eclipses as portents and it was dangerous to do so. They had not yet begun to predict eclipses. They watched for eclipses, at times with great pertinacity, and succeeded in observing eclipses that were quite small and required the use of special means to be seen. It is but natural that the original records should have suffered errors of transmission; as a whole they are surprisingly correct. This fact constitutes an unimpeachable testimony to the fidelity of the HS to fact. (Reproduced by permission and with alterations from Osiris, vol. 5 [1938], pp. 499-522.)</field>
