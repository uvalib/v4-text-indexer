      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE: VOLUME III PORRO TRIADI NOSTROS CREDIDI BIBLOS VISU ET AUDITU MODO DECUSATOS. Quorum duo quidem tam preliis Parisiace urbis, Odonis quoque regis, quam profecto almi ac heroys presertim mei Germani eiusdem sedis olim egregii presulis, effulgent miraculis, alias tamen quibuslibet inauditis. Qui autem supplet trinitatem tercius, horumce ignarus constat. Nam cleronomos, tametsi angustum maneat situm, decentissime ornat: tum scolasticis ambientibus glosas suis in commentis obnixe complacet, allegoria vero aliquantisper, cui eius indago libuerit, renitet; tum per semet quoniam mutis inheret verbis, propria manu linguas superieci. —Abbo, Bella Parisiacae Urbis, from the Preface (Mon. Germ. Hist., Poetarum, IV:1, Hannover, 18) NOW I HAVE BELIEVED THAT OUR BOOKS SHOULD BE DECOROUSLY ARRANGED for both viewer and auditor in the form of a trilogy. The first two of these, which recount the battles of the city of Paris and of King Eude, sparkle with miracles (however slightly known elsewhere) as effulgent as those which my exalted lord the bishop Germanus, egregious prelate of that same See of Paris, once made shine by his endearing virtues. The third book, which completes the trinity, exists without a meaningful relationship to those first two. Yet, however spare it is in volume, it may effectively serve to adorn the studious heirs of God. First, by its comments it supplies solicitous scholars with favorable meanings of obscure passages, indeed makes the allegory sparkle for the nonce for any whom its contrivance may delight; then on its own it brings to the surface meaning inherent in uncommunicative words. —translation of Abbo by Charles W. Jones Abbo's epic, The Siege of Paris, written in the monastery of St. Germain-des-Prés between A.D. 888-896, is the most blatant example of Carolingian literature and writing of what Ernst Robert Curtius termed "numerical composition"— a principle according to which an abstract number symbolism is superimposed upon a literary exposition regardless of whether or not it fits the content. Abbo committed himself in advance to three books, but since two were sufficient to repel the invaders of Paris, he gave the third book exclusively to didactic grammatical commonplaces. Numerical composition, in its broader ramifications, is closely related to those other conceptual innovations which in architecture and site organization produced the square schematism of the Plan of St. Gall. Although as historians of the Carolingian period we are fully aware of the symbolic implications of ternary division, it was not a desire to impose a predetermined order of numbers on the raw material of this book that induced us to issue it in three volumes. The third volume soon emerged as a physical necessity as the work progressed. It does not have the internal unity and coherence of the two preceding tomes, and like Abbo's third book of The Siege of Paris performs in relation to them a clearly supportive function. In content, this last volume consists on one hand of matter that relates directly to the substance of volumes I and II, but is too complex or subordinate to be taken into the main body of text; and on the other hand of contributions strictly supplementary in nature, pertinent, to be sure, to the problems raised by the Plan, but not an organic part of the Plan. Directly related to the Plan itself is the Catalogue of Inscriptions which takes up the bulk of this third volume, and such indispensable accessories to the whole of the work as the Bibliography and the Indexes. The early recognition of the need for a three-volume format to serve adequately the scope of this project also influenced our decision to place the Bibliography and all Indexes for the entire work at the end of Volume III. The encyclopedic concerns and intimate relationship of the first two volumes, and the nature of the third, as well as the plan to issue the books not sequentially but simultaneously, made this solution a logical one. The Catalogue of Inscriptions (Appendix I) is a complete and systematic compilation of the explanatory titles of the Plan with photographic details shown side-by-side with transliterations in modern print and English translations of all of this textual matter. To publish the inscriptions in this manner was not part of our original scheme; only after it had become clear that a full-scale facsimile reproduction of the Plan could not be included in this book, did we find it desirable to make a place where the explanatory titles of the Plan could be studied as a homogeneous body of texts. They are of more than passing interest: not only because of the richness and historical importance of their architectural vocabulary, the meaning and controversial nature of many of the technical terms they contain—but also for the sheer graphical beauty of the script in which they are rendered, the masterful way in which they are positioned within the drawing, inscribed or juxtaposed, tightly and pointedly related to the area or object whose purpose and function they define, yet never obtrusive and nowhere ever entering into conflict with the drawing itself, the primary message. As our work progressed we became more and more convinced (without losing sight of the highly intuitive and wholly unscholarly nature of this supposition) that the scribe and the delineator of the Plan were one and the same person. The ductus of his written line seemed to us to exhibit the same distinctive combination of sensitivity and boldness that characterizes the line in which the buildings were drawn. Clearly supplementary in nature, on the other hand, is the subject matter taken up in Appendices II and III of this volume. Appendix II consists of a translation by Charles W. Jones of the so-called statutes of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie (Consuetudines Corbeienses), that masterpiece of managerial logistics, written for the monastery of Corbie by one of the most illustrious abbots of the period and cousin and schoolmate of Charlemagne. Appendix III is a brief but fascinating essay by A. Hunter Dupree, "On the Significance of the Plan of St. Gall for the History of Measurement." Apologias for these two contributions will be found in explanatory statements preceding them. Preparing the Bibliography and working up the Indexes were the last two serious tasks in this project. While engaged in this labor we could not help but marvel (as other writers must have done before us under similar circumstances) how much there was still to be done after the work on the book itself was completed. It was at this stage of the production of the book, that Ernest Born as its designer, and Lorna Price, its editor, entered the most intensive phase of their travail. Now that all is done, and these last lines are being written at the conclusion of the book, the conclusion of the project —in looking back upon the rigor and richness of life which the subject has imposed upon us, keeping us under its spell for close to twenty years, I can only repeat what I said earlier: I regret that it all went so fast! I envy those who will take up and continue the work on this masterpiece of architectural planning worked out by men who had dedicated themselves to the task of bringing about a better life on earth by placing themselves in the service of God. For Ernest Born and me the time has come to take leave of the Plan of St. Gall and to turn to another pressing task. W. H.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">NOTE ON THE ILLUSTRATIONS ILLUSTRATIONS IN THESE BOOKS OCCUR in a numerical unbroken sequence and are grouped in this list under volumes I, II, and III. (Excluded from the sequence are 166 color illustrations in Appendix I; they are listed by the Index of Building Numbers of the Plan; e.g. c.127, the Mill.) References to illustrations in the main text are by figure number, as, fig. 124. When the reference is to a figure in a volume other than the one in hand, the volume number is also given, as II, fig. 425. Organization of entries in this list is intended to afford the reader both overview and swift access to one, or a series, of illustrations. Order of information is as follows: Monuments and sites: location, monument, date, scale, parts illustrated. (Location of famous monuments may be omitted from both list and caption title.) Books and manuscripts: Author if pertinent, title or descriptive name, publication date or approximate date of writing, folio. Library and shelf number are given in the captions. (But manuscripts lacking descriptive titles are listed by library and shelf number; cf. fig. 388.) Works of art, artifacts: Artist if pertinent, title or descriptive name, date. (Museum location is given in the captions.) Illustrations with several parts occur in two sequences: A, B, C . . . and X, Y, Z . . . series. The A-series identifies the main body of illustrations constituting primary visual support for the text. The X-series was introduced to resolve editorial questions after the main body of figures was established. These may illustrate details (cf. fig. 115.X), supplementary views or plans (cf. figs. 310.X, 438.X), or may identify a major illustration or sequence germane to the arguments of the text, and containing important supportive information in extended captions (cf. figs. 71.X, Y, Z, and 166.X). Illustrations classified as "figures" comprise the majority. Numerous others, not directly referred to in the text, supplementary and germane to the theme of the work, are also integrated in the list. They carry the prefix "ill.", volume number, and page, as, ill. I.25. A few maps, tables, and diagrams are so identified and are listed among the figures in the sequence in which they occur in the text. The term "plate" is not used in this work. Inclusion of an indication of scale with plan illustrations, essential in books concerned with architecture, was adopted at the inception of the work. In general the graphic scale is preferred and is usually shown in both English and metric measure. In most cases it is supplemented by the representational fraction, R.F. (1:100, 1:600, etc.) corresponding to the graphic scale. Details of the Plan of St. Gall are generally reproduced at the scale of the original (1:192) unless otherwise stated. In Appendix I portions of the Plan are reproduced 1.5 times the size of the original for study purposes. Dates are all A.D. unless otherwise noted. Size of original works, important and often cardinal to understanding the subject illustrated, is, whenever possible, given in the illustration caption. For remarks concerning printing procedure and reproduction see notes on Hatton 48 inscription illustrations, I, p. 345; and the Colophon at the end of this volume. Illustrations for the books are drawn from wide-ranging sources. We gratefully acknowledge the aid and cooperation of individuals and of many institutions in making it possible for us to assemble this illustrative record. Full credit to sources is given where each illustration appears in the text, together with bibliographic citations. NOTE: REDRAWING OF ILLUSTRATIONS Subject matter for illustrations was redrawn only when the state of the copy was not suitable, or sometimes not unseable, for adequate printing reproduction; e.g., very large fold-out pages of drawings in lines too thin to reproduce properly when reduced to page size, or archaeological drawings bearing technical field notes irrelevant to the needs of the work. The procedure of redrawing involves interpretation and translation, and in consequence, the possibility of misinterpretation and human error. Mindful of this risk, despite particular diligence in pursuit of the task, the authors ask the indulgence of the reader. Redrawing has been employed only when original copy would not comply with standards of reproduction required for satisfactory performance in effective visual communication and for superior printing and book production. NOTE: ill.III.x [above] SAINT-AMAND APOCALYPSE. Bibliothèque Municipale, Valenciennes, MS 99, fol. 19r. Angel and trumpet.

A CATALOGUE OF THE EXPLANATORY TITLES OF THE PLAN OF ST. GALL PREFACE THE explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall are discussed in widely scattered places in the main body of this work, in the specific contexts of the buildings with which they are associated, as well as in the broad range of architectural and historical problems they raise. In such fragmentation, the inscriptions cannot be studied as a whole and coherent body of texts. Yet, the explicit content and cultural implications of these inscriptions make their ready accessibility not only desirable, but even imperative. Of the 340 separate annotations on the Plan of St. Gall, more than 300 have no other purpose than to explain specifically, and often in highly technical terms, the uses and functions of the 40-odd buildings which comprise the monastery, the assigned use of individual rooms in these buildings, and, as well, the nature and function of each piece of furniture or equipment installed in these rooms. The superior intellect of its originator and his deep concern with detail make the Plan a storehouse of lexicographical information furnishing the student with an opportunity for linguistic exegesis that has no equivalent in any other historical source on medieval art and architecture. The words elucidate the drawing, the drawing elucidates the words. They combine to reveal in intimate detail whatever one would want to learn about the buildings of the Plan, and explicate, with an unparalleled thoroughness, whatever is required—in architectural, liturgical, educational, medical, technological and agricultural terms—to support the purposes and the high quality of life within the confines of a self-sustaining religious community. It is in view of the profound relevance this material has for the history of medieval architecture, both monastic and vernacular, as well as for the history of medieval economy and for medieval life in general, that we thought it imperative to make all this explanatory matter available in a coherent and easily identifiable form for the benefit of those who are interested in the Latinity of the Plan, its linguistic and paleographic details, and who, in this manner, inter alia, will also be enabled to critically evaluate our success or failure to interpret this material correctly. To further these ends we have presented in the Catalogue that follows, in juxtaposition: first, a reproduction of each inscription as it appears on the Plan (for legibility enlarged to one and one-half times the size of the original); second, a transliteration of the inscription simulating its original character as closely as modern typesetting permits; and third, our interpretation of the texts rendered in English. While the inscriptions, seen here in their architectural ambient, are able to furnish a unique and intimate view of the Plan, this Catalogue is not meant to substitute for a facsimile of the entire document, an artifact already admirably executed by the firm of E. LöpfeBenz of Rorschach.1 1 In 1952, Firma E. Löpfe-Benz published a full-size facsimile in color of the Plan of St. Gall from a series of eight negatives taken from the Plan itself. This facsimile is visually the most coherent reproduction of the Plan available to scholars, and stands in its own right as a masterpiece of offset lithography. It is our understanding that copies of this facsimile are still available from its publishers. It is no small presumption to dissect an entire document into graphic components in order to scrutinize its details. At risk is the coherence of the whole artifact. If we have avoided the worst of that hazard, it owes to the patience and skill of Ernest Born who, from the viewpoint of book design, found this Catalogue to be the most complex, time-consuming, and esthetically challenging part of the task to which he has devoted long attention. The general historical implications of the explanatory titles of the Plan have been discussed in earlier chapters.2 2 Chapters "Dedicatory Legend" and "Explanatory Legends," I, 9, and 13. In the present context we will make a few remarks about the Latinity of these texts, the manner in which they are visually displayed, and some of their primary paleographical characteristics. LATINITY The Latin of the titles is lucid, as even a peremptory reading of this catalogue reveals. It makes use of a judicious and sophisticated alternation of prose and verse. With a few exceptions (discussed below), verses—hexameters and distychs— are employed to designate the general purpose of a building, whereas prose is used for their component parts and furnishings3 3 See I, 13ff. . PROSE The prose is logical and unambiguous, and the diction conveys meaning with great precision. This holds true even for the letter of transmission which, although without any internal flaw, has caused some consternation among scholars. Closer inspection has shown that whatever controversies arose in connection with this text were due not to any inherent ambiguities in its style or composition, but rather to linguistic misconceptions of its modern interpreters. The note has the form of a regular letter, naming its receiver, addressing him directly, revealing that the Plan was made upon the request of its receiver, and that it needed for a particular purpose.4 4 See I, 9ff. Its only truly tantalizing feature is that it lacks a signature. There is no cause to blame the author for this omission. The Plan of St. Gall was not made for posterity, but for the benefit of an abbot, who had no trouble in identifying the high person who furnished him with this scheme. In the entire body of inscriptions only seven words have given rise to conflicting interpretations: the terms exemplata and officina (in the letter of transmission), uacatio (in the Outer School), seruitium (in the House for Servants from Outlying Estates), sauina (in the Monks' Cloister), toregma (in the Monks' Refectory and the House for Distinguished Guests), and testu (in the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers and in the Outer School). In four of these cases a search for contemporary parallels has shown that their meaning is unequivocal. Exemplata means "copied," not "by way of example" as had been proposed.5 5 On exemplata, see ibid. Officina cannot be restricted to the meaning "workshop" but refers to all of the buildings of a monastic settlement.6 6 On officina see I, 51. Uacatio means "time vacated from other obligations for the purpose of learning" and cannot be interpreted to mean "recreation" as its modern derivative "vacation" has tempted some to suggest.7 7 On uacatio see II, 172-74. Seruitium are the services due an overlord by his tenants and serfs, and is a term applicable to both secular and ecclesiastical lords.8 8 On seruitium see II, 165-66. Sauina is the classical and medieval designation for the savin plant. Its meaning is clear although we are at some difficulty in explaining fully the reasons that this plant was given a place of such honor in the Monks' Cloister.9 9 On sauina see II, 246-48. Toregma, in the previous literature on the Plan varyingly interpreted as "cupboard," "a vessel for washing hands," "a chair or cushioned seat" or "a water fountain," is a latinization (otherwise not attested) of Greek τ??????. The term, whose painful multivalence was stretched even by its medieval users beyond the limits of propriety,10 10 On toregma see I, 269, 332 and II, 160. is used on the Plan of St. Gall as a designation for "cupboard," as must be inferred from the shape of the object to which this term refers (Monks' Refectory, Abbot's House, House for Distinguished Guests). We are aware of only one other literary source (Ruodlieb), in which the term is used in this sense. Testu in the literature on the Plan, consistently misread as testudo ("turtle shell"), means "protective shell" or "cover." I have not been able to find any contemporary parallels, but the architectural context in which it appears on the Plan suggests that its meaning is "louver", i.e., a protective covering over an opening in the roof that serves as smoke escape and as light inlet.11 11 On testu see II, 3 and 117. The term formula requires some explanation. The shape and size of the objects into which this word is inscribed (long, narrow rectangles in the crossing and transept of the Church) precludes that it be interpreted as "lectern" as has been proposed12 12 For details see I, 137. (the scribe's term for lectern is analogium). Among the numerous references to forma and formula quoted by Du Cange and Niermeyer and indexed in source books such as Lehmann-Brockhaus (1935, 1938, 1955-1960) or the five volumes of the Corpus Consuetudinum Monasticarum (1963-1968) there is only one instance, a rather late one at that, where formula has been interpreted as "lectern"—incorrectly in my opinion.13 13 DuCange, 1938, 568 (a source of 1401 A.D.). The history of the term is interesting. In Classical Latin forma and its diminutive formula served to denote such concepts as "norm," "rule," "guiding principle," or "covenant," but also stood for "matrix," "pattern," or "mould."14 14 For examples and sources see Lewis and Short, 1945, 769-770. It is in the former sense that the term is used by St. Benedict in an often-quoted passage in which he defines the human and intellectual qualities which an abbot must possess: In doctrina sua namque abbas apostolicam debet illam semper formam seruare, in qua dicit: "Argue, obserua, increpa." "For the abbot in his teaching ought always to observe the rule of the apostle, wherein he says: `Reprove, persuade, rebuke.' "15 15 Benedicti regula, chap. 2, 23; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 23; ed. McCann, 1953, 21; ed. Steidle, 1952, 82. The term retained this meaning throughout the Middle Ages, but in addition generated a distinctly different variant when it became a designation for a liturgical piece of furniture that, depending on context, may be varyingly translated as "church bench," as "kneeling-bench" (prie-Dieu) or as "choir-stalls"—a meaning that I suppose evolved from its secondary classical usage "matrix" or "mould." The shape and size of the objects into which the word formula is inscribed on the Plan suggests that it was here used in the sense of "bench" (for sitting). Yet an even furtive review of its use in Merovingian, Carolingian and later medieval sources discloses that it served even more frequently as a designation for a liturgical contrivance that in modern French, English and German is referred to as "prie-Dieu," "kneeling bench," and "Betstuhl," viz., a piece of furniture that supports the body when kneeling and may also be used as prop during the deep liturgical inclinations in which the monks engage in the more sacred phases of their religious service. These prayer-supports could either be set up separately in front of the choir benches or they could be physically attached to them (as in the elaborate choir stalls of the high medieval abbey and cathedral churches) which explains the use of forma and formula for either one (i.e., a bench for sitting) or the other (i.e., a support for kneeling and liturgical inclination) or the combination of both in a fully developed choir stall (i.e., a piece of furniture, in which a solid row of prayer-supports is firmly attached to a range of benches with hinged seats and a high-rising back. A good example for the use of formula in the sense of bench is in the Vita sanctae Geretrudis, in a passage referring to an event that occurred in 783 A.D.: Haec audiens peregrina. . .eam duxit in ecclesiam beatae Mariae virginis et posuit eam ante formulam, ubi Geretrudis sancta sedere solebat. "In hearing this the woman on pilgrimage. . .conducted her [i.e., a young girl who had a vision of St. Gertrude] into the church of our blessed virgin Mary and placed her before the bench where Saint Gertrude used to be seated."16 16 Vita sancti Geretrudis, ed. Bruno Krusch, Mon.Germ.Hist., Script. rer. Merovingicarum, II (Hanover, 1888), 348. Unmistakably used in the sense of "support for kneeling in prayer" is the term in the famous petition (probably drafted by Eigil, later abbot of Fulda) which the monks of Fulda submitted first to Charlemagne in 812, and again to Louis the Pious in 817: Quod infirmorum maior cura sit et miseratio senum videlicet et debilium neque penuria victus affligantur neque vestitus paupertate conterantur et nec ineptiis aliquibus vexentur, ita ut nec baculum eis pro sustentatione fere liceat nec ad inclinatorium, quod nos formulas dicimus, morando haerere, quia caecus et claudus non possunt sine sustentatione baculi bene incedere nec decrepitus sine formula genua flectere. "That special care be taken of the sick and mercy extended to the old and feeble so that they may not be afflicted by a shortage of food nor struck by poverty in clothing nor subjected to any other unsuitable vexations such as being forbidden to carry a staff for their support, or linger and cling to the inclinatorium, which we call formula, because the blind and and the lame cannot move about without a staff nor can the decrepit bend his knees without a formula."17 17 Supplex Libellus monachorum Fuldensium Carolo Imperatori porrectus (812 et 817), chap. 5, ed. Semmler, Corp. Cons. Mon., I, Siegburg, 1963, 323. The passage is interesting because it discloses that the prie-Dieu although clearly known, was not in general use at that period (at least not so far as the Abbey of Fulda is concerned) since the monks in their petition speak of them as a privilege to be made available to the old and feeble. The author of the Plan of St. Gall, as already stated, used formula in connection with an object so shaped that it can only be interpreted as "bench," and in terms of literal visual exegesis this is the way it should be interpreted. But in designating this object by the term formula (more frequently used in the sense of prie-Dieu than in the sense of "bench" in contemporary sources) he may have wanted to imply that these benches, if desired, could be furnished with a range of lean-to's to support the monks when kneeling or bending. Special attention must be drawn to the use of the word domus, since confusion about the meaning of this term among earlier students of the Plan has had an adverse effect upon the identification of the building type in which the workmen, the serfs, and the animals are housed. We have discussed this matter at length in its proper place in the second volume,18 18 For a more detailed discussion of domus, see II, 77-78, and below, 151. and therefore confine ourselves here to simply re-emphasizing that on the Plan of St. Gall the word domus is used not as a designation for the whole of the house, but (as its qualifying adjectives disclose) for an important spatial function of the building: its "common living room" (domus communis) or "principal room" (domus ipsa) where its components gather around the open central fireplace, as distinguished from the peripheral rooms which serve more specialized occupants such as sleeping or the stabling of livestock. In only one instance, in the hexameter that defines the purpose of the House for Goats and Goatherds, does the term domus refer to the entire structure.19 19 See below, p. 76. The term pisale is on the Plan of St. Gall exclusively used as a designation for rooms that are heated by warm air generated in a subterranean firing chamber and channeled into the interior by heat ducts installed under the floor (Monks' Warming Room, as well as the warming rooms of the Novitiate and the Infirmary).20 20 On pisale see I, 313. This is in full conformity with its classical root pensilis, an adjective formed from pendere (to hang, to be suspended) and in architecture employed as a technical term for structures that do not rest exclusively on their own foundations, but are raised upon columns, pillars, arches or vaults as was the case with rooms in Roman houses or baths that were heated by hypocausts.21 21 Forcellini, Lexicon, IV, 1858, 565. The term changed its meaning later on, when it produced French poêle (stove) and Middle High German pisel, phiesel and phiselgadem (a heatable room).22 22 For sources see Capitulare de villis, ed. Gareis, 1895, 51. Levillain's translation of pisalis as séchoir (drying room) is misleading (Levillain, 1900, 342, note 2) as correctly pointed out by Lesne, VI, 1943, 364. The Monks' Warming Room, truly enough, was an ideal place to dry the monks' clothes after they had been washed in the adjacent Laundry, but this was by no means its exclusive function (see I, 258). Rooms with corner fireplaces are referred to as caminatae, (prime example: House for Distinguished Guests).23 23 On the House for Distinguished Guests, see II, 155-65. The term caminata, however, is also used for the corner fireplaces themselves (Abbot's House).24 24 On caminata, see II, 123-28. The word solarium appears only once on the Plan (Abbot's House) in a textual and architectural context, that makes it unequivocably clear that it refers to the upper level of a masonry building whose rooms gave access to the rays of the sun by means of windows.25 25 On solarium, see I, 322. Pistrinum is exclusively used in the sense of "bakery," never in its alternate classical meaning of "mill."26 26 On pistrinum, see II, 253ff. This again is in complete conformity with common contemporary parlance. The term porticus, however, has two distinctly different meanings. In the Monks' Cloister,27 27 On the use of porticus in the Monks' Cloister, see I, 249, n. 26. the Cloister for the Novices28 28 On the use of porticus in the Cloister of the Novitiate, see I, 313. and the Cloister for the Sick,29 29 On the use of porticus in the Cloister of the Infirmary, see I, 313. it is used in the traditional classical sense as designation for a colonnaded gallery or porch, giving access to, or being attached to some other (usually larger) structure.30 30 On the meaning of porticus in Classical Latin, see Thesaurus, and any standard dictionary, sub verbo. In this sense it is also used for the two sunlit porches of the Abbot's House (porticus arcubus lucida).31 31 On the use of porticus in the Abbot's House, see I, 313ff. But in one of the most important explanatory titles of the Church of the Plan porticus clearly stands for "aisle" (latitudo utriusque porticus pedum xx);32 32 On the use of porticus in the Plan, see below, pp. 36, 49. hence denotes a space that is not attached to the Church,33 33 In medieval Latin porticus is also used for spaces laterally attached to a larger building, even if these spaces are not colonnaded, such as the lateral spaces of the sixth-century church of St. Augustine's in Canterbury. Cf. Baldwin Brown's "Note on the word PORTICUS" in Brown, II, 1925, 89. but forms an integral part of its spatial composition. The extension of meaning from "porch" to "aisle" needs hardly any comment, since the morphology and function of a galleried porch are virtually identical with those of the aisles of a basilican church, the only difference being that in one case the gallery opens outward, in the other inward. Yet despite these similarities the term does not appear to have gained great popularity as a designation for "aisle." Hrabanus Maurus (ca. 776-856) uses it in this sense in his verse description of the Abbey Church of Fulda (dedicated in 818) where, with a verbal discrimination rare in medieval poetry, clear distinction is made between the northern and the southern aisle of the church (in porticu septemtrionali—in porticu meridiana) the transept (transversa domus), the eastern apse (in abside orientali), the western apse (in abside occidentali), and the crypt (in crypta).34 34 Hrabani carmina, 41. See Schlosser, Schriftquellen, 1896, 104108; No. 361. But this is the only Carolingian occurrence of this use of the term, outside the Plan of St. Gall, that is known to me. The pre-Carolingian biographies compiled in the Liber Pontificalis do not employ it in this sense35 35 Richard Krautheimer (personal communication) believes that the words pro porticia in the Charta Ecclesiae Cornutianae, issued in A.D. 471 (Duchesne, Liber Pontificalis, I, 1886, cxlvii, line 45) may be a reference to "aisles", but stresses, at the same time, that the term is not used anywhere else in this sense in the pre-Carolingian biographies of the Popes. He warns against giving any weight to the Testamentum Domini as containing evidence for the use of porticus in the sense of "aisle," since the Latin translation of the Syrian text in which the term appears is modern. This translation (Ephraem Rahmani Ignatius, Testamentum Domini, Mainz, 1899) was not available to me. For previous discussion of the subject see Suzanne Lewis, XXVIII, 1969, 95 and the literature quoted there. and the bibliographical sources published in the Scriptores rerum Merovingicarum where the term appears in numerous places, contains not a single case where porticus can be identified unequivocably, as a synonym for "aisle."36 36 Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. rer. Merov., 7 vols., 1885-1919. Even in post-Carolingian times the term is used only sparingly in this sense. It crops up in the Chronicle of Montecassino, where we are told that Abbot Desiderius raised "the walls of the two aisles [of the new monastery church he started to rebuild in 1066] up to a height of 15 cubits" (porticus etiam utriusque parietes in altitudine cubitorum xv subrigens);37 37 Chronica monasterii Casinensis, book III, chap. 26, ed. Lehmann-Brockhaus, Schriftquellen, I, 1938, 476, No. 2277. and it occurs in the Life of St. Dunstan, written by William of Malmsbury about 1126 in a passage, where the Saint is said to have added alas vel porticus to an older church which he wished to widen.38 38 Vita s. Dunstani, ed. Stubbs, and Willelmo monacho Malmesbiriensi, book I, §16, Rolls Series, LXIII, 1874, 271-72; ed. Lehmann-Brockhaus, Lateinische Schriftquellen, I: 1, 1955, 494, No. 1834. Yet these are relatively isolated occurrences. The full history of the term would obviously require a more systematical study than is possible in this context; but it is surely indicative that a quick perusal of the passages referred to in the indices of the source collections published by Schlosser, Mortet-Deschamps, and Lehmann-Brockhaus, leave little doubt that in an overwhelming majority of cases porticus is used in its traditional classical sense as an equivalent for "colonnaded gallery" or "porch" and in only a small number of cases as a designation for "aisle."39 39 Schlosser, 1896; Mortet-Deschamps, 1929; Lehmann-Brockhaus, 1938 and idem. 1955-1960. The term claustrum occurs twice on the Plan, once in the Monks' Cloister ("quattuor semitae p transuersum claustri", "four paths crossing the cloister at right angles") and once in the cloister of the Novices ("hoc claustro oblati pulsantibus adsociantur", "in this cloister the oblates and those who are knocking live together").40 40 For the Monks' Cloister see I, 245ff; for the Cloister of the Novices, I, 315ff. The etymological root of claustrum is found in the word claudere, "to shut" or "to lock."41 41 Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary, Oxford, 1945, 35: "that by which anything is shut up or closed, a lock, bar, bolt." In Classical Latin, claustrum stood for "lock", "bar", or "bolt"; more figuratively for "bounds" and "confines"; in military language for "barricade", "bulwark", and other defensive enclosures.42 42 So correctly Isidore of Seville. St. Benedict used the term in the sense of "confines" (claustra monasterii egredi)43 43 Benedicti Regula, chap. 4, 78, ed. Rudolph Hanslik, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum LXXXV, Vienna, 1960, 35: "Officina uero ubi haec omnia diligenter operemur, claustra sunt monasterii et stauilitas in congregatione;" and ibid., chap. 67, 7 ed. Hanslik, 158: "Siliter et qui praesumpserit claustra monasterii egredi." —a meaning which it retained for centuries along with all the other connotations it subsequently acquired. St. Gregory used it in the sense of "prison" (quod etiam retentus corpora ipsa jam carnis claustra contemplatione transebat), or "confines"44 44 Gregorii magni dialogi, I: 1, ed. Moricca, 1924, 14; confines: "in quantum se intra cogitationes claustra custodivit," 2:3, ibid., p. 83. , Isidore of Seville more concretely for "folding doors" (valvae).45 45 Isidori Hispalensis episcopi Etymologiarum sive originum libri XX, book XV, chap. 7, ed. W. M. Lindsay, II, Oxford, 1911 (no pagination): "Fores et valvae claustra sunt, sed fores dicunt quae foras, valvae quae intus revolvuntur, et duplices conplicabilesque sunt . . . . Claustra ab eo quod claudantur dicta." When precisely in history the term claustrum became the designation for an architectural entity consisting of an open court surrounded by galleried porches has not yet been clearly established. Paul Meyvaert drew my attention to a passage in the Life of Bishop Hrodbert of Salzburg (d. ca. 710) where claustrum may have that connotation (although one would like the phrase to be a little more specific to feel entirely sure of this interpretation): "claustra cum ceteris habitaculis ad ecclesiasticorum virorum pertinentibus . . . construxit.46 46 Vita Hrodberti episcopi Salzburgensis, chap. 8, ed. Levison, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. rerum Merovingicarum, VI, Hannover, 1887, 159. Paul Meyvaert discussed the history of the term claustrum briefly in a paper read at the symposium "Paradisus Claustralis—What is a Cloister?" (New York, March 30-April 1, 1972), and more extensively in "The Medieval Monastic Claustrum," Gesta XII (1973), 53-59. In Carolingian sources claustrum is used in a variety of ways: (1) as a designation for the open inner court and its surrounding porches, (2) as a designation for the porches alone, (3) as a designation for yard and porches, plus the entire frame of buildings ranged peripherally around them, and (4) as pars pro toto for the whole of the monastic settlement. On the Plan of St. Gall the cloister walks or cloister porches, as already mentioned, are individually referred to by the term porticus. The word claustrum appears in titles that are inscribed into the open yard between these porches, and may be interpreted—depending on where one places the accent—as either referring to the open yard alone (since the paths that cross each other at right angles are physically confined to that space) or to the open yard plus its enclosing porches (since the paths emerge from these porches). It is in this latter sense that the word is used in Hildemar's commentary (ca. 845 A.D.) to the Rule of St. Benedict where it is said, "Dicunt multi, quia claustra monasterii centum pedes debent haberi in omni parte minus non" ("It is generally held that a cloister should be one hundred feet square, and no less."47 47 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 183. These dimensions could not possibly refer to the whole of the claustral complex, since it would be impossible to fit its buildings into an area a hundred feet square.48 48 Hildemar's dimensions coincide with those of the Monks' Cloister on the Plan of St. Gall, where the yard plus its surrounding porches are inscribed into an area 100 by 102 1/2 feet square and where it is easy to check what would happen if one were to move the Dormitory (40 feet by 85 feet), Refectory (40 feet by 100 feet) and Cellar (40 feet by 87 1/2 feet) from their peripheral positions into the interior of the cloister yard. Another clear case of the use of claustrum to mean the cloister yard and its surrounding frame of porches is in Hariulf's Chronicon Centulense (1088 A.D.) in a passage describing the cloister of the monastery built by Abbot Angilbert between 790 and 799. In the same narrative the cloister walks are referred to as tectus: Claustrum vero monachorum triangulum factum est, videlicet a a sancto Richario usque ad sanctam Mariam, tectus unus; a sancta Maria usque ad sanctum Benedictum tectus unus; itemque a sancto Benedicto usque ad sanctum Richarium tectus unus.49 49 Hariulph, Chronique de l'Abbaye de Saint-Riquier, ed. Lot, 1894, 56; ed. Schlosser, 1896, 259 No. 783. "The cloister of the monks, however, he built in the form of a triangle, namely from [the church of] St. Richarius to [the church of] St. Mary one covered walk from [the church of] St. Mary to the [church of] St. Benedict one covered walk, and from St. Benedict to St. Richarius, likewise, one covered walk." There are, however, other instances where claustrum stands for the whole of the claustral compound. A phrase in the Gesta Aldrici (bishop of Le Mans, and written between 840 and 842) provides this example: "Claustrum iuxta ipsam ecclesiam fecit, id est refectorium, dormitorium, cellarium"50 50 Gesta Aldrici episcopi Cenomanensis, chap. 26, ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Scriptores, XV, Hannover, 1887, 319. ("and next to the church he built a cloister, i.e. the refectory the dormitory, the cellar"); in the interesting passage in the Life of Eigil, Abbot of Fulda (written between 840 and 842) we find this usage: Vocantur ad consilium fratres. Quaesitum est, in quo loco aedificatio claustri congruentius potuisset aptari. Quidem dederunt consilium, contra partem meridianam basilicae iuxta morem prioris; quidam autem, Romano more contra plagam occidentalem satius poni, confirmant propter vicinitatem martyris qui in ea basilicae parte quiecit. Quorum concilio adsensum praebuere priores, concordabant nihilominus et reliqua pars fratrum.51 51 Vita Eigilis Abbatis Fuldensis, chap, 19, ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Scriptores, XV, Hannover, 1887, 231; and Schlosser, 1896, 112 No. 368. "They called the brothers into council. The question was raised in which place the construction of the new cloister52 52 The cloister referred to is the one which was started by Abbot Eigil in 819 and completed during the abbacy of his successor Hrabanus Maurus (822-840). See Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, I, 1966, 84. should be most suitably undertaken. Some advised that it should be placed against the southern part of the church like the earlier cloister; others, however, claimed that it were more satisfactorily placed in the Roman manner against the western side of the church, because of the nearness to the martyr who rests in this part of the church. As the priors agreed with the advice of the latter, the remaining part of the brothers assented as well." Even in the case of the title that defines the function of the Novitiate, on the Plan of St. Gall (hoc claustro oblati pulsantibus adsociantur) the word may encompass the whole of the claustral complex, as the association of oblates and pulsantes, to which this title refers, pertains not only to their open court into which it is inscribed but also to the porches and buildings ranged around it. In a few instances the word claustrum may also be used in a more limited sense as a substitute for porticus, "cloister walk." Paul Meyvaert drew my attention to a passage in the Capitula Qualiter (written after 821 A.D.): "In claustris hora lectionis summum silentium et summum studium lectionis ab omnibus haberi." Here claustri comes in the middle of a list of buildings: "in oratorio", "in sacrario", "in hospitali", "in refectorio", "in dormitorio", and therefore must clearly stand for "cloister walks."53 53 Capitula Qualiter, ed. Frank, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 355. For other later occurrences of claustrum in the sense of "cloister walk" see the passages quoted under this term in the index of vol. III/IV of the Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum, under the subheadings locutio in claustro, processionem per . . ., sedere in . . ., silentium in . . . . For the use of claustrum as pars pro toto for the entire monastery I refer to the sources quoted sub verbo by DuCange and by Niermeyer.54 54 DuCange, II, 1937, 362-363; Niermeyer, 1954, 188. A typical example is in the Life of Duke William (d. 812), builder of the monastery of St. Guilhem-le-Desert (Gellone) and protector of Benedict of Aniane: Metitur etiam totius claustri spatium, domum refectionis atque dormitorium, domum etiam infirmorum et cellam novitiorum, proaulam hospitum, Xenodochium pauperum, iunctum clibano pistrinum, de latere molendinum.55 55 Vita Willelmi ducis et monasterii Gellonensis, chap. 8, see Schlosser, 1889, 219 No. 686. "He measures, moreover, the space of the entire cloister, the refectory and the dormitory, the infirmary and the novitiate, the house for distinguished guests, and the hospice for pilgrims and paupers, and the bakery next to the oven, as well as the nearby mill." In the fifteenth century, south of the Alps claustrum is used in secular parlance as a synonym for cortile, the galleried, often double-storied range of porches opening peripherally inward onto the courts of Italian palaces. Wolfgang Lotz brought to my attention two contracts in which the term appears with this connotation. One contract was made between Pope Paul II and the three brothers Capranica, laying down the terms for the sale, in 1466, of a house valued at 500 ducats, and defining this property as "unam domum . . . cum cameris, sala, coquina, reclaustro, porticali coperto columnato ante eam, . . . ."56 56 Zippel, 1910, 251, note 1. In the other contract, a donation deed of 1480 concerning the Palazzo Nardini, built for Stephano, Cardinal Nardini between 1473 and 1478, it is specified that the gift applies to the palace "cum omnibus continentibus aedificiis et apotecis et cum tribus claustris et porticibus et cum tribus introitibus a tribus viis, et cum omnis aulis, turribus."57 57 Tomei, 1942, 190. The term has thus come full circle: from "lock" or "bolt" to "bulwark", from military to spiritual enclosure, until finally the image of the ubiquitous monastic cloister furnishes the word for a new concept in secular architecture for which, because it was a novelty, there was no word to be borrowed from Classical Latin. For the history of the term dormitorium, we refer to the discussion in the Glossary, below, s.v. VERSE With regard to the meters found in the Plan, Charles W. Jones remarks: "The captions include four elegaic distychs58 58 On the entrance road, the cemetery cross, north and south of the cross, and between the columns of the church. and thirty-five hexameters.59 59 The Petrus caption in the western apse of the Church and the caption in the toolshed of the Gardener's House look as if they might be hexameters, but they are not. Although of scholastic regularity, they are not pedantically so. In the ninth century, as Leonine rhymed hexameters were gaining favor, the uniform caesura in the third foot became increasingly standardized. But among the thirty-five hexameters there are three hephthemimeral caesuras, and no Leonine verses.60 60 See Dag Norberg, "Introduction a l'étude de la versification latine médiévale", Studia Latina Stockholmienses, 1958, 65. Indeed, there are touches of liveliness. The concluding dactyls of the line on threshing (frugibus hic instat cunctis labor excutiendis)61 61 Cf. below, p. 64, and II, 215. tend to match the rhythm of the labor itself. And as Miss Patricia Clark points out, the most artful verses are the two set in the semi-circular paradises of the church, which she diagrams as follows on the next page: &amp;#x272b; alliteration of p and s It is natural to try to explain the presence of verses in this utilitarian Plan as essentially mnemonic; but such an explanation would be unsatisfactory. No supervising abbot or brother would find any of the common mnemonic aids in these lines. They are, rather, the product of an artist who is taking joy in his work of art." We have already drawn attention to the fact that the metric lines are primarily used to designate the general purpose of a building. In order to make it clear that they define the whole and not part of the building, the author writes metric verse inscription not into the interior of houses or buildings, but places them outside in a position of prominence (analogous to chapter headings), parallel to and at a small distance from the entrance walls. There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule. Some of the smaller guest and service buildings lack these general titles (House of the Physicians, House for Bloodletting, Gardener's House, House of the Fowlkeepers). Conversely, in a few cases, metric titles are used internally in places where the signal importance of the object or area they describe calls for special emphasis. All such instances, except for one (Cross in the Cemetry) occur in the Church, where the inscriptions are associated with primary liturgical stations (Altar of the Holy Cross, Altar of St. Peter, Altar of St. Paul) or appear in buildings directly connected with the Church and vital for the regulation of the intercourse of the monastery with the outside world (the three porches of the western atrium that control entry and exit of the monastic compound). I can think of only one area in the whole aggregate of textual annotations where one would have wished for more explicit information. Modern scholarship would have been spared the pains and pleasures of hundreds of pages of controversy, had the widely spaced title in the longitudinal axis of the Church that reads "From East to West the length is 200 feet" included in its wording a hint that this was a directive given to alter the original concept, in which the church was intended to be 300 feet long.62 62 On the controversy that arose in connection with this title see I, 77-87. The decision to reduce the length of the Church from 300 feet to 200 feet—as the deposition of the abbot of Fulda shows63 63 For details see I, 187-90. —cannot have been entirely free from emotional undertones. One senses a reflection of this in a change of syntax, to which Bischoff has drawn attention: in contradistinction to all of the other legends of the Plan, which are rendered as straight declarative statements, the majority of the titles stipulating that the Church should not be built as large as was shown on the Plan, were put into imperative form (metire, moderare, sternito).64 64 See Bischoff in Studien, 1962, 77. VISUAL DISPLAY In certain places the scribe makes use of a bold capitalis rustica rather than the delicate minuscule in which the majority of the textual annotations are written. Here again he proceeds with discretion. Only buildings or areas that rank high in the architectural ecology of the monastery are singled out for this distinction. Capitalized titles occur in ten places; five of them in the context of the church: the widely spaced axial title that defines what its length should be; a hexameter that defines the function of the presbytery; two hexameters in the western, and one in the eastern atrium. Outside of the church capitalis rustica is found in the following places: In the bold meter that explains the function of the road of access to church and monastery; in the word ECCLESIA written along the axis of the building that contains the chapels for the novices and the sick; in the word HORTUS inscribed into the outer paths of the Monks' Vegetable Garden (in widely spaced letters); and in the two hexameters that explain the purpose of the two circular enclosures for the hens and the geese. The choice of capitals for designating the Monks' Vegetable Garden and the enclosures for hens and geese is perhaps a little surprising. In the two latter cases one might suspect that the scribe, faced with two magnificently free circular spaces exuberantly let himself go. But in the case of the Monks' Vegetable Garden the use of capitals could not have been motivated by the same reason, since the space available there is poorly suited to an inscription in capital letters. Might the emphasis in both cases have something to do with the important place the produce of the garden and of the chicken yard held in the monks' diet, and the fact that the flesh of chicken was the only meat of any living creature except fish permitted on the monks' table?65 65 On the monks' diet see I, 275-79. STYLE OF WRITING AND OTHER PALAEOGRAPHICAL DETAILS It was to Bernhard Bischoff's credit that he established that the explanatory titles of the Plan were written in the scriptorium of the monastery of Reichenau66 66 See Bischoff, op. cit., and I, 13-14. —a discovery of crucial importance for the evaluation of the historical context in which the Plan was copied, and for the identification of the persons who were involved in this task.67 67 On the problem of authorship see I, 11-13. Bischoff distinguished two hands: the hand of a young scribe ("main scribe") who wrote the majority of the explanatory titles (265 out of the total of 341, as well as the ten titles written in capital letters) and the hand of an older man who played the role of supervisor or corrector (writer of the remaining 66 titles). Bischoff defines their respective share in the inscriptions as follows: MAIN SCRIBE He is responsible for the letter of transmission, all of the titles written in capitalis rustica, and the majority of the other titles. Most of these titles are written in dark brown ink. The main scribe, Bischoff points out, writes in a crisp and delicate Carolingian minuscule of a kind that was common among younger Carolingian scribes. His style of writing has a slightly insular touch and discloses clearly that he was not trained in the Alamannic tradition of St. Gall and of the monastery of Reichenau. Certain peculiarities of his script suggest that before joining the scriptorium of Reichenau, he spent some time in the abbey of Fulda. The particulars of his writing Bischoff defines as follows: "He writes vertically and places his letters closely. The letters a and d appear in two variations, on one hand in their closed Carolingian form (at the end of the word on occasion terminating with a sharp upstroke), on the other hand open, with two points, more closely corresponding to the insular tradition, although the latter is usually smaller. A long d alternates with a round d. In the g both arcs are closed; z rises above the letters of intermediate length, and begins and ends with an almost horizontal stroke. Favorite ligatures are the letter combinations ct, en, er, et, rt; and l, n, t when followed by an i. His favored abbreviations are: um (a simple r or the ligature -or with cross stroke; -us (dom'); also -ur (recitat') and insular symbols for est and id est.68 68 See Bischoff, op. cit., 70. SECOND SCRIBE From his hand are the plant designations in the Medicinal Herb Garden and in the Monks' Vegetable Garden, the tree designations in the Orchard, and all of the inscriptions associated with the altars in the aisles of the church and in the towers; furthermore, the additions infra and supra tabulatum in the House for Horses and Oxen, the supra camera et solarium in the Abbot's House, as well as the words pausatio procuratoris (over erasure) in the lodging of the Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. Most of the titles of the second scribe are written in a light brown ink that did not retain its original freshness as well as did the darker ink used by the main scribe. Of him, Bischoff says: "The second scribe, likewise, `writes vertically,' but with relatively short ascenders and a certain trend toward loose but regular distribution. In the alphabet he employs only the cc-a; the d is always straight. The shaft of the f begins with a curved upstroke, occasionally even the shaft of the s; g is always open at the bottom. Favorite ligatures are ar (martini), ect, em, ere, ex, and others; fra (a open), and re. These forms, especially the ligature fra as well as the delicate uniform ductus of the script are closely related to that late fine style of Alamanic writing, of which the librarian Reginbert of Reichenau (d. 846) availed himself certainly as one of its last masters"69 69 See Bischoff, op. cit., 69-70. The dynamics of the interaction of these two scribes, who worked in close cooperation, as well as their relationship to the high official for whom they performed their task, has been discussed in a previous chapter.70 70 See I, 13-14. For those among our readers to whom palaeography is a new adventure, we are adding a few remarks about the abbreviations used in the textual annotations of the Plan. THE MOST COMMON ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THE EXPLANATORY TITLES The nasal bar is the sign commonly used for letters left out. The bar appears both in the middle of a word and at the end. Almost always the omitted letters are readily supplied because the words are familiar. Examples: fr?n??tas, ec?l??e, nr??, sc?? sarcofag?, bibliothec?, dormitori?, for fraternitas, ecclesiae, nostri, sancti, sarcophagus, bibliothecam, and dormitorium. In a few instances, this sign is omitted through inadvertance. Examples: aucar??, analog??, sedend?, c?, mandat??, earund?, seruant??, for aucarum, analogium, sedendum, cum, mandatum, earundem, seruantium. A bar through the descender of the letter p stands for per and pre. Examples: semp, sup, pscrutinanda, pparanda, for semper, super, perscrutinanda and preparanda. A bar through the ascender of the letter b appears only once on the Plan, viz. in the dedicatory legend, in the name of Abbot Gozbert: coz&amp;#x0180;te for cozberte. A period after the letter q indicates that the letters ue have been dropped. Examples: utcumq·, atq·, quoq·, for utcumque, atque, and quoque. A cross-stroked 1 stands for uel. The ampersand stands for et. This sign is used both within and at the end of words as well as a symbol for the connecting word "and". Examples: st&amp;, exi&amp;, cohaer&amp;, col&amp;ur, seru&amp;ur, fa&amp;us for stet, exiet, cohaeret, coletur, seruetur, and faetus. This abbreviation survives in widespread use. A scattering of examples in current practice is included with the redrawn historic examples illustrated opposite. Completion of ending orum and (in one case) arum. This sign always occurs after or or ar of this ending. Examples: infirmorum, ferramentorum, porcariorum, pastorum, pigmentorum, eorum, tuarum for infirmorum, ferramentorum, porcariorum, pastorum, pigmentorum, eorum, tuarum. A period placed below a letter when it appears in conjunction with another letter placed above the line indicates that a correction has been made. Examples: caball&amp;#x0366;?rum, pauper&amp;#x0367;?m, bub&amp;#x0367;?s for caballorum, pauperum, and bubus. Occasionally the dot below the line is omitted. Examples: euangelacae, domum for euangeliacae and domus. A period placed on either side of a letter deletes that letter. Example: c?lo?cleam in the Tower of St. Michael. In the House of the Physicians on the other hand the first l of the misspelled word cubilulum is changed into a c by simply superimposing the latter on the former. A crescent-shaped apostrophe is used most frequently after a t, to supply the rest of the passive ending of a verb, such as ur. Examples: conficiat&amp;#x0357; and triturant&amp;#x0357; for conficiatur and trituratur. It also appears, but more rarely, to show that the letters us have been left off at the end of a word. Examples: camin&amp;#x0357; and dom&amp;#x0357; for caminus and domus. Id est, "that is to say". Example: horreum·?·repositio fructu? annali? for horreum id est repositio fructuum annalium. This symbol is always est alone. Example: domus communis scolae id÷uacationis for domus communis scolae id est uacationis. CAPRICIOUS ABBREVIATIONS There are, lastly, not to be overlooked (as Charles W. Jones reminds me) what Lindsay, in his Notae Latinae, pp. 415ff, calls "capricious abbreviations", e.g. dom for domus (Gardener's House —), necess for necessarium (Novitiate) and cub for cubilia (House of Coopers and Wheelwrights —). AMPERSANDS REDRAWN FROM VARIOUS SOURCES 524. VITA SANCTI BONIFATII. Karlsruhe BADISCHE LANDESBIBLIOTHEK (Codex Augiensis CXXXVI, fol. 14v) CAROLINE SCRIPT (9th century) The full-page illustration reveals the main features of the great script created in the period of Charlemagne, and further developed during the next two centuries. Unlike the great formal court bookhands of the time, it is a cursive writing, a running hand conditioned by economy and speed, with characteristics of both majuscule and minuscule. It is marked by broad and sweeping lines widely spaced, letter forms clearly defined and articulated, smooth flowing and finely proportioned to the page. Its slight slope (here, about 5° to 6°) was perquisite to the urgent quest for speed because, by this device, slight deviations from angle of tilt are scarcely detectible, as are deviations from the absolute verticality of formal writing, courtly and elegant. Still, and this is one of its salient features, an air of elegance dominates a page of finely executed Caroline script that betrays as myth the notion that a degree of speed is inconsistent, when clarity is fused with a great portion of beauty. Alcuin of York, in the years 781-790 at the court of Charlemagne, had been appointed to the enterprise of creating, directing, and disseminating a vast program of education, writing and learning throughout the empire. In 796 he was awarded the renowned abbey of St. Martin at Tours. Here as abbot and director of probably the greatest school of its day, Alcuin had ample time to pursue, till his death in 804, the minuscule and cursive style that is known as Caroline script. Later in Italy in the era of "New Learning" the Caroline script had decisive effect on writing, type design, and printing that lasts to this day. The italic type before the reader's eye is a direct derivative of that great writing. This legacy from Charlemagne is seen throughout the world in all countries that employ the roman-based letter. Its place in the history of civilization and learning is beyond appraisal. E. B. * 525. NOTE THE PLAN OF ST. GALL AS A SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION IN VOLUMES I AND II AND CATALOGUE OF INSCRIPTIONS FOLLOWING VOLUMES I AND II The Plan is shown in this work by two modes of illustration, tonal and line. Tonal illustrations, shown as details of the Plan, in most cases are in color and at the same size as the original, while line illustrations printed in black or in red, often with overlays of the opposite color, occur in several different degrees of reduction and represent the red line drawings of the original. Reproduction of the Plan by line The great Plan drawn on parchment survives in a remarkably good state as a document. In centering attention, at original size, on its prime visual feature, it will be observed that the red line drawing by which building and landscape features are delineated is interrupted in many parts by short breaks, rarely exceeding one or a few millimeters, where the ink has ceased to bond to the parchment. These imperfections posed no problem in reproduction at reduced dimensions. However, in certain parts the course of the red line drawing, although clearly in evidence in original dimensions, is too meager to record photographically a satisfactory printed image of the deteriorated condition of the drawing at reduced dimensions. Resort to correction was performed as follows. By good fortune, the firm of E. Löpfe-Benz of Rohrschach, when printing their important eight-color facsimile lithographic reproduction of the Plan of St. Gall in 1952, also printed a small over-run edition of the red key-plate for a few specialists, and their own use. This reproduction depicted the red line drawing of the Plan at original size stripped of all other subject matter. With a specimen of this key worksheet in our possession, which we obtained through the kindness of the late Hans Bessler, by careful photography, several precision prints were made on material of high dimensional stability and receptive to pen and ink for retouching. On one print all defective parts of the line drawing were corrected to yield a continuous line in all parts of the Plan, alterations being restricted only to supplying in full strength those areas where the ink had deteriorated or ceased to bond, but where unmistakable traces of its original course were in clear evidence. When reduced to exactly one-fourth original size, the print happily yielded an image satisfactory for reproduction in printing. For greater reduction than one-fourth original size, prints as described above required line widths to be retouched two times and in a few cases, were retouched three times line width (1/10 × s, example, ill. I.xx). Since the printed images at reduced size serve schematically or diagrammatically, sometimes as red base color for a black overprinting, the often ugly implications or connotation of "alteration" vanish. When the reader seeks a degree of authenticity in the study of the delineation of the Plan drawing he may turn to color reproductions shown original size in Volumes I and II, or the following Catalogue. Tonal Illustrations in Color The tonal illustrations in color in this work are derived from the splendid facsimile eight-color reproduction of the Plan of St. Gall printed in 1952,* * As previously noted, it was produced under the auspices of the Historische Verein des Kantons St. Gallen, on the initiative and under the supervision of Dr. Johannes Duft and the late Hans Bessler. which portrays the great document in a high degree of fidelity to the original that would be difficult to surpass. The procedure of derivation is accomplished by means of the "optical color scanner," an instrument of photo-computer antecedents, and available commercially only recently for application in the printing arts. At the outset the hope of the authors had been to negotiate with the eminent Swiss firm who printed the eight-color facsimile lithographic edition in some scheme, one perhaps by which their color film or master negatives could be made available. On learning these no longer existed and furthermore knowing of the current ban on photographing the original parchment because of the deleterious effect of strong lighting used in photographic procedure, there was no alternative except to resort to the use of the scanner and a copy of the facsimile reproduction. A facsimile negative (probably on blue-sensitive film) in our possession, provided us by Dr. Duft, was invaluable for reference but proved of little use as a technical instrument since the stained areas of the parchment printed as great black spaces lacking in detail. In color photography screening and dexterous technical manipulation can correct for this condition, as is evidenced on inspection of the facsimile Plan. THE CATALOGUE OF INSCRIPTIONS The remarks on certain problems of reproduction for printing in line when drastic reduction in the dimensions of the image occurs, do not apply to the color reproductions at the same size as the original. To some extent they apply also to color reproduction at reduced scale but except for one instance (frontispiece, fig. 1.X, I.xxviii) that was not a problem in this work. Enlargement does offer grave problems, particularly when the original document to be copied (called "the copy") has been "screened." The source from which the Plan illustrations were scanned was screened copy. Thus, in the reproductions of the following Catalogue, a high degree of printing technology, long experience, great expertise, and close supervision with precise dot control are involved. By tests and experimentation the use of one black plus two colors was found to yield an image of visual quality adequate for the purpose of this work. The greater degree of authenticity exemplified in high fidelity facsimile printing with explicit veracity was not economically feasible nor even appropriate in a work concerned with planning development and architecture more than with great arts ancillary to it.

By the same token the interstices of the nave columns should have been 20, not 12 feet as postulated in its intercolumnar titles (10, 11). The incompatibility of these figures and the rendering of the drawing itself has haunted a hundred years of scholarship. The conclusion that the Plan was not drawn to scale was firmly held until Bockelmann suggested, and the present authors now state, that incompatibilities between drawing and titles expressed a change in thought about the desired length of the Church that developed later than the completion of the drawing (for historical overview and detailed discussion see I, 77-104). NOTE Small black circles with numbers refer to locations shown on the Plan, page 20. AISLES 12 NORTH AISLE Titles for these two altars were written by the supervising scribe.

The furniture arrangement and a door on the north wall suggest strongly the former presence of a door in the Church wall, since this would permit the most direct access to the Outer School for students who pass the Porter's station (see I.f, next page). The alternate route, circuitous, seems unlikely—walking the full length of the Church, across the north transept, through the quarters for visiting monks, then into the school yard to the school. I e THE LODGING OF THE PORTER IN THE EAST SPACE IN THE WEST SPACE I f PORCH GIVING ACCESS TO HOUSE OF DISTINGUISHED GUESTS &amp; TO OUTER SCHOOL If: The first half of this hexameter was written by the supervising scribe, the second half by the main scribe. On their interaction see I, 13-14. I g PORCH FOR RECEPTION OF ALL VISITORS TO THE MONASTERY Ig: The word HABEBIT was partially covered by the overlapping margin of sheet 5 when the latter was attached to sheet 1. The inscriptions on the latter, therefore, must have been completed before the two were joined (cf. I, 35-50). I h PORCH GIVING ACCESS TO THE QUARTERS OF THE SERFS AND TO THE HOSPICE I i LODGING OF THE MASTER OF THE HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS I j THE MONKS' PARLOR I k THE TOWER OF ST. MICHAEL Ik: The inscriptions in the two towers are from the hand of the supervising scribe and very characteristic of his style. Strangely enough the titles in the outer ring of the spiral are rendered in the dark brown ink of the main scribe, and were probably entered before the altar designations in the innermost rings. These are written in the pale brown ink of all other entries of the supervising scribe (and like them are difficult to decipher). I l THE TOWER OF ST.

As in all similar matters, St. Benedict took a tolerant stand (see I, 262-67). 6 THE MONKS' REFECTORY AND VESTIARY ABOVE IT 6.1 IN THE CLOISTER WALK ADJACENT TO THE REFECTORY (SEE SITE PLAN PAGE 81) 6.2 THE CENTRAL PART OF THE REFECTORY For facsimile plan see I, 263. 6.2.1 READERS LECTERN 6.2.2 IN FRONT OF THE LECTERN 6.2.3 ON THE VISITORS' TABLE * 6.2: The design of the Refectory entrance is unique on the Plan.

In the Bakery of the House for Distinguished Guests (10:3) it is used to designate a baking oven. For facsimile plan see I, 263. 9 THE MONKS' BAKE AND BREWHOUSE 9.1 ON THE ENTRANCE SIDE OF THE HOUSE (EXTERIOR) * 9.2 IN THE AISLE FACING THE KITCHEN * 9.3 IN THE BREWERY 9.2.1 ON THE NORTH SIDE 9.3.2 IN THE SOUTH AISLE 9.4 IN THE BAKERY 9.4.1 9.4.2 IN THE SOUTH AISLE * For an outline plan, size of original, 1:192, see II, 138. 9.4.3 IN THE EAST AISLE OF THE BAKE &amp; BREW HOUSE 9.4: The drawing fails to show access from the bakery to the lean-to where flour is stored, or to the aisle which contains the kneading trough. This is among the few genuine oversights of the drafter of the Plan. See I, 61-66 on rendering of doors, and I, 65-73 on oversights. 10 KITCHEN, BAKE, AND BREW HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS 10.1 IN THE KITCHEN 10.2 IN THE LARDER 10.3 IN THE MAIN ROOM OF THE BAKERY 10.4 IN THE MAIN ROOM OF THE BREWERY 10.5 IN THE SOUTH AISLE OF THE BAKERY 10.6 IN THE SOUTH AISLE OF THE BREWERY For facsimile color plan see II, 144. For author's interpretation see II, 154. The original form of this not easily readable word, as written by the main scribe, appears to have been intriuendae, a gerundive form mistakenly formed from the perfect stem (intrivi) of the verb interere instead of from its present stem (intero). The supervising scribe discovered and corrected this faulty conjunction by striking out the letters riu and replacing them above the line by the letters er. I am indebted to my colleague Charles E. Murgia both for the palaeographical and grammatical interpretation of this title. The verb interere, literally `to bruise' or `to crumble' is commonly used in Classical Latin to designate the process of transforming small broken-up substances (such as grain ground into flour) into a pap or paste by mixing them with water or some other liquid. See Lewis and Short, Classical Dictionary and Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, s.v.—W.H. 11 THE HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS 11.1 ALONG THE ENTRANCE SIDE This building, too, serves for the reception of guests 11.2 IN THE SOUTHERN AISLE 11.2.1 EASTERLY AREA 11.2.2 IN THE CENTRAL AREA 11.2.3 WESTERLY AREA 11.3 IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL * * For facsimile color plan see II, 144. For authors' interpretation see II, 146. 11.3 IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL 11.3.1 IN THE EAST SIDE (ON EACH SIDE OF A DOORWAY) 11.3.2 IN THE CENTER SQUARE 11.3.2: Among the guest and service structures of the Plan, this is the only one in which the large square at the center of the house is termed LOCUS FOCI. In two other houses the similar square is termed TESTO (see above, 12.2, 1, 2, and below, 31.4.1). The two terms are crucial for identification of the building type (see II, 117-18). 11.3.3 NORTH OF THE FIRE PLACE 11.3.4 ON THE TABLE * 11.4 IN THE NORTH AISLE 11.4.1 IN THE EAST AND IN THE WEST SPACES 11.4.2 TO THE NORTH OF EACH OF THESE SPACES * 11.5 IN THE CHAMBERS FOR THE GUESTS UNDER THE LEAN-TO'S 11.5.1 IN THE EAST SIDE OF THE PRINCIPAL HALL For the multivalence of the term CAMINATA, here meaning heatable room, elsewhere meaning corner fireplace (Abbot's House, 13-4, below, p. 50) see II, 123ff. * 11.5.2 IN THE WEST SIDE OF THE PRINCIPAL HALL 11.6 IN THE PRIVY * 12 THE OUTER SCHOOL 12.1 ALONG THE ENTRANCE SIDE For facsimile color plan see II, 169.

The titles SUPER CAMERA, ET SOLARIUM, were added by the supervising scribe. The word DORMITORIUM, located in the center of the space it defines, suggests that the main scribe did not yet realize the necessity for a second title below it. He must have become aware of that need before he wrote the title MANSIO ABBATIS. Its position in the eastern half of the room suggests that a second title was to follow in a corresponding position in its western half. (A similar condition exists in the House for Horses and Oxen, 33.2, 33.7). ‡ The term CAMINATA written into the ovoid symbols in the contiguous corners of these two rooms is crucial for their interpretation as corner fireplaces. There are many of them on the Plan, but only in facilities for high ranking monastic officials or guests (see I.c, d, e, i, w, 11, 13, 17.c, d, 20). For the use of CAMINATA as "heatable room" see comments to the House for Distinguished Guests, 11. 13.4.4 ON EACH SIDE OF ENTRANCE TO CHURCH 13.4.5 ON EACH SIDE OF THE SITTING ROOM 13.5 IN THE PRIVY 14 KITCHEN, CELLAR, AND BATH HOUSE OF THE ABBOT 14.1 IN THE EAST AISLE 14.2 THE MAIN HOUSE IS DIVIDED INTO THESE PARTS ON THE WEST SIDE 14.1.1 14.2.2 14.2.3 15.

For authors' interpretation see II, 184.X, 185.X. 16 THE HOUSE OF THE PHYSICIANS 16.1 IN THE MAIN ROOM (ENTERED ON THE SOUTH SIDE) 16.2 IN THE WESTERN AISLE 16.3 IN THE EASTERN AISLE 16.4 IN THE LEAN-TO ON THE NORTH 16.1: The plural form of the title, DOMUS MEDICORUM, makes it clear that this house accommodated more than one physician working under a chief physician, who had his own living room occupying the entire eastern aisle of the house (16.3) and furnished with a corner fireplace. 16.2: The bedroom for critically ill in the opposite aisle, also with corner fireplace, must have been used for care of the monastery's serfs and workmen, since novices, ill, or dying, were cared for in the Novitiate (17.c) and Monks' Infirmary (18.d). For facsimile color plan see II, 171. For authors' interpretation see II, 179, 180. 17 THE NOVITIATE AND THE INFIRMARY ALONG THE AXIS OF THE DOUBLE CHAPEL, 17.a &amp; 17.b, READING FROM EAST TO WEST 17.b THE CHAPEL FOR THE SICK 17.a THE CHAPEL FOR THE NOVICES (AT ENTRANCE TO CHAPEL FROM CLOISTER WALK FOR NOVICES) NOTE benches opposite, in east apse and at altar below, are not identified by inscriptions For plan, scale 1:384, see I, 288. For authors' interpretation see I, 302. 17.c THE NOVITIATE 17.c.1 IN THE CLOISTER YARD OF THE NOVITIATE, SOUTH OF THE CHAPEL * 17.c.2 IN THE CLOISTER WALKS BEGINNING ON THE WEST IN THE ARCADE, READING CLOCKWISE * 17.c.1: One notices that the scribe rotated the parchment counter-clockwise as he wrote the inscription (PORTICUS) in the four sides of the south cloister walk; whereas in the north cloister walk (17.d.2) the inscription is written from a position on the east looking west. The inscriptions in the open space of the cloister, in both cases, are written from this same position. 17.c.3 IN THE WEST WING, SOUTH PART * See note under 17.d.3, page 58. * 17.c.4 IN THE SOUTH WING 17.c.4.1 IN THE WEST SPACE 17.c.4.2 IN THE EXTENSION TO THE SOUTH 17.c.4.3 IN THE EAST SPACE * 17.c.5 IN THE EAST WING, SOUTH PART * 17.d THE INFIRMARY 17.d.1 IN THE CLOISTER YARD OF THE INFIRMARY 17.d.2 IN THE CLOISTER WALKS Beginning on the west in the arcade reading clockwise into the north arcade, hence to the south arcade, then counterclockwise to the east arcade‡ ‡ 17.d.2: An alternative arrangement in the writing of this inscription, to the clockwise arrangement shown in 17.c.2, is amusing and probably issues from the scribes' desire to escape from what was at times a boring task, no doubt. Even a change in letter sequence was an imaginative variant to the day's toil. See I, 155. * 17.d.3 IN THE WEST WING, NORTH PART * 17.d.4 IN THE NORTH WING 17.d.4.1 IN THE WEST PORTION 17.d.4.2 IN THE EAST PORTION The corner fireplace in each room is unidentified by an inscription. Access to each room is from the arcaded cloister walks, 17.c.2 * ‡ Refectorium is written with a capital R in the north part of the west wing, whereas in the corresponding space of the south wing, 17.c.5, spelling is with a minuscule. The word Camera in both locations is capitalized. 17.d.5 IN THE EAST WING, NORTH PART 17.d.5: The three protrusions to the east of the north part of the east wing are not identified by written inscriptions, although dormitory and warming room are identified in both the north and south parts (cf. 17.c.3, p. 55). Corresponding features in the Novitiate (17.c.5) are identified: CAMINATUS, EXITUS FUMI, NECESSARIUM. 18 THE KITCHEN AND BATH FOR THE SICK 18.1 IN THE SOUTH HALF OF THE BUILDING 18.2 IN THE NORTH HALF OF THE BUILDING 19 THE KITCHEN AND BATH FOR THE NOVICES 19.1 IN THE SOUTH HALF OF THE BUILDING 19.2 IN THE NORTH HALF OF THE BUILDING * Letters in brackets are supplied.

Easily understood is its use in the entrance road to the Church (I, 128), in the Presbytery (I, 139), in the eastern Paradise (I, 155), on the west atrium, on the longitudinal axis of the Church (I, 128), and in the chapels of the Novitiate (I, 311). That capitalis rustica was used to identify the houses for poultry (II, 268), and for the Monks' Vegetable Garden (II, 203), touches the student of the Plan with some wonder. While the letters in the Monks' Vegetable Garden are so small and widely spaced as to almost escape notice, in the Goosehouse capitalis rustica is used in the largest size and most elegant display found in the Plan. The chicken house is honored with a similar display but with smaller letters. * WRITTEN CLOCKWISE IN THE CIRCULAR GOOSE RUN BEGINNING ON THE WEST SIDE AND ADJACENT TO THE POINT OF ENTRY. BUILDING 21 AND 23: The circles of the Goosehouse and the Henhouse are neither continuous nor accurate enough to be compass drawn, but too accurate to have been drawn freehand. As no auxiliary work lines are to be discovered on the parchment, we have assumed (I, 15-19) that the circles were traced, a principal argument in our contention that the Plan as a whole is not an original drawing but a traced copy. Among other circles similarly treated, the most important are those of the ambo and the baptismal font in the Church (1.2 and 1.5). For facsimile size plan see II, 265. 22 THE HOUSE OF THE FOWLKEEPERS 22.2 IN THE NORTH AISLE * 22.1 IN THE MAIN ROOM * 22.3 IN THE SOUTH HALL ‡ One curious feature of the design is that the east-west axis of the circle, more or less parallel with the east-west axis of the Church, and the north-south axis of the circle parallel to the axis of the transept, do not coincide with any of the lobes of the system of lobe axis, but instead fall between four pairs of lobes. For facsimile size plan see II, 265. For authors' interpretation see II, 258, 260, 262. 23 THE HENHOUSE ENTRANCE TO THE HEN RUN The entrance to the hen run is on axis with the entrance to the goose run and the two entrances of the main room of the Fowlkeeper's House, 22. Within the circle of the hen run the inscription of 38 letters is more spaciously composed than the inscription of 48 letters within the circle of the goose run. Capitalis rustica, written to a curve of circular configuration occurs in only two other places in the Plan, in the eastern Paradise and in the western Paradise with its adjacent arcade. An eight lobed ornamental rosette occurs in a central position in each poultry house. A similar, but smaller, pair of eight lobed rosettes occurs in a central position in the tower of St. Michael and in the tower of St. Gabriel (building numbers I.k and I.l, page 35). These four are the only rosettes in the Plan. Located on axes of opposing direction, these four rosettes—the sacred four—compose, in the mind, a sacred cross. Is the drawing of an eight-lobed rosette in the center of goose and hen houses of any symbolic significance at this location? Or is it simply a pretty decoration and a convenient ornament to compose in a circle? These are difficult questions to resolve. Apparently the scribe chose not to use the six-lobed configuration, more common, no doubt; because of the great facility with which the "hex" configuration is constructed with a compass. A case for possible apotropaic implications is made, I, 131. * WRITTEN CLOCKWISE IN THE CHICKEN RUN BEGINNING ON THE EAST ADJACENT TO AND STARTING ON THE LEFT OF THE POINT OF ENTRY IN TO THE RUNWAY (an arrangement identical to that of the Goosehouse) For facsimile color plan see I, 20 and II, 265.

INFRA in the same line, and SUPRA TABULATUM beneath it were added by the supervising scribe. In the ox stables (33.5) all corresponding lines are written by the main scribe. The location of STABULUM EQUORUM very low in its space suggests that the scribe was not yet aware that it would be followed by another line—a situation similar to that observed in the Abbot's House (13). This oversight must have been discovered by the supervising scribe before the corresponding titles in the ox stables were written, for these appear with ample room for the lower inscription. IN THE MAIN SPACE OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE BUILDING * 33.3 IN THE WEST AISLE, NORTHERN PART OF THE BUILDING * 33.4 ALONG THE ENTRANCE SIDE OF THE BUILDING ON THE EAST 33.5‡ ‡ 33.5: The rectangular configuration in the central area is unique among graphic treatments drawn in similar spaces throughout the plan. An outer rectangle measuring more than 12 feet by 16 feet frames a smaller rectangle of peculiar design. If the outer rectangle represents the boundary of a hearth, the inner rectangle with one pair of parallel projecting sides cannot be interpreted as a piece of cooking or kitchen gear since it would be inaccessible, being over a hot fire below. If the line of the outer rectangle is interpreted to define the edge of a paved area of kitchen space the inner rectangle can be construed to be a hearth or fire area with some kind of cooking or utensil rig suspended above it, possibly of controllable height. Certainly a typical hearth is not shown, nor is it a stove of some sophistication such as are found in the kitchens for monks or nobles. The delineation piques the imagination. (See text, I, 74-75).

MARTIN, which a monk of the twelfth century wrote on the back of the Plan and spilled over onto the recto, when the verso was taken up by his writing. An attempt made early in the nineteenth century to revive the inscriptions through chemical treatment destroyed them forever. More recent efforts (1949) to make them legible with the aid of X-ray and infra-red photography brought no clarity into the matter (page II, 159). The distribution of blue streaks left on the parchment by the chemical employed discloses that the house was originally provided with a long title, running parallel to the entrance side, unquestionably defining the function of the building, as is done by titles similarly placed in other buildings. Shorter blue blotches visible in the interior of the building reveal the location of other titles once designating the purpose of the component interior spaces. Of the line work of the house itself enough is left to disclose that it consisted of a great central hall with an open fireplace and a complete perimeter of outer rooms ranged symmetrically around it. It differed from the general run of houses of this type by its gigantic dimensions (100 feet long and 80 feet wide) as well as the fact that its (only!) entrance was located not in the center of one of its long walls, but in the middle of one of its two shorter walls. As in all of the other houses of this construction type the peripheral rooms are accessible from the center space exclusively, and every man or beast, to reach his place of rest in any of these outer rooms, would have to be channeled through this center space, which can in turn only be entered through a vestibule located in the middle of the aisle that runs along the entrance side of the house. We have set forth, in our textual discussion of this structure (Vol. II, pp. 166ff), the reasons why we presume that it served as a House for the Vassals and Knights who travelled in the Emperor's Court.

In eleven other houses, DOMUS refers to the central hall. This common living space is variously called DOMUS COMMUNIS (12.2, 22.1) and IPSA DOMUS (20.2, 35.3), or by the name or occupation of those inhabiting the buildings (16.1, 25.4, 31.4, 38.3, 39.3, 40.3). A typical example, DOMUS ARMENTARIORUM (37.3), is shown on the next page. The absence of an inscription in the main or central area of this type of building in the Plan is most exceptional. 36.2 TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE ON THE EAST 36.3 in the U-shaped area, north, west, and south of the main room (written counter-clockwise) For facsimile color plan see II, 244.

On the basis of precedent it might be argued that the purpose of these unidentified areas was self evident (storage, stables, sleeping quarters) since the chief function of the house was known by its explanatory title. But sophisticated architectural perceptions typical of the Plan's least details are not elsewhere left to subjective interpretation. It may be more accurate to infer that when the Plan was traced some question still remained open as to final determination of the specific disposition of these areas; hence specific designation was omitted. 38.2 IN THE EAST AISLE TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING For facsimile color plan see II, 156. For authors' interpretation see II, 157. 38.3 IN THE MAIN HALL 39 THE HOUSE FOR SWINE AND SWINEHERDS 39.1 ALONG THE ENTRANCE SIDE ON THE EAST 39: In building 38, the unlabeled U-shaped area around the central hall can only have served as a dormitory strewn with pallets for repose, and heaps of travellers' trappings—or perhaps, if the servants were so lucky as to be mounted, with harness tack and the mounts themselves. In the House for Swine and Swineherds, herdsmen's sleeping quarters are designated on the east side (cf. guardians' quarters, building 38). The unlabeled areas were likely intended to shelter swine. But absence of drawing (cf. ox stalls, building 33) or inscriptions may indicate that the kind of pen to be installed for pigs was not determined when the Plan was traced. Sole access to the inner spaces of the buildings lay through the vestibule (center, east side). Swine herded to their pens would have to pass right through the herders' quarters, certainly a very social arrangement and highly nondiscriminatory. 39.2 IN THE EAST AISLE TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE VESTIBULE For facsimile color plan see II, 296.

Arches giving access to the yard occur in groups of four. On each side of the four principal arches are four small arches rising from plinths. From each of the four principal arches a path extends to what appears to be a square planting bed in which four junipers emerge radially from an inner circular bed. The stress on four is emphatic. The graphic delineation of a cross in the layout of the yard is unmistakable. For facsimile color plan of CLOISTER see I, 257.

Nine of these have been treated with the same chemical substances which obliterated the titles of the large building in the northwest corner of the monastery site, but these are still legible. Two other chemical blotches along the north side of the corner trees on the entrance side of the Cemetery suggest that there may have been titles for two additional species, no longer identifiable today. Keller believed he recognized the letters mal and r and reconstructed these words as malarius (apple) and pinus (pine). The names of trees in Orchard and plants in Medicinal Herb Garden (p. 88) were written by the supervising scribe. * Because the camera supported by photographic processes can reveal matter unseen by the unaided eye, an examination was made of the facsimile negative of the Plan which we were permitted to use in the preparation of this study (see note preceding the List of Illustrations, page xi). We confirm, in part, Keller's observation: the letter "m" is clearly visible in the negative; the second letter, somewhat less clear, is still evident as an "a".

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX II THE CUSTOMS OF CORBIE 527. THE "CORBIE PSALTER," INITIAL LETTER CORBIE PSALTER (CA. 800) AMIENS 18, fol. Iv The script of the psalter is that of the Maurdramnus Bible, the embryonic Carolingian minuscule, possibly derived from North Italian uncial. Since the many designs in the codex betray direct dependence on Byzantium, Jean Porcher (Karl der Grosse III, 59-60; ill. p. 69 fig. 7) surmises that the artist came from the Greek colony of Ostia near Rome to Picardy in the company of another Greek, George, who became Bishop of Amiens, 769-798. * The CUSTOMS OF CORBIE CONSUETUDINES CORBEIENSES A translation by CHARLES W. JONES of THE DIRECTIVES OF ADALHARD OF CORBIE [753-826] PREFACE TO include in a book on the Plan of St. Gall a translation of Adalhard's Consuetudines Corbeienses hardly calls for justification. The two documents have much in common. Both are examples of a type of ordinance that in the Middle Ages were referred to as brevia, i.e., "briefs"—a designation which in modern general (and distinct from legal) parlance is more appropriately rendered by the term "directives." Such administrative ordinances were intended to make regular and generally uniform the usages and practices (consuetudines, i.e., "customs") of a given institution. The Plan of St. Gall delineates in the graphic language of the architect the aggregate of buildings of which an exemplary Carolingian monastery should be composed, the manner in which they are to relate to one another, and how they should be arranged internally. In a comparable manner, the Directives of Adalhard of Corbie set forth in the form of a body of managerial directives what measures should be taken by the heads of the monastery's various economic departments in order to guarantee an even and unfailing flow of food supplies and other material necessities for the physical sustenance of life in the abbey of Corbie. One could not conceive of two mutually more elucidating historical sources. It is therefore with gratitude that I accept for inclusion in this book Charles W. Jones's masterful translation of this unique and important document. It will be a valuable source of information for those who cannot read it in its original language and of more than casual interest to those who are aware of the (in places exasperating!) difficulties of interpretation presented by medieval texts of this nature. Jones's translation of Adalhard's Directives is the first of this treatise in any modern language, so far as we know, and we hope to make it available in the near future for broader distribution by means of a separate, more easily accessible edition. More than one hundred and twenty years ago B. E. C. Guérard, one of the greatest students of the Age of Charlemagne, recognizing the need for translations of primary sources of this type published a French version of another important managerial treatise of the period, the famous Capitulare de Villis (q.v.), and thus made the subject of the management of royal desmesnes available for study in a broad spectrum of neighboring disciplines. I have no doubt that Charles W. Jones's translation of the Customs of Corbie will have a similar effect in broadening our historical perspective of the monastic economy of the period. TWO WAYS TO SHARPEN A SWORD UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830) fol. 35v 528.A 528.B Utrecht University Library THE CIVILIZING ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE CAROLINGIAN DYNASTY CANNOT OBSCURE THE FACT THAT ITS POWER RESTED ON ITS PROWESS IN WAR; IT LOST THAT POWER WHEN IT CEASED TO BE CAPABLE OF ANSWERING VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE. Jean Porcher, The Carolingian Renaissance, p. 4 Sharpening by grindstone and whetstone may in fact show two stages, rough edge, to finished, of one process. Fabrication and maintenance of arms were tasks of major monastic centers, indicating their active military role. The Plan provides such facilities (below, p. 65). This illustration is for verses 2-4 of Psalm LXIII (64): "Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked . . . who whet their tongues like a sword . . . ." * WALTER HORN INTRODUCTION By CHARLES W. JONES THE year 822 is red-letter in the history of Corbie, of its ninth abbot Adalhard (753-826), and of the Emperor Louis I. Although at Adalhard's request Louis renewed and extended the privileges of Corbie (Addendum I, 124; 100 fig. 530) the moment Charlemagne had died, in the same year he banished Adalhard to the island of Noirmoutier (dépt. Vendée), off the mouth of the Loire. Then, in a mercurial shift of policy, Louis restored him in the year 821. Though the reasons for both the banishment1 1 "Factum est, ut sine accusatore, sine congressu, necnon sine audientia atque sine iudicio iustitia plecteretur in eo." Vita Sancti Adalhardi . . . Radberto ix, 30 (Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. II, 1828, 527; Acta Sanctorum 1863, 101). Cf. Anonymi Vita Hludowici, 19 (Pat. Lat. CIV, 941B-C). Levillain, 1902, 199-200, would extend Louis's rancor against Adalhard back to Charlemagne's difficulties with Gerberga, wife of Carloman. At all events, as he notes, endowments declined at Corbie during Charlemagne's rule. Noirmoutier (Hero), like St. Michel, Lindisfarne, and other offshore retreats, is a peninsula at low tide. Evidently Adalhard was accompanied by a considerable retinue, for at Noirmoutier he ordered Corbie companions to copy the Historia Tripertita (now Leningrad MS F v. 1, 11); according to Leslie Jones, 1947, 377, "Nearly every quaternion shows a change of scribe." This fact argues for his continual close knowledge of Corbie affairs during the exile. According to the lists of abbots of Corbie in 12th-century MSS, a second Adalhard, "the Younger," filled his post during exile, but the evidence is dubious (cf. Levillain, 1902, 93 and 317-19; Irminon, 1844, II, 338-39). and the amnesty are obscure, we may infer that Louis simply feared more intensely than did his father Adalhard's Italian sympathies and tried to break up the coterie around young king Bernhard. Such a coterie would have centered in Adalhard, the regent. With the stable Adalhard exiled, Bernhard unsuccessfully revolted against Louis, who ordered him blinded. Bernhard died in consequence. His death, together with the death (11 February 821) of Louis' close advisor, the monastic reformer Benedict of Aniane, deeply affected the emperor. Immediately he restored Adalhard, who inherited Benedict's influence. These actions affected the course of Carolingian institutions, whether on the Bodensee or on the Somme. When Adalhard left Noirmoutier, he returned to Corbie long enough to prepare the Directives during the month of January 822. Then he hastened on to Attigny, where Louis publicly humiliated himself as penance for his cruelty to Bernhard and doubtless for his mistreatment of Adalhard and his brother Wala.2 2 Annales regni Francorum, anno dcccxxii (ed. Kurze, Scriptores rerum Germanicarum, 1895, 158); Cambridge Medieval History III, 12. Ratpertus (Vita sancti Adalhardi xiii, 49) states that Adalhard was stricken with fever at Corbie, evidently at the time of composition of the Directives. According to Halphen, Attigny accentuated the religious bent of the imperial government. From that event, unity of faith became surrogate for unity of empire: one spoke of unity of empire and unity of church as equivalents. As all became subordinated to the cause of religion, the Church dominated the life of the state. "The men of the Church were consulted before all others; after the death of Benedict of Aniane, the bishops, abbot Adalhard of Corbie, his brother Wala the monk, made immediate impact on the emperor, who ended by seeing only by their eyes and doing only what they desired."3 3 Halphen, 1949, 249-50; Amann, 1947, 210-17; Folz, Le couronnement imperial de Charlemagne, 1964, 214-15. It would be uncritical to generalize from the single record of relations between Benedict of Aniane and Adalhard: "Contentio fuit inter Adalhardum et Benedictum" (Hafner, 1959, 140). The contention seems not to have centered in any fundamental policy, but only in human relations between zealot and diplomat. From Attigny Adalhard went on to Saxony. Long before, he had planned with Charlemagne to bring Christianity to heathen Saxony; but during his exile his successors had established Corbeia nova (Corvey) in an ill-favored site at Hethis. Adalhard now transferred it to a new site on the Weser at Höxter, where it soon became, as Hauck says, by far the most important convent in Saxony.4 4 Vita sancti Adalhardi, 16 (Acta sanctorum, 107). Helmut Wiesemeyer, "La fondation de l'abbaye de Corvey," Corbie abbaye royale, 105-33; see also Karl der Grosse, I, 472; II, 282, 286. In such ways did Adalhard influence the Carolingian social pattern for Italy and Germany as well as France. The English queen of Clovis II, Balthilde, had founded Corbie on royal demesne between 657 and 661, by transplanting Luxeuil monks, who subscribed to the Luxeuil use of the Rules of Columban and Benedict.5 5 Columban founded Luxeuil A.D. 590; the Benedictine Rule spread through Francia in the seventh century (Lesne, 1910-43, I, 379, 399). The Corbie "ab script" was especially cultivated under Adalhard; it was originally called "Lombardic," and confused with script from Bobbio, possibly because both scriptoria derived their form from Luxeuil. See Jones, 1947, 376-80; Françoise Gasparri in Scriptorium XX (1966), 265-72; Ooghe in Corbie abbaye royale, 1963, 267-68. Such traditions doubtless fortified the interest of both Adalhard and Wala in Lombardy. The Irish customs evaporated, leaving no trace in the Directives.6 6 But see Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 253. On the advance of Benedictinism under Charlemagne, consult Semmler in Karl der Grosse II, 255-89, esp. 262-67, 287. After Balthilde, the royal patronage continued: her son Clothaire III gave Corbie six other demesnes,7 7 Lesne, 1910-1943, I, 117, 122; Jones, 1947, 191. and five other Merovingian kings, as well as the Carolingian Pepin III and Charlemagne, are recorded patrons. Carolingian Corbie was a model of culture—not only affluent but learned. It was on the main road from Britain to Italy, an axis of Carolingian development. The brothers assembled an important library of classics, and copied more. Like St. Gall, it was rich in the works of English and Irish writers. Adalhard himself, while in exile, ordered a copy of the Tripartite History, which he then brought to Corbie; and Pope Eugenius II in 825 gave Corbie copies of the Hadrianic Antiphons, which made the abbey a center of Roman liturgical tradition.8 8 Jones, 1947, 196, but see Bischoff in Karl der Grosse II, 237-39; New Oxford History of Music II (1954), 100. "Probably Adalhard, the famous abbot of Corbie, should get the credit [for the Glossaria Ansileubi]; for apparently the compilation was made at Corbie in Adalhard's time. And what a huge compilation it is! (It fills, even with all our compression, over 600 printed octavo pages.) What a noble record of French learning in Charlemagne's time!"—Wallace Martin Lindsay in Bulletin DuCange, III, 1927, 97-98. An examination in computus administered to prospective teachers in A.D. 809 mentions Adalhardus venerabilis abbas as authority on lunar movements (Mon. Germ. Hist., Epistolae III, 1934, 569-72; Jones, 1963, 25). For Adalhard's central position in the Filioque controversy (Procession of the Holy Spirit) see the exposition of Henri Peltier in Corbie abbaye royale, 1963, 63-65, and references. For a discussion of Adalhard's literary activity as well as for the English tradition in the abbey, see W. Stack and H. Walther, Studien zur lat. Dichtung (Ehringabe f. Karl Strecker), Dresden, 1931, 18-21; Paul Bauters, Adalhard van Huise, Audenarde, 1965; Fr. Prinz, Frühes Monchtum im Frankenreich, Munich-Vienna, 1965, 521-23. The "Maurdramnus Bible"9 9 Parts are now Amiens MSS, B. M., 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and Paris MS. B.N., Lat. 13174 (E. A. Lowe, Codices Latini Antiquiores VI, 1953, No. 707; Scriptorium XX [1966], 265-72; Karl der Grosse, ed. Braunfels II, 186; No. 368 in Karl der Grosse [Catalogue], 209). The "Maurdramnus script" can be examined in Amiens MS. 18, "the Corbie Psalter." Maurdramnus was abbot A.D. 772-780 (Jones, 1947, 385); Ooghe in Corbie abbaye royale, 1963, 273-78 (both with facsimiles). has sometimes been called our first dated example of Caroline minuscule. The residents of Corbie were in large part noblemen.10 10 H. Fichtenau, The Carolingian Empire, 1957, 167, citing Ratpert, in Vita Sancti Adalhardi, col. 35. Ewig, Karl der Grosse, I, 166, calls it "Ausstattung männlicher Nebenlinien," and Notre-Dame de Soissons, a somewhat affiliated nunnery, "Ausstattungsgut weiblicher Angehöriger des Konighauses." Adalhard himself was a grandson of Charles Martel, and therefore first cousin to Charlemagne. No lesser Frank could rule so proud a house.11 11 Karl der Grosse, I, 163. See the genealogy of the Carolingian kings and of Adalhard's family, p. 127. Adalhard gave his patrimonial lands near Tournai and Audenarde to Corbie (Vita sancti Adalhardi, 8; Pat. Lat. CXX, 1512; Levillain, 1902, 247). He had been instructed in the palace school, inter palatii tirocinia, under the same masters as Charlemagne, cum terrarum principe magistris adhioitus.12 12 Ratpert, Vita sancti Adalhardi, 7 (Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. II, 525); Lesne, 1910-1943, V. 34. Ratpert's elegaic eclogue on Adalhard is in Mon. Germ. Hist., Poet. Lat., III, 45-51. After admission to Corbie, Adalhard spent a period at Monte Cassino (Vita, 3) where he may have first met Paul the Deacon, who later wrote: "Sooner a recidivous Rhine retrace its stream, / Sooner a bright Moselle flow backward to its source, / Than my love let escape from out of my heart / The dear, sweet, ever-cherished name of Adalhard. / Thou too, if thou wouldst bask in grace of Christ, / Through every hour be mindful of thy Paul." —Carmen xxvi (Mon. Germ. Hist., Poet. Lat. I, 62) His sister Guntrada was a lady-in-waiting at the court.13 13 Alcuin, whose nicknames for court companions are demonstrably meaningful (Karl der Grosse I, 43-46), called Guntrada "Eulalia" and Adalhard "Antonius." His brother Wala, his successor at Corbie, was also a regent, legate, and councillor.14 14 Another brother, Bernher, is known only as a monk at Lérins (Peltier in Corbie abbaye royale, 73), though we may guess that he was exiled there. Lérins, St. Honorat's great foundation, was reformed by agents of Benedict of Aniane ca. 800 (Karl der Grosse II, 260). A fifth child, Theodrada, a nun (Vita sancti Adalhardi, col. 61; Karl der Grosse I, 81) doubtless became abbess of the royal retreat, Notre-Dame de Soissons (Karl der Grosse I, 163, n. 164). Adalhard, who had arranged Charlemagne's betrothal to the Lombard princess Ermengarde, quit the court to become a monk when Charlemagne rejected her. But like his prototype, St. Anthony, he could not remain a recluse; his studious concern with both the theory and practice of managing men forbade it.15 15 There is some doubt whether Adalhard was involved with the Ermengarde affair (770) or Desiderius (771); Ratpert asserted the latter. See Èmile Amann, L'époque carolingienne, 1947, 52. Desiderius, after defeat, retired to Corbie (ibid., p. 57) where we may imagine that his association with Adalhard confirmed the latter's Italianate predilections. Archbishop Hincmar's Pro institutione Carlomanni regis (ed. M. Prou, Bibl. de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes 58, 1885) seems largely (cc. 13-36) copied from Adalhard's De ordine palatii (On the Structure of the Royal Court), a work of unknown date which has disappeared. Halphen, in Revue historique CLXXXIII, lff, and others, have doubted this ascription, but Fleckenstein in Karl der Grosse I, 33, lists the authorities; cf. Ganshof in Karl der Grosse I, 360, n. 77. Management of the temporalities of Corbie required worldly wisdom. The Directives specify twenty-seven villas16 16 Villa has no fixed meaning, but is comparable with parochia. A record of Teodrada's Notre-Dame de Soissons, of A.D. 858, equates the abbess's two villas with seventy-eight manses: "Abbatissae quoque pro opportunitate potestatis se praeparet, duas ei villas delegavimus servituras . . ., id est mansos lxxviii." See Lesne, 1910, 31n. This roughly accords with the data of the Polyptyque de l'abbé Irminon, ed. Guérard. "Mansi, agricultural holdings whose normal size in Northwestern Gaul was 10-18 hectares (25-48 acres)." François L. Ganshof, Feudalism (Torchbook ed.), 37. According to the Polyptyque, the lands of the abbey of St. Germain des Prés, ca. 815, were 35,012 to 38,141 square kilometers, and the number of individuals about 10,282; see Ferdinand Lot in Le moyen àge XXXII (1921), 10-11. in some form of tenure, but that number is far from exhaustive.17 17 "Very clearly then, the villas listed by Adalhard constituted the villae dominicae of Corbie, as opposed to villae constituting the beneficium of the vassi, often called villae beneficiatae in other abbeys." Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 235. For example, Corbie held substantial grants in newly conquered Saxony before the foundation of Corvey, to which some grants were transferred. It is known that Corbie also held villas in Alsace and the Rhineland.18 18 Weisemeyer, Corbie abbaye royale, 114; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 234. Carloman's Queen Gerberga gave some of these lands; see Levillain, Examen critique, 1902, 240. As with the portfolios of modern benevolent institutions, the holdings were diversified. Adalhard evidently considered his abbey as consisting of four concentric operations: 1, the cloister; 2, the compound, equivalent with the area visualized in the St. Gall plan; 3, the domain, made up of seven adjacent villas and twenty more at a distance not exceeding sixty kilometers; and 4, a total feudality of indeterminate bulk, in allegiance to the abbot, spreading across a considerable sector of empire, embracing not only the domain, but also distant tenures involving a wide variety of rights and obligations, to which he does not allude.19 19 Compare the holdings of the equally distinguished abbey of St. Wandrille (Fontanelle), situated on the Seine below Rouen. According to the Deeds of the Holy Fathers of Fontanelle (ed. Dom F. Lohier and R. P. J. Laporte, Gesta Sanctorum Patrum Fontanellensis Coenobii, 1936, 82): "These are the total holdings of the abbey according to the inventory which the invincible King Charles ordered Landric, abbot of Jumièges, and Richard, the count, to prepare in the twentieth year of abbot Witlaic's rule, which was the year of his death (A.D. 787). First, of those holdings intended for the abbot's personal use and for the subsistence of the brothers, there were found to be 1313 full manses, 238 half-manses, and 18 garden-plots—a total of 1569—plus 158 undeveloped manses and 39 mills. As for released benefices, there were 2120 full manses, 40 half-manses, and 235 garden-plots—a total of 2395 —plus 156 undeveloped manses; these have 28 mills of their own. The sum total of present holdings, considering full manses, half-manses, and garden-plots, is 4264, excluding those villas which Witlaic released to the king's men or even granted to others under usufruct—something that should under no circumstances have been done." A mansus integer, or full manse, has been defined in note 16; or it may be calculated as consisting of two or more bunnaria, or 2.56 hectares, of arable land, to which must be added the common forest lands, meadows, and vineyards. For the sub-standard garden-plots (manoperarii) the holders contributed only manual labor, not carts or draft animals. There was always a good deal of undrained or marginal land which made up the domain; such land is listed in the inventory as absi, or undeveloped manses. The category of mansi ad usus proprios, reserved for direct support of the abbot and abbey, compares with what I have called operation 3 at Corbie; and the beneficii relaxati, or released benefices, with operation 4 (see preceding p. 95). Professor Ganshof wrote (The Cambridge Historical Journal, 1939, 162), "It is certain that ecclesiastical lords regarded themselves as proprietors of the benefices granted by them to their vassals, and the same naturally holds good for lay seigneurs." See François L. Ganshof, Feudalism (Torchbook ed.), 162. Doubtless a large fraction of the benefices yielded the nona, as income under the Capitulary of Herstal (A.D. 779, Mon. Germ. Hist., Capitularia I, No. 20, 50). See Ganshof, ibid., 38-39, and I, 341, 349. The Council of Aachen, 816, ruled that external estates must be managed exclusively by laymen. The Directives show that the economy of Corbie, though primarily dependent upon produce from the villas of the domain, also fundamentally depended upon the use of money; they reveal that the old support in kind was yielding to such far-flung operations.20 20 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 123, 249-51; cf. Karl der Grosse I, 534-36. There were many mints in the time of King Pepin, but in 804 Charlemagne issued a Capitulary (Thionville, c. 18) limiting the coinage to the emperor's palace: "De falsis monetis, quia in multis locis contra justitiam et contra edictum fiunt, volumus ut et nullo alio loco moneta sit, nisi forte iterum a nobis aliter fueri ordinatum. (Regarding the coinage, which against law and order has been produced in many places, we decree that it should not be produced at any other place unless in exceptional circumstances we should authorize it anew at some other locality.)" The figure on p. 122 shows a coin by the abbot of Corbie believed to have been minted shortly after the abbey's founding. Like St. Gall, Corbie was an arm of theocracy. Alcuin's nickname for Charlemagne was "David;" for the emperor stood at the head of the religious and secular life of his realm as did King David of old, who was both priest and warrior, and in whose kingdom each secular act had its religious counterpart. Carolingian magnates simultaneously tried to balance secular and ecclesiastical offices (pope-emperor; bishop-count; priest-vassal) and to unite their duties in single persons (cancellarii and missi, originally secular posts now held largely by clergy; abbacomites, lay abbots). Artists now exercised their ingenuity to apply the figure of the Christian warrior (miles Christi), popularized in the days of Roman persecution by the Acts and Passions of the Holy Martyrs, equally to the knight on horseback who carried Conversion in his sword and to the prelate who carried it in the sacrament. Indeed, the interrelations, even in etymology, of the monastic court (co-hortus) and the secular court (curia) cannot be unraveled. Corbie's economy centrally supported 350 to 400 Christian knights (miles Christi) in the divine task (opus Dei) of liturgical procession toward the New Jerusalem.21 21 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 252-53. Though there is no record that he ever rode to secular warfare, Adalhard was one of the royal prelates who made monk and knight two faces of the coin of Christian warfare. To support 400 knights, whether spiritual or temporal, was a logistical problem which depended for success on an even flow of goods and services. Writing was a comparatively recent acquisition among the German rulers, but Adalhard had learned from the heads of the royal court how valuable each preserved written document had proved to be for stabilizing power. Written memoranda had been accepted as binding by the Franks ever since Insular missionaries like Boniface became involved in court affairs. Before then, conquest, oaths, the spoken word, had served to secure man's loyalties and obedience, but from Pepin's time onward, faith in the written order was established and accepted. Adalhard solved his managerial problems by incorporating both custom and reform into writing.22 22 Ganshof in Karl der Grosse I, 391-93. Incompletely transmitted though they are, the Directives are our most specific and circumstantial economic document at a key moment in the evolution of feudalism. The editors of the Corpus Consuetudinum Monasticarum have listed23 23 Corp. Cons. Mon., I, XIII-XLIX. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 247, following Ganshof, say that in conformity with the Capitulare de villis (Mon. Germ. Hist., Cap. I, 32, 85-86) one-third of the production of the villas went to the needs of the domain, one-third for sale, and one-third for the needs of the monastery. Of course the tithe was first subtracted from all. The Directives treat only the tithe and the last third. the works that in some fashion might be considered rivals. The polyptych of Irminon is also valuable, but in a very different way. The two bear somewhat the relation of the coronation charter and writs of the English Henry I to the Domesday Book of William I. Adalhard's effective model was the Rule of Benedict of Nursia, with its reformation codicils, that regulated the claustral division of the abbatial operation.24 24 The Admonitiones, pp. 121-22, treat claustral problems. They are topics to be dealt with orally in meetings of the Chapter, and Benedict's Rule is their constitution. Hafner gives four versions of the reform texts of Corbie use. Benedict had had no need for more; beyond his Italian cloisters lay not a theocracy but an essentially hostile state, chaotic if not anarchic. Benedict walled out that world. But Adalhard on the contrary had to build a bridge between his cloister and the friendly, benevolent empire. The transitional area was the compound and domain, where the Chapter, headed by the deans, melted into the familia Corbeiensis, headed by the mayors. Both were under the fatherhood of the abbas. Here Adalhard needed a rule. Doubtless he prepared directives for each of the monastic officials charged with any extra-claustral responsibilities. These would have included the provost, the deans, and the chamberlain. Not all have survived. What have survived are those for the magister pauperum (I?, II),25 25 See I, 128, 326, and 335; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 265-66; also the excellent chapter in Fichtenau, 1957, "The Poor," 144-76. Before the reforms, there was a custom for the revenue to go to the cellarer for eleven months a year and to the porter for the month of December (Lesne, 1910, 29). the custos panis (III), the hortolanus (IV), the cellararii, iuniores et senior (V, VII), and the portarius (VI).26 26 Based on Benedict's Rule, chap. 66; see also Lesne, 1910-1943, I, 379. Compare Lesne, 1925, 419-20, for a slightly different estimate of the contents of the archetype. A fragment (VIII) on the vestarius suggests that Adalhard may have extended Benedict's Rule by issuing directives for some internal officials too; for instance, the bibliothecarius, cantor, hospitalarius religiosorum. But the evidence is minuscule. Naturally, there is no suggestion of written rules or memoranda for lay officials (vassali, maiores, actores, fabri). Among Teutoni generally, only clerical fratres were expected to be literate.27 27 Cf. Lesne, 1925, 419-20; James Westfall Thompson, The Literacy of the Laity, 1939, 27-52, who quotes (p. 28) Pirenne, "No one wrote except the clergy." Charlemagne had learned the uses of literacy and had pressed the abbeys to take some noble scions for tutelage. At St. Gall, for example, their number was considerable before the end of the ninth century. But most monks regarded such intrusion of secularity an abuse. The reformers did what they could to control mingling which they were not powerful enough wholly to prevent. There are faint suggestions, no more, in the Directives that Corbie had a few external scholars, but Adalhard presumably would not favor the practice.28 28 Lesne, 1910-1943, V, 319, 433: "The school at Corbie in the ninth century is clearly a school exclusively for oblates." But the remarks on clerici in the Directives (Cons. Corbeienses, 366) do not support that statement, and the statement about clericis extraneis (text, note 60) seems to be indisputable evidence to the contrary. The Council of 817 forbade external scholars in monasteries: "Ut schola in monasterio non habeatur nisi eorum qui oblati sunt" (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 474). Pierre Héliot, "Die Abtei Corbie zur den normannischen Einfällen," Westfalen XXXIV (1956), 133-41, notes how the Directives and the Plan of St. Gall complement each other and he lists, pp. 138-39, all the buildings alluded to by Adalhard. He derives a lay school at Corbie from the Vita S. Anscharii, and places it outside the cloister (p. 138). M. L. W. Laistner, Thought and Letters in Western Europe, 500-900 A.D., rev. ed. 1957, p. 209, on the basis of statements in the Vita Anskarii (i.e., Bibliotheca hagiographica Latina, no. 544) suggests that St. Peter was the schola exterior for Corbie. At all events, we may doubt that any of them graduated to any other vocation than that of royal or episcopal cleric. And it would be inconsistent with the evidence to believe that in the year 822 written regulations or directives governed secular officials on the manors. The diction of the Directives shows that the Carolingian proprietors were feeling their way toward a new orthodoxy in feudal relations. Adalhard seems to choose his words rather loosely,29 29 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 114-16. using labels like prior, provendarius, maior, custos, magister, and vassalus in overlapping and contrary senses. But with each year of Louis's reign these tenures became more particularized, as the discriminating research of Professor Ganshof and other recent scholars shows. The Directives record a moment of rapid social change: vassalus is equated (402.1) with homo casatus, "a housed man."30 30 See above, note 19, and Ganshof, 1939, 151-53, and Feudalism, ed. cit., 5, 25. Possession of a benefice of four mansi normally entailed military service, and twelve mansi bound a vassal to mounted service (Ganshof, 1939, 160). On monastic military obligations, see I, 342, and n. 21. By capitularies of Carloman, Pepin III, and Charlemagne vassals, but not brothers, were held for military service. However, the casa vasallorum (367.8) is a separate hospice within the compound to house visiting vassals. Are they there to transact business in goods and services, to render homage, to worship? Or is their servitium as a military guard? The curticula abbatis (366.2) is etymologically only a "modest atrium," but is developing into a domus or palatium, and also into a curtis dominica.31 31 Lesne, 1910-1943, VI, 314ff; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 120. Note the discussion of domus dominus in K.-J. Hollyman, Le développement du vocabulaire féodale en France, 1957, 90-97; says H.-F. Muller, "Mais la religion devait donner à ces mots toute leur force nouvelle." For casa vasallorum see Héliot, op. cit., 139, n. 47. At Corbie domus is not necessarily an aristocratic word; note the domus infirmorum. Lesne too forcefully contended that there is no evidence of mensae, or inalienable livings for the cloistered, at Corbie, though they were already appearing elsewhere. He maintained32 32 Lesne, 1910, 26-37, 70, 114; 1910-1943, VI, 224; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 235, n. 163, but see p. 114. Adalhard in fact speaks of villas "quas praepositus specialiter in ministerio habet" (Consuetudines Corbeienses, p. 375, line 8; cf. p. 418, lines 15-16); cf. Lesne, 1910, 137-38. In A.D. 681 all the property of Corbie was exclusively in the prerogative of the abbot (Lesne, 1910-1943, I, 287). that Adalhard was himself a monk, not a lay abbot, and that only under civil governors did monks demand protection from those who would waste their substance in secular affairs. But this is a point of view from later reforms: under Charlemagne, Adalhard was both monk and courtier. Many of the Directives concern specific differentiations between what is due allowance for the cloister—monks, prebends, and matriculants—and what lies outside their call. The abbot clearly states that specific lands have been ceded to the provost and deans, that is, to the fraternal officials. All else doubtless was secularly managed by the abbot in some capacity of vassalage. * 529. LUTTRELL PSALTER (CA. 1340) BRITISH MUSEUM ADD. MS. 41320. fol. 66b, detail [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] MAN WITH BROAD-AXE, DOG, AND GOOSE Adalhard describes equipment for gardeners (below, p. 109 and notes, 108) who were to have "hatchets and pick-axes"; the sophisticated broad-axe of the later Psalter is more appropriate gear for a forester or game warden. Adalhard is a diplomatic innovator. He is quite proud of his solution33 33 Cons. Corbeienses, 20, 391-94; translation, p. 113. of the problem of tithes in kind from distant villas, but is wary of his brothers' reaction against his change.34 34 "Some parts of Charles' empire were unaccustomed [to the use of coins] and regarded it with mistrust."—Grierson in Karl der Grosse I, 535. Adalhard does not mention money, but it is evident that his proposal depends upon it. See note 20, above. He introduces other reforms (e.g., banishment of seculars from the kitchen; establishment of tithed sheep in the claustral sheepfolds) in an easy spirit of conciliation, suggesting that his innovations be tried only until better methods are found. His grants of privileges to millers in exchange for increased production is masterful. His style suggests that he dictated his remarks to a secretary: it shows haste, and his sentences contain administrative jargon and circumlocution. But he has exceptional ability to make himself understood, to both the ninth and the twentieth centuries. Only Benedict's exemplary Rule is a model for this unique work.35 35 "Un document unique"—Lesne, 1925, 385. The Directives of Corbie and the Plan of St. Gall are remarkably interrelated; for they were prepared at almost the same historical moment, under the impact of a political and social change which was itself unifying. The two abbeys were comparable in aims and power, though ethnically separated. Wiesemeyer writes: "Well-known facts show that Corbie was the most important monastery of Northern France, comparable in all ways with Saint-Denis, Saint-Gall, and Monte Cassino." In the Plan of St. Gall and the Directives we have the specifications of abbey life, easily bridging the gulf between spiritual and temporal and manifesting how slight was that separation in the days of Louis I and Benedict of Aniane.36 36 Héliot, 19-41, describes the architectural layout of Merovingian and Carolingian Corbie with the Plan of St. Gall in mind (see p. 30); but the data are sparse. THE ADDENDA I have appended four Addenda. Addendum I, the Emperor Louis's charter of immunities (29 January 815), confirms that issued by Charlemagne (16 March 769) to Abbot Hado of Corbie,37 37 Levillain, Examen critique, 1902, no. 18, pp. 240-42; cf. 96-100. as Charlemagne had confirmed the immunities granted by the Merovingian kings and his father Pepin before him. The editor Levillain has persuasively but not irrefutably argued that this charter was presented to the second Adalhard ("the Younger") rather than to our author; however, any doubt about who received it does not affect the precision of its contents, which clearly indicate the legal status of all Corbie property alluded to in the Directives. Addendum II, a document contemporary with the Directives, was issued at the abbey of St. Wandrille* * Map, page 110. (Fontanella), about seventy-five air miles southwest of Corbie on the lower Seine River. Fontanella and Corbie were of comparable size. Addendum III indicates by genealogy the relationship of Bernhard's family, including our Adalhard and his brother Wala who succeeded him to the abbacy, to the royal Carolingians. Addendum IV, an epitaph commemorating Adalhard's death, was written shortly after that event by Paschasius Ratpertus, monk of Corbie and later its abbot. THE TEXT Adalhard's Directives survive in the two tenth-century manuscripts (bound together at Corbie before the thirteenth century), in Dachery's printed edition of 1661 drawn from an early (ca. A.D. 900?) manuscript now lost, and some fragmentary copies made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries essentially from the previous items. Four printed editions preceded Semmler's. The two surviving early manuscripts agree with each other neither in contents nor arrangement, nor with Dachery's edition.38 38 Semmler describes the manuscripts and printed editions in Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 1963, 357-63, and tabulates their differences. The four essential documents are: A. Paris, National Library MS lat. 13908, fols. 1r-22v (copied after A.D. 986). B. The same MS, fols. 29r-53v (according to Levillain, 1900, 333-349, copied in the 10th century from a recension prepared A.D. 822-844). S. L. Dacherius, ed., Spicilegium IV, Paris 1661, 1-20 (according to Levillain, loc. cit., copied from a lost Corbie MS of a recension prepared between 844 and the 10th century). M. Paris, National Library MS lat. 17190, fols. 66r-73v (copied ca. 1700 for the Benedictine editor Martène from Dachery's MS, supplying sections which Dachery had omitted). Professor Émile Lesne (1925, 385-420) proposed that Adalhard had originally prepared separate directives for each of his major officials: "The brevis dictated by Adalhard in 822 was composed of a considerable number of separable items, though forming a continuous series. Presumably, either because of the natural disruptions among the separated letters as sent to each monastic official concerned, items which quite possibly consisted of small gatherings or detached sheets, or simply because of the deterioration of the archetype or its early copies, the text has come down to us in the shape of fragments very diversely chopped up by the scribes, who doubtless had at hand only torn or partially illegible folds. [p. 418] . . . the three manuscripts together preserve, despite some easily identifiable additions, each partially and in different grouping, the essential contents which Adalhard drafted in 822 [p. 419]." Professor Semmler, in preparing his excellent edition ("Consuetudines Corbeienses," Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 1963, 355-422), adhered to Lesne's proposals while altering important details in the light of convincing evidence. He relegated the later interpolations to an appendix and changed some parts of Lesne's suggested arrangement.39 39 See pp. 360-62. I have translated Semmler's edition without alteration. "The Rubrics (Capitula) of the Abbot, Dom Adalhard" (below, pp. 121-122) are not to be found in an extant manuscript, but were published by Dachery's co-worker, Jean Mabillon, in the Acta (saec. IV, pars prima), 1677, 757-58. Mabillon transcribed them from Dachery's manuscript, now lost; the consensus is that they are authentic. 530. THE CHARTER OF LOUIS THE PIOUS (9TH CENTURY) BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE, MS 2718, fol. 80 v [courtesy of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris] The origins of ancient stenography are obscure. Isidore of Seville may be the source of the later phrase "Tironian notes": "At Rome Cicero's freedman, Tullius Tiro, first worked out shorthand signs, but only for prepositions . . . Finally Seneca, by contraction and division of all words and numbers, brought the total number of signs to five thousand" (ETYM. I, xxii). In the poverty of the seventh and early eighth centuries, monastic scribes sometimes saved precious vellum by employing shorthand. From civil offices diplomas employing it survive from Merovingian notaries of the late seventh century, but only under Louis I did tachygraphy predominate. Under the Carolingians CANCELLARII (a term of Byzantine origin) replaced REFERENDARII as chief notaries, and under Louis I the archchancellor, in charge of the emperor's seal and therefore of highest responsibility, was drawn from the episcopate, usually a trained monk. This charter is translated on page 124, below. Contractions and abbreviation signs in the Plan of St. Gall are discussed above, page 11. C.W.J.

BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE, PARIS, CABINET DES MEDAILLES actual size: 38 mm in length Seals (SIGNA or SIGILLA) were used in antiquity to impress wax or clay on documents or boundles to assure classification or privacy; but among illiterate Merovingian sovereigns seals replaced signatures as authentication of public documents. The Carolingians, IN RENOVATIONE IMPERII, revived a Roman custom of using a symbolic effigy—not a portrait of the reigning sovereign— on the seal. To it they added the sovereign's name and title. Thus, the image on the seal of the Emperor Louis I is the bust of a Roman, evidently Commodus (see H. Bresslau, Handbuch II2, 550, 559). Charlemagne and successors also used monograms and BULLAE together with or as a substitute for seals. The inscription surround of the laurel-crowned bust on this seal reads: XPE PROTEGE HLODOVVICUM IMPERATORE ("Christ guard Louis the Emperor"). [A] DIRECTIVE WHICH ADALHARD, RETURNING TO CORBIE IN THE YEAR OF THE INCARNATION OF THE LORD 822, IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY, IN THE FIFTEENTH INDICTION, &amp; IN THE EIGHTH YEAR OF THE IMPERIAL REIGN OF THE GLORIOUS LOUIS AUGUSTUS, ORDERED TO BE PREPARED. &lt;i&gt; I &lt;PREBENDS&gt;1 1 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 114, 119, 251, 254, 256, 259-62, 264, 266; Lesne, 1929, 446, 453; see I, 341; II, 195, 208. Provendarii - praebendae &lt; praebere: "terrena subsidia (debent praelati) diligenter illis praebere."—Regula s. Chrodegangi, c. lv; "victus . . . quae iure ab abbatissis praeberi debuerant."—Conc. Turon. 813, c. x. Hence, "permanent domestic personnel." &lt;I.1 THE NUMBER OF PREBENDS&gt; During our tenure these are the prebends who ought regularly to hold appointment, with equal ranks and full-time duties. If one of them should die, another should immediately be appointed, so that the full quota may always be maintained. And no further addition should be made to that number, although there may at times be extra clerks, like Salvaricus and some others who are attached to that cadre2 2 cella. at present, or certain laymen like those who are a part of that cadre—the Vinedi, and Gerola, and Bruningus the Saxon, or the brother of Bituradus. Even if other clerks or laymen are sent, still they are not to be added to that number of 150. They must always be counted and rationed individually, according to a separate allowance for each of them, as ordered by whoever is in charge at the time. But under our tenure those 150 are to have uniform rations, just as today they are provisioned through the several service offices, some in one manner, others in another. So in consequence, it has not been necessary to write down the procedure here, since it is well known both to the givers and to the receivers from daily practice. And the executive officers themselves, that is, the chamberlain, the cellarer, and the seneschal, each have their own directives on the subject.3 3 "Et ipsi ministeriales habent inde singuli breves suos, id est camararius, cellararius et senescalcus." See Lesne, 1925, 391; see I, 333ff. THE CLERKS4 4 clerici: all those below order of diaconi who are subject to scholastic discipline. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 259 n. 279. Twelve novices,5 5 pulsantes, as at Tours (Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 259 n. 281); cf. Benedicti regula, chap. 58; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 133-38; ed. McCann, 1952, 128-33; ed. Steidle, 1952, 275-79; also see I, 311ff. seven other clerks. From among the latter, two are assigned to the cellarer, one to the brothers' laundry, one to the abbot's garden,6 6 curticulum abbatis. Cf. Institutio Angilberti, Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 300, l. 22; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 261 n. 295. three to the infirmary.7 7 domum infirmorum: see below, Rubric XXXIV, p. 121. The other duties which clerks ought to perform should be performed by the novices. The point is that only as many novices should be placed in the cloister as are able to perform all the necessary internal duties and are of our community.8 8 familia. This distinction was confirmed in the Capitulare monasticum, 42 (Mon. Germ. Hist., Capit. I, 346); Verhulst and Semmler, 260 n. 285. The distinction between external students, usually "canons secular," and internal students, usually oblates, was becoming more definite (see above, p. 97). In this way they will not dare to gainsay anything and will conform with what is proper just as if they were officials, and because of their vocation or spiritual life they should look beyond the provost and dean9 9 praepositum et decanum: Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 261-64; praepositus is often considered identical with prior (see I, 331-32), but the words "abbati vel priori vel praepositis" (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 418, line 15) indicate two positions at Corbie. to the wardship of St. John.10 10 St. John the Baptist, prototype of monks and patron of Corbie. And they are never to be left without supervision, lest the spiritual life of the monastery be defamed because of some misbehavior on their part. Likewise the Laymen11 11 laici: See I, 341ff.; II, 189-202; 215-299. Almsmen12 12 matricularii: "Poor men acting as servants for the up-keep of the church"—Niermeyer, 663. &gt; matricula, "list of poor" = marguilliers.

To the second shop seventeen: one of these for the shop, six blacksmiths, two goldsmiths, two cobblers, two shield-makers, one parchmentmaker, one saminator,13 13 s.v., Du Cange; not recorded elsewhere.

These are within the monastic quarters. And those outside the Monastic Quarters16 16 Section 3 specifically differentiates the locus Corbiensis, which may have had a surrounding wall, from the villae Corbienses which lie beyond. Within the first is the cloister, or locus internale, of the brotherhood. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 119, n. 134.

OF PREBENDS&gt; The Distribution of Extras23 23 Legislated by Council of 817 (VI), Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 474-75. Now these are the thirteen days on which, for the love of God and of the saints of those days, an extra allowance is to be given to the prebends outside their own stipend, if that is not enough or sufficiently satisfying. The extra is one loaf between two of the vassals,24 24 Vasalli is evidently used here as genus for species provendarii; but above (367 l. 8) the casa vassallorum, within the compound, is listed as having two prebends in service—a suggestion that the casa was a hospice for visiting beneficiaries holding their beneficium from the abbot. At the end of section 11 Adalhard lists in order: (1) famuli nostri vel matricularii, (2) fratres, (3) vasalli, (4) ospites, (5) pulsantes vel scolarii, (6) singuli provendarii. of the size which is made thirty to a modius, and to each vassal a half pound of some kind of vegetable, and to each a full beaker, whether it should be from out of the wine or, if that is not available, from the brothers' brew.25 25 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 256. The days are: the Lord's Nativity, on Holy Epiphany, the Mass of Lady Balthilda26 26 Queen Balthilda, founder and endower of Corbie. (and for that day the allowance is drawn from the ministry of the chamberlain27 27 ministerio camerarii: Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 109, 266-67. ), Purification of St. Mary, on Sunday the beginning of Lent, on Maundy Thursday, on Holy Easter, Ascension of the Lord, Pentecost, Mass of St. John the Baptist, of St. Peter, of St. Martin, of St. Andrew. Feasts on Which Work on the Domain is Omitted Furthermore, in like fashion these are the days on which men are freed from work on the domain, except as it pertains to the preparation of food: Nativity of the Lord, St. Stephen's, St. John's, Innocent's Day, Octave of the Lord, on Holy Epiphany, Mass of Lady Balthilda, Purification of St. Mary, on the first Monday in Lent (stipulated in order that the laity may have time to renew their confessions), Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Wednesday in Easter, the three days of Rogations, the Ascension of the Lord, St. John the Baptist's, St. Peter's, St. Marcellinus',28 28 21 September: Dedicatio s.

The Council of 816 considered the clothes allowance (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 462; cf. p. 446). These are what should be given to our aforesaid clerical canons who have the special title of "knockers"31 31 pulsanti. : in clothing, two white tunics and a third of another color and four hose, two pairs of breeches, two felt slippers, four shoes with new soles costing seven pence at the cobbler's, two gloves, two mufflers. These they receive every year, but a cope of serge and fur and a mantle or bedcloth, or a blanket, in the third year. All these should be taken from the clothing which the brothers return when they receive new.32 32 Cf. below, Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 374, lines 24-25. And they should select from the stock those garments which they think are most useful to them. The other cowled garment33 33 capelle. —the tunic34 34 hroccus. or the cowl of serge from which the tunic can be made—will be issued at the discretion of the prior. &lt;II&gt; &lt;THE POORHOUSE&gt;35 35 hospitium (l. 4) or ospitalis (l. 5) pauperum. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 105, 255-56, 264-66; Lesne, 1925, 247; see II, 144-53. We have stipulated that loaves be given out every day at the poorhouse—forty-five made from three and a half pounds of maslin and five made of wheat or spelt such as the vassals receive, making a total of fifty loaves. These loaves are to be distributed as follows: twelve paupers who are staying there overnight should each receive his own loaf; and the next morning each should receive a half loaf for the road.36 36 ad viaticum. Then the two hospitalers who have been serving there should each receive one loaf from the aforesaid stock. The five loaves of wheat bread ought to be distributed among the migrant clergy, who are admitted to the refectory,37 37 And hence partake of the monks' repast there. See Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 260. for the road, and among the infirm who are cared for at the poorhouse. However, we leave this distribution of bread to the discretion of the hospitaler for this manifest reason: if a greater number of paupers or those who are more or less needy, such as the weak, or very small boys who eat little, should appear, then he should decide how much is needed. But if it should happen at another time that fewer paupers came, then the hospitaler and his master, the senior porter,38 38 portarius = ostarius. See I, 326 (Table), 335; II, 145, 153. should determine, after considering all factors, how much less than the prescribed number should be dispensed because few came. In that way what was left over may be dispensed at another time when more may come. But for the other poor, who come and go on the same day, it is customary to give out a quarter of a loaf, or, as we have just said, the amount that the hospitaler foresees to be needed to take care of a greater or lesser number or need. The food to accompany the bread39 39 companaticus. should be allotted according to custom. With regard to drink, there should be given out each day a half modius of beer, that is, eight sesters. Of these, four sesters are divided among those aforesaid twelve paupers, so that each will receive two beakers. Then from the other four sesters is given one beaker to each of the clerical brothers who wash the feet40 40 Council of 816, XXI and XXII (Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 463); Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 260. Guérard, 197, and Lohier-Laporte, 120, equate the Carolingian sester with 4.25 liters. and one beaker to Willeramnus the servitor. We leave to the discretion of the hospitaler the method of dividing any residue among the infirm or the other paupers. But the matter of wine shall be in the discretion of the prior. However, the senior porter ought to anticipate the needs of the infirm in order to be able to supply either food or drink which the hospitaler lacks to meet the need of the infirm.41 41 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 265-66. And if it should happen that pilgrims come from distant lands in excess of the stipulated numbers, the porter42 42 portarius. See note 38 above. should provide for them the things that are necessary in such a way that the supplies which are stored to meet the daily requirements are not diminished. Also we add to the foods of the poor as accompaniment to bread thirty standard rations in the category of cheese and bacon and thirty modii of vegetables, a fifth part of the tithe of eels43 43 Eels fished from the abbey's mill-races (Lesne, 1912, 666 n. 1). which the porter receives from the cellarer, or of the new cheese which is due in payment from the ten sheepfolds,44 44 Cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 397, 1. 25 ff. together with that which is given in tithe from the villas of the domain, as well as every fifth part of the tithe of cattle, that is in calves, in sheep, or anything which is given to the porter from the flocks, including horses. Furthermore, beyond the aforesaid we have arranged to give directly through the agency of the senior porter to the hospitaler a fifth part of all money whatsoever that may come to the gate.45 45 Lesne, "La dime des biens ecclésiastiques au ixe et xe siècles," Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique XIII (1912), 479 n. 3. Of this money we have desired to create such a method of distribution that not less than four pence should be given out each day. And if the amount from that fifth should be less than sufficient for making that daily distribution, the abbot, if he wishes, may supply it from elsewhere; nor should any be withheld if it should rise above that amount. According to custom the porter should provide firewood for the poor or other things which are not recorded here, such as the kettle or dishes and other things that are in the quarters.46 46 lectulis. Of those things which come to the gate, all the aforesaid rations should be given out according to the method of distribution of the supplement of money, just as it is recorded above. Furthermore, the hospitaler should receive from the chamberlain the old garments and footwear of the brothers for distribution to the poor according to custom.47 47 After, of course, the novices (pulsantes) have taken their allowance of them. Therefore we beg all those to whom the office in this monastery should be assigned that they order their decisions in the generosity and almsgiving of God rather than in the example of our parsimony, since each will be rewarded according to his own standard. &lt;III&gt; &lt;THE GRAIN SUPPLY&gt;48 48 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 108, 110, 241-42, 244-45, 247, 253, 255, 259, 266; Lesne, 1910, 17-21; see I, 333; II, 215-48; 254. The disposition or amount of grain or of bread: What kind or where from or how much is due to come to the monastery each year, or in what fashion the bread-warden49 49 custos panis. See I, 326 (Table I), 333; II, 97, 339. ought to dispense it: It is our wish that every year there should arrive 750 corbi50 50 The corbus seems to have varied from 10 to 14 modii depending upon the crop; see Du Cange, Niermeyer. The modius (which Adalhard as regularly writes modium) is, roughly, a peck. of well-winnowed and husked spelt, each corbus having twelve modii, well compared and standardized to the new modius which the Lord Emperor has set.51 51 See especially Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 375 n. 7; and I, 52 n. 19; and the translation below of Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 379, p. 108. Charlemagne decreed the new measure before A.D. 794 (text Mon. Germ. Hist. Concilia II, 166; Capitula I, p. 104; etc.). The standard was on deposit in the palace at Aachen. But in spite of the royal decree, the measure was not uniform in the kingdom of the Franks. Adalhard seems to refer to the repetition by Louis I of Charlemagne's decree. That grain supply should come from those villas which the provost has particularly in his charge,52 52 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 115, 243-44, 266-67. and, if it should be necessary, from all of them, but if not then from those which he shall have agreed on with the abbot. We have purposely set that amount so that for every day of the year, 365 of them, there will always be two corbi, which make in all 730 corbi. Then we have taken pains to add twenty so that there may in time be a surplus rather than a shortage. And although that grain supply may sometimes be better, sometimes worse, and may occasionally yield more flour and occasionally less, yet we hope by calculating averages that from those two corbi we may always get ten modii.53 53 The weight of bread was considered by the Council of 817, Art. XXII (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 478). Therefore if each modius thirty loaves. . .54 54 Lacuna in MSS. 300, then we have made sure that at all times we will have in the monastery not less than 300 and always something more between the leftover and the incoming. Yet though we would at present not number more than 350 members, nevertheless we want to arrange as if we were at all times about 400, sometimes less, sometimes more. In this way, when we are less than 400 a surplus will accumulate. Then the bread can be distributed more generously when we are more than 400. Yet it has rarely happened that we have that larger number since it most often happens that we number many fewer than 400.55 55 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 253, n. 242. Therefore we should add four modii a day of flour which comes from the mills and make 120 loaves; add the amounts together and there are 420 loaves. Note that we have not only enough for the 400, which rarely exist, but even an extra twenty loaves every day, which are even more rarely needed. But because we desire all our substance which is dispensed through our ministers always to be larger, so that there may be surplus rather than shortage, we now add still another modius to the amount which comes from the mills; and that makes 450 loaves daily from the fifteen mills. According to this plan, by adding the amount for each day we get the annual total of 5475 modii. Also we should add twenty-five from those mills and that makes 5500. Of these, 3650 should come from spelt, with a remainder of 1850 from the mills.56 56 The editors, Verhulst and Semmler, have not questioned this number: "3650 muids étaient fournis par les villae du prévôt" (247, n. 215). They thus equate it with the statement above, "villas which the provost has particularly in his charge." But 750 (corbi) × 5 (modii) = 3750. Now because, as we have already remarked, we want to have a surplus more often than a deficit, for that reason we arranged first to add twenty corbi and then daily more loaves in addition to the 400 regularly rationed, and finally twenty-five modii, even though, as was said before, we are apt to number less than 400 more often than very much above 400. And because cattle, swine, different birds, dogs and even horses are to be fed at the mill itself, we should then add from the mills themselves 150 modii, making in all 2000 modii which should come from the mills.57 57 See below, 379, line 11; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 243, n. 199. Meanwhile these stipulations as set down should be observed until we can consider together whether it may be necessary to add or subtract anything. Nevertheless, as a precaution we request the warden of the loaves to pay very close attention in every detail to anything that can be learned from the distribution or the accounting by days, weeks, or months of the whole year, to the end that when the time for change58 58 tempus mutationis. "Fratres vero qui in diversis ministeriis foris occupati fuerant medio augusto cum mutatio facienda erit sive de cellis seu de villis ad coenobium redeant."—Statuta Murbacensia, × (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 445). comes he will be ready to recount to us how he has administered the current year. And in order that he may the more easily know, he should first set aside those allowances which are routinely held and distributed in equal amounts through rationing. That number is always the same, unless through some accident there should be a need for fewer rations; for there is never a need for more. Then he should calculate the brothers' bread, according to whether it is to be eaten once or twice in the day.59 59 See above, p. 104 and I, 333; Benedicti regula, chap. 41, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 102-104; ed. McCann, 1952, 98; ed. Steidle, 1952, 238-39; Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 114, 133, 335, 474ff; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 256 n. 262. Let him always set apart what is deputed for their needs. Let him figure how much is needed for the period when it is regularly eaten once a day, and how much when twice a day, and how much in one week in either case—how much in a week when the lesser amount and when the greater. We opine that he can thus very closely approximate what quantity of bread or modii he should have to furnish for their needs. In that number are to be figured all who receive brothers' bread except those guests who do not receive it every day. Moreover, the warden should avoid baking so much of the brothers' bread that the leftovers get too hard. However, if he should do so during the period when he is trying to establish the correct number, that bread is to be taken away and other bread substituted for it. But because, as we have said, we sometimes eat once a day and sometimes twice and we are now many, now few, and we can never limit ourselves to exactly the number we ought to be, if with the help of God he can invent some other better method of effecting the desired end, he should do so. The same applies to provisions for our vassals, and the same also for those at the gate, the number of which cannot be set. If he shall have begun to calculate by the method we have spoken of above—by days, by weeks, by months; the seasons when he distributes least, when average, when most—we think that he surely can determine how he will be able to get through the whole year. So for the novices, the scholars, the rest of the clerks, whether our lay brothers or the externals,60 60 laicis nostris vel extraneis. he can easily formulate the procedure for caring for them. Also we admonish him to be sure to keep in mind how that bread is to be distributed which is not given in equal amount to all, but more to some and less to others. In this operation he needs to determine with each measure of loaves how many of the large, medium, or small can be made from one modius; and we hope that by so doing everything will be quite clear to him. Now as far as has been in our power, we hope that we have invented an effective means whereby we may be able in the future to handle the grain supply which should arrive at the monastery under the categories which we have stipulated above, not that we wish to solidify such a procedure permanently, but in order that we can learn the right way by making a start. The rations are those of, first, our servants and working dependents,61 61 famulorum nostrorum vel matriculariorum. who always should have the same amount; second, of the brothers; third, of the vassals; fourth, of the guests; fifth, of the novices or scholars; sixth, of each of the prebends here and there. Unfortunately, of these last, as we have said, we cannot stipulate a number which would always hold stable. WHAT WE WANT AS THE PROGRAM FOR MILLS OR MALTHOUSES First, that a manse and six bonuaria62 62 For measurement of bonuarium see L. Musset's investigation in Melanges L. Halphen, Paris, 1951, 535-41. Possibly, like the "acre," an amount to be plowed by a yoke of oxen in one day. of land should be given to each miller, because we wish him to have the wherewithal which allows him to carry out the orders laid on him and to see to it that the millings are properly protected. That is, he should have oxen and ready implements with which to work, whereby he and all his helpers can live, feed the swine, geese, and chickens, maintain the mill and acquire all the timbers needed to keep it in repair, renovate the weir, tend to the millstones and be capable of supplying all the materials and labor which are needed for maintenance and operation there.63 63 Adalhard's investment of milling will illustrate the monastic contributions to growth of power, described, for instance, by R. J. Forbes in The History of Technology II (Oxford, 1956), 606-11. "Adalhard distinguishes two categories of obligations of millers: the moltura, on the one hand, rendered equally by the phrases ea quae ei rubentus perficere and ea quae de molino debent exire; the servitium, on the other hand, or ea quae molino necessi est facere, among which are included the upkeep of the mill. . . and the delivery of swine, geese, and chickens fattened at the mill on behalf of the abbey, as well as the delivery of eggs, and possibly other duties" (Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 245). And therefore we do not want him to do any other service—not with cart nor horse nor manual labor nor plowing nor seeding nor gleaning the fields or meadows, nor by making mash or hops nor by trimming trees, nor should he do anything else needed on the domain aside from what is needed to take care of himself and his mill.64 64 Ibid., 240. But the swine, geese, and chickens which he ought to fatten at his mill, let him feed from his own meal. Let him also gather the eggs. And, as we have said, let him tend to procuring those things which he needs to make the mill work or which the mill ought to produce. But what we have stated above65 65 See above, p. 107 (377), l.30 and Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 376, line 26. —that 2000 modii should be coming from the mills to the monastery for our use—we have not stated with a view to removing that other production from that granary, but in order that the miller should try to demonstrate in the course of a year whether it be necessary to add or to subtract from the amount. He should be in a position to produce in the course of a whole year such a number as is conformable with the number of prebends and with the variety of operations carried on in the monastery each year, which are governed by the vintages, the gardens, the fields, and such like. We also desire that, in the presence of the millers, the older modii be made to conform exactly in every way with the new modius. Then, however many new modii they find are equivalent to the old ones, they should in the future pay as their due, whether of flour or grain, according to these new modii, so that the tally agrees.66 66 See above, n. 51. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 243-44. And we desire that every one of the millers should keep his plant in operational order with six wheels ready to work. But if anyone does not wish to have six, but only half that number, that is, three wheels, he should not have more than half of the land that attaches to that millstead. That is, he should hold three bonuarias, and his associate the other three. Then between those two they should render the full milling and perform the full service required of that one mill, with regard to milling or the millpond or the bridge or all other duties as they are assigned to each separate mill.67 67 Evidently a portion of this section has disappeared, since the malt-houses mentioned in the rubric are not treated. Lesne, 1925, 400. &lt;IV&gt; &lt;THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GARDENS&gt;68 68 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 108, 110, 116-17, 122, 237-40, 250, 253, 264, 266; Lesne, 1910-1943, VI, 302; I, 203-210 Adalhard's first office as iunior at Corbie was hortolanus (Acta Sanctorum Bollandiana, I, p. 97). In order that the brothers that ought to work them69 69 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 112, 116-17. can do so without molestation or any unseemly disturbance there while they fulfill the duties committed to them for the common good, we have decreed that the mayors70 70 maiores: cf. seniores, ealdormenn, magnates. See I, 341. of the following villas should build whatever accommodations are needed there, and erect and mend fences to the extent that they should be necessary: at the first door, which is next to the stockyard, the mayor of Wagny and Chipilly; at the second, of Ville-sous-Corbie; at the third, of Aubigny and Cérisy-Gailly; at the fourth, of Vaire-sous-Corbie and Thésy-Glimont. And they should each give the same amount—each to the garden assigned to him—every third year one plow, a yoke with rope and ties when it shall be necessary, and in the fourth year a barrow for cultivating the garden. The effective date is always the Mass of St. Marcellinus.71 71 Sept. 21; above n. 28. See Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 117, 122. And when the time comes when it is necessary to clean the weeds out of the fields (that is, from the middle of April up to the middle of October), let each one of these mayors without any suggestion of negligence or slovenliness of any kind appear every twenty days before the brothers' gardener to whom he should render assistance, to see and ask when he should need to assign weeders to that garden. Then after the various kinds of leek (porri et porricini)72 72 Porrus leek, a plant included in one of the beds of the Monks' Vegetable Garden (see above, II, 204f and Appendix I, p. 84). Porricinus must be a closely related plant of the same genus. have been transplanted, as well as the shallots, the garlics, and the onions, the mayors should weed them as much as and whenever necessary, just as has been stated.73 73 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 237, n. 175. And whenever the workers gather for that weeding, the mayor himself in his own person or the dean—one of those two— should be there to see to it in every detail that the workers complete their work conscientiously and efficiently. The gardeners should receive carts from the shed every year according to custom. They ought to receive all iron tools from the chamberlain,74 74 "The first chamberlain should be responsible for the clothing and textiles for all the various uses of the brotherhood and for the gloves and shoes, and the shoemakers and tailors or furriers, and the makers of cooking utensils. He should supervise this work and the areas assigned to the shop in which the aforesaid items are to be produced, and all the copper vessels assigned to the brotherhood." The abbot's chamberlain should be responsible for all smiths, armorers, saddlers, turners, parchmentmakers, furnishers, and personally supervise all metal implements.—Breve Walae a. 834/836 (Corp. Cons. Mon.I, 422). who should supervise the smiths according to the custom of the community. If any of the tools should be broken, let the gardener show them to the chamberlain75 75 The hortolanus is under the chamberlain's jurisdiction I, 326 (Table I); 335. and let him have them repaired or give out another metal appliance and take in the broken one. Furthermore, those tools must then be repaired by the chamberlain in whatever way may be necessary. And for cultivating the field or for carrying out any other needs, let each one have six trenchers76 76 "Secures simplices vel dolabrates"—Palladius I, 43, 3. K. D. White, Agricultural Implements of the Roman World, Cambridge University Press, 1967, pp. 60-64, with figs. 34-39, clearly distinguishes between secures (hatchets) and dolabra (pick-ax). For fussorii (trenchers) see White, pp. 25-26, fig. 6. Taratra (sledges) is in doubt; cf. White, p. 152, fig. 114 (traha) from trahere = Italian treggia. Could taratrum be Virgil's temo aratri (plough beam), Georgics i, 162 ff.? , two spades, three hatchets, one pick-axe, two sledges, large and small, one pruning-knife77 77 Scalprum: According to White, pp. 94-95, figs. 70-74, "The paring edge" of a vine-dresser's knife (falx vinitoria) "used when he wishes to smooth a rough surface or remove some bark." , one gulbium,78 78 Glubium, possibly a stripper &lt; glubere, "to de-bark." DuCange, citing only this passage, glosses: "instrumentum ad ortum excolendum." Falcilia (sickles): cf. White, pp. 96-97, figs. 74-75, who defines f. vineatica as a grape-knife. Falx (scythe): cf. White, pp. 72-90, figs. 51-65. two sickles, one scythe, two trunci,79 79 Trunci, possibly handles for axes and scythes, replacements for which are always needed. Another possibility would be "cutters" &lt; truncare. Niermeyer, citing only this passage, glosses "iron tools." one coulter, one scerum,80 80 Scerum, possible "shears" &lt; OE and OHG sceran, HG schere. and other instruments kept in the chamberlain's office, as are winnowing fans,81 81 Uanni, L. vannus, F. vannage, OHG wanna, HG Wanne, a "winnowing fan;" for separating chaff from grain, by exposing it to wind or an artificial current of air; by extension, other mechanisms capable of separating valuable from worthless parts, such as fish-weir (ML vannagium). For vanni (winnowing fans) cf. White, pp. 32-35, and the same author's Roman Farming, London, 1970, p. 185. casting shovels82 82 Banstae, a "casting shovel" (Wurfschaufel), used in winnowing, as proposed by Frischius (cf. DuCange, sub verbo). or other things of this sort. Whenever old equipment breaks down, the gardener should tell the abbot. The abbot will advise him about obtaining replacements. We have also arranged to give the brothers one hundred loaves as periodic rations for men who accompany them. These men are to clear the fields in autumn and to assist the brothers in planting the fields in spring, as well as to weed the seedlings in summer as each brother gardener shall deem necessary. The brother who provides the brothers' bread should give out those loaves, not all at once but according to the gardener's needs. In this way the dispenser should deliver bread to him as he needs it until the quota has been filled. Likewise one modius of beer is to be given to each gardener by the cellarer in just the same way that the bread is given, that is, not all at once but in portions whenever the gardener needs it and in whatever amount; and the gardener should requisition it, until the stipulated amount has been delivered in full. Also each brother should receive one modius of vegetable; and each of them should receive from the abbot five shillings (solidi) through the year for the men who go with them, as we have said. Those accompanying men83 83 Qui conducticii; but in the preceding sentence conducendos homines. Conductus = "harvest transport;" hence probably primarily carters. who are not needed are not to go anywhere except within the monastery. Otherwise, whatever each brother shall be able to acquire from his garden above the allotments which he ought fully to render to the brotherhood he should deliver without any shortage at the proper time to the abbot. We have arranged for each to have his own ox, with which he can without interference tend to the cultivation of the gardens as needed. This above all we admonish the gardeners about: that they should steadfastly refuse to commit the shameful act of working for money or of visiting the neighbors. &lt;V&gt; &lt;MANAGEMENT OF THE REFECTORY, OR BROTHERS' KITCHEN&gt;84 84 This whole section (V) is based on Benedicti regula, chaps. 35, 39-40; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 92ff, 96ff; ed. McCann, 1952, 86-88, 94-98; ed. Steidle, 1952, 226, 234ff. Also see Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 105, 253, 258, 259, 264; and I, 288, 333, 326 (Table I). As for operating the refectory, just as we have already said in dealing with our other quarters, whenever something different is discovered to be an improvement in some way, probably the dictates of reason ought to be followed, though circumspectly. First of all, the junior cellarer should give out his hemina to all brothers in equal amounts.85 85 Benedicti regula, chap. 40, loc. cit., with McCann's commentary (ed. McCann, 1952, 186-87); and I, 296, 333; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 264; Lesne, 1925, 403. Then if, because of some need at a particular moment, inequality should be necessary because an inequality among guests necessitates an inequality in measurements, an elder brother86 86 See I, 333. of such standing that everyone will be certain of his honesty should be assigned to the junior cellarer, so that anything that has to be added or subtracted from anyone's portion will be considered a proper amount. But if the lord abbot or the provost or the dean, because of someone's illness, should order that man's portion to be altered for a day, two, three, or sometimes more, yet the junior cellarer himself or whoever has been appointed to support him should under no circumstances presume to give the excess to another or to protract the stated number of days for giving the restricted amount to the man himself. However, all other matters involving due propriety—such as relate to guests or the elders' table or generally to the supervision or procurement of all the brothers— should be the responsibility of the junior cellarer in person, to see that those entering, leaving, or waiting there or, as the saying goes, "dropping in," do not offend by bad manners or whatever may fall below the level of established moral probity. Those things which particularly appertain to the cooks, they should of course look after with the closest attention. Nevertheless, the aforesaid cellarer should not delegate any part of his stipulated responsibility, but should always observantly supervise and admonish, lest the aforesaid cooks presume. . .87 87 Lacuna in ms. in no wise those things which have been committed to them, to the end that at the expiration of the week, according to the prescription of the Rule, they may return the appurtenances of their ministry clean and whole.88 88 Benedicti regula, chap. 35; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 95-97; ed. McCann, 1952, 86-89; ed. Steidle, 1952, 226-28. The senior cellarer89 89 Ibid., chap. 31; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 87-89; ed. McCann, 1952, 80-83; ed. Steidle, 1952, 220-22; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 264. both within and without, that is, either in the refectory or in the kitchen or in those quarters which are attached to the kitchen, should take pains in all things and on behalf of all people, so that no one will presume to conduct himself there in ill-mannered activity or boisterous speech, either in person or in his work, except insofar as he accords in all ways with our religious profession. And it is not to be asked or required of that cellarer that he involve himself in the preparing of dishes, even if he himself wants to, and for that reason neglects for the moment that aforesaid supervision. Rather, in accordance with the authority of the Rule,90 90 Si maior congregatio fuerit, cellararius excusitus a coquina (Benedicti regula, chap. 35, loc. cit.). he should request additional help, if need be, so that he may always remain free for overseeing here and there those things which are of CORBIE, AACHEN, CORVEY, ST. GALL Corbie, Corvey, and St. Gall are apices of a nearly equilateral triangle. The densest settlement of the Empire and its political heartland, not shown on this small map, lay to the west, depending southward from Corbie and Paris. Charlemagne had no permanent seat but traveled prodigiously until, after 806, he "settled" if not permanently then at least frequently at Aachen. It may be seen as a hub of the eastern part of his Empire. * God. We do not speak these words in this context with a view to inhibiting his devout desires—whenever they can be satisfied without diminution of that aforesaid supervision—but to prevent his immersing himself, however devoutly, in those matters which are not important to his charge at the moment, and thereby presuming to set aside the demonstrable need for oversight which is imposed upon him. &lt;MONKS SERVING IN THE KITCHEN&gt;91 91 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 258; and I, 288-89. But to prevent the cellarer from saying that he does not know about what and in what the said cooks are to be directed to do or not to do, these matters among others are principally to be noted: First of all, the maintenance of silence does not wholly contribute to the carrying out of this duty during the period of assignment. Consequently, in order that the rule of silence can be observed with some attendant benefit by all those working there, the psalms are to be sung without surcease, and as long as even two cooks are there, the singing is not to be silenced for a moment.92 92 This reform is attributed directly and personally to Benedict of Aniane (Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 258). And when it happens that any cook should need to go away in pursuance of any duty whatever and for this reason should possibly not be able to begin the psalm, as soon as he returns he should join in at the place at which he finds the others chanting and try to sing with them as long as he is in the kitchen. And again, if a second or third should depart, each should join in with the chanters on his return. But even if for some exceptional reason, as occasionally happens, it should come about that everyone is indeed so involved that no one is able to rehearse the psalms in chant, then as soon as anyone is free he should repeat the interrupted psalm from that place at which he dropped it, and all the others, as they become free, should join in with him in the service in praise of the Lord. But also, if it even should happen that no one knows at what point they stopped the unfinished psalm, it should be resumed at the nearest point that can be recollected. Thus they should not abandon a piece which has been begun until they have sung through everything which could be considered a part of or related to that cursus. Then each, insofar as reason dictates, should return to those matters which remain to be done, always observing silence as far as may be possible. But to keep these matters from slipping anyone's mind, because of some earlier code, we herewith briefly formulate the three principles underlying all these statements: that is, either keep quiet if the matters are not essential, or say what is necessary, or else chant psalms. And next, we cannot be irresponsible with regard to this operation simply for the sake of adhering to the Order of Rotation. When it happens that the Order of Rotation calls for all juniors, or even too low a number of sagacious or reliable brothers, to serve in the kitchen, then we must pass over that provision and add to the contingent of juniors some reliable senior who, guided by the zeal of God, will earnestly watch over * himself and the others. Then when the period of his service is over, the one who was shifted to meet the emergency assignment should again move freely with the seniors. In such fashion it will be provided at all times in all ways that neither those who are ineffectual because of senility nor those who are undisciplined because of youth be exclusively assigned. Neither of these classes is sufficiently reliable to maintain equilibrium in any situation of this kind. Therefore, to insure that God's will always be preserved within and a proper dignity without, one or two mature brothers should always be assigned each week, as set forth above. And if anyone should say that this is not the correct procedure, but that the order in which the monks sit at table should always be adhered to, he should be ignored or reprimanded for holding a discordant opinion. If he should indiscreetly continue to complain and persistently be recalcitrant, he should more forcefully be persuaded to obey the sounder procedure. We explain these rules in such a clear and repetitive way that no one can claim ignorance, even the simpler—or had I better say stupider—monks. Moreover, in order that these rules may properly be observed, the dean and the cellarer must make provision many days in advance to assure that nothing—neither the incidence of some illness nor the event of a journey nor an emergency however unexpected, even an order of any kind from the lord abbot or provost—should ever disrupt this arrangement. Having set up the procedure in this way to assure constant vigilance, we must not neglect to point out that the cellarer, whenever he has the time, should in his own person assign the tasks for each brother, to insure that one brother does not have more or less than he ought to have because of the favoritism of someone in making assignments. The cellarer, who ought to know the weaknesses and needs of each brother, should make the assignments as required, according to clearly demonstrable needs. But if the cellarer does not have the time, then whomever he deputizes should always make the nominations cautiously, to avoid initiating some kind of trouble at that point. Such are the methods to be followed. For the laymen93 93 See I, 289. there is one clear statement: No one should enter the kitchen at any time that food is being prepared or the prepared food is being served. This rule applies both to the first sitting, when the body of brothers are at refection, and to the later sitting for the servers.94 94 Regulated by the Council of 816, c. XXVI (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 465). But if there is some food which is assigned to be prepared in advance or later cleaned or specially handled by laymen, some window, niche, or opening outside of the kitchen should be set up as a place where the brothers may pick up the food to be prepared or carry the food to be cleaned. By this method they can either set out or take in such food without giving any excuse for laymen entering the kitchen. Under this head a few particulars come to mind: Herbs of any kind which are to be converted to food must be delivered, washed, and bunched; similarly fish, whenever they are needed, must be disemboweled and scaled. All varieties of legumes must be washed and prepared, as must other products like them. The laymen must fully and honestly perform these tasks outside the kitchen as many times as is necessary, and in places assigned for the purpose. They must use great care to place or stack the food in a spot where the brothers can conveniently pick it up. And, as has already been said, they must completely avoid entering the kitchen at the proscribed times. Further, any wood which is to be gathered, cut, or suitably prepared should be delivered through the window we spoke of or through a convenient opening. If this procedure is followed, the laymen will not have to come in to the brothers, nor will the brothers have to go out to them. There may be some who think that there are too many regulations, but we have chosen rather to explain things one by one in sequence as each need has presented itself rather than to give anyone the opportunity of erring on the excuse that he did not know what he should do. The cellarer should try to supervise all these matters every day if time allows, to make sure that no trouble starts in the kitchen. In that way it will become customary, with God as Author, for everything to be done there politely and honorably. Then no one, however much a novice, will err out of ignorance. Therefore we leave all these matters to the wisdom of the cellarer, for we neither desire nor allow anyone to serve in that capacity who is rebellious or contradictory. But if—Heaven forbid!—it should happen that the senior cellarer himself, or a junior, does not prudently enforce those regulations and others like them which affect the office, and if, having been admonished in accordance with the Rule, he does not reform, he should leave the post with a wholly deserved bad reputation, since he would not be fit to stay. Above all let procedure remain clear and orderly. &lt;VI&gt; &lt;THE GATE AND THE TITHES&gt;95 95 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 108, 110, 111, 118, 119, 235-39, 241, 248-50, 265-66; Lesne, 1925, 408-18; and see I, 335, and II, 153. &lt;VI.1&gt; We have not wanted to insert anything about the gate of the monastery, or what concerns it, among those matters which have been taken up above because, with the Lord's guidance, we have decided that whatever belongs to the gate or its ministers from the tithes should be treated independently, item by item. &lt;THE PREBENDS WHO SERVE AT THE GATE&gt; Under this heading it should first be noted that particular care needs to be exercised with respect to the prebends appointed to serve there. There need to be enough of them, but under no circumstances more than are necessary. They are to be fed and clothed from the tithe itself, in the same amounts as are meted out to others. Hence they will neither suffer want nor be spoiled by overindulgence. Now it seems to us that ten prebends ought to be adequate for those who receive the guests and serve them. Likewise, that the prebends themselves should be provided with the same quality and quantity of food and drink as the rest of our prebends. That is, they should receive as a monthly allowance what is customary for the others, and also the customary amount of food and drink. But they should receive a modest allotment of clothing and footwear as has been described above, so that they may not be repulsive in rags or unsightly dress, or presume, on the other hand, to claim more than their due share. These statements concern prebends. . . . &lt;VI.2&gt; &lt;THE METHOD OF TITHING&gt;96 96 Although monasteries had long set aside some part of the tithe for distributing to the poor, Louis the Pious seems to have issued a decree that in some monasteries tithes of listed goods must be dispensed to paupers and pilgrims. Abbot Adalhard seems to have turned this decree into a memorandum at this point (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 389 n. 4). See above, p. 105, and cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 374, lines 5-18; and Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 236; Lesne, 1925, 410, and in Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique XIII, 1912, 479. . . . . Therefore it seems to us that if every tenth of all and in all is donated, as has been ordained, then that donation should suffice for all the needs of rich and poor of any kind. We mean by "every tenth" a tithe of those things which are freely contributed to the monastery either by the churches for charity work or by the brothers in different forms of physical or movable goods97 97 "Ut de omnibus in elemosinam datis tam aecclesiae quam fratribus decimae pauperibus dentur." (Council of 817, ix; Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 475; cf. pp. 528, 551, 560.) ; also anything that is acquired, by any means whatever, in different kinds of agricultural produce; or in the different varieties of animal stock that have been husbanded or that, by the dispensation of God, has been freely produced among the animals themselves without men's provision, like milk or wool; also hay and those things which grow freely in trees, such as pasturage and different kinds of fruit, should be turned in, as far as is practicable. According to what the season grants, these should be sufficient, depending upon the quality and quantity of each several item. We wish to make what we say even clearer: First, everything, just as described above, is to be paid in fully from our villas located in Amiénois, Artois, and Beauvaisis.98 98 These holdings listed in Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 233-34. See also ibid., 248, n. 218; Lesne, 1925, 411-12. Then if it happens that there is no possibility of workers making deliveries because of the long distance, with the Lord's guidance we have worked out a good arrangement in such an instance so that no portion of the tithe will be sacrificed or any resentment aroused among the poor. What we are saying is that the whole quantity and quality of produce which has been assembled in the far places and which by reason of distance is impossible to handle if it is in sheaves or hay, though it could be handled if it were spelt, is still subject (under the inspiration of God) to a saving arrangement of another kind, under which no community will be oppressed, nor will the tithe be excused. But before we may say how the arrangement itself can be effected in a reasonable way, we entreat the good will of all those who are assigned to administer these matters. Otherwise either the plan may seem impossible for them or they may become wearied if, in the discussion and working out of details, we prolong the treatment of the topic too much, in our concern for a satisfactory solution of present and future operations. Yet all the while we are merely trying to make sure by such discussion how it can be effected without transgression in the eyes of God or shortcoming in the eyes of the world. &lt;TITHING GRAIN&gt; It seems to us, therefore, not to be a bad thing but rather quite a good thing (in line with the principle set forth above) to have all that agricultural produce which can be tithed by bundles so handled that each crop be levied for tithe according to its species. Moreover, there should be certification after exact measurement how many bundles of that species produce a modius. In this connection it is very important to be sure that each several crop from the various fields be separately tithed, because, as we all know, even though they may be of one sort, the crops in all fields do not turn out to be equally good or fruitful. And therefore it is necessary that in the several villas God-fearing men be chosen for doing this, and that they be strictly warned by their masters that they should not try to cheat here or there, or tally more or less than the true account. Now we have pursued this matter in order that no doubt can exist that after the inventory has been established by a reliable method, if all the sheaves are properly examined for tithing, as many modii ought to come in the tithe for each several crop as if they had been paid in another location. In the same fashion the hay is to be weighed and accounted carefully and judiciously to determine how many cartloads are to be brought for tithe, so that the same amount of the same quality can be restored in another place. But though we have presented this signal plan in writing, which may quite possibly seem unnecessary to some people, we now unfold it with even greater precision by showing more fully how it works in specified villas. Observe: As we all know, it is not only very difficult but virtually impossible without very serious distress for the communities at Waliacum and Montiacum, at Haino-Villare and Domnus Aglinus,99 99 Waliacum = Wailly, dept. Pas-de-Calais; Montiacum = Monchy-aux-Bois, Pas-de-Calais; Haino-Villare = Hainvillers, Oise; Domnus Aglinus = Le Donacre, Pas-de-Calais. "The vassi, in short, whose beneficium is found to be at an excessive distance from Corbie, have the right to sell the tithe of their indominicatum which they owe to the porta [see Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 402, lines 14-25]. It follows then, from these facts, that we must not underestimate the role which the agricultural produce of a domain like that of Corbie played in the commerce of the Carolingian age. At the same time, we should see the other side, the contribution of regional or inter-regional commerce to it. So it is necessary to understand properly the importance, in connection with monetary circulation, of the sale of that agricultural produce. In this respect the Statutes of Adalhard furnish examples whose significance depends upon interpretation of many nuances by which in time there emerges a picture of an important monetary circulation and yet strictly limited in its extent." (Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 248-49, after H. Van Werveke.) Adalhard speaks delicately and obscurely in advancing his revolutionary proposal that in pairs of villas, one near and one far, the near villa provide double the produce and be recompensed in money from the local sale of the produce of the far villa. as well as at certain other places, to arrange for delivery to the monastery of the kind of crop that is harvested in sheaves or the hay stacked there in the field. But if it is threshed there and the resulting grain either sold or delivered, all the straw, which is likewise needed by the brothers100 100 That is, within the compound. in the off-season for use according to its quality, will be unavailable, though its contribution would be, as we have said, almost equally requisite. With these facts in mind, if both here and there the problem is considered either with respect to the size of the villas or the quantity of produce each successive year, possibly a double tithe may be paid in without great inconvenience by the villas nearer the monastery. In this way the evils listed above, either debasement of the tithing or distress for the community, may easily be avoided. But, not to obfuscate what we say, or the end we want to obtain by saying it, it is necessary that we specify certain villas between which such an interchange could be effected without detriment: We therefore join together Waliacum and Vernum.101 101 Vernum = Vaire-sous-Corbie, dept. Somme (cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 380, line 8). When Vernum's tithe has been rendered and transported to the monastery, then let the commissioner state from the evidence of these very sheaves with respect to each of the several kinds of grain how much in Vernian grain would be the equal of the same tithe which has been levied at Waliacum. Then that tithe should be brought to the monastery either in bundles of whole, uncut grain or simply as hay. Now this should be understood, that under no conditions do we want that community to bring the second tithe through the long stretch of empire to the monastery. The porter should hire carts for himself as the season and the availability of carts then dictate.102 102 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 250. We do not by this remark say that the porter himself should rush about103 103 Cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 445, x. and make inventory of that tithe at Walliacum or on his own account render a judgment about its sufficiency. Rather, through the provost and through the agent104 104 actorem. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 238. of the villas, such God-fearing ministers, faithfully keeping trust in all matters, should be chosen as may carry on the work there and here without any kind of deceit. The porter then would have no worry except that of collecting the goods. Yet, on written request, he would always receive all produce every year, so that he would be able to know, if need arose, whether the ministers themselves were performing this function in good faith. This exemplary instance of these two villas should sufficiently explain how, in this pattern, other villas, two by two, one located far away and the other nearby, will be joined together whenever they easily and expediently can be joined. In this way, as suggested above, the nearer towns pay a double tithe. That same oft-mentioned tithe is to be brought to the monastery without diminution, and the community is in no way to be distressed. The villas thus joined are: Montiacus and Albiniacus; Templum Martis and Vila; Habronastus with Campania, and Waniacum; Fortiacavilla with Walhonocurtis, and Saliacus; Filconovillaris and Tittonomontis; Haionovillaris and Tanedas; Domnus Aglinus and Domnus Audoinus.105 105 Montiacus = Monchyaux-Bois, dept. Pas-de-Calais; Albiniacus = Aubigny, dept. Somme; Templum Martis = Talmas, Somme; Vila = Ville-sous-Corbie, Somme; Habronastus = Havernas, Somme; Campania = Campagne, Somme; Waniacum = Gagny, Somme; Fortiacavilla = Forceville, Somme; Walhonocurtis = Warlincourt, Pas-de-Calais; Saliacus = Sailly-le Sec or Sailly-Laurette, Somme; Filconovillaris = Foncquevillers, Pas-de-Calais; Tittonomontis = (?); Haionovillaris = Hainvillers, dept. Oise; Tanedas = Thennes, Somme; Domnus Aglinus = Le Donacre, Pas-de-Calais; Domnus Audoinus = Demuin, Somme. However, each one of the following should pay only its own tithe: Paliortus, Alas, Haionocurtis and Arvillaris, Cipiliacus, Cirisiacus, Galliacus, and Wadonocurtis.106 106 Paliortus = Paillart, Oise; Alas = (?); Haionocurtis = Hénencourt, Somme; Arvillaris = Arvillers, Somme; Cipiliacus = Chipilly, Somme; Cirisiacus = Cérisy-Gailly, Somme; Galliacus = Gailly, Somme; Wadonocurtis = Vadencourt, Somme. Chipilly and Aubigny were two of the several villas in the foundation endowment of Queen Balthilda (Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 122). We intentionally set these latter villas aside because they are not so far away that they cannot deliver their tithes. But then if and when at some location the crop does not grow or a tempest levels it or it has to remain in the fields, there will always be something available at these villas, from which the loss can be made up. But if another, better arrangement or pairing of the listed villas can be found, we should not object to trying it. Just as we have said, the end in view is the predetermined plan which will remain in force; and as far as possible the double tithe should be levied on the nearer villas because of the burden on the porter, who has to assemble the necessary carts, as has been explained. Now, whenever these carts need to be rented, the porter should do whatever needs to be done through the agency of his assistant, for it is shameful for him to do it himself, as if he could find no man whom he could rightly trust.107 107 Ibid., 250, n. 233. According to Levillain, Examen critique, 1902, 196ff, the original endowment of Queen Balthilde and King Clothaire III consisted of the following lands in the regions of Amiens and Arras: Corbie, Foulloy, Gentelles, Chipilly, Aubigny, Monchy-aux-Bois, Wailly, Beaurains, Talmas, and a pagena of woodland in the forest of La Vicogne and part of a forest at a place called Thésy. In 716 King Chilperic II, at the instance of his father Childeric II, confirmed to the monastery the concession of certain revenues in the nature of a levy on the marketplace of Fos, near Marseilles, which King Clothaire III had also yielded to the monks of Corbie. With this concession was included a patent (tractoria) which excused the abbey from the cost of food and lodging for envoys sent from Corbie to supervise the transport; moreover Fos would defray the cost of transport. By this patent the abbey annually received: 10,000 pounds of oil, 30 hogsheads of a condiment called garum, 30 pounds of pepper, 150 pounds of cumin, 2 pounds of cloves, 1 pound of cinnamon, 2 pounds of nard, 30 pounds of costus(?), 50 pounds of dates, 100 pounds of figs, 100 pounds of almonds, 10 pounds of pistacios, 100 pounds of olives, 50 pounds of an aromatic called hidrio, 150 pounds of chickpeas, 20 pounds of rice, 10 pounds of golden pimento, 10 seoda(?) skins, 10 skins of Cordova, 50 hands of papyrus. The exemption of the cost of transport was only slightly less valuable than the cost of the goods themselves. As Levillain remarked, the novelty of the charter of Chilperic II was that the concession was perpetual. The stipulation of papyrus in the confirmation of Chilperic is noteworthy, since it is widely believed that trade in papyrus had been cut off by the Moslems before the year 716. Since papyrus disintegrates rather rapidly, we have here an indication of a reason for disappearance of early Corbie deeds and charters. &lt;CROPS TO BE TITHED&gt; Spelt, or barley, which like spelt is reaped with its grain, should be brought from the villas in which it grew on the determination of the domain;108 108 ex iussione dominica = "the constituted authority," whatever it may be in the particular instance. similarly, flax, wool, turnips,109 109 Naves. Not recorded (?) by lexicographers, but compare napus &gt; OF navel = navew. and all legumes, which are to be tithed together in a group before being separated into the various kinds, must also be delivered. Nothing at any place should remain untithed. With respect to garden produce, what is customarily grown in the various locations, such as leeks, shallots, algi,110 110 Sic. Not recorded. Pole-beans (?) &lt; alligere? or other similar varieties which can reasonably be sold, should be sold for either money or grain, and the payments brought to the porter. With respect to fruit, the same method should be followed wherever and whenever it is reasonable to do so. Moreover, if there are any other crops, however small, a tithe should be paid on them in the same way. &lt;ANIMALS TO BE TITHED&gt; For the time being, these edicts are adequate. Now we must consider all cattle and their husbandry. But before there is specific treatment of each kind of herd, we wish to call attention to this edict governing them all: Of every ten quadrupeds in any herd, the tenth should be handed over. If there are nine animals beyond every group of ten, the ninth should be handed over; likewise, if eight, the eighth; if seven, the seventh; and so on down to one. If there is only one more than ten, then that one must be handed over. In this tithing the Lord's precept111 111 Leviticus xxvii, 33. that one animal may not be selected or changed for another—that is, a poor animal exchanged for a good one or a better for a worse—must be carefully observed. The tenth animal to appear after the herd has proceeded single file through an opening in some fence should be handed over in tithe, no matter what the quality is. But if there are not ten, then the ninth, eighth, or even first, if there are no more, as has just been said. Now first, the draught animals. All the foals born in one year must be tithed in that year. Then the herdsman must care for them, just as diligently as he cares for the rest of the herd, until they are a year old. If the porter wishes, the herdsman must care for them until they are two years old. If, however, the porter should want to take them earlier, that is his right. Since he cannot leave them in the herdsman's care more than two years, he should give his attention to converting them for the benefit of the aforesaid gate by either selling or bartering them in some way. Therefore, we want them to be tithed soon after they are born so that if one should accidentally die through human negligence, the porter may know through whose negligence it came about. This is the porter's task, not the agent's or the mayor's.112 112 See above, p. 113, and cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 392, l. 18. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 238, n. 179. As for calves, the same procedure should be observed either in keeping them through a two-year period or in supervising their care. The milk must also be tithed to the monastery. * The same procedure applies in each detail to the lambs: They are either tithed or fattened for two years. All their wool, however, must be paid in to the porter. Then the rest of the wool, that obtained by shearing the other sheep, whether large or small, and the other lambs, must be tithed immediately upon shearing without any selection for quality, color, or weight, and brought to the porter at the monastery. The milk, like that of the aforesaid cows, should be tithed to the monastery. In tithing and caring for goats, too, the same pattern that we have described for lambs is to be followed in every detail. If the milk of the she-goats is brought to the monastery, it should be tithed there; but if not, the agent and the mayor at each villa having goats should assume the responsibility for supervising in every detail the collection of the tithe in the form of cheeses. In this case, whatever tithe accrues each month should be brought to the gate and should not be allowed to go bad from over-aging. The tithing of pigs is difficult because the times at which they conceive and produce their young are inevitably unpredictable. It is therefore hard to regulate the tithing in the same way that the tithing of other animals has been regulated above. Consequently, in this instance we have thought it good to center attention on the exigencies of the full year and to set a fixed number in the light of what we consider adequate for our needs. Of pigs which are at least moderately fat, this number should be delivered at the gate, whether or not there is grazing land for them. However, if there shall have been abundant grazing land and the swine are fully fattened, then even very fat swine should be brought to the gate. Therefore, because the year is based on fifty-two weeks in this as in all matters, it seems to us that two swine each week could be a sufficient number under this head, always excepting those which the porter wishes to care for himself. With respect to these shoats, since, with the help of God, he will have adequate grain supply, he should plan ahead and see to it that from what he can supply from his own husbandry he will have enough under this head for entertaining guests. . . . Moreover, when their season arrives, it will be in his power to take whatever sheep he wants from his tithe. Also, whenever the time for using rams comes around, he should take as many as he wants from the ten sheepfolds where in the summer the brothers manufacture cheese. With these animals as with all others, the tenth youngling is his. And when the tithed lambs from the other flocks can live healthily away from their mothers, they too are in his control. He may want to transfer some of these out of the flock before the two-year period is finished because he decides to put them in with the aforesaid ten flocks which are cared for at the monastery. The purpose would be to have them at hand and be able to extract them when, and to the amount that, he might wish. But meanwhile, up to the time said sheep, which have been tithed in this year, have become two- or three-year-olds, he may even subtract from the aforesaid ten flocks according to an agreement between him and the herd-master113 113 magister gregum. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 237; and see I, 264ff. which insures both that the flocks will not be depopulated beyond measure and that the guests will not suffer unreasonable deprivation or want. Then there are the rules for tithing lambs from the joint flocks: We have said that they are to be organized into the ten flocks which provide the monastery with cheese in the summer. The purpose is always to have enough at hand there to be able to provide abundantly for any guests without constantly needing, because of the distance to the villas, to tire out the porter or shepherd114 114 pastor. or some other man. The actual delivery of the lambs should be the mayor's, not the porter's, responsibility. Consequently, when the porter shall have ordered them delivered to the aforesaid flocks, the mayor should have it done. But if the aforesaid tithed sheep, when they become two- or three-year-olds, should number more than the ten flocks, or more than the shepherds can manage, the porter should consult with the herdmaster about the course to follow: whether to sell, kill, hang, or try to exchange them for swine. This exchange would serve the purpose of providing suckling pigs at a time when the sheepfolds were not productive, as we mentioned before with respect to the other sucklings.115 115 Cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 396-97. However, if there is not enough grain to keep them an entire winter, the porter can kill and hang some of them, keeping the others alive. In this way he can always have a few suckling-pigs. In the process he should be sure that everything that needs to be provided and maintained for the requisite integrity of the gate and the monastery in its reception of guests will be procured at the proper time, so that it will be ready at the proper time. However supererogatory these directions may seem to some men, we nevertheless choose painfully to employ phrases clear to the less intelligent and through these writings of ours to eliminate any possibility for mistake, rather than to have the porter encounter some occasion that induces error inconsonant with our religious life. We therefore feel that the aforesaid master of the ten flocks and porter should work together in this operation, so that by common agreement they may profitably arrange whatever is suitable for regulating these tithes. Along with the porter's lay apprentices, they may take care of everything. The end result should be that there be no need for the aforesaid porter or any of the monks to run here and there outside the monastery to procure some item; but according to this outline of operations they may arrange everything and receive the tithes in orderly fashion even while they reside quietly in the monastery, away from the tumult of the outside world. &lt;VI.3&gt; These statements about wethers, as follows: The procedure followed is not the same as that for foals, calves, and kids. The 532. LUTTRELL PSALTER (CA. 1340) BEEHIVE WITH 15 BEES BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS. 41230, fol. 204r [by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] The fourteenth-century "skep" illustrated above would have been the same as in Adalhard's day. The art of weaving such hives from grass and straw was discovered in western Germany about the time of Christ and was standard thereafter in teutonic lands. That bees and honey are not mentioned in Adalhard's text indicates lacunae in transmission. Bees were among the first domesticated food producers, "land of milk and honey" was a commonplace of ancient societies, and honey was the only practical sweetener known to Carolingians. Isidore describes (Etym. XX, iii) nine honey drinks, including mead (hydromel) and medicinal potions. Inevitably monastic regularity was compared with the bees' economy, especially in the light of Virgil's Fourth Georgic, devoted to the art of beekeeping and containing such lines as: Some say that unto bees a share is given of the Divine Intelligence . . . Each into his starry rank Alive they soar, and mount the heights of heaven. lines 220-21, 228-29 (trans. Rhoades) * porter should endeavor, by keeping them no more, if not less, than two years, to convert them, as has been said, by sale or barter, to the benefit of the hospice in any way which seems reasonable and most effective. Moreover, every tenth goose or chicken fed in the poultry yards of the domain should be rendered to the porter. Of the rest of the chickens which the community pays in, if they are delivered to the monastery, the porter should take a tenth on delivery. If the poultry is redeemed for money, a tenth of the money should be rendered to him. As far as can be, eggs are to be treated in the same way, whether they are brought to the monastery or redeemed at the villas. We urge that no one consider these rulings excessive or unnecessary for proper operation; for in any operation nothing can be found to be excessive which is exacted for the sake of God rather than of man. Appositely, the Author of the human race Himself deigned to speak in just this way to the Pharisees, mentioning tithing of mint and anise, among other things. And He added, "These things you ought to have done, and not to leave those undone."116 116 Matthew xxiii, 23. Because the reason why these words were said is known to all literate and intelligent men, we therefore need not dilate at length, but merely allude to them briefly. It is more fitting that this passage should provide the incentive for any wise and intelligent man to leave no part of it undone, than that such men should presume to deride the things which are ordered or required to be given to God, as if they could be laughed off. &lt;THE TITHE OF MILLS&gt;117 117 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 243, 249. See above, pp. 106-107, and cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 376, lines 10-28. And moreover though up to the present it has not been customary, we want above all that the full tithe from all our mills be given at the gate, and always be given first—before any of the product be distributed, whether to the widows' share or for any other use or purchase or sale or prebend of any sort. Rather, any actions of this kind should occur later in other locations. Regarding the delivery of the tithe to the porter, it is suitable for him to send his apprentice, who shall either haul it with his own oxen or, better, supervise other carts hired at his expense. &lt;MALTHOUSES AND BREWS TO BE TITHED&gt; From malthouses, and the brews which come from malthouses, we likewise desire that the tenth modius of the brews which have been made be set aside to give to the porter before they are delivered to the monastery. If it happens that there is not enough remaining from which the manorial obligation may be filled, and it cannot be filled from those same malthouses, the shortage should be made up from the manorial grain supply which has already been tithed. Then the porter should not be given a tithe from this latter amount. But, as has already been said, the porter should through his own supervision arrange to have his malt fixed for him from the grain brought to be milled. Then if he does not have enough from that source, he should associate a knowledgeable man with him, who will prepare as much malt as will suffice.118 118 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 250. &lt;THE TITHE OF HOPS&gt;119 119 Ibid., 241; Lesne, 1925, 414; and see I, 261-63. Also, after the hops come to the monastery, a tenth portion of each lot should be given to the porter over several months. However, if this amount does not suffice for him, he should acquire enough for his needs by purchase or by some other method. In these ways he should have enough for making his allowances of beer. Similarly the provost, if it should become necessary for him, should contribute from the manorial substance so that under no circumstances would he make demands on the community itself beyond its legitimate rent.120 120 See above, p. 106 and cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, p. 375, l. 8. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 241, n. 196. Yet this should be understood: the manorial bakers themselves should bake every loaf of bread needed at the gate. Likewise the manorial brewers should brew all the beer. But the porter should contribute the grain and malt from his stores. Then as often as the amount which he has given shall have been used up in beer or bread, he should add a new supply so that the product should always come from his ingredients and not from those of the manor. &lt;VI.4&gt; THERE WILL BE THIS FURTHER CONSIDERATION REGARDING BREAD AND BEER . . . &lt;The Gathering of Wood&gt;121 121 Lesne, 1925, 414-15. . . . that, just as the porters furnish the grain and malt on their own from the tithes which are given them, so also identically the firewood should be turned over in the amount which they, in consultation with the other ministers, consider necessary for their task of preparing both. Hence it is necessary that every load of wood which our whole community delivers to the monastery for the yearly needs be tithed as with all else, and then placed in a separate location, yet within the compound. And this arrangement is necessary to prevent the porters from touching the specified allotment when they begin to run short on wood for other uses—wood which they have to furnish from their own resources—and thus be shorted on both counts, just as we have seen happen this year. And therefore the wood which might have been needful for the comfort of the guests, or for any other needs at the gate in the course of the whole year, should be delivered during the summer outside the gate of the monastery and then stored in places suitable for use in such a way that there may always be enough in every hospice for those who properly should receive it, while it is kept safe from every type of chicanery. For these reasons we have said that, notwithstanding the great need for it, that wood is to be stacked by itself around the monastery, lest we might seem to have opened the door for its being dissipated, even though for necessary uses, and consequently being in short supply. Now that we have in this manner dealt with the provision of wood, we should move on to other topics. &lt;VI.5&gt; WITH REGARD TO TITHES WHICH OUR VASSALS OR OUR BENEFICIARIES122 122 Vassi vel cassati homines. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 236. OWE, THE TOLL IS THIS: Of everything whatsoever that they may produce from the soil for their own use, such as grain, wine, vegetables, fruit, or other main or secondary crops produced, they must deliver in payment to the monastery tithes on every item. Furthermore, they should try to tithe in the same way those things which spring up as volunteers, such as fruit, hay, or anything else for which man is not so much required to work as that the providence of omnipotent God wills that not only men but also animals feed upon it. These products, too, they should deliver to the monastery with pious goodwill in the fashion described. With every different kind of animal they should exercise a like responsibility. Hence from draft animals to chickens or eggs, there shall be no livestock of any sort which they have reared (or anything which is given a vassal in annual payment by his workers of the kinds we have enumerated above or of those which we now mention) which should remain at his manor untithed, insofar as it can be identified and reasonably be processed. Now if anyone should not fully understand these statements or should have any doubt in his mind about them— by what method or with what intensity they should be effected— let him come to the monastery and ask the masters of the monastery. In the same fashion that they are ordered to carry out their affairs in serving the monastery, so should he conduct his own affairs.123 123 This sentence effectively puts in words the primary contribution of monasticism to western culture—that the monastery was a living model of Christian daily conduct, synthesizing Roman and Teutonic culture. But if the man's beneficium is located rather too far away to be able to deliver the sheaves or hay without excessive cost, let him ascertain how much the tithe amounts to and make arrangements with the porter concerning a time when he might satisfactorily sell these same. Then he should bring the money from his sale to the porter, without any deceit or shortage. However, if the porter should prefer to collect the produce in his own cart and deliver it to the monastery rather than to put it up for sale at the manor, that is his prerogative.124 124 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 248-51. Let it also be understood that those who hold as many as four manses in beneficium should pay their own tithe to the monastery according to the method described above. Those who hold fewer should, of course, fully pay their tithes in the same way, but not to the monastery. They should pay to that church or chapter at which the community which holds the land customarily pays its own tithe. All beneficiaries125 125 beneficiarii. of St. Peter ought to have this directive so that they will know how to proceed, and so that no one can plead ignorance as an excuse. But, as has been stated, if he should have any question, he should go to the monastery, where all the regulations regarding tithes are systematically recorded. And there he can learn how he ought to perform. DIAGRAM: ALLOTMENT OF SWINE one symbol represents 10 swine THE GATE 60 THE CELLARER 370 THE PREBENDS 120 THE ABBOT 50 TOTAL 600 Adalhard apparently regarded horses and cattle (BOVES, even VITULI) as draft animals, sheep and hogs as edibles (cf. above, p. 114), as did Isidore of Seville (ETYMOLOGIES XI, 1, 5). Like Homer in the Circe incident, Isidore thought PORCI unclean (i, 25), but Adalhard uses only PORCI and never the less odious APER, SUS, or VERSES. "Flitch" (early Teutonic FLICCI), used here to translate BACCO(NES), also early Teutonic, in later usage meant a "side"—therefore two to an animal; but Adalhard clearly meant that one animal yields one flitch. CELLARARIUS become in Middle English "sty-ward, steward," a keeper of a cell or pantry, not a pigsty. &lt;VII&gt; &lt;THE NUMBER AND ALLOTMENT OF SWINE&gt;126 126 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 106, 257, 261-62, 264-65; and see I, 74, 307; II, 289-96. This is the number and this is the allotment of swine which are killed at our cellar during the year. If the number at hand is ever less than 600, then the swine should not be slaughtered. The allotment shall be fourfold: First, sixty shall be given to the gate, whole except for the sungias127 127 Meaning unknown (&lt; sumen?) ; at the disposal of the cellarer, 370; for the needs of the prebends who receive stipends, 120. The fifty that remain should be reserved for whatever the abbot desires. OF THE THREE PARTS WHICH STAY WITH THE CELLARER, THIS SHOULD BE THE DISTRIBUTION: From the 370, the cellarer should provide the full meat allowances for the infirm, the vassals, and all other allowances as we have stipulated, except for those who receive distributions at the gate and those prebends who receive allowances. And consequently 370 are allocated for this purpose, so that for each day of the year—365, that is—the cellarer will have a flitch of bacon with its entrails.128 128 minutia. Primarily consumed as sausage. And we have arranged to add another five to make 370 because we very much prefer to have some surplus rather than shortage. But also we want those 370 so that they can be dispensed as follows: When they have first been hung, thirty flitches with all their entrails should always be set aside, so that throughout the twelve months each month will always have its thirty flitches with their entrails hung by themselves. And, if it is possible, we would like the cellarer always to plan ahead for the time when he releases the thirty flitches with their entrails during each several month, and ascertain man by man who should receive fat or flesh. In this way he can ensure a fair distribution to them. Now if he should lack fat, he may take from those fifty swine which we have ordered reserved for our needs, and thus fill out the allowances. Likewise, if he should lack entrails he may take an amount from that reserve to fill out that allowance. But he should be careful not to encroach upon that other meat and fat which is being kept for the following month before the first of the following month. But if he has fat or entrails left over from the first month, he should set it aside for reserve in its place, beginning on the first of the next month the allotment for that month and distributing that month's allowance in the manner stipulated above. Then if he should be short, he should get what he needs, whether fat or meat or both, from what was left over from the earlier month. But if he should not have enough even when he follows this method, he may then return to those fifty which had been set aside for the needs of the abbot. However, if, after the second month has passed, he should find that for two successive months he has a leftover stock of fat or meat or both with which he can supply the third month, let him take it and do it. Then to the amount that he is short, let him add as much as is necessary from the third month, which he is then in. And what is left over from the third month, let him reserve for the fourth; from the fourth, for the fifth. He should always proceed in this way from month to month, expressly observing this, that he should never take from a future month for the present, but should carry over any remainder from the present into the future. And we do not want him to move this meat or fat which is left over through the several months from one place of hanging to another, but to allow it to hang in its own spot, where it has hung throughout, until he shall use it in the second or third month to come, in the stipulated way. Nor do we want that cellarer to require either that the entrails should run evenly with the lard or that the lard run evenly with the entrails throughout the several months. But the lard should run according to a plan for it, and the entrails according to a plan for them; for there is no other method that works as well. We know that the agent responsible for providing it should not begin to distribute the lard and entrails of any one year in equal amounts or at the same time, because the entrails are good for distribution just as soon as they have been rendered. The longer they are kept, the more they will deteriorate, inevitably. But well-rendered lard cannot be eaten as soon as it has been made, and is not properly aged before Easter. And so it follows from this that we should look for a plan that allows the cellarer who begins his office on the first of January to begin to distribute the new meat through these four months, and yet not touch the new lard before the first of May. But he should have in storage enough old lard from the preceding year to be able to distribute it through the four months up to May 1, according to the ration for each month, as has been stipulated. Then from May 1 through the eight months up to January 1 again, he should distribute the meat and new lard together at the same time. To achieve this result, he should always run the entrails from January 1 to January 1, but the lard from May 1 to May 1. Nor do we want to have counted in that total the lard or those sausages which are made from the swine which come from the mills or those sausages which are made from the swine from which alabum129 129 Meaning unknown. is made. And likewise the entrails are not to be counted if, as is customary when swine have been fed on a rich pasturage of acorns, they yield an amount exceeding the normal yield. Now we wish to keep all these categories separate, as a reserve in case it should become necessary for the cellarer to have them in order to be equipped to care for whomsoever he should, fully and abundantly. Yet the administration of every step should always be carried out with the intention that, when the new season of production arrives, it will be possible to deliver the quota in each instance in the amount and kind that is being used at present, or in the amount that has been reserved in the past for the next year. And this above all we desire, just as we have already said, that the cellarer should see to it that there is no discrepancy in the amount which he is supposed to hand over to the succeeding cellarer, whether of old or of new lard or of meat. Whatever is in stock should be declared in writing to be in order and be shown by inventory to be in order, bin by bin. Now with respect to the meat itself, in whatsoever station it is to be dispensed, there is as well a procedure which we want our monastic officials130 130 ministeriales. Provost, deans, and those directly responsible for order in the cloister, evidently the magistri monasterio referred to in the section on tithes (see above, p. 117, and cf. Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 402. l. 17). to study and understand thoroughly: For if we count those forty days in Lent when no one may touch meat, and add to those the forty-six Fridays which lie outside of Lent when virtually no one may touch meat, we find eighty-six days.131 131 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 257. Many also customarily abstain before the Nativity of the Lord, and there is scarcely any mature man who does not to some degree abstain from meat. Consequently we wish to make record of these facts, because if some need should arise either in connection with travel or work or any other need whatsoever, requiring the giving out of whole sides of bacon or entrails, or if the cellarer should be constrained by some emergency to dispense a larger amount than we have stipulated above, it still should not become necessary for the allowance which we have ordained to be altered, unless an excessive amount is given out. For if such a demand should turn out to be slight or of no account, there would be very little need to alter the standard allowance, even though it could give rise to an increase in the amount available at some future time. We stress this again and again, that whatever under this heading anyone is called upon to do, he should strive to do to the utmost of his ability, to the pleasure of God and the gratitude of men, and always be in control of the delivery of proper amounts in each several allocation. With respect to the second allocation, in which there are 120 for the needs of prebends who receive stipends, the cellarer ought to receive ten sides of bacon each month for the purpose of making ten stipends, and distribute one side for each stipend. Now if each of these sides does not make an individual stipend, we shall thereafter consult with him about means of filling out the amounts. For if anyone has received more than the amount, the cellarer should subtract from it and give to him who does not have enough. If he does it this way each month, he will never depart from his proper tally. Yet according to the schedule above, he has to begin the distribution of lard from May 1, and from that point distribute by tens each month in such a fashion that there will remain after that anchor date a sufficient amount for the subsequent cellarer to last him in turn to May 1. But under the direction of abbot or provost or dean, he should process such sausages as he can make from those 120 swine. Then if it should turn out that for any reason he lacks sausages in proper amount from his own, and even from those fifty swine, he should tell this to his masters and receive as much as may be needed outside that allocation. For this very reason, we do not allot those entrails to any particular purpose except under pressure of necessity, because if, by the gift of the Lord, something should be left over for us, we hope to make the distribution from old lard or old entrails rather than from the new. With respect to the third portion, to which the fifty are allocated, if according to what has been said above they should be needed for any monthly purveyance, they should be used; but if not, then the full amount should be left to the decision of the abbot. NOW THE FIRST ALLOCATION WHICH SHOULD BE FOR THE GATE The whole sixty should be hung in the larder. Then according to that method whereby the cellarer distributes from month to month in thirties, so the porter should make his distribution by ones through each several week. And just as the cellarer does not move the leftovers from place to place, neither should the porter do it; but he should carry to the gate whatever should be needed, and what is left over he should leave there. And we have arranged to add eight swine above the number of weeks in a year, which are fifty-two, so that, as need arises, he can draw upon the extra ones and not touch those allotted to future weeks. &lt;VIII&gt; FINALLY, THE BROTHERS' VESTRY132 132 The vestryman was under jurisdiction of the chamberlain; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 109, 243, 266; see I, 335. . . .

That on Sunday everyone who by any means can do so should assemble for public mass, and that officials should stand in order of rank and the others should follow next, in order of convenience. VI. That on Sunday itself, or on other days when the Office is observed outside, no one is to remain in the sacristy except the one who has to supervise it or has been ordered specifically to do so, but not the week's reader. VII. That anyone who cannot chant and read from the ambo134 134 De cruce decantare et legere qui non potest: so Du Cange, s.v. crux. should be excused, and he who can should never avoid it, and he who performs carelessly should be castigated. VIII. Of sleepers. IX. On the omission of short responds, antiphons, verses, and lections. X. That seats are not to be changed. XI. On those who do not chant the psalms or who chant meanly. XII. On those who talk when they should be praying and, if they are not talking, respond nothing or respond inaudibly. XIII. The Kyrie eleison. XIV. On going out for Nocturns, and what ought to be done about those who come late to Nocturns, especially on Sundays. XV. Regarding the fact that even during the night chattering and giggling goes on there among some while the Office135 135 opus Dei. is in progress, and that some even incite the same behavior in others who are not acting in that way. XVI. The place reserved for reading. XVII. The ranks in choir.136 136 de ordinibus in loco. Semmler notes ambiguity here; the alternative meaning: "The relative status of officials in the hierarchy." XVIII. Sandals. XIX. That deacons, after taking up the book, read the Gospel before the altar and, after having read the Gospel, withdraw from the altar. XX. The fact that very few remain for Sext on that day. XXI. That when it is time for Communion, if the elders wish they should signal to the juniors at the proper moment for them to proceed. XXII. That when the feasts of the Apostles or any like occasion occurs, the same method should be followed with respect to Communion. XXIII. That the priests, after the completion of their Mass, should attend Sext or Nones if they can conveniently do so.137 137 Up to this point the rubrics have related to the opus Dei. XXIV. The dormitory. XXV. Loud talking. XXVI. The coming together of two or three. XXVII. All disturbance or commotion or noise. XXVIII. The refectory.138 138 See I, 267-81; Benedicti regula c. 41; Council of 817, i (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 473). XXIX. The Verse to be chanted.139 139 For example: "Rising from chapter, all standing together should say the Verse three times, with the prior beginning, Deus in adiutorium meum intende [Ps. lxix, 2], adding the Gloria Patri, and genuflecting. After rising from the Lord's Prayer, the prior should say Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini, with the others responding, Qui fecit caelum et terram. Then they should go, either together or separately, to the work assigned them, preserving silence. Let them sing their psalms either together or in twos or ones as is suitable, saying nothing else unless it chance that they have to whisper something about the singing itself."—Memoriale (ca. 780) III (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 238-39). XXX. Miserere mei Deus.140 140 Ps. 50. "Possibly in this passage Adalhard is referring to the psalmos graduales which Benedict abbot of Aniane instituted." (Semmler) XXXI. On absence. XXXII. Prolonging the lection.141 141 "After lection in Chapter (which Chapter is held after Prime), each should depart for the work which the prior has ordered for him" —Ordo Casinensis I, 2 (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 101). XXXIII. The lection for blood-letting. XXXIV. On silence in the infirmary or when someone dies. XXXV. On obedience: that they should not come late; that after they have arrived they should proceed with silence or chant; that they should not leave there without permission simply because a few have come there.142 142 "That some of the senior wardens of the monastery should go out with the brothers in obedience while others should remain to watch over the monastery."—Council of 816, chap. 32 (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 466). XXXVI. The rest period. XXXVII. Supervision of the cloister. XXXVIII. The mutual nod when they meet. XXXIX. On secular names.143 143 puris nominibus: "No one of the brothers should call another by his secular name, but as the Rule prescribes, seniors should call their juniors brothers, and juniors should call seniors their nonnos, which is a paternal reverence. Then the abbot should be called lord and father." —Memoriale, IV (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 241), after Benedicti regula, chap. 63, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 147; ed. McCann, 1952, 142-45; ed. Steidle, 1952, 304-307. XL. Swearing. XLI. On not saying, "My own."144 144 "No brother should speak of anything whatsoever or a member of the body as his own, but always `ours.' The one exception to calling anything his own is `my fault' (mea culpa). Everything that God grants should be common to us all, but peccancy comes from our own weakness."—Memoriale IV (Corp. Cons.

PETRI with engraved bust, and on the back [RATIO ECCLESIAE] with double-bar cross, was probably but not certainly minted at Corbie. As Merovingian rule weakened, the kings lost control of coinage and local civil and ecclesiastical powers established mints. Pepin and Charlemagne re-established royal monopoly and silver monometalism, but a silver DENARIUS (penny) of Charles II (+ 877) with SC PETRA MONETA inscribed on the back indicates weakening royal power and a return of minting to abbeys. * XLIII.

On leaving the place of prayer and on proceeding through the prayers.147 147 It is possible that Adalhard here refers to the visitatio altarium instituted by Benedict of Aniane, e.g.: "31. That the interval after Matins and before Prime in the winter or summer season may be filled out by the brothers' gathering and proceeding around the altars in prayer. By this procedure they can leave Prime at daybreak or sunrise directly to the period of meditation or to the obedience enjoined on them" Capitula Notitiarum (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 345). XLVI.

END, RUBRICS OF DOM ALDALHARD [C] &lt;FRAGMENTS OF CHAPTERS&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;THE CANONICAL HOURS&gt; &lt;THE SILENCE TO BE MAINTAINED IN CHURCH&gt; . . . . Having already summarily reviewed by writs the items related to the Hours within the church during the performance of God's Work—inviolable at all times and of primary importance by virtue of attention and prestige, for which the Lord supplied the form and content—these matters regarding God's Work seem worth adding: If it is summer time, it is proper, upon completion of the Hours after which one normally goes to the refectory, for all to sit silently in church. Then when they hear the signal they should leave quietly, reverently giving thanks to God. And in the said silence entering and sitting and leaving the refectory, each should then attend to those matters that the seasonal schedule calls for, or that he has been ordered to do. But if it be winter, and getting warm is a vital necessity, according as he who is in charge shall see fit either before or after the completion of the Office, he shall allow some period when they can warm themselves; but if not, let them wait in the church, as above. And so, these additions to the subject. &lt;II&gt; &lt;THE SILENCE TO BE MAINTAINED IN DORMITORY AND WARMING ROOM&gt;150 150 piselo. THE DORMITORY On this subject, for those who honestly understand it, everything can be embraced in the statement that at no time should anything dishonest or dishonorable be done there. To that end, some proprieties involving the time for conversation should be recorded as a memorandum; these will suggest others like them which should never be forgetfully disregarded. Conversation there should always be guarded, whether two or three or even many gather there, as they customarily do when they rise from chapter. But when the time for sleeping arrives, whether day or night, just as silence ought to be absolutely preserved in speech, so too should one step with the utmost caution, so that no one will suffer disturbance. No one is to shake out his clothing, no one negligently sit up or lie down in bed or make other like movements which cause needless vibrations or any sort of unpleasant sound; but also at all times, just as has been said, every precaution is to be taken there, either out of due respect or because the weak need their rest. It is necessary that when anyone happens to need rest there, compelled by necessity, he should not be disturbed through the discourtesy of another. So too, if anyone should lie down on his bed to read, no one else should ever come up to him there to talk; for because of the noise it is never right for one person far away from another or for two people, one seated, the other standing, to enter into conversation. They should respect the customary good manners of the quarters. These short notes have been selected from among the many strictures to be observed in the dormitory in order that such manners not be contemned by some simpletons as of no account, or ossified by some authoritarians beyond what is sensible. . . On every occasion they are to be enforced, not gently, not only by the provost, dean, and other deans, but also by the monitors appointed for the hours when the brothers are away for lections.151 151 concinnatoribus: Ordo Casinensis, I, 8 (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 103), stipulates that two such proctors circulate through the cloister at all hours of prayer. When it is necessary to use the warming room, nearly the same care and courtesy in all things should be observed there as we have stipulated for the dormitory, except as related to the act of sleeping itself. Of course it happens that there are some matters which particularly apply to those quarters, as, for example, matters relative to the wet clothes hanging there, or to the loungers and sleepers and those who neglect their reading because of the pleasant warmth, or with respect to other situations like these. From daily experience everyone should know what needs to be said on that score if he wants to bring such a gaggle to a sense of its bounden duty, however slightly. Even when the "unseasonable hours" have passed and the permissible time for conversation and fellowship has arrived, still the well-known common courtesy is always to be observed in word and deed there, just as in all other places, whether there be few or many present. Such is never to be forgotten or slighted. END Consuetudines Corbeienses [D] ADDENDUM I THE CHARTER OF LOUIS THE PIOUS* * By this document the emperor, at the request of Adalhard (the Younger?), confirms the privileges of immunity granted by Charlemagne and earlier kings to the Abbey of Corbie. The text is translated from the edition of Léon Levillain, Examen critique, 1902, 247-49. The original charter is lost; the extant copy (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 2718, fol. 80v, ninth century) is written in Tironian notes. Aachen, 29 January A.D. 815 IN THE NAME OF THE LORD GOD AND OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, LOUIS, EMPEROR AUGUSTUS BY ORDINATION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE: With respect to foundations dedicated to divine worship for the love of God and His servants, wherever we have bestowed appropriate tenures on such foundations we have believed that our eternal reward would be meted to us at the seat of God. In that light be it known to all our faithful supporters, both now and hereafter, that the venerable man Adalhard, abbot of the monastery of Corbie, which was erected in the region of Amiens in honor of St. Peter and St. Stephen, brought to us the immunity of our lord and father Charles, most pious Emperor of pious memory, wherein we have found in writing how he and his predecessors, the earlier kings of the Franks, had with divine love and reverence for that holy place, always held the aforesaid monastery under the most complete guardianship and protection from harm. To substantiate that status, the aforesaid abbot Adalhard asked us for the love of God and reverence for divine worship likewise to add our authority to that pre-existent authority. We freely acquiesce to his request and fully accord in all respects, confirming the authority by this our command. Wherefore we are issuing the order that no one of our loyal subjects or anyone within the jurisdiction or any of our retainers either present or future shall dare to enter into the churches or lands or fields or other possessions of the aforesaid monastery which at present it rightly and legally holds in possession in whatever region or province under the authority of our imperium, or any others which hereafter divine piety may determine to add to the domain of that monastery, for the hearing of disputes or levying of fines or tributes or the erection of buildings or the exaction of bonds or the punishment of men, whether freemen or serfs, living on its land, or collection of revenues or enforcing illicit actions in ours or future ages; nor shall he in any way plot to carry out any of the acts mentioned. And whatever the fisc has been in a position to expect from the goods of the aforesaid monastery, so much we turn over to the aforesaid monastery as an everlasting income, so that in perpetuity it may be applied to the augmentation of alms for the poor and stipends for the monks serving God at that place, to the end that it may delight those servants of God who are in a position to minister to Christ therein, to pray that the mercy of the Lord be granted to us and maintained on our behalf, and that of our wife and offspring, and the stability of our whole empire. And that this authority may, with the protection of the Lord, have power to continue unaltered through ours and future ages, we have signed it with our own hand and ordered it to be countersigned by the impress of our seal. Given the fourth kalends of February in the first year (by the grace of Christ) of the imperium of lord Louis, most supreme Augustus, Indiction VIII. Performed at the royal palace at Aachen, auspiciously in the name of Christ, Amen.

The Feast of Circumcision passed, from flesh released The following day, with joy he sought the stars.

On this stone were carefully chiseled eight verses of elegaic song . . . [above]. Now at that spot are buried with him the four worshipful men who were designated by the Lord for the selfsame responsibility in service. I do not think that it happened by accident. Rather, after the model of Jesus, as they were one band of Christian soldiery in carrying their own cross ever upward to this spot, so should they be buried as one—placed together in a position manifestly resembling the shape of that Cross. Here we discern our elder in the center. Above him peal the bells for the hours of the Divine Office, and at this spot they sound so clearly that one may believe their ring is the very tongue of the Holy Spirit, and that the Invitatory to the office of the Work of God originated here.

It bespeaks the one of them (that is, Corbie in Gaul) as nourished in wedlock to him, after the image of the Church with Christ; but the other (Corbie in Saxony) in a marvelous balance to have been her direct offspring according to monastic discipline. Clearly, the one of these was named Galathea by reason of her pure white countenance, whereas we may believe that the other was consecrated with the name of Phyllis because of her zeal for charity: GALATHEA: With me lament, men, reverently lament our elder; Let men through every stage of life seek his support.

AOSTA, ITALY MUSEO CIVICO TOMBSTONE OF LUCIUS AEBUTIUS FAUSTUS SURVEYOR [FIRST CENTURY] The dedication, written in eight lines, is composed within a square space (symbol of centuriated measure?). Fine letter forms of the inscription, slightly contracted to compose with pleasing effect in a narrow area, are representative of the period of high perfection in development of the CAPITALES QUADRATAE (cf. comment on Trajan's column inscription, I, 291). With restraint, clarity of statement, and mastery of design by an unknown sculptor we are told, with respectful terseness bordering on the laconic, of a servant of the empire, by means of a monument of exceptional character, artistry, and great beauty. The vertical slab of marble, lower portion lost, depicts above the inscription a pediment with floral ornaments, left and right, that fill two triangular corner spaces. A shield and two spears within the triangle of the pediment may indicate former military service. The remainder of the fragment, below the inscription, depicts symbols of state and authority, and instruments of the surveyor's profession—cross arms of a groma (below, p. 140) superimposed on its vertical staff, exactly positioned on the slab axis. A pair of jasces, axe blades directed outwards, composes symmetrically about the groma staff. Two plumb bobs, one right and one left, are seen between the cross arms. Just above the head of the staff is depicted an object that cannot be identified with certainty. Its resemblance to a settee with surmounted cushion has provided a tentative identification. Yet, a bench-like form is also reminiscent of the chorbates, a Roman levelling instrument used in construction work. The article surmounting the bench form may in this matter be interpreted as a vessel pouring water, seen issuing at left, to fill the water-levelling trough of the chorbates below, and of which it is a part. The plumb bob is essential in use of both groma and chorbates. Whatever the object may be, a pragmatic efficiency governing and pervading its design dismisses any notion that it was a whimsical choice made by the sculptor to fill a space. Noble, imaginative, with a measure of delight, utterly unsentimental, the genius of a Roman artist has brought to the memorial purpose, a quality of lasting greatness which in later eras disappears, is lost. E.B. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PLAN OF ST. GALL TO THE HISTORY OF MEASUREMENT A LINK BETWEEN ROMAN, AND ENGLISH AND AMERICAN SYSTEMS OF MEASURE by A. HUNTER DUPREE PREFACE During a discussion conducted at a meeting of the Herbert M. Evans History of Science Club, early in 1968,1 1 Meeting of the Herbert M. Evans History of Science Dinner Club, held on February 2, 1968, at Berkeley. where I reported on my findings on the scale and construction methods used in the Plan of St. Gall, Professors Charles L. Camp and Hunter Dupree drew attention to the striking similarity between the series 640, 160, 40, 10 and 2½, used by the designer of the Plan in laying out the primary area divisions of his monastery site2 2 See I, p. 78ff. and the measurement system embodied in the American Land Ordinance of 1785. The latter is familiar to anyone reared on the great western plains or wherever in the vast territory of the Midwestern United States that land division into sections one mile square, each composed of 640 acres (fig. 539), is quite visible Internally these are divided into half-sections of 320 acres, quarter-sections of 160 acres, and downward by the same process of binary division into parcels of 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2½. In the great rural plains of America, as it was subsequently pointed out by Hunter Dupree, the expression "the back forty" and "the front forty" (for divisions of a section) or "forty acres and a mule" (to define subsistence, if not plenty) are deeply imbedded in American history and in common usage even today.3 3 Dupree, 1968, 20. These analogies raised the interesting question whether the American land measuring system of 1785 might be historically connected with the system used in the Plan of St. Gall. The problem has since become the subject of two fascinating studies by Hunter Dupree, the first entitled "The Pace of Measurement from Rome to America," published in the Smithsonian Journal of History, III, 1968, 19-40, a second and more extensive one entitled "Measure is the Measure of All Things," read at the Annual Meeting of the Society of the History of Technology, in Washington D.C. on Dec. 28, 1969; and a third, "The English System for Measuring Fields," Agricultural History XLV:2 (1971), 121-29. The historical implications of these three studies of Prof. Dupree's are vast and arresting. After brilliant beginnings in the earlier parts of the nineteenth century, the history of mensuration has fallen into a state of almost complete stagnation. That my work on the Plan of St. Gall should have inspired Hunter Dupree to stir new life into this subject adds a new dimension to the Plan of St. Gall and heightens my excitement about my own findings. I am grateful to Hunter Dupree for allowing me to include in this work a summary from his own pen of those aspects of his studies which cast light specifically on the historical significance of the Plan of St. Gall as a connecting link between earlier and later measurement systems. His report is rendered verbatim. W.H. 536. THE WORKS OF EDMUND GUNTER. TITLE PAGE FIFTH EDITION, LONDON, 1673. SHOWN ORIGINAL SIZE Edmund Gunter wrote his treatise on the sector and other instruments in Latin in 1609. Although it was copied and freely circulated, Gunter did not permit its publication in English for more than 16 years. It then appeared in an edition entitled The description and vse of the sector, the crosse-staffe, and other instruments, for such as are studious of mathematicall practise (London, 1609). This treatise formed the "first edition" of Gunter's Works and as such was then issued (also in London, 1623) in two volumes: De sectore et radio . . . description and vse of the sector, in three bookes, and Description of the crosse-staffe in other three bookes . . . . Subsequent editions were published posthumously in London. A second edition (1636) appended Gunter's Canon Triangulorum, the important tables of logarithmic sines and tangents first published in 1620, and was issued under the rubic "much augmented." A third (1653), "much enlarged by the author" (his death in 1626 notwithstanding), was "amended" by H. Bond, and contained an addition by Samuel Foster on the use of the quadrant. A fourth edition (1662) was issued with a description of "another sector and quadrant invented by" Foster, as well as "examined and enlarged" by William Leybourn. The fifth and last edition (1673) was merely "corrected" by Leybourn who also published, in 1685, Description and use of a portable instrument known by the name of G's quadrant . . ., the last book with which Gunter's name was associated. The publication history of Gunter's innovative work is reflected in that of a later handbook, similarly indispensable, by Nathaniel Bowditch, whose American Practical Navigator has been revised and reissued frequently since it was first published in 1802. E.B., L.P. WHEN WALTER HORN, through his analysis of the scale and construction methods of the Plan of St. Gall, dispelled "once and for all, the widespread belief that medieval architectural drawings were not made to scale,"4 4 Horn, 1966, 285-307; and in considerably more detail in I, 77ff. he placed a question mark on the almost universally accepted version of the history of the measurement of length from Rome to America. The accepted version, to risk an over-simplification, followed roughly the pattern of the history of mathematics, reaching a peak with Archimedes and dwindling almost to complete chaos before the rise of modern science reintroduced precision into the thinking of Western man. Any measurement outside the confines of the metric system, the units such as inch and foot, were unfortunate and irrational survivals. That measuring units with human-body referents were widely scattered through time and space in the world's history was well known but unanalyzed, of antiquarian interest only. This slumbering set of generalizations scattered in the encyclopedias of the world has now been thoroughly disturbed. Before Horn's analysis of the measurement system used in the Plan of St. Gall it would have been extremely difficult to construct a single grid of measurements from Rome to America. Not that the general correspondence of the survey land patterns in the Po Valley and Ohio, for example, had gone unnoticed. Rather a link was missing which roughly corresponded to the decline of learning—to the old concept of the Dark Ages. Only in the period after the transmission of Greek mathematics and Indian numerals to the Western world by the Arabs, should a scholar even begin to look for the resumption of a mathematical activity which might make a measuring system possible. Yet if one conceives of the carrier of a measuring system not as high mathematics but as language, he might see the whole problem differently. A continuity of measurement through the Dark Ages would then be as unbroken as the use of the Latin language, and Carolingian times might provide a cross section of the system. When Walter Horn elucidated the meaning of the dimensions of the Plan of St. Gall and especially when he derived the unit of 2½ feet from the length of 40 feet by the process of continuous halving, he laid the basis for a cross section of a Carolingian measuring grid. Because the Plan itself is a set of dimensions, with 1/16 inch playing an important role, and because by multiplying by 192 the Plan becomes a monastery on the ground, the significant units include the inch, the foot, and by implication the step (2½ feet). Significant groupings of the units include the 40-foot side of the crossing square, and by implication the 160-foot of the supermodule in Horn's analysis, the 480-foot short side of the Plan, and especially the 640-foot long side of the Plan. The Roman predecessors of the Carolingian units are readily apparent for the inch and the foot. That the length is close to that of the foot of Drusus (33.30 cm.) rather than the classical Roman foot (29.60 cm.) or the modern English foot (30.48 cm.) is of minor importance. The foot of Drusus was itself an inheritance of Roman times and retained its stability alongside the slightly shorter Roman foot for many centuries. Once a length for a unit has been selected, the elaboration of a grid can proceed on the same relations as one based on a slightly different unit as measured against a modern scale as long as the name, in this case "foot," is identical. In addition to the inch and foot, the Roman jugerum (a measure of land 240 feet by 120 feet) appears as one-half of the short side of the Plan. The Roman stadium, or 625 feet, has a reflection in the long side of 640 feet. The difference between the two is extremely important, as it represents an anomaly in the Roman system in halving the Roman mile of 5000 feet (1000 Roman paces or 2000 steps) three times to 625 feet and doubling the 2½ foot step in a sequence 2½, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640. This difference will ultimately account for 120 feet of the 280 feet added to the Roman mile to make the English mile of 5280. An examination of the intervals of the grid pattern shown by the Plan of St. Gall indicates that, while the units are clearly Roman, the changed social setting has seen a regrouping of the Roman units into a grid adapted to the life of a Benedictine monastery. The 5-foot Roman pace has receded in favor of the 2½-foot step, which is more useful in close quarters. The short side of the enclosure as analyzed by Horn could be most readily measured in cubits (1½ feet), which introduces a factor of 3 that is very useful in constructing right angles. Yet the dominant unit of the step (2½ feet), and of the sides of the nest of modules, which includes that of the crossing square of the church (40 feet), all relate to the long side of the Plan (640 feet), so that a ratio of 3:4 is readily available both to the planner on the parchment and to the builder on the ground. 537. PLAT OF THE FIRST SURVEY MADE UNDER THE LAND ORDINANCE OF 1785 NATIONAL ARCHIVES, CARTOGRAPHIC ARCHIVES DIVISION, WASHINGTON, D.C. ILLUSTRATION is 3/4 of the size of the original drawing SCALE OF ILLUSTRATION: 1 1/2 INCHES = 80 CHAINS 3/4 INCHES = 40 CHAINS R.F. = 1:84,480 In the Land Ordinance of 1785 the Congress of the Confederation in the new United States set the pattern for surveying the western lands north and west of the Ohio River ceded by the states to the national government. Thomas Jefferson and Hugh Williamson of North Carolina, members of the committee drafting the statute, originally proposed in 1784 a square grid of townships, oriented to true north, each of which would measure ten miles on a side. Jefferson proposed that the mile to be used should be the "geographical mile," which he took as 6086.4 feet, quite close to the present nautical mile. He further proposed a decimalization of the geographical mile as follows: thus: ONE AMERICAN MILE = 6086.4 feet [10 LINKS = 1 PACE] ONE FURLONG = 608.64 feet 10 PACES = 1 CHAIN [100 LINKS = 1 CHAIN] ONE CHAIN = 60.864 feet 10 CHAINS = 1 FURLONG ONE PACE = 6.0864 feet 10 FURLONGS = 1 AMERICAN MILE [ONE LINK = 0.6864 feet] Had this choice of units prevailed, even if the foot were retained, the grid of the Land Ordinance would not have belonged to the tradition of length measurement carried by the units descending from Rome through Carolingian times and medieval England to the American colonists in the form of the statute mile. Rather the grid would have derived from the grid of latitude and longitude which the cartography and navigation of Europeans had developed to a high degree of accuracy since the beginning of the expansion of Europe over the broad seas in the fifteenth century. However, the population of the new American republic possessed a system of land measuring with as great an agreement on fundamental units as that used by any people anywhere. The Gunter chain of 66 feet, divided into 100 links, had no rivals. Ten chains made a furlong and eight furlongs a mile. Hence when, after Jefferson's departure for Paris, the committee drafted the final version of the Land Ordinance in 1785, it substituted the statute mile of 5280 feet for the geographical mile as the side of a section, 36 of which made a township. One scholar who has examined the connection between the grid idea and Roman centuration concludes that while such a conceptual link is not impossible, it is highly unlikely (William D. Pattison, Beginnings of the American Rectangular Land Survey System, 1784-1800) [Chicago: University of Chicago Department of Geography Research Paper No. 50, 1957], pp. 60-64). Pattison does not, however, address himself directly to the history of the units of the subdivisions of the sections and their relation to the measurement tradition discussed here. The so-called seven ranges of townships on the western bank of the Ohio River were surveyed under provisions of the Land Ordinance of 1785 in the summer of 1786 and 1787, and the submission of notes and plats was completed in 1788. Although surveying methods were later improved in detail, the basic method of laying out sections and townships became standard for surveying the public domain as settlement moved westward. The occasional penciled lines on the original plat show that division of sections into quarter-sections of 160 acres had already begun at an early date. The principle which revealed the relations of the units and intervals of the Plan to Horn is that of continuous halving. Instead of dividing units into tenths, as in a consistent decimal system, Western man usually referred to the units by language referring to conventionally chosen dimensions of the human body (e.g. 1 foot = 12 inches [thumbs]). Integers were to them as handy as they are for people of any age, but lacking decimal notation they found that the easy way to make a fraction was by continuously dividing by 2. Hence the base of the measuring system is 2 arranged in a geometric progression. . . 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 . . . . . . 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 . . . . . . The gaps in this base progression can be filled in the ranges used in the Plan of St. Gall by multiplying it (as on the short side) by 3 3 6 12 24 48 96 192 384 768 1,536 . . . . . . 3(20) 3(21) 3(22) 3(23) 3(24) 3(25) 3(26) 3(27) 3(28) 3(29) . . . . . . On the long side the multiplier is 5 5 10 20 40 80 160 320 640 . . . . . . 5(20) 5(21) 5(22) 5(23) 5(24) 5(25) 5(26) 5(27) . . . . . . In this last sequence one sees not only the 40 of the crossing square and the 160 of the super module, but the halving of 5 is 2½ of the step, the most frequently occurring unit on the Plan. Where once was only the confusion of the centuries of the Dark Ages a measuring system adapted to life in a Carolingian monastery has now become clear. More important, a link between the Romans and the Carolingians having been secured, the possibility of a link to the still living Anglo-American measuring systems requires the invention of no different language and no different social institutions from those we already know to have existed. Indeed by 1300 the English measuring system had, by becoming a part of statute law, placed itself beyond any possibility of a break in continuity down to the present. Since the foot (in a length not far from that of the Romans) was available in medieval England, and since the cloth-yard of 3 feet was already in consistent use, the problems confronting the measuring-system designers of the thirteenth century had to do not with units but with the layout of agricultural land. The dominant mode of farming in England was of course in long narrow strips. Hence it is not surprising to find the statute acre defined as 4 rods by 40 rods, both longer and narrower than the Roman jugerum. Yet the length of the statute rod is 16½ feet, clearly an innovation of some sort. The story of how the 16-foot rod, 40 of which make 640 feet (the length of the long side of the Plan of St. Gall) was modified by the addition of a step of 2½ feet at the 32-step mark on the long side of an acre to create the 660-foot furlong has been told elsewhere.5 5 In a preliminary way in Dupree, 1968, 19-41; more fully in Dupree "Measure is the Measure of All Things" delivered before the Society of the History of Technology on December 28, 1969. In the sixteenth century the Roman mile (mille passus, one thousand paces) of 5000 feet became increasingly conspicuous as the major itinerary measure in England. While in Roman times the mile had consisted of 8 stadia of 625 feet, the evolution of the measuring system through the Carolingian empire and medieval England had produced a furlong of 660 feet. Therefore to adjust the difference the Roman definition gave way to evolution, and the statute mile of both Elizabethan times and the present became 8 furlongs of 660 feet, or 5280 feet. By the early seventeenth century measuring behavior, which continued to be performed by common and uncommon people alike, came under the scrutiny of mathematicians who were by this time convinced of the advantages of decimal fractions. Edmund Gunter (1581-1626) not only added the chain of 66 feet to the English grid, but he divided it into 100 links thus adding a decimal element to the English grid. In the meantime the invention of logarithms and the regularization of decimal notation for fractions had rendered the operation of halving unnecessary in many measuring settings. and eventually the metric system dispensed with the units of the traditional systems themselves. The American republic was struggling with the problem of a surveying system for its western lands in the 1780s just before the metric system became available, its introduction hastened by the French revolution. Although Thomas Jefferson, acquainted with French thinking on the subject, toyed with an innovative decimal system, the Congress of the Confederation settled on a grid based on the English mile. A mile square, 640 acres, was divided by continuous halving into 320 acres, 160 acres, 80 acres, 40 acres and so on (fig. 537). The mile, an itinerary unit, thus became part of field measure, and the subdivision followed the same sequence—640, 320, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2½—that characterizes the Plan of St. Gall, Thus the American land system resembles the measuring system of the Plan of St. Gall, and when all the adjustments are made this demonstration leads to the conclusion that the American system is the St. Gall system. A single measuring system has survived within narrow limits of accuracy from Rome to America. The actual and continuous existence of the grid opens a new set of perspectives on social history in the Western world. That people had measures, kept them stable, passed them from one generation to another without a single break, and adapted them to changed modes of life gives both shape and continuity to a numbering system running through hitherto unquantified ages. More fundamentally, the Rome-to-America grid ties measurement to the life of people in each age traversed and makes it a part of their language and culture. A.H.D. 538.

"Acre" in the heading could read "furlong" and "Cent." could read "link." [The original concept acre, the area that could be plowed by a yoke of oxen in one day, in England, became limited by statutes under Edward I, Edward III and Henry VIII as a piece of land measuring 40 poles (one furlong* * Furrow + long, in concept regarded as the length of a furrow of the side of a square field containing 10 acres. As early as the 9th century the furlong was identified as the English measure corresponding to the Roman stadium, 1/8 of a Roman mile. Thenceforth it was so considered and remains today 1/8 of a statute mile, 220 yards, 660 feet. ) in length by 4 poles** ** Conceptually, 32 furrows of a plow in width, one "furrow long." See caption p. 140, iugera [jugerum] re: groma. ‡Note, page 140: For urban land division, the foot (pes), with subdivisions of actus, was commonly used as units of land measure. See, e.g. Roman atrium house, II, 6, fig. 265.A. in width (= 4840 square yards or equivalent area). Interpreted as feet, this is a plot 660 by 66. The width to length ratio 1:10 of the plot is significant. By designating as existing statutory measure, 4 poles or 66 feet as a CHAIN, and by extending the decimal notion a step further, Gunter's "centesimal" was created as a LINK on the ratio 1:100, the link length to chain length, of 0·66 feet = 7· inches.

The forty-acre fields are a common size for fields within a farm. The blocks in the townsite in the northwest corner are, allowing for spacing by two-chain streets, very close to 2 1/2 acres. The modules from 2 1/2 acres through 10 acres, 40 acres, 160 acres, and 640 acres are all visible. Recent research has shown that once the land grid had been laid down, its effect has continued to shape land use, road patterns, property boundaries, administrative units in a way which differs from similar terrain surveyed unsystematically (Norman Thrower, Original Survey and Land Subdivision: A Comparative Study of the Form and Effect of Contrasting Cadastral Surveys [Chicago: Rand McNally &amp; Company, 1966]). A safe prediction is that after two thousand years at least some of the American land grid will be as visible in an aerial photograph as the Roman centuriation has proved to be. For visual comparison, a metric scale is included with the Anglo-U.S. scales of feet, miles, chains, together with indication of the furlong. One furlong appears in coinciding alignment with 0·2km. The actual relationship is one furlong equals 0·217km. Thus five furlongs equal 1·0058km, irrelevant perhaps but interesting. DIAGRAM SHOWING SUBDIVISIONS OF LINEAL AND AREAL MEASUREMENTS IN RELATIONSHIP TO A TYPICAL U.S. LAND DIVISION PLOT ONE MILE SQUARE The units—mile, acre, furlong, chain, rod, feet—and the ratios among them were the carriers of continuity with the Carolingian grid. The subdivisions within the sections were not even specified in the Ordinance. It is the grid within the sections and not the idea of a grid itself which connects by the units and their ratios to the Plan of St. Gall. The only change between the ninth century and the eighteenth century was the addition of 1/2 foot to the rod of 16 feet to create the statute of 16 1/2 feet in English laws just before and after 1300. * 540.A GROMA based on Matteo delle Corte, 1922 INSTRUMENT OF THE GROMATICI a professional title, with AGRIMENSOR surviving after the instrument became obsolete 540.B PRINCIPAL ROMAN MEASURES OF THE LAND SURVEYOR AREAL: 1 actus = 120 × 120 sq. ft. 2 actus = 1 juger, jugerum 2 jugera = 1 heredium 100 heredia = 1 centuria LINEAL: 1 pace, passus = 5 feet 2 paces = 1 PERTICA* * ITALIAN, pèrtica (or pèrtiche), pèrticatóre, land surveyor; SPANISH, pértica; FRENCH, perche; ENGLISH, perch (from French), pole, rod—similar names for identical tool and purpose, but of unlike measure value at different periods. , 10 ft. 24 pertica = 1 actus, 120 ft. 10 actus = 2400 feet [MILLE PASSUS = 5000 feet, 1 mile] The groma consisted of two metal members crossing and rigidly fixed one to the other at the mid-point of their length. In the example found at a surveyor's workshop in Pompeii, cross members are metal, hollow or tubular, to receive wooden arm extensions. The cross unit, pivoting atop a bracket offset from and fixed to a vertical staff, was free to rotate, From the ends of the cross formed unit, two pairs of plumb bobs were suspended, each pair in opposite positions of an arm. By means of sighting along one pair of suspension cords, taut and plumb, a line could be established on the ground with remarkable exactness, perpendicular to a line sighted along the complimenting pair of plumb cords. Dependable, almost unbreakable, non-versatile, it was a single-task instrument. Yet despite irreducible primary simplicity, by its aid GROMATICI laid out schemes of centuriation and survey with amazing accuracy and extension that today, from high altitudes, appear to have been laid out by instrumentation of advanced technology and engineering method. The bracketing of the cross arm unit permitted the staff to be easily positioned on the ground in an offset position to give unobstructed sighting in two directions, and the four taut vertical suspension cords inherently gave a self-contained means for one assistant to hold the staff in plumb position, two ingenious features that contributed in generous measure to the accuracy of surveys. The Roman foot (PES) was the basic Roman lineal measure [ca. 11·60 inches, 29·57 cm]; five feet constituted the Roman pace, and 1000 paces (MILLE PASSUS) was a Roman mile, 5,000 feet [ca. 4850 feet]. For large scale land subdivision and centuriation, the basic unit of the land surveyor was the ACTUS of 120 feet with its square, an area of 14,400 sq. feet. From the ACTUS, the JUGERUM, HEREDIUM, and CENTURIA derived (see table; see Note re: urban land division, p. 139). To measure an ACTUS, the instrument used was a wood pole, the PERTICA or DECEMPEDA of 10 feet. Commonly employed in pairs for convenience and accuracy in the field, the two poles, ends metal-capped for dimensional stability, were laid down in alignment, butted end to end to lay off 20 feet, an operation which, repeated six times, laid off an ACTUS. Greek and Roman foot were alike in length. It is startling to observe the Greek pace, BEMA, 30 inches (half a Roman pace) or 2½ feet appear in the Plan of St. Gall as its standard module, even though the circumstances of its presence are unrelated to Greco-Roman usage. Prior to authorization to proceed with a scheme of centuriation, "inauguration" by an augur was necessary, with readings and sacrifice‡ ‡ In solemn rites seeking good portent the augur read the entrails of a sacrified animal scattered on the ground with respect to the cardinal points. The cruciform configuration is ancient indeed. in priestly ceremonies oriented with respect to the cardinal points. Cryptic symbols of augur and surveyor's rational geometry exhibit common identity of configuration (incised on the tops of stone monuments that record critical points of survey in the field, fig. 540.A, C), similarities that appear to link to science, survey, prelude to geodesy, in an origin of religious character, long ago.

      <field name="fulltext">GLOSSARY This glossary is developed along historical lines, specifically to account for terms occurring in the annotations of the Plan of St. Gall, in contemporary sources related to it, and in the scholarly literature devoted to disentangling the historical issues raised by the Plan. The entries pertain not only to structures and methods of monastic architecture at the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, but also to the cultural and conceptual preconditions that gave rise to their various forms. Our sources range from prehistory to relatively modern times, with greatest concentration in the Carolingian and early medieval periods. They include rich testimony in forms other than monuments: legal and managerial treatises, literary exploits and aesthetic constructs, systems of mensuration, artifacts and technological devices. Earlier and later etymological histories of many of the entries can be found in the dictionaries listed here. Where original definitions were not needed, free use of the work of others was made. Cross references are by volume and page number of this work; as elsewhere, volume number is omitted for the book in hand. Adalhard's "Customs of Corbie," translated by Charles W. Jones (102-20, above), is also referred to by chapter and section number which always appear in &lt;angle brackets&gt;, reflecting the style used by Semmler from which edition Jones made his translation. NOTE: For the convenience of readers interested in etymology, we are listing briefly those dictionaries we have used in making the Glossary. Many had already proved to be of great value in our research and are thus to be found with full citations in the Bibliography: they are listed here only by editor or title. The few dictionaries not already in the Bibliography are given below with all necessary citations. LORSCH, ABBEY GATEWAY Incrustation of stone masonry tile work.

Head of a monastic community. From abba, "father," an epithet by which Jesus was addressed and with which Jesus himself addressed God. Although elected by the monks, the abbot was confirmed by the local bishop, and subject to correction by him. The abbot carried ultimate responsibility for both spiritual welfare of his community and management of all its temporal possessions. As lord of a vast and ramified system of manorial estates he held, at the time the Plan was drawn, an economic and social position comparable with many leading secular lords of the empire; and consequently the Carolingian rulers approved appointments of lay abbots (see Du Cange, s.v. abbacomites and above, 95) like Angilbert of St. Riquier, father of Charlemagne's grandson Nithard. For a full definition of the abbot's duties and qualifications see I, 330-31. ACRE: An English measure of land area, historically varying widely, but in 1878 defined by the Weights and Measures Act to equal 4,840 sq. yards (4046.873 sq. meters); this is the Imperial acre, but larger and smaller local variants still exist all over the British Isles. The word comes from the Latin ager; its Greek antecedent means "open country." The acre has always been colloquially understood to be that area which a yoke of oxen can plow in a day. For a discussion of the relevance to the Plan of the American land measurement system, and the role of the acre, see above, 129ff. Also see mansus. actor (-es): Agent, deputy. The actor villarum, more active than the maior, was perhaps more overseer than official, but the definitions overlap. acus: Needle. See vestimentum. adolescens or adolescentiores: Adolescent. In monastic parlance, a youth from the age of 14 to 28 (cf. infans and puer). ala: In the 12th century description of English barns, as well as in other medieval sources, used to designate the aisles running along the two long walls of the building, and distinguished from the LEAN-TO's (culacium) under the hipped portion of the roof at the two narrow ends of the building. alin (ON): See ELL. ALMSMAN: See matricularius altare: Altar. A base, pedestal, or table, of varying form and materials (stone, wood, baked brick), used from earliest times for sacrifice and worship. In Christian life the most venerated piece of liturgical furniture, upon which was lavished the finest artistry and craftsmanship, often of gold and silver. A fixed altar consists of a table (mensa) and its support (either a solid mass of masonry or four or more columns), usually surmounted by a ciborium or CANOPY. The altar usually contained a small chamber or cavity (sepulchrum) for relics. The earliest Christian churches had only one altar. In Merovingian times their number increased. By the time of Charlemagne certain churches had as many as 14, 17, even 30 altars. For the historical rationale of this strange phenomenon see I, 208ff. alueolus: A trough for mixing the ingredients for dough and for kneading dough. In this sense used in the Monks' Bake and Brew House. The same vessel is designated in the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers as "the place where the dough is mixed" (locus conspergendi) and in the House for Distinguished Guests as "the place where flour is mingled with water" (intriuendae pastae locus). ambo: Pulpit from which the bishop, abbot or officiating priest addresses the congregation. In the Church of the Plan it is located in the easternmost bay of the nave within an area separated by railings from the adjacent parts of the church 136, 148 fig. 98; Adalhard, Rubric VII, 121 n134. amphora: A large earthenware vessel used in ancient times for storing liquids and foods; as a capacity measure, the equivalent of 25.5 liters. analogium (-a): An elevated pulpit of lectern in the church from which the Holy Scriptures are read. In the Refectory (also invariably in an elevated position) the Reader's pulpit. See lector. ANCHORITE: One who renounces the world to live in seclusion, a recluse. In contrast to the hermit, the cell of the anchorite is often attached to a church or some other form of human settlement. On anchoritism as one of the earliest forms of monasticism and its progressive substitution by communal forms of monastic living, see coenobite and coenobium. ANGLE STRUT: A short inclined member acting in compression, and serving to reduce the unsupported length of a major structural member. See RAFTER. annona: Annual harvest in grain. See Adalhard: Annona sive panis, &lt;III&gt;, 102. antiphona: Anthem. Originally a refrain intercalated among psalm verses, then an alternating liturgical chant holding fixed positions in the opus Dei. antiquarius: In monastic life, an experienced writer whose skills were used for making liturgical books. APSE: See exedra and COUNTER APSE. árbol (SP): Literally, tree; also, a large pole in horizontal position rotated by a water wheel and activating a trip hammer (palanca) by means of wooden cogs. arboreta: Orchard. ARCADE: Traditionally, a series of masonry arches with their supporting columns or piers; also, a covered gallery faced by a system of such arches. More recently the term has been applied specifically (but so far only in English studies) to posts set at intervals on parallel axes down the length of the nave of an aisled hall or barn. Cf. PLATE. ARCHITRAVE: The horizontal element, of stone or timber, that spans the interval between two columns or piers; the lowest member of the ENTABLATURE. arcicapellanus, also summus capellanus: Arch chaplain; during the reign of Charlemagne the emperor's primary advisor in ecclesiastical and educational matters, whose office later became absorbed in that of the Chancellor (summus sacri palatii cancellarius). From 791 to 819 this office was held by Bishop Hildebold of Cologne, who may have had a personal share in making the prototype plan, from which the Plan of St. Gall was traced. ARCUATED LINTEL (Syrian arch): A masonry lintel formed of a single block of stone with an arch or arches cut into it, not to be confused with an arched lintel, a misnomer for an arch made of wedge-shaped stones. ARCUATED PORCHES: Porches with arched openings admitting light. See porticus. argentum: Money received and dispersed for goods and services, and as alms (Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105). On coinage, see moneta. arinn (ON): Hearth. Used alternately with eldr. armarium (-a): A clothes press or wardrobe. In monastic parlance it was a cupboard in which books were kept; figuratively a designation for the library itself. On the Plan used to denote the storage place for drugs and medicaments (armarium pigmentorum) in the House of the Physicians. armarius: Librarian. Also called bibliothecarius; see armarium. armenta: Dairy cow. See armentarius. armentarius: Cowherd or dairy farmer. On the Plan the cowherds are lodged in the House for Cows and Cowherds. artifex (-ices): Craftsman. An exemplary Carolingian monastery, to judge by the Plan of St. Gall, provided (outside the Monks' cloister, yet still within the monastic enceinte) living quarters and workshops for the following craftsmen: shoemakers (sutores), saddlers (sellarii), trenchermakers and furbishers (emundatores uel politores gladiorum), shieldmakers (scutarii), turners (tornatores), tanners (coriarii), goldsmiths (aurifices) blacksmiths (fabri ferramentorum), fullers (fullones), coopers (tunnariores), and wheelwrights (tornarii). The majority of these were installed in the Great Collective Workshop; the coopers and wheelwrights were lodged in a separate house. asar, also langvidir (ON): Long beams. A collective term designating all longitudinal timbers in a trussed roof. See PLATE, PURLIN ASCETIC: One who devotes himself to a solitary and contemplative life by practicing bodily abstinence and self-mortification. ASHLAR: Regular masonry of squared stones laid in horizontal courses with vertical joints; cf. RUBBLE. ASHLAR PIECE: In timber construction, a short vertical upright, at the base of a roof, rising from the inner end of a SOLE PIECE to the underside of a COMMON RAFTER. It helps to form a small triangular truss at the foot of the rafter and thus steadies its springing. Such auxiliary trusses are also installed above the roof plates, where they serve as footing for the upper rafters. assecula: Servant. On the Plan used to designate the oxherds in the House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers. asser(-es): In a roof of relatively small dimensions, according to Vitruvius, the name for the coupled rafters carrying the covering of the roof, without purlins. In a roof of broad span, the name for the outer or common rafters, which are pegged into the purlins, and usually converge in a ridge beam. See RAFTER, PURLIN. atrium: In Republican and Imperial times the central, originally open, court of the Roman house. For centuries misinterpreted, even by some of the most distinguished classical archaeologists, as the central inner hall of the Roman house, with fireplace, because of an erroneous etymological explanation of this term by several Roman authors who claimed that atrium came from ater ("black") and referred to the blackening of the atrium walls by the smoke of its hearth. Recent and more reliable studies of the development of the Roman house have shown that its atrium was by origin not a central living room which developed into an open yard, but, on the contrary, an open yard that gradually developed into a covered court. See cava aedium. The etymology of the term atrium is still uncertain. It is related to Greek ???ζ??ζ or ?????ζ??ζ = "a place under the open sky"? (Thesaurus Linguae Latinae II:1, s.v.) For more detail see II, 6-9 n4. auditorium: Literally, audience hall. In monastic life a room reserved to the abbot for reading, conversing with brothers, and for guests; in Haito's time (806-836) a room in the abbot's own house, traditionally used for dining with guests (for sources see I, 22, 323). In later monastic life the term also employed in the sense of parlor or locutorium. aurifex(-ices): Goldsmith. On the Plan housed in the Annex of the Great Collective Workshop (II, 196; Adalhard &lt;I. 27, 99&gt;). aula: In medieval Latin, the general term for a manorial hall. On the Plan used for the Abbot's House. The new residence built by Grimald, abbot of St. Gall from 841-872, is also, in contemporary sources and inscriptions, referred to as aula. B balneum, balineum (-a): Bath building, public or private, of ordinary size, as distinct from the great public baths (thermae). On the Plan facilities for bathing are designated balneatorium and balneatorium domus. The Plan shows four such installations: the Monks' Bathhouse and Laundry, a room in the Annex to the Abbot's House, a bath for the Novices, and a bath for the ill monks. On changing monastic attitudes toward bodily cleanliness see I, 262ff. bancus: Vulgar Latin for bench. See sedile. banstae: Casting shovels used in winnowing grain (Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 105 n82). banzao (Sp): A collecting basin for water used to turn the wheel of a trip hammer (pila). See arbol, palabca, mazo. BARREL VAULT: A half-cylindrical vault, as in a continuous arch; also a tunnel vault. BASE CRUCK: See CRUCK. BASILICA: In Roman life a public edifice serving as assembly hall for citizens to conduct business. It was simultaneously used as a court of justice and in this capacity under the direct jurisdiction of the emperor; hence its name, "royal" [hall]. In Christian parlance the word means church, as a rule longitudinal and composed of nave and aisles, the former lit by a clerestory, and often provided with one or more apses or tribunes. basilica discoperta: A type supposed to consist of covered aisles and unroofed nave. BAY: In timber construction, a principal division of space formed by the constituent members of the principal trusses as well as by the horizontal timbers which connect the latter longitudinally (roof plates, purlins, and ridge beam). In the Middle Ages the size of a timbered house or barn was often defined not in feet, but by the number of bays of which the structure was composed. In masonry architecture the term denotes a principal division of space framed by piers and boundary arches rising from engaged pilasters or columns. BEAM: In a timber frame, a horizontal member that spans a structure from wall to wall. Depending on the span and the scantling of the beam, it may be unsupported, or posted. TIE BEAM: A major member of a timbered roof frame that spans a space transversely from wall to wall, or in the case of an aisled structure, spans two posts of a principal truss across the nave, and in the aisles, spans from each of these posts to the WALL PLATES. The ends of nave tie beams are mortized into the heads of the PRINCIPAL POSTS as well as dovetailed into the upper surface of the ARCADE PLATE, if the latter should lie beneath the tie beam. The principal function of a tie beam is to prevent the roof-supporting members from springing outward or collapsing inward under the load of the roof. COLLAR BEAM: Lying parallel to and higher than the tie beam, it connects rafter pairs at mid-point of their rise, or slightly above it. It acts both as tie and stiffening member of a TRUSS. HAMMER BEAM: A short horizontal beam supporting the foot of a principal rafter or truss blade on the wall top, the projecting end of which carries a HAMMER POST or an arch brace. It is invariably supported from below by an inclined or curved brace. It is a form of extended SOLE PIECE. bema (Gr): In Greek churches, the area in front of and around the altar reserved for the clergy and usually separated from the rest of the church by chancel barriers. In early examples of development of Early Christian architecture, the bema lay in front of the apse and functioned as a feature in an incipient CROSSING SQUARE, separated from the main by CLOSURE SLABS. benda (-e): Bandages of linen used in bloodletting. beneficiarii, beneficiaries: "b. S. Petri," holdings benefice from the abbot of St. Peter, Corbie. beneficium: In Classical Latin, well-doing, kindness. In Medieval Latin a term of many different shades of meaning; most frequently used in the sense of a grant of land to a vassal or tenant in form of a holding without onerous obligations; all landed property attached to a religious community or to the head of that organization (bishop, abbot); the part of that property attached to the priest who administers a church (for the tithe imposed on such beneficia see Adalhard &lt;VI. 5&gt;, 117; or simply, the name for any manorial or servile holding. beneficium relaxatum: Released benefice. Used by Adalhard to designate manorial holdings lying at such distance from the abbey as to prevent direct exchange of services (95 n19). berbicaritia, berbicaria: In medieval Latin, a sheepfold or, a facility for raising sheep. On the Plan exemplified by the House for Sheep and Shepherds (II, 35, 297; berbicarii, Adalhard &lt;I, 2&gt;, 99. bibliothecarius: Librarian. The monastic official in charge of the monastery's holdings in manuscripts; also called armarius. BLADE: One of the two converging members of a cruck truss; see CRUCK. Also used to denote a raking beam. bonuarium: See bunnaria. bord (ON): Table. So-called because of the wooden boards set up on trestles for eating in the aisles of the Saga Period house (stofa) and removed after the meal to make room for the occupants bedding in such instances where there was no separate house for sleeping (skáli) available; whence in modern English, "room and board." BRACE: An oblique subsidiary member that lends stiffness to two principal members to prevent the system from rocking and swerving, often placed under beams having spans too long to allow them to rest unsupported. A brace may be straight, bent (elbow brace), or arched (arch brace). In large structures braces are often formed of very heavy timbers and doubled. If braces extend from the same upright in two or three different directions they are called two-way or three-way braces (figs. 7 and 8). Braces which lie in the plane of the roof, stiffening the corners between the converging timbers of the principal trusses and their purlins, are called wind braces. braciator, bratsator, or braxator: Brewer. Also see bracitorium, sicerator. bracile: Belt. See cultellus and vestimenta. bracitorium: Brew House. The term appears only once in the Plan in the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. In the House for Distinguished Guests it is referred to as the domus conficiendae celiae; in the Monks' Bake and Brew House as hic fribus conficiat ceruisa. In other sources called bracinum, bratiarium. For bracibus decima (the tithe) see Adalhard &lt;VI, 4&gt;, 117f. brevis: Literally a summary or abridgment, but in the Middle Ages also frequently used in the sense of directive or letter of mandate. The outstanding Carolingian example is the Brevium exempla ad describendas res ecclesiasticas et fiscales (see II, 36ff). The Directives of Adalhard of Corbie also constituted a brevis (93ff) as did the instructions to each monastic officer (see &lt;I&gt;, 103 n3). In monastic parlance the term breve was also used for the check-out list in which the librarian (bibliothecarius or armarius) records the disposition of the books out on loan. In monachism, it is also used to mean a letter recording decease and obligation of prayer for the soul (see Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 270, 34). The term brevis directly yields our word "writ" as a precept or command of court or office distinct from common law and legislation. brogilus: In Medieval Latin, an enclosed demesne meadow for horses and beasts of burden. bubulcus (-i): Oxherds. On the Plan lodged in the House for Horses and Oxen. bunnaria: Measure of arable land, division of a manse (see mansus). Possibly, like the ACRE, an amount to be plowed by a yoke of oxen in one day. In some medieval documents defined as half of a mansus. Adalhard allots one manse plus six bonuaria to each full-time miller &lt;III&gt;, 103 n19, 105 n34). bura, buria: Shed, coachhouse, for storage especially of carts for transporting produce from gardens and manors (villae). See Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 112ff. butticularius: High administrative officer at the Royal court, responsible for the management of the royal vinyards and breweries and for the supply of wine and beer at the king's table. C caelia, celia: Beer. See cervisa. calciamenta diurna: Day shoes. The synod of 816 prescribed that each monk be issued two pairs of day shoes. caldarium (-a): Cauldron for warming water or cooking vegetables, usually supported by iron tripods. In Classical Latin, the hot room of a Roman bath. calefactorium, calefactoria domus: On the Plan the designation for the Monks' Warming Room located beneath the Dormitory. Its primary function was to give the monks an opportunity in the winter to warm themselves in intervals between services, to dry their clothes, and to meet at certain hours for conversation. Heat was produced in a subterranean firing chamber (caminus ad calefaciend?) and circulated in ducts beneath the floor of the building (see HYPOCAUST). In both Novitiate and Infirmary, warming rooms are referred to as pisale. CALENDAR (kalendarium): Written formulation of the Christian liturgical year as observed in a diocese or abbey. Though based on the Julian kalends, nones, and ides (whence the name), the annual cycle did not usually begin with 1 January (Circumcision), but with Advent, Nativity, or Easter. The Corbie year was reckoned from Nativity in Adalhard's calendar of drink allowances (see &lt;I, 2&gt; 104ff). On the effect of the monastic time table upon the modern concept of timing, see I, 253ff. calix (-ices): Beaker. The beaker of Corbie, according to Adalhard, held 1/96 of a modius, which, according to capacity measures then in use, would amount to 0.7 liters. camba: Brew- or malthouse, where cervisa, q.v., is made Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 107ff. For cambis decima, the tithe for malthouses, see Adalhard &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 116ff. camera: On the Plan used not in the sense of chamber, but to designate a storage room primarily for food supplies: thus the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, Novitiate and Infirmary, and where this facility is in convenient proximity to refectory (refectorium) and kitchen (coquina). In the Abbot's House (I, 321ff) the room referred to as camera is too distant and inaccessible from the kitchen to carry that sense, and thus more likely stands for the room serving as the monastic treasury. For the location of the monastic camera in Cluny, see II, 335, fig. 515. camerarius: Chamberlain. Monastic official responsible for the clothing of the brothers, their bedding and all of the monastery's tools and utensils. In this capacity he was in charge of the activities carried on in the Great Collective Workshop, the House for Coopers and Wheelwrights and the monastic Vestiary (vestiarium). His counterpart at the royal court is in charge of the royal treasury. For a fuller description of his duties see I, 335; Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 99 n3, and &lt;VI&gt;, 105 nn74, 65. caminata: Presumed diminutive for camera caminata. On the Plan, used to designate rooms heated by corner fireplaces (House for Distinguished Guests and Porter's Lodging) as well as for the corner fireplaces themselves (Abbot's House). This amenity is a prerogative of persons of high standing. For a historical and etymological discussion, see II, 123ff. caminus; caminus ad calefaciend?: Oven, furnace, kiln. On the Plan used for firing chambers of the hypocaust system for the Monks' Warming Room and for the heatable room (pisale) of the Novitiate. Heat is transmitted to the building through heat ducts (not shown in the Plan) drafted by means of external smoke stacks (euaporatio fumi). Also used in the sense of "oven in the Monks' Bake and Brew House." But in the Bake House for Distinguished Guests and the Bake House for Pilgrims and Paupers the baking oven is referred to as fornax. For a historical and etymological discussion of the term in both its meanings, see II, 124ff. camisia or tunica: Shirt or tunic. See vestimentum. campana: A church bell rung with a rope and mounted in a tower so as to be heard outside of the church over a wide distance not to be confused with the sigum and tintinabulum, smaller gong-like sounding devices, announcing liturgical hours or events during the Divine Office or at other important events in the monastic timetable. canalis: A water trough for washing the hands. CANOPY: A hood or cover of fabric or other more permanent materials raised on columns over royal thrones or altars. An ancient symbol of the celestial dome and hence, by implication, of universal rulership transmitted from the Roman gods to the Roman emperor and from the emperor to Christ, as Christ acquired the status of a Roman state god. Also see ciborium. cantherius: In architecture, the classical designation for RAFTER, and in particular the strong principal rafters of roofs of broad span. Literally: "a beast of burden," an appropriate allusion to the load-bearing action of this important roof timber, which should not be confused with the outer or common rafters (asseres). cantor: Choirmaster. A monastic official who "regulates whatever pertains to the chant." In his commentary to the RB, Hildemar of Corbie defines him as a soloist "who modulates his voice." He is assisted in these tasks by others specially trained in chant, the praecentor, the succentor, and the concentor. In early monastic life he also performed the functions of the librarian (armarius or bibliothecarius). cantus: Chant, chanting. See s.v. versus. capa, cappa: A cape, cope, or hooded cloak (Adalhard &lt;I, 4&gt;, 105 n30ff). The synod of 816 prescribes that each monk be issued two copes "to which might be added a third one if necessity requires." Also see capella; cf. vestimentum. capella: Literally, goat. In this sense used on the Plan in the title of the House for Goats and Goatherds; but in the Middle Ages it was the designation for a special room at the court of the Merovingian kings, in which the cape of St. Martin was kept; subsequently applied generically to similar places of worship called chapels, and to the ecclesiastic (chaplain) in charge of such places. capellanus: Chaplain. By origin the cleric who served as head of the royal chapel at the Merovingian court where the cloak of St. Martin was kept as a sacred relic. Subsequently the official title for the heads of lesser seigneurial chapels. Also see arcicapellanus. CAPITAL: In architecture, the head or uppermost member of a column or pilaster, crowning the shaft and taking the weight of the ENTABLATURE. In palaeography, the words or letters standing at the head of page, or at the beginning of a line or paragraph. Capital letters are letters of the form and relative size used in this position. In writing, majuscules are termed `Capitals' to distinguish them from small letters, or minuscules. Capitals are called `upper case' letters, minuscules `lower case', because of their position in a printer's type-storage case. CAPITAL LETTERS (majuscules) upper MINUSCULE LETTERS lower CAPITAL Höchst, Church of St. Justinian capitale: Pillow. Prescribed as a mandatory item for the monk's bedding, RB, 55. See vestimentum. capitula: Little chapters, the chapter titles in a Table of Contents in Carolingian manuscript books; also topics. We have translated capitula as "Rubrics", 121ff. Cf. capitulare, capitulum. CAPITULARY: A legislative, administrative or managerial ordinance or promulgation (capitulare), as they emanated from the Merovingian and Carolingian court; so-called because divided into capitula, or chapters. The most outstanding Carolingian example is the famous Capitulare de villis, a royal ordinance issued by Charlemagne shortly before 800 to correct certain abuses in the administration of royal estates, and to set a managerial program for the future. capitulum: In Classical and medieval Latin: chapter, or paragraph. In legal usage: clause or article. In religious life: the reading of a chapter from the scriptures. In monastic life: the daily reading of a chapter from, e.g., the Rule of St. Benedict, as well as the daily assembly of monks for conduct of abbatial business starting with reading of a chapter; by further extension, the place or building in which these assemblies were held, a chapter house. The monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall does not provide for such a house; instead, chapter meetings were held in the cloister walk running along the southern flank of the Church. The same conditions prevailed in the cloister built by Abbot Ansegis in Fontenella, 823-833. On the origin and early history of the separate chapter house see II, 336ff. For lectio in capitulo, see Adalhard, Rubric XXXII, above, 121 n141, and Ordo Regularis (Casinensis), Corp. Cons. Mon. I, p. 101, 8-12. capraritia: In medieval Latin "a facility for raising goats" exemplified on the Plan by the House for Goats and Goatherds. capreolus: In architecture the classical designation for the diagonal bracing struts that stiffen the angle between a principal rafter and a king post (see RAFTER). Literally: "wild goat," a term expressive of the butting action of this timber, which props the rafters midway in their span and thus prevents them from sagging inward under the load of the roof skin. See cantherius and transtrum. capriata (It): Roof truss, also called incavallatura. See TRUSS. cardo: Part of the terminology of the Roman surveyors. The planning of the countryside and, wherever possible, of the associated towns was based ideally on the intersection at right angles of two main streets of a town (by the Romans called cardo and decumanus), whether they comply with the rules of surveying or not. caritas: Charity. A fundamental Christian concept and primary obligation in monastic living, the act of giving love and succor to the poor, to guests, and to one's own brothers (II, 139). In a more specific sense, an allotment of special rations of food and drink on festive days or on other special occasions. carnis: Flesh, meat. Consumption of flesh of quadrupeds was categorically forbidden to monks, except in case of illness (RB, 39). Benedict did not explain the reasons for this injunction, but Hildemar of Corbie in his commentary (845) on the Rule, informs us that it was "because of the pleasurable taste" and "because the desires of the flesh are more easily aroused where greater delight and pleasure is encountered in food" (I, 277). The monastic workmen and guests were exempt from this ruling. (For storage and distribution of pork at Corbie, see Adalhard &lt;VII&gt;, 118ff. also see I, 305.) CAROLINGIAN MINUSCULE: The book hand, which was cultivated throughout the Empire at the time of the Plan, in which it is written (see 95 n9). It was revived in printer's roman type. casa: Virtually synonymous with domus. casa vasallorum: See vasallus. cassati homines (vel vassi): See Adalhard &lt;VI, 5&gt;, 113. castellum: In medieval times a term for circumvallation; fortifications of the type used in Roman military camps. castrum: Military camp, theoretically rectangular though in practice often square or trapezoidal in plan. The layouts normally conform to one of two main types, one with two main streets (via quintana and via principalis) running parallel to the long sides, the other (characteristic of permanent fortresses) with two main streets intersecting at right angles (cf. cardo). CATHEDRA: Throne of the bishop or in a monastery, of the abbot. In churches with synthronon, often installed in the apex of the semicircular bench against the wall of the apse. cava aedium (cavaedium): Vitruvian term for types of Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman Houses with open inner courts, wholly or partially roofed over. Vitruvius (VI. 3) distinguishes five main types: 1: tuscanicum, which he, Varro, and others ascribed to the Etruscans, i.e., a house with an inner court (atrium) whose roof sloped downward toward a central opening (compluvium) through which the rain descended to a rain catch-basin (impluvium) in the floor beneath it; a: displuviatum, in which the roof sloped upwards towards the compluvium; 3: tetrastylon, with columns at each of the four corners of the compluvium; 4: corinthium, with intermediate columns also; and 5: testudinatum, with a court entirely roofed over and often even surmounted by a second level of rooms. cavea: Tiers for seating in a Roman theater or amphitheater, so-called because installed in a cavity originally excavated from a hillside. cavicchia, cavicchio (It): A pin of wood, in timber architecture used in various fastening applications. cellanovitiorum: See NOVITIATE. cellararius: Cellarer. A monastic official in charge of everything pertaining to the kitchen or to food after it had reached the monastery, including buildings in which these supplies were stored and prepared—the Cellar (cellarium), the Larder (lardarium), and the Kitchen (coquina or culina) as well as the work performed in these buildings. He may be assisted by junior cellarers and by a cellarer for the monastery's serfs and laymen (cellararius familiae). For a fuller description of his qualifications and duties see I, 333; Adalhard &lt;I&gt;, 103 n3; &lt;V&gt;, 105ff; &lt;VII&gt;, 118ff. Also: a lay keeper of rural food stores on outlying monastic estates. cellarium: Cellar. Traditionally, a storeroom or -house for supplies of food and drink required by a monastic community, usually associated with a larder (lardarium). On the Plan this term appears twice, once to designate the function of a relatively small square room in the Annex to the Abbot's House, in which the pantry supplies for the Abbot's Kitchen (coquina) are stored a second time as the name of the lower storey (infra cellarium) of a building 40 feet wide and 87½ feet long) which contains the barrels in which the monastery's wine and beer are stored. The upper level of this building provides a larder, and storage for "other necessary supplies" (lardari? &amp; alior? necessarior? repositio). From the Merovingian period onward cellarium designates a rural collecting point, in which the produce of royal and seigneurial fiscs (fiscus) is gathered and stored. In such cases the term refers to both the institution and the buildings of such a collecting point (cf. Henri Pirenne, "Le cellarium fisci, Une institution economique des temps mérovingiens," Bull. Ac. Roy. de Belg., CL, Lettres, 5° sér., XVI [1930], 201-211). cena (coena, caena): A meal or supper. The Last Supper or the day on which it is commemorated (Maundy Thursday). In monastic life, the evening meal in periods when three meals are served in the course of a day as was the case with monks when they were bled. (For the number and timetable of meals taken by healthy monks see I, 275.) censum: Tribute, tax, or rent in money or kind. For Adalhard on legitimum censum, see &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 117. centuria: A group of 100 items; in Roman military language, an army unit of 100 men, formed of ten contubernia (see contubernium). CENTURIATION: A term used in Roman land surveying; the system of laying out squared land units with a side of 2400 Roman feet (the Roman standard for state lands). Each square contained an area of 200 jugera (ca. 124+ acres or 50+ hectares) and were called centuriae since in theory each contained 100 plots of the early colonial land subdivision. ceruisa (cereuisia), caelia (celia), cerea: Beer. By Pliny (Hist. Nat., XXII, 82) described as words of Celtic origin denoting beverages drunk in his days in Celtic Spain and Gaul. St. Columban defines it as a beverage "boiled down from the juices of corn and barley, used in preference to other beverages by all nations in the world". On the Plan the terms ceruisa and celia are used interchangeably; Ceruisa: House for Distinguished Guests; Monks' Bake and Brew House and Brewer's granary. Celia: House for Distinguished Guests, Monks' Bake and Brew House. It is a substitute for wine in periods of shortage (Adalhard &lt;I, 3&gt;, 105 n 25.) On basic procedures and equipment for making beer and the history of beer see II, 259ff. On the association of brewing and baking see pistrinum. CHAIN: An English measure of length, the equivalent of 66 English feet; internally divided into 100 links. CHANCEL: From Latin cancellum. See PRESBYTERY. CHANCEL BARRIER: A low partition separating CHANCEL from areas accessible to laymen. Enclosures of this type were usually composed of moulded and often intricately sculptured slabs and, in Carolingian times became a prominent feature of monastic architecture in Northern Italy and transalpine Europe. See CLOSURE SLAB. chorus: An area of the church in front of an altar screened off for monks chanting during services. The Plan shows two such areas: the principal one in the crossing, the smaller adjacent to the western apse of the Church. The former is referred to as chorus psallentium which, because it has only a relatively limited seating capacity (four benches) was probably reserved for the specially trained singers in charge of the more difficult passages of the counter song. ciborium: A column-supported canopy raised over the altar of Christ. On its historical and symbolic connotations see CANOPY. circator (-es): Literally "the one who walks around." In monastic life the overseer in charge of maintaining order and propriety as well as the unslothful performance of meditative reading and prayer (lectio divina, q.v.). circinnator: Circator, proctor, monitor (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n7). A senior appointed to supervise hours set aside for reading. circulus (-i): The hoops of a wooden barrel, made of iron or wood. On the origin and cultural history of the barrel (tunna) see I, 293ff. claustrum: Cloister. From Latin claudere, to shut, to lock; in classical times used in the sense of bounds and confines. On the Plan used to mean an architectural entity consisting of an open court surrounded by galleried porches (porticus) that give access to and connect the principal claustral structures (Dormitory, Refectory and Cellar). Four-cornered porches ranged around an open yard (quadriporticus) were used in antiquity for a variety of different functions, and sporadically in Syria as courts attached to churches and surrounded by living quarters of the monks and clergy, as at Umm-is-Surab and Id-Dêr. Its acceptance as a standard form for monastic housing in the Carolingian period depended on the rejection of the semi-hermitic forms of living of the Irish monks in favor of the highly controlled and ordered forms of communal living prescribed by St. Benedict. It was also an answer to the need for internal architectural separation of monks from monastic serfs and workmen, who had entered an economic symbiosis with the monks, when the monastery, in the new agricultural society that arose north of the Alps, acquired the structure of a large manorial estate. (See Horn, 1974.) CLERESTORY: In a building of basilican design, the fenestrated wall above the nave arcades, which rises above the roof of the aisles. clerus, clericus: Clerks, clergy. Derived from Ps. LXVII:14. Anyone in ecclesiastical orders of any kind, hence of some schooling. However, the RB suggests limitations in use to those in minor orders (gradi sacerdotum vel clericorum—Rule 61). Clerici seculares (extranei) were excluded from cloisters by the Council of Aachen (817), Decretum II (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 473). Adalhard (&lt;I, 4&gt;, 105; and cf. &lt;I, 1&gt;), 99 n4) calls the novices "clerici canonici." CLOISTER VAULT: A vault composed of four, eight, or twelve curved surfaces, as would result from the interpenetration of two, four, or six barrel vaults of equal height and diameter (Brit. domical vault); also, a four-, eight-sided, etc., dome. CLOSURE SLAB: A low stone partition separating chancel from nave, usually about handrail height, with intricate sculptured features; they became prominent features in churches and cathedrals. cochlea: Winding staircase. On the Plan used in connection with the Church towers: ascensus per cocleam. cochlearis or cochlearius: A ladle used in cooking, for skimming fat or to move or cover hot cinders in the fire. cocus, coquinus, coquinarius: Cook. Cooks in the coquina fratrum are brothers serving in order of rotation under supervision of the cellararius. COENOBITE: A member of a monastic community that is committed to the principle of communal forms of living and serving God, historically superseding, but never fully supplanting or eradicating anachoretic forms of monasticism. See ANCHORITE, coenobium. coenobium: A monastery committed to communal forms of living. On the earliest coenobitic monasteries and the role St. Benedict played in diffusing this form of monasticism see I, 241ff; on its alliance with feudal agrarianism, see I, 343; 349ff. co-hortus (cors, cohors): From the image of Christian soldier (miles Christi) is attracted the classical term co-hortus an enclosed yard, or the militia protecting it. Hence the court, walled garden, or claustral space (cf. e.g. Bede, H. E. iv, 24, ed. Plummer I, 260, 28). The architectural and verbal images acted upon each other to influence Carolingian spirituality and secularity, creating a cloister and palace imbued with "courtliness," overlapping and interchanging with curtis, curia. COLLARBEAM: See BEAM. colonus: A man who enjoyed personal freedom, but was inseparable from the land he cultivated. See s.v. familia. columbarium (-a): Literally, dove cote, whence a sepulchral chamber with rows of small recesses like nesting boxes to hold ash urns. Also see PUTLOG HOLES. columna: Column. When used in the description of medieval timber buildings, a roof supporting post, or an upright (columna a qua culmen sustentatur = a post supporting the ridge beam. See first. comes palatinus: Count Palatine. Officer in charge of the Empire's judiciary administration). comes stabuli: Official at the royal court in charge of horses and all other means of transportation. COMMON RAFTER: See RAFTER. companaticus: Food to accompany the monastic bread allotment. See Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 n39. competentia horarum: The task and skill of assuring in a monastery the correct maintenance of the prescribed timetable. It was the responsibility of the Sacristan (custos ecclesiae). compluvium: The open portion of the roof of a Roman atrium, above the impluvium. computus: The study and transmission of knowledge about the Christian calendar; a primary curricular subject of monastic learning. concentor: An assistant to the cantor. Hildemar of Corbie defines him as a monk who "harmonizes" (consonat) the monastic chant. conch: In architecture: the domed roof of a semicircular apse; also the apse as a whole. tetraconch: A building composed of four conchs. conclave: On the Plan used to mean bedroom or quarters for the oxherds in the House for Horses and Oxen and their Keepers. For other terms used in the same sense, see cubiculum, mansio, mansiuncula and repausatio. conducticius, conducendos homo: Harvest transport (from conductus). See Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 105 n83; carters? confessio: In a church a subterranean chamber or recess located below or near the altar and sheltering a relic, in general of the body of the patron or the founding saint. In Carolingian times that part of the CRYPT reserved for the private services of the monks, and not accessible to laymen, who gain access to the relics through an outer or corridor crypt. consuetudo: A single, consistent, and binding rule or code intended to govern monastic affairs. Cf. Consuetudines; Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum in Bibliography. Also see regula, regula mixta. contubernium: Literally, a tent- or hut-companionship (from taberna = hut). In Roman military usage, an army unit usually of ten men. In Roman military camps, barracks were constructed to house 100 men (centuria) and were internally divided into ten rooms, each housing one contubernium. contus: A pole to carry cauldrons (caldaria); also a stoking-iron to reduce the fire; also a lance on which to carry a banner (Niermeyer, s.v.). coquina (-æ) or culina: Kitchen. A monastery of the size shown on the Plan, because of the different dietary regulations, and the prohibition for monks to intermingle or share their meals with the serfs or visiting laymen, had at least six different Kitchens: the Monks' Kitchen the Abbot's Kitchen, the Kitchen for the Novices, the Kitchen for the sick monks, the Kitchen for the Pilgrims and Paupers. It is not clear where the meals for the serfs and workmen were cooked (for a possible explanation see I, 73-74). For conditions at Cluny, as reflected in the Consuetudines Farfenses, where distinction is made between a coquina regularis and a coquina laicorum see II, 337ff. On dietary distinctions see I, 257ff. For the management of the refectory at Corbie see Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 109ff, for the monastic officials in charge of Refectory and Kitchen see cellarius; for the performance of the work in the Monks' Kitchen by brothers assigned to it for the period of a week see I, 279, and s.v. hebdomadarius. CORBEL: A projecting stone or piece of timber supporting a super-incumbent weight. corbus: Basket, a capacity measure that was according to Adalhard the equivalent of 5 modii. Also see Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 106 n50, 56. corda, chorda (It): String or rope finished from several strands. In Palladian and post-Palladian architectural usage, a horizontal beam forming part of a TRUSS and acting in compression, e.g., as a tie beam (corda maggiore) or a collar beam (corda minore). See transtrum. coriarius (-i): Tanner. On the Plan housed in the Main House of the Great Collective Workshop. corinthium: See cava aedium. CORNERFIREPLACE: See caminata. corrector: A proof-reader. The corrector was among the most experienced and most learned monks. The explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall were written by a main scribe and a corrector, the latter possibly identifiable as a famous teacher, Reginbertus of Reichenau. For more detail on this question see I, 13 and 149. cotis ad acuendum: Whetstone. COUNTER APSE: A second apse added at the entrance side of the church, sporadically used in Early Christian times but almost a standard feature in Carolingian architecture. In some early churches the counter apse is clearly the heritage of a pre-existing basilica of pagan times put to Christian use. In others, it was added to a previously single-apsed church to serve as a sepulchral martyrium for a saint whose growing importance called for a second place of veneration in a location comparable, if not equivalent, to that of the patron saint (whose services continued to be held in front of the primary apse). A typical example is the abbey church of Fulda. The Church of the Plan offers an interesting variant, since here the services held in honor of the founder, St. Gall, are celebrated at the same altar at which the original patron, St. Mary, is venerated ("altar s?c??. mariae &amp; s?c?? galli"). The eastern apse contains the altar of St. Peter; the western apse the altar of St. Paul. For full discussion of these issues see I, 199-204ff. Also see exedra. COWL: See cucullus. CROSSING: In a Christian church, the area or space created by the intersection of nave and transept. If nave and transept are of equal height and the area of intersection is framed by boundary arches, it is a disengaged crossing, "ausgeschiedene Vierung." If the crossing is formed by the intersection of a nave with a low transept and framed by arches or wall projections of different height, it is referred to in German literature as "abgeschnürte Vierung." CROSS IN SQUARE: An Early Christian church type with nave and transept of more or less equal length and width, inscribed into a square. The earliest forms are timber roofed; later forms are vaulted (see QUINCUNX). The combination of this church type with the Constantinian transept basilica leads to the appearance of the cruciform or Latin-cross basilicas of the Carolingian period. CRUCK TRUSS: A straight, bent, or arch-shaped truss formed by two heavy converging timbers, called BLADES, placed at bay intervals down the length of a building to support the roof skin by means of plates and purlins which rest either on the back of the cruck blades or are secured to their flanks. To obtain matching shapes the two paired blades of a cruck truss were often cut from the same tree, making use of its natural growth. In a BASE CRUCK the blades do not rise to the ridge of the roof but terminate in a collar piece or another structural member. (See Horn and Charles, 1973). CRYPT: Latin cripta, from Greek ????τ?ζ = hidden, concealed. In Roman architecture, a subterranean gallery such as the hidden ramps in a theater or amphitheater. In church architecture, a chamber or vault beneath the main floor, not necessarily underground and usually containing the relics of the saint who founded the sanctuary (or in later days, the graves of the founders and donors of the church). Also see vomitorium. The crypt of the Church of the Plan consists of two parts: an outer ?shaped corridor crypt through which the visiting laymen gain access to the tomb of St. Gall and an inner crypt called confessio where the monks may pray near the tomb of the Saint without intermingling with visiting laymen. On the development of such arrangements and controversies surrounding it see I, 144, 169ff and 196ff. cubiculum, cubilium: Bed chamber, or sleeping quarters. On the Plan used in this sense in the House for Distinguished Guests, the Abbot's House, the houses for threshing, grinding and parching of grain, and all the houses for livestock in the western service yard of the monastery. In other buildings, rooms performing the same function are referred to as mansiones, mansiunculae, or repausationes. Sleeping quarters are consistently installed in the outer or peripheral rooms of a building. Their function never fuses with that of the main hall (domus) of the building. cucullus (coc-), or cuculla: Cowl. Benedict (RB, 55) prescribes that each monk be issued two cowls (one "thick and wooly in winter," the other "thin or worn in summer"). See vestimentum. culatium (or culacium): A lean-to, literally, behind posterior. In twelfth-century descriptions of English barns a term designating that section of the barn under the hipped portion of the roof at the narrow ends of the building. Also see ala, LEAN-TO. culina: See coquina. culmen: Ridge or RIDGE PIECE; also see first. cultellus: Knife. Benedict (RB, 55) listed it as one of the mandatory items of equipment to be issued each monk. It was carried on a belt (bracile) which must be taken off at night, so that the monks "may not be cut by their knives in their sleep" (ibid., chap. 22). cultrum: A coulter, i.e. a plowshare or a cutter attached to the beam of a plow. cultrum ad lardum: Knife, for cutting lard. cunei: The wedge-shaped blocks of seating, divided by radiating passages, in a theatre or amphitheatre. cuppa: A tub or basin for cleaning vegetables before they are put into the cooking cauldron (caldarium). cupa balnearia: Bath tub. The term does not occur on the Plan; but its bath-houses show them. curia: The classical seat of the tribunal, used also to denote its decisions. In administering civil law and real property, the abbot, sometimes with elders, often constituted a curia; hence some confusion arose with co-hortus and curtis—all contributing to "courtliness," though of separate origins (see p. 95). curticula: A fenced-in space of modest dimensions, a farmyard or garden (diminutive of curtis); for curticulum abbatis see Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n6. See curtis. curticulum: The forecourt of a medieval fortification, to be distinguished from the inner court (curtis, I, 116). curtis: Enclosure. From Latin cohors. In medieval Latin, a fenced-in space containing a house and a yard; a landowner's homestead; an outlying manorial estate or settlement either monastic or secular; and on the highest social levels, a center of agricultural exploitation of a domain or manor. Also used in the sense of palace (palatium), baronial residence or royal court. For a fuller analysis see II, 41 n43. With regard to the size, number and topographical spread of monastic estates see I, 349ff. See villa. custodiens (-entes): Caretaker, custodian. The term occurs only once on the Plan in the phrase "custodientes familiae quae cum seruitio aduenerit," (the custodians of the House for Servants from Outlying Estates). They have permanent quarters in this house. Cf. custos. custos (-des): Caretaker, guardian (also see custodiens). In medieval Latin, a generic term for a variety of ecclesiastical and monastic officials, mainly in their capacities as administrators of the temporalities associated with their offices, ranging from the level of bishops and abbots to that of keepers of hens and geese or the keeper of the woodpile. custos aucarum: The Keeper of the Geese. On the Plan he lives in the south aisle of the House of the Fowlkeepers. custos cartarum: Writer and/or Keeper of Charters, as distinct from scribes who devoted their time to copying books. custos ecclesiae: Sacristan. Monastic official in charge of supervising services celebrated at the altar, as opposed to the choral phase of the opus Dei which came under the jurisdiction of the cantor. One of the sacristan's primary and most important duties was to assure the correct maintenance of the prescribed liturgical time table, computentia horarum, I, 335ff and 353ff. See computus. custos equaritiae: Keeper of the Brood Mares. On the Plan, they live in the House for Brood Mares, Foals and their Keepers. custos infirmorum: Warden of the Sick (I, 144). Concerned with the general welfare of the sick and the living conditions in the monastic Infirmary (infirmorium), his office should not be confused with that of the physician (medicus) or physicians who had charge of medical analysis and treatment, and who, although they lived within the monastic enclosure (House of the Physicians) were not necessarily monks. custos panis: Keeper of the Bread. Monastic official responsible for supplying the community with its daily requirements of bread, of making allowance for the yearly fluctuations in the number of monks, serfs, and guests to be fed by providing for a reasonable surplus of four, so as not to be caught short, and not to bake more than is needed "lest what is left over should get too hard" (Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 107). custos pomorum: Keeper of the Orchard. custos pullorum: Keeper of the Hens. He lived in the north aisle of the House of the Fowlkeepers. custos vinearum: Keeper of the Vineyards. He is under the jurisdiction of the Provost (praepositus). custodia claustri: See Rubrics of Adalhard, 121ff. D DAIS: The high table, including its platform, in the innermost bay of a feudal hall, where the lord and his family took their meals, and where distinguished persons sat at feasts or royalty on a throne; often surmounted by a canopy. decanus: Dean. Originally denoting the leader of a group of ten (decem) men, both in secular and ecclesiastical life. Later the name of a monastic official in charge of the spiritual conduct of the monks and of monastic discipline. The senior deans (decani seniores) were often assisted by junior deans (decani iuniores) to whom the senior deans could delegate any particular function of their office of maintaining monastic discipline. For more detail, see I, 332; Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n.9 and Rubric III, 121. decempeda: A Roman lineal measure of 10 feet. Cf. PERCH. DECIMAL SYSTEM: The method of counting and measuring in units of ten. It owes its origin to the fact that man has ten fingers, and that counting in early societies, as is still done today in many places, was performed with aid of the hand. On the shortcomings of the decimal system compared with others of comparable historical importance, see DUODECIMAL and SEDECIMAL systems. decimum: Literally, one tenth. In medieval life a term for the mandatory tithe, usually consisting of one tenth of a feudal tenant's annual industrial or agricultural produce. Cf. seruitium. A complete description of tithing procedures at Corbie is given by Adalhard &lt;VI&gt;, 111ff, and notes. decimatio: Rendering or receiving of tithe; also the right to exact it. decimator: Official in charge of collection of tithes. decumanus: See cardo. Dele: See flet. denarius: A monetary unit. Twelve denarii = 30 solidi, an amount fixed in the synod of 817. Garden produce sold for money (denarii), Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 114 n110. Also see libra. DIACONICON: A room attached to or enclosed in the church; in Early Christian times, utilized for the reception of the congregation's offerings and serving as archive, vestry, and library; later used only for the latter functions (also, a sacristy. See secretarium.) Also see PASTOPHORY. diaconus: Deacon. A member of the third evangelical order, below bishop and priest. In imperial schools at the time of Hrabanus Maurus a student, having as a clerus graduated from propacdeutic studies of reading, writing, counting, chanting, entered the diaconal order for five years of study of biblical interpretation before ordination as priest at the canonical age of thirty (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n4). DIAPHRAGM ARCH: A masonry surmounted arch that spans the nave of a church crosswise, springing from shafts attached to (usually) alternate piers. The diaphragm arch, although known considerably earlier, became fashionable in Norman architecture of the 11th century. It is one of the precursors of an all-pervasive system of shafts and arches that divided the component spaces of Romanesque and Gothic churches lengthwise, crosswise and in their entire height into a modular sequence of clearly definable bays. It is with the aid of the diaphragm arch and its supporting shafts that the SQUARE SCHEMATISM, introduced in Carolingian architecture, is first projected upwards into the roof system and transversely across the body of the nave and the aisles of the church. It is also through its embodiment in the diaphragm arch that a divisional principle, first expressed in the boundary arches of disengaged crossings is projected into the longitudinal body of the church; see CROSSING. DIRECTIVE: See brevis. disciplinum: Apprentice. As in Adalhard &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 116, disciplinum potarii. dispensa: Storeroom, or stores (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103). displuviatum: See cava aedium. diurnales: Vestments of the day. See vestimentum. dolatorium: An adze, a cutting tool with an arched blade set at right angles to the handle, used for scantling timbers. dolium (-a): A large earthenware jar for storing wine in bulk, occasionally so large that a fully grown man could stand erect inside of it without being visible. Dolia were covered by a convex lid (operculum) sealed to the vessel by a heavy layer of pitch, and buried to the rim in a deep layer of sand. DOME: A hemispherical or ovoidal vault. When raised over a space of square or polygonal shape, it is supported in the corners by SQUINCHES or PENDENTIVES; not to be confused with CLOISTER VAULT. From Latin domus, house; presumably domus Dei, house of God (whence NHG Dom and It. duomo) or domus episcopalis, a term used in the Middle Ages for the quarters of the clergy, whose members originally lived together like monks in houses attached to one flank of the church. Initially applied to the whole of the structure, from the 15th century onward the terms is progressively used to designate the hemispherical vault surmounting certain parts of the building. This restriction might have been influenced by late Roman doma, a term used by the Church Fathers to mean "roof." In NHG Dom means both the structure and the vault. In It., the linguistic conflict was resolved by the early introduction of the term cupola, from the Latin cupa, tub. Fr. could avoid linguistic duplicity by the felicitous use from the 12th century onward of the term ecclesia cathedralis, the church with the throne (cathedra) of the bishop. Dosme or dome were used in the later Middle Ages briefly in the sense of domed vault, but soon, under Italian influence, were abandoned to make room for coupole. dominicatus: Property that is part of the center of a manorial domain and exploited by the lord directly (mansio dominicata, casa dominicata, mansioles dominicatae) as distinguished from outlying property held in tenure. On domus dominica, see 97 n31; iussio dominica, the domain as constituted authority, see 91 n6 and Adalhard (VI, 2&gt;, 114 n8. dominicus: Royal, or pertaining to a royal or seignorial manor. Used in reference to property as well as to persons; also see dominicatus. domus (-us): In classical Latin the designation for a house, the residence of a single well-to-do family as distinct from both the huts or tenements of the poor and, under the Empire, from the apartment houses (insulae) of the middle class. In Merovingian times, the term meant all or any portion of property, buildings or fields. (See e.g. Greg. Tur., H.F. X, 29). On the Plan, domus is used once to mean the entire building: "Ista domus cunctus . . ." begins the inscription in the House for Goats and Goatherds. In all other cases domus (as its qualifying adjectives reveal) identifies the most important spatial component of the building: its common living room (domus communis) or principal room (domus ipsa) where its occupants gather around the open central fireplace (locus foci) as distinguished from the peripheral rooms that serve more specialized functions such as sleeping or the stabling of livestock. Sometimes, but not always, domus is interchangeable with mansio or casa denoting parts, or all of secular or ecclesiastical properties, and by figural extension their spiritual or ideal forms. On domus dominica see 97 n31. dormitorium: Sleeping quarters. The term occurs six times on the Plan, always to designate a sleeping room for a relatively large number of people, primarily monks. Bedrooms of serfs or workmen are referred to as cubilia and in a few cases only, as mansiones or repausationes. Dormitorium is a conversion into a noun of the neuter form of dormium = pertaining to sleep and originally related to cubiculum. It occurs extremely rarely in Classical Latin, is used by Pliny, is found in a small number of Early Christian inscriptions, but is not found in early monastic literature.1. 1.

Even in the RB, the term dormitorium is conspicuously absent,8. 8. In his famous chap. 22 of the Rule, "Quomodo dormiant monachi," he refers to the monks' sleeping quarters on one place simply as locus, in another as cella: Si potest fieri, omnes in uno loco dormiant; sin autem multitudo non sinit, deni aut viceni cui senioribus, qui super eos soliciti sint, pausent. Candela jugiter in eadem cella ardeat usque mane" (Benedicti Regula, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 77-78, ed. McCann, 1952, 70-71, ed. Steidle, 1952, 200-201). and as late as ca. 750 the author of the Vita S. Filiberti (d. 684) refers to sleeping quarters of Jumièges as domus quiescendi obtentu.9. 9. Vita Filiberti abbatis Gemetiensis et Heriensis, ed. Levison, Mon. Germ Hist., Script. rer. merov. V, Hannover, 1910, 590. For an analysis of this controversial passage, see Horn, 1973, 34-35ff. To the best of our knowledge, the earliest medieval occurrence of dormitorium is in the Vita S. Columbani by Jonas, written shortly after Columban's death in 615.10. 10. Vita Columbani abbatis . . . auctore Iona, cap. 19 (ed. Krusch, 138): "Subito, e medio dormitorii massa ignis in modum modii egressa totam domum perlustravit." The word appears again in the Rule of St. Fructuosus, written 630-635.11. 11. Sancti Fructuosi Regula Monachorum, cap. 3 (ed. Migne, Patr. Lat. LXXXVII, Paris, 1863, col. 1100): "Praepositus sane in medio consistens dormitorio, quodusque cuncti quiescant, omnibus iam circumeat silenter lecta singulorum, ne quis aut tarde se jaceat, aut extra regulam occultis mussitationibus vacet." Bede uses it in his account of the Life and Death of Abbess Hilda of Streaneshalch (Whitby), in connection with a miracle that took place in 680.12. 12. Bede, Eccl. History, lib. iv, cap. 23 (ed. Colgrave-Minors, Oxford, 1969, 412): "Haec tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans." Chrodegang of Metz (d. 766) directs that even the secular clergy should sleep in a common dormitory;13. 13. Sancti Chrodegangi Regula Canonicorum, cap. 13 (ed. Migne, Patr. Lat. LXXXIX, Paris, 1863, col. 1065): "Sint etiam interius [in the cloister of the regular canons] dormitoria, refectoria, cellaria et caetere habitationes usibus fratrum in una societate viventium necessaria"; (ed. Wilhelm Schmitz, Hannover 1889, 4, after a different source with a different wording). from that point, dormitorium becomes the generally accepted term for communal monastic sleeping quarters and in this sense is promulgated throughout numerous imperial capitularies.14. 14. See Corp. Cons. Mon. I, Initia Consuetudinis Benedictinae, Siegburg, 1963, Index, s.v. dormitorium. In light of such linguistic evidence, the diffusion and general acceptance of dormitorium appears to be closely connected with the ascendancy and formal adoption of Benedictine monasticism during the Carolingian period, and the general rejection of the eremitic and individualistic forms of monasticism adhered to by the Irish monks. The Latinity of other terms with specialized meanings used on the Plan is discussed above, 1, 2-8. DOUBLE CATHEDRAL: In Early Christian architecture, a cathedral of two halls or basilicas, their axes placed, as a rule, parallel to each other; the structures served different functions, as yet not fully understood. DOVETAIL JOINT: A joint formed by a tenon in the shape of a dove's tail spread or reversed wedge, to fit an indenture or mortise of corresponding shape. Dovetail tenons are invariably found on the underside of the extremities of a tie beam, the corresponding mortise being cut into the upper surface of the contingent roof plate. The reversed wedge of the tenon locks the roof plates firmly into the tie beam and prevents them from slipping outward under the thrust of the superincumbent rafters. DRIP MOULD (also called HOOD MOULD): A projecting moulding over the heads of windows and doorways, to throw off the rain, or serving to enrich the outline of an arch. DRUM: The circular or polygonal structure on which a dome is raised. drykkjuskáli (ON): Festal hall for drinking or dining. See skáli, stofa. DUODECIMAL SYSTEM: The method of counting and measuring in units of twelve, used in remote periods, and today along with the DECIMAL SYSTEM. It owes its origin to the recognition that 10 cannot be divided easily into three or four parts, whereas 12 not only allows this, but also lends itself to all divisions of which the number 10 is susceptible. The division of the Roman and Anglo-Saxon FOOT into twelve inches (uncia) is conditioned by another observation made early in the life of man, viz, that ca. twelve thumb-breadths of a fully grown person equals the length of his foot (I, 83ff), where the Latin names for all of the duodecimal divisions of the Roman inch are listed. On mensuration based on division of a unit into sixteen parts, see SEDECIMAL SYSTEM. dvergr (ON): Dwarf post, i.e. a short timber rising from the center of a COLLAR BEAM to the ridge of the roof and supporting the RIDGE PIECE (S.V. PURLIN), in Old Norse called moeniáss. E egressus: Literally, egress. On the Plan, indicates the passageway from the Monks' Warming Room to their Bathhouse and Laundry. Also used in the northern arm of the corridor crypt. Also see ingressus eldaskáli (ON): Kitchen house, or a hall heated by an open fire (see eldr). eldr (ON): Fire. In the Saga Period house, the open fire burning in the middle of the center aisle, equivalent of locus foci in the House for Distinguished Guests of the Plan of St. Gall; also see arinn. Long fires, lit in trenches dug along the axis of the center aisle, are referred to as langeldar or máleldar. eleemosynarium: A room in which the monastic almoner administered to the needs of transient paupers. In the monastery of Cluny, according to the Consuetudines Farfenses, this room was 10 feet wide and 60 feet long. ELL: Average length of a grown man's arm measured from elbow to end of the third finger; half of a standard English/US yard. The ell of ca. 18 inches was used in Iceland until 1200, when Bishop Paul doubled it by law into a stika to conform with the English ell of ca. 36 inches. To prevent use of incorrect measure, a standard stika was marked on the walls of churches. Icelandic trade being mainly in the hands of English merchants, the English double ell, or yard, probably prevailed until the end of the fifteenth century (cf. Vigfusson, An Icelandic-English Dictionary, Oxford, 1957, s.v. alin). emundator (-es): Trenchermakers. On the Plan housed in the Main House of the Great Monastic Workshop with the furbishers ("emundatores vel politores gladiorum," II, 195ff; 347). ENGAGED ORDER: Decorative order projecting from, but forming an integral part of, the wall against which it stands; "semiengaged" when only the entablature is engaged and the columns are freestanding. ENTABLATURE: Horizontal course of moulded stones carried by a colonnade, in classical architecture usually divided into three parts: architrave, frieze, and cornice. See ARCHITRAVE. Epfildrac (MHG): Cider. Also see sicerator, Slehendrac. equos seruantes: The Keepers of the Horses. On the Plan lodged in the House for Horses and Oxen. Eren (MHG): In dwellings of Upper Germany and in Switzerland the center room with hearth, and giving access to the subsidiary outer rooms. ESONARTHEX: See NARTHEX euaporatio fumi (exitus fumi): On the Plan the designation for a detached smoke stack that serves as outlet for the smoke produced in the firing chamber (caminus) of the HYPOCAUST and furnishes the latter with the necessary draft (Monks' Warming Room and the pisale of the Novitiate and the Infirmary). For a full discussion of the heating devices used in the various buildings of the Plan of St. Gall see II, 117ff. exedra: Apse. In Roman and Early Christian architecture, a usually semicircular extension of a larger space reserved for the throne of the emperor, the throne of Christ or his terrestrial representatives, the bishop or abbot. In Christian architecture often furnished with a synthronon. The altar may be in the apse, but more generally lies in the nave or transept before the apse. Normally the apse lies at the end of the nave, opposite the church entrance or, if it is provided with a transept, at a corresponding place on the other side of the transept. The usual Early Christian church has only one apse, attached to that end of the nave that lies opposite the entrance. Liturgically and architecturally it forms a focal point of the spatial composition. From the fifth century onward, however, in certain cases a second apse is added on the entrance side of the church (see COUNTER APSE). exitus: Exit. On the Plan used to designate a covered passageway leading from principal to subsidiary buildings, such as to latrines (Monks' Privy, exitus ad necessari?; or to the Outer School, exitus necessarius). In one case the name for the latrine itself (House for Distinguished Guests, exitus necessarius). Also used to mean smoke stack (exitus fumi, Novitiate). For other terms for the same or similar facilities see necessarium. F faber (-ri): Smith; in Carolingian usage fairly limited to workers at the forge, i.e., blacksmith (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103, calls them "fabri grossarii"). On the Plan they are housed in the Annex of the Great Collective Workshop. familia: Family, the collective name for the monastic family of laymen. familia intus: Inner family, referring to laymen living within the monastic enclosure, including craftsmen, herdsman, and minor functionaries. Adalhard (&lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n8) speaks of familia nostra ("community") as only those eligible to live within the monastic enceinte. familia foris: Outer family. The body of serfs and laymen living outside the monastic enclosure on land and in quarters assigned them in exchange for payment of tribute (tributum) or service (servitium). On the Plan they are designated as "familia quae cum servitio aduenerit". The outer family is further divided into coloni, lides, liberi, and servi. Adalhard &lt;IV 108ff&gt;, designates as familia the laborers assigned from villae for weeding the monastic gardens. famulus (-i), famulans (-tes): A lay servant or serf, also referred to as servitor (-es). fascia (-ae): Bandage of linen used in bloodletting. fasciola: Head covering. The synod of 816 prescribes that each monk be issued two such head coverings—and "two more in the case of a journey" (I, 282). FATHOM: A measure usually nautical, of roughly six feet, obtained by extending the arms laterally and measuring from tip to tip of the third fingers; equivalent of a French toise. fauces: The entrance or passageway leading from the street to the atrium of a Roman house. femoralia: Hose or drawers. See vestimentum. fenestrum obliquum: See SPLAYED WINDOW. ferculum: Literally, that on which anything is carried; by extension: a dish or a course of a meal. FINIAL: The terminal stone or group of stones on top of a gable, pinnacle, canopy, or spire, often foliated or cruciform. First (OHG): Ridge, or ridge beam (see culmen; and s.v. PURLIN). For other forms see II, 27n19, and 29. fiscus: In Medieval Latin, a crown estate or royal manor, an estate forming part of the patrimony of a feudal lord, either secular or ecclesiastical, such as a count, bishop or abbot. fiscus dominicus: See dominicus. Firstfalli (OHG): Literally, the pulling down of a ridge beam which causes the roof to fall apart; an act bearing legal sanctions. Firstsul (OHG): The post by which the ridge is carried (columna a qua culmen sustentatur). See first. fjöl (ON): The movable board or boards attached to louvers (ljori, q.v.) that served as smoke escapes and light inlets in houses of the Saga Period. They could be opened and closed by means of poles or ropes. Also see spjaeld and skjaglugger. fjoshlada (ON): Cattle barn. flabellum or flavillum: A fan to ventilate the fire; in liturgical use, a fan or fly whisk carried in the hands of one of the officiating clergy. See I, 288, flabellum vimeneum ad ventilandum, a fan woven of pliant twigs to force air to the fire. fleotomatus: A common medieval designation for a person whose blood is let. For monastic views on bleeding and the salutary effects expected from this practice see II, 184ff. Also see minutio. fleothomus: Medieval form for classical Latin phlebotomus, a lancet for letting blood. Flet (NHG): Designation for the floor (and space) of that portion of the LOWER SAXON FARMHOUSE containing the hearth and serving as living quarters for the farmer and his family, not to be confused with the Dele, the floor (and space) of the center aisle in that part of the buildings in which livestock are stabled. follis: In Classical Latin, crazy. On the Plan, a bellows: "follis ad sufflandum ignem (I, 288; II, 198). FOOT: Linear measure originally based on the average length of a grown man's foot. The English/US standard foot of 12 inches equals 30.48 cm. The classical Roman foot was 29.60 cm, the old Drusian foot, 33.30 cm. The latter was reported to have been adopted by Drusus as a standard measure in certain Germanic and Celtic parts of the empire, hence its name (I, 83ff). It may have been adopted by Carolingian Franks moving into that same territory. The standard foot of medieval France, the pied royal, was equivalent to 32.48 cm, or 12.8 English/US standard inches. The foot-measure of the scale of the Plan of St. Gall is discussed at length, I, 95ff; for more general information, see Arens, 1938. forceps: Iron tongs used in cooking or re-arranging the fire (I, 287; II, 198). FORE CHOIR: A unit of space inserted between the transept and the apse of the church. In inserting this unit the T-shaped plan of the Early Christian basilica is transformed into a Latin cross plan (crux capitata). Also see PRESBYTERY. forestarius: A forester. An official in charge of a royal, seigneurial or monastic forest. formula: A diminutive of forma, serving in classical Latin for such concepts as norm, rule, guiding principle or covenant but also used in the sense of matrix, pattern, or mould. On the Plan used as a designation for a liturgical piece of furniture that may be translated as church bench, as kneeling bench or as prieDieu. fornax: On the Plan, used to mean kitchen stove and baking oven. Cf. caminus. forsæti (ON): Fore chairs, set up in Saga Period houses to seat additional banquet guests on the inner side of the tables (bord) opposite others seated on the long benches (langbekkir) ranged along the walls of the house. forskáli (ON): Entrance bay in a sleeping house (skáli, q.v.) of the Saga Period. It is separated from the principal space of the house by a wooden cross partition. (puerpili, q.v.). forstofa (ON): Entrance bay in the living house (stofa) of the Saga Period, separated from the principal space of the house by a wooden cross partition. foscina: Grappling hook. frater maturus (senior): A monk with authority to adjudicate problems of wine rationing (Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 109, and 110 n86). frater minuendus: A brother who has been bled. See fleotomatus and minutio. forum (-a): An open square or plaza for public affairs; market-place. fullo (-nes): Fuller. On the Plan housed in the Annex of the Great Collective Workshop. fumerium: Literally, smoke hole, a term frequently used in the Liberate Rolls of King Henry III and other English kings. A sampling of these is listed, II, 121 n11. G galilea: Narthex, porch, or chapel at the entrance of a church, from the province of Galilee, a name applied, in medieval architectural language, to outer annexes of the church, probably an allusion to Galilee as an outlying portion of the Holy Land, or to the phrase "Galilee of the Gentiles"— Matthew, IV: 15. See paradisus. genicium (-a): A room, apartment, or house set aside for women; in Carolingian times particularly for the purpose of weaving; a facility mentioned in the Capitulare de villis. golf (ON): Floor. Often used in the sense of center aisle and in this capacity also referred to as midju golf. granarium (granea, granica): Granary. On the Plan this term is used for the Brewer's Granary, while the place for storing the annual harvest is referred to as horreum. GRANGE: From Latin granarium; in a broad sense used to designate a farming establishment, especially one belonging to a monastery, with all of its lands, its houses for the monks, lay brothers or serfs, and its requisite barns and stables. If the grange lay at some distance from the mother house it also had a chapel. In French the term is used interchangeably to denote either the entire establishment, with all of its lands and buildings, or its principal service structure, the barn. Parçay-Meslay is a typical example. GRANGER: From medieval Latin grangerius; one in charge of a grange. The manager or supervising monk of a grange, or the official in the mother house charged with the management of all of the monastery's granges. graphium: Pen. See vestimentum. GREEK CROSS PLAN: A church plan forming a cross with arms of equal or nearly equal length; may be vaulted or unvaulted. GROIN VAULT: The vault formed over a square bay by the interpenetration of two barrel vaults of equal diameter and height, the lines of intersection (the groins) forming a diagonal cross; also known as a cross-vault. gulbium (glubium): Possibly a stripper, from glubere, to de-bark DuCange, citing only this passage, glosses "iron tools" (see Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 108 n78). H HAMMERBEAM: See BEAM. hásaeti (ON): High seat in the Saga Period house, usually located in the middle of one of the two long benches (i midju bekk, II, 23; or in langbekk midjan, II, 79) next to the open fire (eldr) burning in the middle of the center aisle (golf). A second high seat for distinguished visitors was traditionally set up at a corresponding location in the middle of the opposite long bench. See öndveggi and DAIS. hebdomadarius: A week; literally seven days. In monastic usage a monk in charge of a particular duty for a week. Such duties might range from assisting at mass to kitchen service, reading during meal hours in the refectory (I, 279ff; and see Adalhard, hebdomadarius lector, Rubric VI, 121). The term also applies to serfs living on monastic land and liable for weekly labor service. hemina: A capacity measure 1/32 part of the modius in Roman times the equivalent of 0.2736 liters; between the fall of the Roman empire and its renovation under Charlemagne subject to a considerable amount of inflation. In the early years of the reign of Charlemagne it was the equivalent of 1.06 liters. In 794 it was raised by Charlemagne to 1.46 liters, and sometime prior to 822 by Louis the Pious to 2.12 liters. St. Benedict allows each monk "a hemina of wine per day." Charlemagne made several attempts to establish the precise value of this measure. A directive issued during the first synod of Aachen, in 816, stipulates that if a shortage of wine were to occur in a monastery, the traditional measure of wine should be replaced by twice that volume of beer. Our own calculations suggest that at the time the Plan was drawn the hemina was the equivalent of 0.5 or 0.7 liters. Cf. the drink allowances at Corbie (Adalhard &lt;I, 3&gt;, 104) for feast days and the dispensing of the allowance by the cellarius junior under supervision (&lt;IV&gt;, 109). In terms of English measure: One fluid ounce = 0.0295729 liters i.e., 10 ounces = 0.295729 liters. With the hemina = 0.2736 liters, then 10 oz. × 0.2736/0.295729 = 9.2 oz., or 0.57 pints. That is, the hemina would be a little over a half pint. herbularius: On the Plan the designation for the Medicinal Herb Garden. For a list of the plants there cultivated see II, 181; for plants in the Monks' Vegetable Garden, see II, 205, for varieties of fruit trees in the Orchard, II, 212. HERMIT: One who retires from society to live in solitary prayer and religious contemplation. A solitary who chose remote habitations, the hermit thus differed from the ANCHORITE whose cell was often attached to a church or some other human settlement. HIERARCHY: The Greek roots of the word mean, literally, "holy rulership." The term does not occur in classical Greek but is used from the Carolingian period onward to denote a highly sophisticated institutional and conceptual parallelism between the orders of Heaven, Church, and Monarchy that found its most perfect embodiment in the metaphysical speculations of William of Auvergne (see I, 232) and Thomas Aquinas. Of course, there were certain pre-medieval historical elements and speculative components in this metaphysical scheme. For one thing, the fourth century was already conscious that the Church had developed an administrative organization which paralleled that of the Empire, and this consciousness was never wholly lost in the Middle Ages. Just as important, however, was the speculative creation, around 500 A.D., by Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite of a metaphysical scheme paralleling the celestial hierarchies of the angels with the orders of the Church, a structured but not institutional parallelism, geared to the notion of a diffusion in graded stages of descent of divine grace. The metaphysical speculation of the Pseudo-Areopagite penetrated the West in the Greek manuscript presented by Pope Paul I to Pepin I in 758, which, by 835, had been translated into Latin by Hilduin of St.-Denis; a generation later John the Scot revised and refined Hilduin's translation. To summarize the principal stages in the establishment and evolution of the medieval awareness of hierarchical concordance between the institutional structures of sacerdotium and imperium or regnum: around 700, the parallelism of the lay and clerical hierarchies in a kingdom was set forth in a brief capitulum of an Irish canonical collection. A century and a half later, this text reappeared in altered form within the Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals; under the title Scitote (its opening word), this text became extremely influential through its diffusion in canonical collections during the reform of the later eleventh and earlier twelfth centuries. But even before Pseudo-Isidore, the most detailed and extended statement of this theme had already come from the pen of Walahfrid Strabo, writing between 840 and 842 (see I, 231). Precisely in the Age of Reform—for example, in the writings of Bernold of Constance, Bonizo of Sutri, Gilbert of Limerick, and Gratian—there was a renewed and intensified interest in the parallelism of the two hierarchies, informed in part by Walahfrid Strabo's continuing influence. But at any time after the publication of Gratian's Decretum around 1140, the concept of this hierarchical parallelism was a commonplace. R.L.B. * The history of the origins, diffusion, and final crystalization of these great metaphysical schemes is now being studied by Robert L. Benson who graciously contributed this entry.—W.H. hircaritia: In Medieval Latin, a facility for raising and keeping billy goats. hlada (ON): A hog or cattle barn. holera (olera): Vegetables; the term used for plantings in the Monks' Vegetable Garden. See herbularius. horae: See opus Dei. hortolanus: Gardener. Because of the basically vegetarian diet of the monks one of the most important monastic officials. On the Plan provided with his own house. hospitiisligna: Firewood for the hospice. hospitalarius (magister pauperum): See procurator pauperum. hospitalarius religiosorum: See ministerium. HORIZONTAL PROJECTION: The drawing on a flat surface of the primary characteristics of the rising surface of a building. horreum: The classical word for a structure built for storing grain. On the Plan defined as repositio fructu? annali?, "storehouse for the annual harvest of grain". In Medieval Latin the term is not as frequently used as other more specific terms such as granarium and spicarium. hostellarius: Monastic official in charge of the management of the Hospice of Pilgrims and Paupers (Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105ff); on the Plan referred to as procurator pauperum. huiluskáli (ON): See skáli. humblo: Hops, a constituent ingredient in brewing beer; a word of Ural-Altaic origin. On its etymology and use in monastic beermaking see II, 249. For humloni decima (the tithing of hops) see Adalhard &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 117. humilitas: Humility, Benedict of Nursia wrote into his Rule (Chap. 7) a prescription of Twelve Degrees of Humility. For discussion of the virtue in Chapter, see e.g. Adalhard, Rubric II, 121. hypocaust: A space or system of flues through which hot air produced in a firing chamber (caminus) is circulated beneath the floor of a room or building. Necessary draft is generated by a smoke stack (euaporatio fumi) raised at some distance from the building it serves. The use of this well-known Roman heating system in the monastery shown on the Plan discloses that hypocausts were, at the time of Louis the Pious, considered to be a standard heating device for monastic warming rooms (see calefactorium). The Plan provides for three such systems: the Monks' Warming Room, the Warming Room of the Novices (pisale) and the Warming Room of the Infirmary. For a full historical and typological discussion see the chapter "Hypocausts," II, 125ff. hypogaeum: A subterranean tomb chamber (or group of tomb chambers) for private use. I immunitas (-tes), imunitas, munitas: Rights and privileges that were granted by authority, or their certificates. See the Charter of Louis the Pious, above, 120. impluvium: Shallow catch basin in the atrium of a Roman house, to catch the rain falling through the compluvium. IMPOST BLOCK: A block placed between the capital of a column and the arches or vaults it supports. INCH: A unit of measure originally based on the average thumb breadth of an adult man. The modern US and English standard inch equals 2.54 cm. In England the inch was standardized by a statute, presumably of Edward II, to equal "three grains of barley, dry and round" placed end to end. See I, 85ff, for a discussion of the Carolingian inch rule. inclinatorium: Kneeling bench (Fr. prie-Dieu), furnished with a lean-to to support persons when kneeling or bending in prayer. inclusor: Jeweller, lapidary. incus: Anvil. indominicatus: Domain (dominicus: Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 109 n99). infans (-tes): In monastic parlance a child up to the age of seven (cf. puer, adolescens). INFIRMARY (domus infirmorum): The care of the sick was ruled by St. Benedict (RB, 36) as a primary monastic obligation, and one of which "the abbot take the greatest care that they suffer no neglect." He directs that the sick brethren be assigned a special room and an attendant who is God-fearing, diligent and careful (ibid.). The architectural layout of the Infirmary shown on the Plan, like the Novitiate, is a replica of that of the Monks' Cloister and roughly ¼ the latter's size. It has its own Dormitory, Warming Room, Refectory, Supply Room and Dwelling for the Master (magister) of the sick brothers; also its own Bathhouse and Kitchen. ingressus: Literally, ingress. On the Plan, used in the sense of vestibule (House for Distinguished Guests); and also as entrance (passage between Abbot's House and the northern transept arm of the Church, as well as southern entrance to the crypt). Also see introitus. INNER SCHOOL: See s.v. schola. insula: Tenement or apartment house, as distinct from a private house (domus). Also, in conventional modern usage, a city block. introitus: Entrance. On the Plan, used in the sense of vestibule (Outer School, II, 174) and in the sense of entrance (northern entrance arm to the corridor crypt). Also see exitus. J jugerum: In Roman measure, a tract of land 120 × 240 feet, comprising 28,800 sq. ft.; cf. ACRE, which came to have a statutory area but is not, of course, defined as a rectangular tract of specific dimensions. See page 140, fig. 540. B. L laborationes: Crops, produce (cf. Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 114 for examples). lamina (-ae): Wooden barrel stave, also called tabula. On the origin and cultural history of the barrel (tunna), see I, 295ff. langbekkir (ON): Long bench set up in the aisles or attached to the long walls of the Saga Period house. langpallar (ON): Floor of the aisles of a house of the Saga period (stofa) which in general were raised above the level of the center floor (golf) and covered with wooden planks. On these the long benches (langbekkir) and tables (bord) were set up, the followers or retainers of a chieftain took their places at mealtime. langvidir (ON): Longitudinal timbers. See asar. LANTERN: See testu and louver. lardarium: Larder. The storeroom, where lard and meat is kept. On the Plan this is a space 40 feet wide and 87½ feet long, located above the Monks' Cellar (cellarium) which occupies the ground floor of a double storied building on the west side of the cloister yard. Adalhard of Corbie gives a complete account of the contents in pork of such a larder &lt;VII&gt;, 118, and the aging of lard &lt;VII&gt;, 119. The meat from quadrupeds (forbidden to monks) was for the sustenance of the monastery's contingent of serfs (familia) and for its guests. See carnis. laterculus: In Classical Latin a small brick; in medieval Latin also used for shingle (see II, 29 n25). LATIN CROSS PLAN (crux capitata): The cruciform plan of a church whose longitudinal body intersects the transept; not very common in Early Christian times, but almost mandatory in the Middle Ages. It owes its rise to the spread of monasticism and the thence resulting need for more choir space for the worshipping monks. See FORECHOIR and PRESBYTERY. lavatorium: A room or house for washing the monks' clothes. On the Plan referred to as lauandi locus and combined with the bathhouse (see balneum). Adalhard speaks of the lavandaria fratrum &lt;II&gt;, 123. lavra: A cluster of cells or caves laid out for hermit monks, having in common a center containing a church and sometimes a refectory. LEAN-TO: A shed roof attached to the end of a roof with two inclined sides or annexed to the walls of a larger structure; cf. culatium. A wing or extension of a building having a lean-to roof, that is, a roof with only one slope that is built against a higher wall. lectio divina: In Early Christian and Medieval times the designation for liturgical readings from appropriate scriptures during mass (opus Dei, q.v.) and other religious celebrations (Adalhard &lt;Rubrics&gt;, 121): passages from the Gospels, Epistles, Old Testament or patristic texts including hagiography. In monastic life also the designation for the long daily periods of meditative reading prescribed for the spiritual well-being of the individual rather than the promotion of his intellectual powers, an activity for which four hours were reserved in the daily routine of the monks (I, 339ff and Adalhard &lt;Rubrics&gt; and whose proper maintenance was supervised by the circatores. For other integral activities of the daily life of the monks see opus Dei and opus manuum. Alone, the term lectio is also used in the sense of lesson or period of instruction, and in university life for an entire course of lectures. Lectio quando sanguine minuunt: Reading while the monks are being bled &lt;Adalhard, Rubric XXXIII&gt;, 121. lector: Reader. A monk appointed for the period of a week (hebdomadarius) to read from an elevated pulpit (analogium) the meditative reading assigned to the meal hours. He is supervised by the corrector who sits beside him on the pulpit and corrects him "gently" (leniter) should he make a mistake. lectisternium: In classical Latin, bed or couch, and in a special sense the draped couches set up in theaters and circuses to symbolize the presence of gods. By St. Benedict used as designation for the beds in the Monks' Dormitory. On the multivalence of medieval interpretations of this term see J. P. Migne's commentary to RB, 22, in Patr. Lat. LXVI, Paris, 1866, col. 491. lena: Coverlet. Prescribed as a mandatory item for the monk's bedding in RB, 55. See vestimentum. liber, homoliber: A free man who had the right to go wherever he wanted, and was not claimed by any master. See familia foris. libra: One pound, the amount of bread allotted to each monk per day by St. Benedict (RB, 39). In Roman times the equivalent of 326 grams, it was increased by Charlemagne to the equivalent of 406 grams; in the Synod at Aachen, held in 817, it was defined as corresponding to 20 solidi of a value equivalent to 12 denarii. Also see panis. licentia minuendi: Permission to be bled, which was only obtainable from the Abbot. lidus: A man who was dependent both on the lord and the land on which he lived. His social status is midway between that of the colonus and the servus. See familia foris. ligamentum (-a): Linen bandage with which to wrap the arms of a person whose blood is let. lignorum decima: The tithe on firewood (Adalhard &lt;VI, 4&gt;, 117), LINK: 1/100 of a CHAIN (q.v.) of 66 feet. See page 137, fig. 538. ljóri (ON): Light inlet, designation for the opening in the roof ridge of the Saga Period house, and the LOUVER or LANTERN surmounting it, which on the Plan is referred to as testu. Since this opening also served as smoke escape for the fire (eldr) that burned in the floor beneath it, it is also referred to as reykháfr or reykberi, smoke outlet. In its capacity of air inlet, it is referred to as vindgluggr and vindanga. See II, 23, and for a fuller discussion, II, 117ff. locus: Following the usage of Benedict (RB, 64), locus is often synonymous with monasterium, e.g., locus S. Galli, locus Corbiensis, and the cloister itself is locus internale. Also used for choir stalls; Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n16. locus foci: A hearth or open fireplace in the floor of the center room or common hall of the guest and service buildings of the Plan. Smoke escapes through an opening directly above it in the ridge of the roof; it is surrounded by a small protective superstructure, a LOUVER or LANTERN (q.v.), on the Plan called testu. The term appears only once on the Plan, in the center of the dining room of the House for Distinguished Guests. locutorium: A room in the monastery, where monks with permission from a higher official may during general periods of silence confer about business if their duties require. Also see auditorium and parlatorium. lokhvílu (ON): Lockable bed closet, a compartment for sleeping in the aisles of a sleeping house (skáli, or huiluskáli) of the Saga Period, separated from adjoining sleeping compartments by wooden walls, and capable of being locked; in general reserved for the owner of a farmstead and his wife. los-hus: The Dutch and Frisian equivalent to the LOWER SAXON FARMHOUSE. LOUVER: From Medieval Latin lovarium, Old French louvert, the lantern-surmounted opening in the roof of a medieval hall (II, 120ff); in the explanatory titles of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall referred to as testu. In the Liberate Rolls of King Henry III also referred to as fumerium. For actual examples, either in situ or known through illustrations (see figs 361-365). For other devices serving the same purpose see II, 121. n10. lovarium: See LOUVER and testu. LOWER SAXON FARMHOUSE (Wohnstallhaus): A modern derivative of the aisled Germanic all-purpose house sheltering man and animals under the same roof; even today in wide use in northwest Germany, in the provinces of Niedersachen and Westphalia. Also see Flet. lucerna: Lamp, oil lamp, mandatory in monastic privies and dormitories. Also a signal lamp in a watch tower (see I, 249 and 259). lucernarius: Caretaker of the lamps. See lucerna. M maenia: Tiers of seats in a Roman theater or amphitheater. magister: Master; head of a group of people performing a service or skilled in a craft; also in the sense of teacher, leader, supervisor; in the context of the Plan, either a monk or a layman. magister carpentarius: Master carpenter. magister gregum: Chief herdsman, head of keepers of livestock. Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 112ff, requires the chief herdsman and the porter to work together closely. magister infirmorum: Managerial, but not medical, supervisor of the infirmary (I, 313-14). In other sources referred to as custos infirmorum; on the Plan of St. Gall this official had a large, heated room in the north wing of the infirmary. magister lapideus: Master of stone masons. magister novitiorum (magister pulsantium): Master of the novices. On the Plan he is allotted a large heated room in the south wing of the Novitiate (see oblatus and pulsans). magister pauperum: Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. Also called hospitalarius, and procurator pauperum. See Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 n35. magister vitrici: Master of the glassmakers. magistri infantium: Masters of the children reared in the monastery, under constant supervision of seniors. magnas (-atis), magnatus: The great man of a designated territory, normally vasallus, owing personal obligation to a master, in contrast to the maior or villicus, who represents a group, normally workers in villae (see Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 108 n70). maior (-es): The head or foreman among a group of families forming a villa. Also called villicus. For his office in relation to monastic fields see Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 108. majuscule: A large letter, whether CAPITAL or UNCIAL. malleus: Hammer. málstofa (ON): Council hall. mandatum: The washing of feet. This old monastic custom was based on the example set by Christ, when before the Last Supper he washed the feet of his disciples, admonishing them to fulfill his "new mandate" (novum mandatum) by perpetuating this rite. The Plan informs us that the mandatum is performed in the Parlor, the only place within the cloister where the monks could legitimately meet with visitors from the secular world. The mandatum fratrum, i.e. the washing of feet of one brother by another was probably performed in the northern cloister wing. manica: A glove. The synod of 816 prescribes that each monk be issued two pairs of gloves, one for the summer (uuantus) and one for the winter (muffula). manipulus: Bundle, sheaf. Adalhard &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 115, treats the method of tithing as different from tithing hay or grain. mansio: House or dwelling. On the Plan used in the sense of living room: mansio abbatis, mansio scolae, mansio hortolani, mansio seruiti?. Also see mansus. Mansio dominicatus: See dominicatus mansiolum, mansionilis: A farm, an outlying homestead, either feudal or monastic. Mansioniles dominicatae: See dominicatus mansiuncula (-ae): Diminutive of mansio, a small dwelling. On the Plan used to designate the small bedrooms for students who were lodged in the Outer School and for the bedrooms of the craftsmen (aurifices) installed in the annex of the Great Collective Workshop. In the description of the monastery of Cluny in the so-called Consuetudines Farfenses the term is used for the individual stalls in which horses of visiting noblemen are stabled. mansus: Since the seventh century used to denote a small holding of land to supply the needs of one household; a homestead (Déléage, La vie rurale en Burgogne jus qu'au debut du XIe siècle, 1941, I, 253-360). While often synonymous with mansio, it tends to suggest the arable land rather than the dwelling proper. mansus bonuarium: A division of the manse, possibly, like the ACRE, an amount to be plowed by a yoke of oxen in one day (Musset, Mélanges L. Halphen, Paris, 1951, 535-41). In some medieval documents defined as 1/12 of a manse (Dufy, 1962, 29). The land assigned to the miller by Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 106, would consequently amount to 1 = ½ times the amount of other family units. man(u)operarius: A landholder contributing only manual labor for a substandard holding; also the holding itself (p. 96 n19). manutergiola: Towels for cleaning the hands. mappula: Handkerchief. See vestimentum. martyrium: A site which bears witness to the Christian faith, either by referring to an event in Christ's life or Passion, or by sheltering the grave of a martyr, a witness by virtue of having shed his blood; the structure erected over such a site. matio(-nes), machio: Mason. matricularius: Odd-jobber selected from among the poor and entered on the matricula or "poor list" of the monastery (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n12, 104 n24). matta: Mattress. Prescribed in RB, 55 as a mandatory item for the monks' bedding. mazo (Sp): An iron hammer; at the head of a trip hammer (see pila) such as might be used to crush ore. medicus (-i): In classical and medieval Latin: a physician—as a member of a monastic community not necessarily a monk. Adalhard &lt;I, 2&gt;, 103, classes medici as laymen. On the Plan the physicians are lodged in a special house (II, 178ff) that lies midway between the Monks' Infirmary (I, 313ff) and the House for Bloodletting (II, 184ff). The plants in the Medical Herb Garden are listed, II, 181. megaron: The principal hall of a Mycenaean palace and, later, of a Greek house. In modern usage applied to houses and temples having an open porch (pronaos or prodomos) flanked by two antae and often provided with columns. mensa: A table used for celebrating Mass; an altar table. Also, a refectory table and the "living" or "board" regularly served thereon. Hence by extension an endowment for the support of stipulated prelates or clergy (cf. 97ff). mercatus: Market, fair. For the goods and revenues of the market of Fos, near Marseilles, see 114 n107. MILE: Measure of distance introduced into the Western world by the Romans as the equivalent of 1,000 PACES (mille passus) or eight Roman stadia of 625 feet. See page 140, fig. 540.B. Like other land measures, the mile came to vary widely (cf. ACRE) before it was standardized. The old Roman mile equalled ca. 1,620 English yards, or 1,428 meters. The English and US statute mile is 1,760 yards (1,609.3 meters) or 5,280 feet. miles Christi: Christian soldier, or Christ's knight. Stemming from II Timothy ii:3ff. (cf. Eph. vi:10-18; I Thess. v:8). and the ancient parallel of physical and spiritual ascesis, miles and athleta Christi or Dei betokened a monk. miniator: A highly skilled scribe who embellishes manuscripts with pictorial images. From miniare = to touch up with red vermilion (minium). See rubricator. ministerialis (-es): Holder of a ministerium, Q.V. ministerium (-a): In medieval Latin the designation for an administrative department of a monastic or secular estate, and the responsibilities involved in its operation. Also referred to as officium. Abbo Wala (Bobbio, 834-836) listed the following ministerii quae infra monasterium aguatus: prepositus, decanus custos eclesiae, bibliothecarius, custos cartarum, cellararius, cellararius familia, iunior cellararius custos panis, portarius, hospitalarii religiosorum, hospitalarius pauperum, custos infirmorum, cantor, camerarius primus, camararius abbatis, iunior prepositus, magister carpentarius, custos vinearium, ortolanus, decanos iuniores, circatores lucernarios, . . . (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 421-22; cf. Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n3 and &lt;VII&gt;, 118 n130, where he calls the servatores "ministri"). MINUSCULE: A small letter, as opposed to a CAPITAL or UNCIAL; the small cursive script which was developed from the uncial during the 7th-9th centuries. minutia: Originally, particles of small consequence; hence entrails and sausages (Adalhard &lt;VII&gt;, 118 n28). minutio: Bloodletting; more specifically, minutio sanguis. Literally, weakened, diminished. See fleotomatus; licentia minuendi, and frater minuendus. See Adalhard, Rubric XXXIII, 121 "lectio quando sanguinem minuent." missa: Mass. Missa publica, see Adalhard, Rubric, V, 121. missus: Literally a messenger or courier. In medieval administrative parlance, used in the sense of royal or imperial envoy, or ambassador charged with a diplomatic mission, or as a commissioner sent by the King for a particular purpose (missus dominicus). On lower social ranks also applied to the representative or delegate of a count or a bishop. mita: A haystack or stack of sheaves protected by a conical roof of thatch which rested on poles and could be lowered and raised according to need. For other early and modern forms and its classical roots, see II, 15 and n17. mixtum: The first of three monastic meals, a mixture of bread and drink (RB, 38), in general not served before 2 p.m. For the monastic timetable in eating see I, 275. modius: A Roman capacity measure, divisible into 2 situlae, 16 sextarii, or 32 heminae. The classical Roman modius had a capacity equivalent to 8.49 liters. In the early years of Charlemagne it came to equal 34.8 liters. In 794 the emperor instituted a new modius equal to 52.2 liters. Before 822 Louis the Pious raised its capacity to 68 liters (I, 298). Adalhard &lt;I, 3&gt;, 104 and &lt;III&gt;, 106 n50 informs us that ten modii equal two baskets of grain and that each modius yields 30 loaves of bread. MODULE: A unit of measurement, lineal and/or volumetric, by means of which proportions or parts of a building are regulated; in the development of the Plan of St. Gall, the module of 2½ feet and its multiples provide a comprehensive aesthetic and practical organization. See SQUARE SCHEMATISM, and discussions in I, 87-95, 212-39. moeniáss (ON): See RIDGE PURLIN. mola (-e): Millstone. The monastic mill shown on the Plan was waterdriven. On the origin and diffusion of the water-powered mill, see II, 225ff and fig. 448 caption. molina, moinum: Mill. molinarius: Miller. See molitor. molitor: A grinder of grain, a miller from mola, millstone. On the grain supply at Corbie, see Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 102ff and notes; on the tithe of mills &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 113ff and notes. moltura, molitura: The yield of grain mill. servitium molinarii: Service owed by miller to abbot excluding moltura. molendinorum decima: Mill tithe. monachi seniores: Senior monks of wide experience and superior moral and intellectual stature. Benedict stated: "It is through men of this type that the orderly conduct of monastic life (ordo monachorum) is maintained." They have the power, should need arise, "to correct the deans, the provosts, and even the abbot" (Expositio Hildemari, I. 336). monachus: Monk, member of a community of men living under vows of religious observance; see MONASTICISM. monaco (It): Monk. In the architecture of Palladio, the term for a vertical post (KING POST) connecting the TIE BEAM at mid span with the apex of a TRUSS to prevent sag in the lower member. Also see paradosso. monasterium: A house for religious retirement, or for seclusion from the world for persons under religious vows; a monastery. While literally referring to solitary retirement (see HERMIT and ANCHORITE), the term soon became a synonym for large religious communities, where men banded together in communal forms of living and religious observance. MONASTICISM: An ascetic system of living alone, away from society. On its two earliest Christian forms, see ANCHORITE and COENOBITE. moneta: Mint; right of coinage. Widespread individual coinage by barons and prelates was forbidden by Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, but revived during and after the latter's reign. See denarius, solidus, and 97 n20, 99 n34; and Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 n45, &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 112 n99. MONK: See monachus. moratum (from monem, mulberry or blackberry): Probably wine diluted with mulberry juice rather than mulberry wine, prescribed by Adalhard &lt;I, 2&gt;, 104 for the most distinguished feasts. See Guérard, Irminon, Appendix 5, p. 305. MORTISE: A socket cut in a structural timber to receive a corresponding TENON cut at the end of another timber. The inserted piece is pinned to prevent the tenon from slipping out of the mortise. A mortise is usually of rectangular shape but its form varies with the angle of intrusion of the inserted member. muffula: A winter glove; muffula ueruicina, one of sheepskin. See vestimentum. Mus (MHG): A mixture of crushed barley and oats made into a kind of porridge, one of the chief items in the secular as well as monastic diet of Western Europe prior to the introduction of the potato. As a noun, often used to mean food; as a verb, to mean eating (abendmussen = to take one's supper). N NARTHEX: A narrow and usually colonnaded entrance hall built transversely against the facade of a church, often part of a colonnaded fore court (atrium, quadriporticus); in buildings of great importance it is often doubled, so as to form an inner and outer narthex (esonarthex, exonarthex). NAVE: In traditional Christian church architecture, the central hall of a church with walls rising above the roof of the aisles to form a fenestrated CLERESTORY. In timber architecture, a central hall flanked by aisles under a roof whose slopes descend in a straight or only slightly broken line from ridge to aisle walls. necessarium: Privy. On the Plan of St. Gall, a euphemism for privy, latrine, outhouse (exitus necessarius; also requisitum naturae). For a full discussion of the sanitary facilities of the Plan, see II, 300ff. nocturnales: Nightclothes. nomen purum: A monk's secular name (see Adalhard, Rubric XXXIX, 121 n143. nona: Payment for beneficium after decium has been paid (see above, 95 n19). NOVITIATE: In a monastery, the place where novices are reared and trained. Benedict (RB, 58) stipulated a separate facility for them. On the Plan of St. Gall, novices are defined as oblati and pulsantes, with a separate cloister modelled on that of the monks'. On conditions of admission, and training, see I, 337ff and Steidle, 1952, Excurs I, 280-81. At the second synod of Aachen all except oblates were forbidden access to the schola in monasterio. As a result the institution of the novitiate came to distinguish the Inner School from the Outer School, in which only secular priests and the sons of noblemen were trained (II, 168ff). novitius (from novus): One admitted to be trained as a monk. See pulsan, oblatus, and NOVITIATE. numeri sacri: Sacred numbers conceived as an expression of divine order pervading the created world, a judaeo-hellenic construct adopted and widely diffused by St. Augustine (Civitatis Dei; II, 30) and taught in every medieval monastic school in Europe. The concept plays a decisive role in the conceptual organization of the Plan of St. Gall (I, 118ff) and in medieval literary composition (see NUMERICAL COMPOSITION). NUMERICAL COMPOSITION: A principle according to which an abstract number symbolism is superimposed on a literary composition regardless of whether it fits the content (see numeri sacri). O obedientia: Obedience. See RB, 5, and Adalhard, Rubric XXXV, 121. oblatus (-i): A youth offered to the monastery by his parents and reared in the novitiate with pulsantes. Ofan (OHG): Wall fireplace or corner fireplace. officialis: Head of an administrative department of a monastic or secular estate; see ministerium. officina (-ae): Workshop. In medieval usage and in St. Benedict's time a word used generally to mean building, structure, or installation. The implications of its meaning are discussed I, 9-10, and 50-51. officium: See opus Dei; ministerium. öndvegi (ON): High seat. See hásæti. œdra öndvegi: "First seat of honor," reserved for the chieftain. uœdra öndvegi: "Second high seat," opposite the first, reserved for honored guests. opus Dei: The work of God, over which, according to Benedict (RB, 43) "nothing must take precedence." The liturgical sequence of one day consisted of four hours daily of divine service, common liturgical prayer, and chant performed by monks during the course of originally seven, later eight, services, consisting of: Nocturne (celebrated at 2 a.m.), Lauds (celebrated at dawn), Prime, Terce, Sext, None (at first, third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day), Vespers (at sunset), and Compline (at the onset of darkness). See I 339ff; opus manuum, and lectio divina. opus manuum: Work of the hands; in monastic life, manual labor of about four hours daily and generally restricted to tasks that could be performed within the claustral compound. It included cooking, baking, serving meals, housekeeping and personal tasks, and ordinarily excluded heavier forms of agricultural labor performed by serfs and laymen attached to the monastery; see familia, opus Dei, lectio divina. opus signinum: Concrete floor of mixed aggregate; also conventionally describes any Roman waterproof concrete made with crushed brick. oratorium: Oratory, a place for prayer. See Adalhard, Rubric LV, 121. ordo servandus: Order of rotation of monastic tasks (servitium, q.v.) of the brothers, determined primarily by seniority (see (Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 109ff); not applicable to the officiales and ministerii. Many such assignments were rotated weekly; see hebdomadarius. ospitalis pauperum: See ministerium, and Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 n35. ostiarius: Literally, doorkeeper or usher, an important household official at the royal court, responsible for receiving, feeding, and housing visitors. Cf. portarius. OTTONIAN ART: A period of German art flourishing during the reign of the Saxon emperors (919-1024) when Germany became politically and culturally the leading power of Europe. Under Otto I, II, and III it produced some of the finest schools of book illumination, and such monuments as the abbey churches of Gernrode (961-975) and Hildesheim (1010-1033); in them Carolingian modularity was carried from ground level into the elevation of structures by means of supports of rhythmically alternating strength and design. OUTER SCHOOL: See scola. P PACE: Distance traversed by one step; in the Middle Ages measured heel to heel (ca. 2½ feet) and in Roman measurement, the distance between successive stationary positions of the same foot (ca. 5 feet), a unit used in military life, which formed the basis of the Roman MILE (1000 paces = 5000 Roman feet). pagena, pagina: An unfixed extent of woodland held in common by a villa, or larger living unit; from pagus, the countryside, as opposed to town or city. See Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 113 n107. palanca (Sp): Beam of a triphammer; see pila. palatium: In Classical Latin an imperial residence; by extension the king's or emperor's court. In medieval Latin, also the residence of a feudal or ecclesiastical dignitary. panis: Bread. Benedict directed that each monk be issued one pound per day (RB, 39; panis libra una propensa). For the controversial term propensa, which we interpret to mean "weighed," see II, 257. On grain needed daily to supply needs, see Adalhard &lt;I, 2&gt;, 103 n18. paradisus: Enclosure, park; Garden of Eden (biblical) or earthly paradise, distinct from that of Heaven. On the Plan the terms PARADISIACUM (west apse) and PARADISI (east apse) are used for the open, park-like spaces enclosed by semicircular walls and porches attached to the church. paradosso (It): Principal rafter; part of a TRUSS; same as a Vitruvian cantharius. Parc (OHG): Enclosure or shed. For other old and modern variants see II, 29 n16. parochia: An ecclesiastical district, loosely of extent equal to a villa (see 94 n16). pastio: Pannage (pasturage of swine on acorns; Adalhard &lt;VII&gt;, 118ff). PASTOPHORY: A room in an Early Christian or Byzantine church serving as a DIACONICON or PROTHESIS, as a rule, flanking the apse of the church. pastor (-es): Herdsman in charge of monastic livestock and poultry. On the Plan their quarters are in those buildings housing the animals for which they care: horsegrooms (equos seruantes), oxherds (bubulci), cowherds (armentarii), caretakers or brood mares and foals (custodes equaritiae), swineherds (porcarii), shepherds (opilii), goatherds (pastores capellariam) and fowl-keepers (pullorum custodes, aucarum custodes). See II, 271ff and Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 115 n114. patellum: Skillet. pausatio: See repausatio. PECK: See modius. peculia: Cattle, but often in the wide sense of chattels, as especially assigned monastic property. See Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 112ff. PEDIMENT: Triangular gabled end of a ridged roof, comprising the tympanum and the raking cornice above it. pedules: Shoes. See vestimentum. PEG: A pin used in mortice and tenon joints for fastening: in medieval carpentry usually square cut. pellicia: Fur robe (. . . usque ad talos; reaching to the heels). See vestimentum. PENDENTIVE: Triangular segment of a sphere forming the transition between a cubic space and a hemisphere, the latter rising from a circle inscribed into the square of the cube. PERCH: Rod or POLE of defined length. In land measurement by standard, 5½ yards, but varying greatly locally, within a range of 10 (Roman decempeda) to 21 feet (perch of Ireland). For a rich quotation of sources, see DuCange s.v. pertica. PERISTYLE: Inner, colonnaded garden court of a Pompeian house. Also used by Vitruvius as equivalent of peristasis. Pfette (NHG): Purlin; structural member of the Pfettendach. Pfettendach (NHG): A roof frame consisting of heavy trusses equally spaced. In this construction the roof-skin weight is transmitted to the trusses through purlins that rest on the principal rafters, and to which the outer, or "common" rafters are pegged. Also see Sparrendach. Vitruvius recommends this roof type for broad spans (De Architectura, VII, 2, 1). It is the roof type of the Norse Saga-period house and was widely used in vernacular architecture in Medieval France (see s.v. TRUSS. Pfostenzange (NHG): In timber construction, a joint made by cogging the notched end of a large beam into a corresponding slot in the head of the posts that support the beam. pied royale de France: A linear measure established by the kings of France to standardize local land measures; the equivalent of 32.48 cm, internally divided into 12 pouces (see pollex) or 144 lignes. See FOOT, toise. pigmentum (-a): Spices. On the Plan used in the sense of medicines (armarium pigmenton) in the House of the Physicians. pila (-ae): Pestle used to crush grain. On the Plan, the pilae appear to be triphammers, the dimensions of which indicate that they were meant to be water driven. The quantities of grain needed to supply bread and beer for a monastic community attest the need for large-scale milling and crushing facilities. See arbol, banzao, palanca, and mazo. PILASTER: A rectangular strip of masonry engaged into a wall or a pillar from which it projects with its base and capital one-third to one-fourth, or other proportion, of its breadth. pilistrinum: A facility for crushing grain. See pila, pistrinum. piratium: Pear cider (see sicerator). pisale: In architecture, structures that do not rest exclusively on their own foundations, but are raised upon columns, pillars, arches, or vaults, e.g., in Roman architecture rooms or baths heated by hypocausts. On the Plan, this term exclusively describes rooms heated by means of subterranean firing chambers (caminus) and warm-air ducts in the floors. In MHG the term became Pisel, Phiesel, and Phiselgadem (a heatable room): adulterated, in French, it became poêle (stove). On silentiam in piselo, see Adalhard &lt;Fragments of Chapters&gt;, 123. piscarium: Fishpond. From the time of Cassiodorus's Vivarium, the fishpond was as conventional and useful an adjunct of a monastery as the garden, usually not within but at a short distance outside the monastic enceinte; therefore not shown on the Plan. pistillum: Pestle. See pila. pistrinum: Bakery, as used exclusively on the Plan, and never in the sense of mill, its original meaning, which derives from the fact that before the invention of millstones (mola), grain was crushed with mortar and pestle (see pila). pistores dominici: External bakers (Adalhard &lt;VI, 3&gt;, 117). PLATE: A general term for horizontal timbers laid upon walls (WALL PLATE) or roof-supporting posts (ROOF PLATE) to carry a superincumbent frame. Masonry walls may carry paired plates running parallel; cf. SOLE PIECE. ARCADE PLATE (ROOF PLATE): A framing timber set longitudinally upon, or into, the heads of freestanding, roof supporting inner posts of an aisled structure, usually below, more rarely above, the TIE BEAMS. See RAFTER, POST. The term "arcade plate" is currently used to substitute for "roof plate" in English architectural studies. It owes its origin to the bold two-way and three-way bracing struts rising from PRINCIPAL POSTS to their plates, a feature greatly favored by English builders and evoking a visual resemblance to arcades. In certain English manor and palace halls, builders imitated in timber the shapes of masonry arches and their moldings. See STRUT and figs. II, 340-346. pollex: Thumb; 1/12 of a FOOT; see INCH, UNCIA. polyptique (Fr): A record of listing; originally used to denote the folded or hinged tablets on which records were inscribed. During the late Roman Empire the term was used specifically to designate land survey records. In the early Middle Ages it came to mean inventories of land and property compiled by churches; cf. the Merovingian term descriptiones. The oldest, most nearly complete, most famous and most detailed such polyptique is that of the abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés and generally known as the Polyptique of Irminon, after the abbot who composed it. Because of the scrupulous care with which Irminon amassed the particulars of every domain belonging to his monastery, the document has attracted and held the attention of scholars for over a century. With the Capitulare de villis of Charlemagne, it has become the historian's principal source for the description of a great domain during the early Middle Ages (Latouche, 1961, 190). pomatium: Apple cider (see sicerator). porcaritia: A structure for housing and breeding swine. For the distribution of pork, divisio porcorum, see Adalhard &lt;VII&gt;, 118; includes porcorum decima, the tithe on swine. porcarius (-i): Swineherd. On the Plan, lodged in the house whose central hall is referred to as domus porcariorum. porta: A gate, door, hence, the point of reception of distinguished guests, itinerant clergy, and paupers, as well as the entire administrative organization (ministerium) in charge of reception and care of visitors. See portarius. portarius: Monastic official charged with providing food and shelter for visitors, for that purpose drawing on one tenth of the monastery's revenues (for tithing, see decimum). Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 112, says "that donation should suffice for all the needs of rich and poor of any kind." The portarius received guests, assigned them to appropriate quarters, and, at Corbie, supplied wood and cooking utensils for the paupers' quarters (Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 106 n46). As the only official besides the abbot and the provost with contact to the outside world, Benedict (RB, 66) deemed the porter should be "a wise old man, who understands giving and receiving a message, and whose years will keep him from leaving his place." The porter was assisted by the procurator pauperum who, on the Plan, has his own modest quarters (for the Porter's living quarters on the Plan, see II, 153ff). At Corbie he had a staff of ten prebends (provendarius) and two laymen. The porter also supervised carts that transported tithes from distant estates (Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 113, and 114 n107). The porter's secular counterpart is the ostiarius. porticus: In Classical Latin, a colonnaded porch or gallery giving access to some other, usually larger, structure. On the Plan, used in this sense for the two sunlit porches of the Abbot's House, and for the porches in the Monks' Cloister. But in the Church the term is used to mean aisle (latitudo utriasque porticus pedum XX.) Adalhard, Rubric XLIX, 122, uses it in the sense of narthex. porticus villa: A large Roman residence with one or more internal courts, and one or more elaborate galleried porches connecting various parts of the building (I, 317ff). POST: An upright timber. In the buildings with which this study is primarily concerned, one of a series of uprights placed at intervals along parallel axes and framed into a roof-supporting system by means of PLATES and TIE BEAMS. Also, an upright timber forming part of the internal structure of a TRUSS. WALL POST: A post that is a structural component of a wall frame, usually rising from SILL to PLATE. PRINCIPAL or MAIN POST: One of a free-standing inner row of posts. CROWN POST: An upright timber rising from the center of a tie beam to a COLLAR (or CENTER) PURLIN, frequently giving issue to two- or four-way angle struts that minimize sagging of purlin and collar. QUEEN POST: One of two upright timbers, in a roof truss, rising from a tie beam at points equidistant from its center, and tenoned at their heads into the extremities of a collar beam or the undersurface of a PRINCIPAL RAFTER at the level where the latter carries the purlin. KING POST: A vertical timber of a roof truss suspended in the heads of two PRINCIPAL RAFTERS—not a true post under compression, but a tie acting in tension. When peg-tenoned into the body of the TIE BEAM or slotted through it, it prevents the latter from sagging. With the aid of BRACING STRUTS (see BRACE) emerging from its flanks it props the PRINCIPAL RAFTERS mid-span and prevents them from sagging. To perform this function the king post does not have to be connected to the tie beam. Cf. trave pendente, transtrum, cantherius, capriolus. HAMMER POST: A stout upright rising from the projecting end of a HAMMER BEAM and tenoned at its head into the principal rafter. potio: Drink. See I, 304ff for monastic beer and wine production; I, 296ff for allowances of drink to monks; Adalhard &lt;I, 2&gt;, 104, for definition of the drink allowance (RB, 40, de mensura potiis) for the festal calendar. potionarius: On the Plan, used for a person who is being purged or given medical potions for other purposes. praebendarius: Same as provendarius. praecentor: Assistant of the cantor. Hildemar of Corbie defines him as a monk who "opens the song" (vocem praemittit in cantu). praepositus: Provost or prior. Monastic official highest in rank after the abbot and in his absence acting head of the monastic community. He is in charge of all the monastery's temporal activities and is responsible for the management of its outlying estates. For a fuller discussion see I, 331ff; at Corbie, praepositus and prior apparently were separate offices (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n9 and 99 n32). prandium: In monastic life, the evening meal during periods when only two meals are served in the course of a day. On the Plan, used as a general term for "meal" in the House for Distinguished Guests: domus hospit? ad prandendum. pratellum: In medieval Latin, the monastic garden around which the claustral structures are ranged. PRESBYTER: Literally, elder; in the Early Christian church, a cleric exercising administrative and priestly functions; also a parish priest. PRESBYTERY: Chancel: the area around the high altar where clergy or monks assemble daily to celebrate divine services, including choir, sanctuary, and bema. In the Church of the Plan, the presbytery is located in a large square space between apse and transept, with two rows of benches along its walls continuing in the apse. The insertion of such units, often referred to as fore choirs, became mandatory in Carolingian monastic architecture, in order to accommodate both monks and celebrants around the altar. pretium: Purchase price, money payment (Adalhard, &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 114; &lt;VI, 5&gt;, 117). See denarius, moneta, solidus. PRINCIPAL POST: See POST. PRINCIPAL RAFTER: See RAFTER. PRIOR: See praepositus. procurator pauperum: Almoner. At Corbie, the hospitalarius (Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 nn38, 45). A monastic official in charge of receiving visitors of modest social rank, in this capacity he would have managed the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (magister pauperum). He is subordinate to the Porter (portarius). promptuarium: Literally, a place of readiness. A space for storage, mainly of food supplies. On the Plan used in the sense of larder. proprium: Personal possessions forbidden to monks (on poverty see RB, 33; also see Adalhard, Rubric XLI, 122 n144). PROTHESIS: Room attached to, or in the church, for preparation of the Eucharist before mass, and usually for its storage afterwards. Cf. DIACONICON and PASTOPHORY. provendarius: A claustral serf who receives daily subsistence from the monastery in return for service. Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103, and &lt;I, 3&gt;, 104 n24 uses provendarius and vassalus interchangeably. Also see 97, and I, 341. PROVOST: See praepositus. psalmi cantandi: Chanting of psalms in unison prescribed for brothers in the coquina fratrum (Adalhard &lt;V&gt; 110 n92). puer (-i): In monastic parlance, a boy between the ages of seven and fourteen. Cf. infans and adolescens. pulletrus (pullus): Foal or any young animal; cf. "pullet," and see Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 114. pulmentum (pulmentarium): In Classical Latin, anything eaten with bread, a relish. Hildemar of Corbie commenting in 845 on the use of this term in RB, 2, notes that St. Benedict used it exclusively for cooked dishes of vegetables, cheese, eggs, and flour, in variance with Biblical tradition, where pulmentum includes dishes of venison. pulsans (-tes): Literally, "those who knock," a term for those requesting admittance into monastic life; novices on probation, housed and reared in the Novitiate with the oblaties. Also see Adalhard &lt;I, 4&gt;, 105, and 104 n24. PURLIN: A horizontal timber secured longitudinally to the principal trusses of a roof. SIDE PURLINS: Located part way up the roof slope, they help support the common rafters. BUTT PURLINS: These are tenoned into the sides of the PRINCIPAL RAFTERS or truss blades. THROUGH PURLINS: These are carried on the backs of the principal trusses and run without interruption the length of the structure. RIDGE PURLIN (RIDGE PIECE): Longitudinal member at the roof apex into which the rafter heads are fastened. See SADDLE. COLLAR PURLIN (CENTER PURLIN): Longitudinal timber sustained by a series of CROWN POSTS that rise from the mid point of TIE BEAMS, and serving to stabilize both crown posts and the COLLAR BEAMS to which it is fastened. PUTLOG HOLES: Small square holes left in walls by cross pieces of scaffolding used in constructing the wall. By Vitruvius called columbaria, from their resemblance to pigeon holes. pyrale: Warming room. The term is used by Ekkehart IV for the monks' warming room in the Abbey of St. Gall. But on the Plan itself the term does not occur; this facility is there called calefactoria domus and pisale. Q quadriporticus: Enclosed courtyard with porticos on all four sides. See porticus and claustrum. QUINCUNX: A nine-bay structure, the center bay a large square, the corner bays small squares, the remaining four bays rectangular. The center bay, framed by arches, is usually domed, the corner bays are either domed or groin-vaulted, the rectangular bays are usually barrel-vaulted; also referred to as cross-in-square. (See J. K. Conant, A Brief Commentary on Early Medieval Church Architecture, Baltimore, 1942, 15, for "quincunx.") QUOIN: The external angle of a building or of a protruding portion of its masonry such as a porch or buttress; specifically, the ashlar stones with which the corners are built, as distinguished from rubble construction of the straight portions of a wall. R ráf, or ræfr (ON): Roof. RAFTER: Inclined timbers forming the sides of a roof on which laths are fastened to carry the roof skin. COMMON RAFTERS: Inclined timbers of relatively light SCANTLING, usually springing at one- to two-foot intervals from the WALL or ROOF PLATE. LOWER COMMON RAFTERS: Aisle rafters, which spring from the WALL PLATE and butt or lean against the outer side of the ARCADE PLATE. UPPER COMMON RAFTERS: In an aisled structure they spring from the ROOF PLATE and rise to the RIDGE PIECE. If the structure has no ridge piece, these rafters may be beveled and pinned at their heads. Rafter pairs may be connected by one or more COLLAR BEAMS: see TRUSS. PRINCIPAL RAFTERS: Inclined timbers of heavy scantling forming an integral part of the principal trusses. They are placed at longer intervals than common rafters, which are needed to bridge these intervals. See TRUSS. Rafter pairs may be connected horizontally by COLLAR BEAMS about halfway up their length. Various post and beam constructions are used to stiffen and stabilize rafters; see s.v. POST, PURLIN, TIE BEAM, TRUSS. refectorium: Refectory; monastic eating hall developing from the rise of coenobitic monasticism. The Refectory of the Plan is discussed, I, 267ff. For the management of the refectorium or coquina fratrum see Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 109ff and notes; for discussion of table manners see Rubric XXVIII, 121n 138. regnum et sacerdotium: A phrase alluding to either the separation or alliance of Church and State. On the Frankish alliance with the papal court see I, 187 and II, 155. On the effects of this concept on monastic planning, see Westwerk. regula: A collective term for rules governing monastic liturgy and life; the title used for the body of directives issued to regulate the practice of monachism (Regula Benedicti, Regula Columbani, etc.) A great reform movement in Charlemagne's reign resulted in the replacement of earlier, varied monastic customs (regula mixta) with a single, universally binding rule (Regula Benedicti abbatis Anianensis sive Collectio capitularis [A.D. 817], ed. Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 515-36). This new order for monastic life issued from two synods held in Aachen in 816 and 817; the Plan of St. Gall emerged as a product of these synods. rekkja (ON): Bed closet. See sengefeller. religiosus: Literally, one devoted to a religious life, specifically an ascetic. In monastic Latin it stands for clerics, as distinguished from laymen attached to the monastery. See familia. requisitum naturae: Literally, that which is requisite to nature. On the Plan, a euphemism for privy or outhouse. See necessarium. rere-dorter (Fr): Privy situated at the back of a monastic dormitory. Like garde robe (used for the same or similar purposes) a prudish post-medieval term. For its medieval equivalents see exitus. responsium: Responsory. Musical form of chanted psalms fixed in positions in the officium (see opus Dei: horae). retiarius or retiator: Netmaker. retis abcisiones: Swab of wire netting used to clean pots. reykberi (ON): Smoke outlet. See ljori. reykháfr (ON): Smoke outlet. See ljori. RIDGE: See s.v. PURLIN. roccus: Frock or fur garment. See vestimentum. ROD: In land measurement, originally a stick or pole of defined length; standardized in many places to equal 5½ yards (16½ feet). See PERCH. Rofe (NHG): Sapling, pole. See Rofendach. Rofendach (NHG): A roof formed by saplings fastened heavy end up, to the ridge pole by means of a natural hook formed from the stub of a lopped branch. ROOF PLATE: See s.v. PLATE. rota: A turning wheel, used by blacksmiths. RUBBLE (ROUGH WALLING): Coarse walling of rough stones taken as they come from the quarry, not large but of great irregularity in size and shape, and including wastes from freestones. rubricator: In manuscript illumination, an artisan or scribe specializing in decorative letters rendered in a color (such as red) different from the text; usually a letter of an opening word of a verse or paragraph. See miniator. S sabina (Juniperus sabina L.): Savin plant or tree; a low spreading evergreen shrub located in the center of the Monks' Cloister. Known from Antiquity for its medicinal and other attributes, which range from causing the onset of menses in women to spicing wine, the plant's full iconographic significance on the plan is not clear. There may be symbolic content in the fact that juniper wood is aromatic, and very hot and long-burning. The Capitulare de villis states that juniper is obligatory for the gardens of a Carolingian crown estate. See I, 246ff for a discussion, in the context of the Cloister. sacerdotium: See regnum et sacerdotium. SADDLE: A short length of timber immediately below the juncture of two converging rafters or blades, usually seating for a ridge piece (see s.v. PURLIN). sængarklædi (ON): Hangings, i.e., rugs or curtains suspended from cross beams to divide aisles of a sleeping hall (skáli) into compartments accommodating two bedfellows (sengefeller). sagum: Blanket, also used to mean the fabric serge, by Adalhard &lt;I, 3&gt;, 105. See vestimentum. sala: House or hall in medieval Latin; a large aisled building without a second story. Most of the guest and service buildings on the Plan are variants of this type, here referred to as the Germanic all-purpose house; but the term sala is not itself used on the Plan. sanguinator: Professional bleeder. See fleothomus, fleotomatus. saponarius: Soapmaker. sartor: Tailor. See vestiarium. scalprum: Vine-dresser's knife. scamnum: On the Plan, used to mean bench, in the Refectory also see sedile. SCANTLING: The dimensions of timber in width and thickness, but not length; also, any piece of timber under 5 inches square; as a verb, finishing or milling timber to specified width and thickness. sclusa: Millrace. scola, schola: From a Greek word meaning leisure for the purpose of learning. In secular classical life, it was used to mean an association of men gathered for a variety of purposes. In commercial or industrial life, it meant a guild. In military parlance of classical and medieval times; an imperial or royal guard, or on a lower social order, a body of armed retainers. In ecclesiastical parlance: a bishop's retinue, the body of priests attached to a cathedral. In educational life, the meaning returned to its original sense, i.e., a body of men gathered for purposes of learning. In this sense the word was used in many Carolingian sources (II, 168ff) as well as on the Plan of St. Gall, where the term appears in two places: In a title describing the purpose of the large center room of the Outer School, (II, 168); there it is used in its original sense; and again, but with surprising looseness, in the title for the Schoolmaster's Lodging (II, 175). The term "mansio scolae" cannot refer to students of the Outer School, who lived in the school itself, but rather to the Master of the Outer School and, judging from the number of beds in the Schoolmaster's Lodging, two teachers who appeared to have shared his quarters. scola interior, and scola exterior: Inner, and Outer schools. In the former future monks were trained: the latter provided instruction for those intended for a career as secular clergy, as well as for such laymen, poor, or noble, whose education was entrusted to monastic teachers. On the stress leading to this division of the monastic educational system, see I, 23-24 and II, 168ff. Scof (OHG): Weather roof. scopa: Brush or brushes for scrubbing cauldrons (see caldarium). Scopar (OHG): Haystack, or sheaves piled in open fields. scorum: Possibly shears. scrinium: Small storage chest. scriptor: Scribe, less well trained than the antiquarius. scriptorium, scriptrum: Writing room; script. See CAROLINGIAN MINUSCULE and 95 notes 5, 8, 9. scuria: Grange or barn; a Latinization of an OHG word. scutarius (-i): Shieldmaker. On the Plan, housed in the Great Collective Workshop (II, 195; Adalhard &lt;I, 3&gt;, 105). scutella: Plate, tableware. secretarium: Sacristy (see Adalhard, Rubrics III, VI, 121). secretum: On the Plan, the withdrawing room or inner study of the Master of the Outer School. SEDECIMAL SYSTEM: A system of computation based on the number 16 and its subdivisions; for its application in Carolingian architecture, see I, 87ff. sedile (sedilium): Bench. On the Plan, benches in the Refectory, and seats in the Monks' Privy are referred to by this term; in Vulgar Latin, bancus. sellarius (-i): Saddler. On the Plan, these workers are quartered in the annex to the Great Collective Workshop. senescalcus: Literally, old servant. Official in charge of provisions, and especially for the royal table (Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103 n3). sengefeller (ON): Bedfellow; in Saga Period houses, a bunk-mate in the sleeping compartments partitioned in the aisles (set) of the sleeping hall (skáli). See also sængarklædi and rekkja; when partitions for beds were locked, they were referred to as lokhuila (II, 23-24). seruitium: In medieval life, a service performed for someone of higher rank by a person of lower standing. In this general sense, it may apply to the obligations of a serf to his master, to services a vassal is held to render to his overlord, or to services rendered the king by both secular and ecclesiastical officials, such as obligatory attendance at court, or rendering military service (seruitium ad hostem). Cf. decimum. The term is also used to mean the discharge of a public official's duty and also the entire body of public offices in the empire, as well as ecclesiastical and monastic institutions. Finally, it is also used for service rendered to God by worship, as well as for the office of divine ministry (cf. Niermeyer, s.v.). On the Plan, the term occurs only once, in a title explaining the function of the House for Servants of Outlying Estates and Servants Traveling with the Emperor's Court (dom familiae quae cum seruitio aduenerit), referring to service performed by serfs to the monastery itself, and to servants of the emperor. seruitium ad hostem: Service rendered by landholders, both secular and ecclesiastical, in defense of the country in the form of a levée of military goods, services, and men—a feudal institution which explains the presence in the Great Collective Workshop of the Plan, of the shield-makers (scutarii) and trenchermakers and weapons furbishers; see I, 347ff. Other feudal and mandatory services were obtained from tenants under the system of corvée, e.g., road maintenance and other arduous manual labor. This institution, thoroughly detested because of the tyranny with which it came to be imposed and the hardship it caused farmers by taking time needed for making crops, lasted from Charlemagne's time until it was overthrown in the revolution of 1792. seruitium molinarii: Service to which a miller is held (see Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 106ff). servans (-tes): Serf, servant. On the Plan, horse grooms and cowherds are designated thus. servus: Serf. i.e., a man with no freedom whatsoever, who could be sold, given away, or traded with the land on which he lived; see verna. set (ON): Aisles of the sleeping house of the Saga Period. They were covered with straw bedding and could be made into compartments; see sængarklædi; sengefeller. sextarius (sestarius): A Roman capacity measure, a sixth part. For the Carolingian sester see hemina, modius. sicerator (-es): A brewer of alcoholic drinks, a broader term than brasator since sicara according to Isidore of Seville (orig. 20, 3): ". . . est omnis potio, quae extra vinum, inebriare potest." The Capitulare de villis distinguishes between three types of siceratores: Those who make beer (cervisa); apple cider (pomatium), and pear cider (piratum). signum (-a): General term for a bell, suspended or hand held, announcing liturgical hours of the day, or crucial phases in the liturgy. silentium: The observance and rule of silence within the cloister (RB, 6), including the kitchen, though Benedict of Aniane (Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 110 n92) approved of chanting psalms in unison during work. For discussion of the topic in chapter, see Adalhard, Rubrics III and XII (121); in the kitchen "either keep quiet if the matters be not essential, or say what is necessary, or else chant psalms" &lt;V&gt;, 11of; Rubric XXXIV, 121; cf. 120 n139. Silentium in refectorio, and In dormitorio atque piselo: see Adalhard (Fragments of Chapters&gt;, 123, and 122 n145. situla: Bucket; a Roman capacity measure, half of a modius. skáli (ON): Sleeping hall; when reserved for men, called karlskáli, for women, kvennaskáli. Also see forskáli. skjagluggr (ON): In Saga Period houses, a translucent screen made from the stomach lining of hogs and mounted on moveable frames attached to a louver (ljori) that served as smoke escape and air inlet (vindgluggr); also called skajvindanga, skjarinn. See spjæld and fjöl. Slehendrac (MHG): An alcoholic beverage made of sloes. solarium: Sun dial, in Classical Latin; by extension, the open area in which it was located. The word came to be applied to the sun-exposed roofs or decks in front of or on upper levels of Roman houses, usually supported by colonnades or arcades. In medieval architecture, the solarium was the upper story of a two-level structure sufficiently fenestrated to admit the sun. The Abbot's House on the Plan is the earliest visual record of a medieval hall with solarium, but other literary sources attest its existence in feudal residences as early as A.D. 584 and 766. In the description of Cluny, in the Consuetudines Farfenses, the term is used for the upper, presumably fenestrated story of a large building 25 × 280 feet, where servants of visiting noblemen slept and ate, the ground floor of which provided stabling. For solarium used as a synonym for scriptorium, doubtless because the scribes needed ample light to work, see Adalhard, Rubric L, p. 121. SOLEA: In an Early Christian or Byzantine church, a raised pathway projecting from bema to ambo. SOLE PIECE: A short horizontal member lying across the plates of a masonry wall, forming the base of a small triangular truss that sustains the foot of a COMMON RAFTER or a truss blade. The sole piece is locked into the wall plates to prevent their slipping apart. The inner end of the sole piece is usually surmounted by a short ashlar piece rising to the inner surface of the rafter. Sole pieces assembled into small triangular trusses are also found above the ROOF PLATES to serve as footing for the upper rafters, in a masonry structure with a clerestory. Cf. HAMMER BEAM. solidus: 30 soldi = 12 denarii, according to the Synod of 817; also see Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 108f. Spanga (OHG): Clamp, identical with NHG Spange in the description of the Bajuvarian standard house and used as to mean WALL PLATE. Sparre (NHG): One of two converging timbers in a roof supported by a continuous sequence of coupled rafters: see Sparrendach. Sparrendach (NHG): Roof made of a continuous sequence of coupled rafters, common in Anglo Saxon England, and during the Middle Ages and today in Lower Saxony. Fundamentally different from the Pfettendach, the roof type is represented in the vernacular architecture of medieval and modern France; See II, 109ff; cf. Pfettendach. Spelta: "German wheat," a grain resembling both wheat and barley; see Adalhard &lt;III&gt;, 106f. spicarium: Granary, and, in a broader sense, a manorial grain collecting center. spjaeld (ON): Wooden shutters attached to the louvers (ljori) serving as smoke escapes and air inlets in Saga Period houses. They were opened by means of poles or ropes. SPLAYED WINDOW: A window set into a thick wall; its inner aperture larger than its outer one to permit the dispersal of light to the interior, but prohibiting entry by intruders from the outside. Sporadically used in Roman architecture, in the sixth century, they were apparently common enough to attract the attention of Gregory the Great. SPROCKET: A short, wedge-shaped member extending from the foot of a rafter to form the projecting eaves. It is pegged to the top side of the rafter and is necessarily of slightly shallower pitch. SQUARESCHEMATISM: A sophisticated concept of spatial organization in architecture, based on the use of MODULES, and one of the most significant innovations of the Age of Charlemagne, as well as being of fundamental importance for everything that followed. For a full discussion, see I, 212-39. Square schematism appears to have two primary historical roots, one in the vernacular architecture of the Germanic tribes, the other in the constructional layout of illuminated pages in Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts (I, 227-38). système des barlongs: A system of oblong bays in the division of component spaces in Gothic cathedrals, a Gothic elaboration of square schematism of Romanesque architecture which has its roots in Carolingian architecture. système des carrés: In Romanesque architecture, means square schematism. SQUINCH: A general term for a variety of architectural forms (corbelled arches, corbelled or half-domed niches, semiconical vaults) allowing a space of square plan to be surmounted by a polygonal or circular drum or a polygonal space or drum to be surmounted by a circular dome—an architectural feature almost simultaneously developed by Roman builders in the late Imperial period and the Sassanians of Persia. stabulum: Building with stalls for domestic animals. The officer in charge was a stabularius (&gt;constable). See Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103. stadium: A Roman measure of length equal to 125 paces or 625 feet; eight Roman stadia form a MILE. See PACE. Staflaegjur (ON): WALL PLATE. ST. ANDREW'S CROSS: Two short pieces of timber, half-lapped at their centers to form an X; in medieval roofs used to stiffen the SUB RIDGE in relation to the RIDGE PIECE. stofa (ON): Saga Period house used for daily living, distinct from other houses or halls used for sleeping or drinking (see s.v. skáli, forstofa. stokk (ON): A beam or board forming the edge of the slightly raised floor of the aisles of a Saga Period house. stuba: Bathhouse, by extension a heated or heatable space; related etymologically to ON stofa. SUB RIDGE: A subsidiary ridge pole running parallel to and some 6-9 feet below the main ridge piece usually connected to it by ST. ANDREW'S CROSSES. Unlike the main ridge piece, which rests atop king posts and usually carries the length of more than one bay, sub ridge pieces are butted into the sides of the KING POSTS in the longitudinal axis of the structure. See s.v. PURLIN. subtalares: Slippers. The synod of 816 prescribes that each monk be issued "two night slippers for summer" (subtalares per noctem in aestate) and "two night slippers for winter" (subtalares in hieme uero soccos); see vestimentum. succentor: Assistant of the cantor. Hildemar of Corbie defines him as a monk who responds in the song (canendo respondet) to the opening chant of the praecentor. súlur (ON): Upright, or roof-supporting posts of the Saga Period house; also called stafir, stodir, and stolpar. innstafir innstolpar: Inner or principal posts. útstafir: Outer, or wall posts. summus capellanus: The emperor's primary advisor in ecclesiastical and educational matters and as such, the titular head of the palace school. His office later was absorbed in that of the chancellor (summus sacri palatii cancellarius); see capellanus and arcicapellanus. sutor (-es): Shoemaker. On the Plan, quartered in the Great Collective Workshop. See Adalhard &lt;I, 1&gt;, 103. syllr (ON): Mud sills. SYNOD: An ecclesiastical assembly and an age-old institution of the Christian church, devised to further unity of faith, uniformity of practice, and conformity in administration and implementation of monastic customs (see s.v. consuetudines, regula, unitas). The Plan of St. Gall was the intellectual product of two such synods held in Aachen in 816 and 817. Like all other legislation emerging from them, the Plan was an attempt to demonstrate, in the form of a universally binding example, of what buildings a paradigmatic Carolingian monastery should be comprised and how they might relate to each other. synthronon: In East Christian and Byzantine churches the bench or benches reserved for the clergy; arranged either in a semicircle (sometimes amphitheatrically) in the apse or in straight rows on either side of the bema. T tabula (-ae): Table, tablet. A word of many meanings, it basically refers to objects rectangular in shape, and includes the stave of a wooden barrel (see lamina, tabulatum, cf. vestimentum). tabulatum: Flooring. Like tabula, it also refers generally to rectangular objects or areas, and thus to flooring and to the various stories of buildings. On the Plan it refers to the wooden platform above head level in the House for Horses, Oxen and their Keepers, which served as hay loft. taratrum: Auger. Used for drilling pin holes in timbers, and also in cutting mortices. See Adalhard &lt;V&gt;, 109 n77. tegula: Ceramic tile. Unless qualified, the common term for roof tile; but tegula lignea = shingle or shake; tegula plumbea = lead tile. tepidarium (-a): Warm room of a Roman bath. testu: Literally, skull or lid. By early scholars of the Plan it was consistently misread as testudo (= tortoise, turtle shell, and by extension, roof or vault). In early studies of the Plan it was translated incorrectly as courtyard house or garden hut. In reality it proves to be the term for lantern or louver, a protective superstructure atop a roof opening over a fireplace, which serves to admit light and vent smoke. The lantern is one of the primary typological characteristics of the guest and service buildings of the Plan, and a prime criterion in their identification as a variant of the aisled Germanic all-purpose house. See II, 117ff for a complete discussion. testudinatum: See cava aedium. TIE BEAM: See BEAM. tignum: Wooden beam. tina: Wooden bathtub large enough for one person; see cupa. tintinabulum: A signal, such as is made by striking a gong or triangle, to announce liturgical hours or events; see signum. TITHE: See decimum, decimatio, decimator; cf. seruitium. toise: A French lineal measure of six feet, roughly equal to 1.949 meters of 6 2/5 English feet. See FATHOM, hexapedon. toregma (-mata): On the Plan, used to mean a cupboard for storing tableware; a Latinization of the Greek (see I, 129ff). torfi (ON): Turf. tornarius (-ii): On the Plan, presumed to mean wheelwright; see tornator. tornator (-es): Turner; a wood lathe craftsman. On the Plan the tornatores are installed in the main part of the Great Collective Workshop in a relatively small space, whereas the tornarii in the House for Coopers and Wheelwrights have a large work area. By this allocation one may assume that the tornatores made small utensils and hand tools, while the designation tornarii could be assumed to mean wheelwright. trabes: In Classical and medieval Latin the designation for horizontal long and cross beams, such as TIE BEAMS and PLATES. tractoria: Epistle, patent or writ (see brevis), normally used for excusing or imposing requisitions of goods or labor (see Adalhard &lt;VI, 2&gt;, 113 n107). TRANSEPT: Transverse unit of space inserted between nave and apse or nave and FORE CHOIR CONTINUOUS TRANSEPT: One that is internally undivided. HIGH TRANSEPT: With height equal to that of the nave. LOW TRANSEPT: With cross arms of lesser height than the nave. TRIPARTITE TRANSEPT: One consisting of a center bay continuing the nave, combined with wings as high, or lower than, the nave, but always separated from the center bay by colonnades (with low wings, the term "dwarf transept" is used). TRICONCH TRANSEPT: One with wings terminating in apses; see CONCH. transtrum: TIE BEAM. See corda. triclinium (-a): Originally dining room, so called because of the conventional arrangement of three banqueting couches (Klinai) around three sides of a square. In later Roman usage, it was the principal reception room or rooms of a house. trigonus (-i): Jib crane. TRIPHAMMER: See pila. truncus (-i): Possibly handles for axes or scythes; possibly cutters (from truncare). See Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 109 n79. TRUSS: A construction of principal timbers that spans a building transversely and supports its roof by means of PURLINS, which also link trusses and help maintain them in the vertical plane. Truss timbers are designed to support each other, and framed internally to prevent their being warped by the roof load. See s.v. BEAM, POST, STRUT. Trusses are placed at regular intervals and divide the building lengthwise into bays. PRINCIPAL RAFTER TRUSS: One whose inclined members serve as principal rafters lying in the same plane as the roof. See RAFTER. RAKING BEAM TRUSS: One whose inclined members run parallel to, but below, the plane of the roof. TRUSSED ROOF: A roof whose load is supported by principal trusses, distinguished from one supported by a continuous sequence of rafters (see COMMON RAFTERS s.v. RAFTER: also see Pfettendach). tuninum: In medieval Latin, a fence or a fence-enclosed space. tunna: The Romans used this word to mean wooden barrel. On the Plan it indicates the barrels used to store wine and beer. On the Celtic origin of the staved barrel and its implications for wine making and transporting, see I, 293ff. tunnarius: Cooper. On the Plan, housed in the immediate vicinity of the Cellar. tuscanicum (tuscanum): See cava aedium. þili (ON): Wainscoating, in Saga Period houses. veggþili: Wainscoating against the long walls of the house. þuerþili: Wooden room partition separating an entrance bay from the main hall space. þverþallr (ON): Innermost floor or bay of the Saga Period house, where the women were seated. U uncia: See INCH. For other duodecimal gradations of the Roman foot, see s.v. FOOT, and I, 83ff. uncial: See uncia. In palaeography, letters or writing having the large rounded forms of early Greek and Latin manuscripts. unitas: Concept of spiritual and administrative unity of Church and State (regnum et sacerdotum) and within the Church of uniformity of rule (regula) and custom (consuetudo). uuantus (Vulgar Latin): A glove that is worn in the summer (manicas quas uulgo uuantos appellamus in aestate). In the synod of 816 listed as one of the mandatory items of clothing to be issued to each monk. Also see muffula; cf. vestimentum. V vacarritia: Dairy in medieval Latin; on the Plan, includes cattle breeding as well. vacatio: Time vacated, or released, from other obligations for the purpose of learning; in this sense used on the Plan in the Outer School. See scola. vagl, vaglbiti (ON): TIE BEAMS. vannus: Winnowing fan; see Adalhard &lt;IV&gt;, 109 n81. veggir (ON): Walls, in a Saga-Period house; referred to as langveggir, long walls, or gaflveggir, gable walls. veizluskáli (ON): Banquet hall. See stofa. Verblattung (NHG): Lap joint. Verkammung (NHG): Half-lap joint. verna, uerna: Slave, person of low social standing. On the Plan, used for lay helpers in the Monks' Bake and Brew House; possibly the designation for a lay brother. versus: Short chanted verse occupying fixed positions in the opus Dei, q.v. See p. 121 for Adalhard, Rubric IX; for versus cantandi outside the Office, Rubric XXIX, 121 n139, and Rubric XLVIII, 122 n149. Verzapfung (NHG): Mortise and tenon joint (II, 116). vestiarium: Vestiary. On the Plan, a large room over and coextensive with the Refectory, by its size presumably able to accommodate tailoring and storage of clothing (I, 281ff). See vestiarius. vestiarius: Keeper of monks' clothes, a subordinate of the Chamberlain (camerarius). See Adalhard &lt;VII&gt;, 120 n132. At Fulda in 812 "Omnes homines qui in eodem monasterio loco habitant ab uno vestiario vestitum accipiant prosint praepositas sive cellarius dispenserint" (Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 325). vestimentum (-a): Garment. Benedict (RB, 55) prescribes an issue of two tunics (tunica), cowls (culculla), stockings (pedules), two pair of shoes (caligae), a belt (bracile), pen (graphium), needle (acus), handkerchief (mappula), and tablets (tabula); monks on journeys receive a pair of trousers (femoralia) which are to be washed and restored to the vestiary upon returning. The abbot supervised the exchange and fit of new clothes for old ones, an exchange occurring on St. Martin's Day (November 11). At the synod of 816, the Benedictine standard clothing list was greatly enlarged, doubtless in recognition of the harsher climate north of the Alps. For clothing items and allowances at Corbie, see Adalhard &lt;I, 4&gt;, 105 nn30-34. Novices were issued the discards of monks. On the Plan, facilities are indicated in the Great Collective Workshop for fullers, tanners, and shoemakers (fullones, coriarii, sutores), indicating that the community doubtless produced all its own clothing and harness tack. Vestimenta capernina seu sirico circumsuta, vestments made of goat hair or edged in silk, were forbidden to monks according to Haito's commentary to the preliminary acts of the first synod of Aachen. [ad]viaticum: Provisions for journeying (Adalhard &lt;II&gt;, 105 n36). villa (-ae): An outlying manorial estate or settlement, composed of manses (mansi). The economic exploitation of such estates, if monastic, and within practical range (villa dominica; see Verhulst and Semmler, p. 235) was in the hands of the provost, the chamberlain, and the porter. Each, for the fulfillment of his respective duties (ministerium), had assigned to him the yield of a specific number of services (seruitium) or the collection of tithes (decimum) in those tenures subject to tithing. An elder, called maior, represented the villa; if the estate lay beyond practical reach of the monastery, the abbot delegated authority for its administration to a vassalus in beneficio (see I, 349 and Adalhard &lt;I&gt;, 103 notes 16-19). villa rustica: The country residence of a Roman land holder with living quarters usually ranged around an open, galleried court and partially roofed over. villicus: See maior. vindgluggr, or vindanga (ON): Air inlet. See ljori. vinum: See hemina. vivarium: Fishbreeding pond. Also the name of a famous monastery founded by Cassiodorus near his ancestral home of Syllacium in Calabria, with fishponds established by deflecting the river Pella into collecting basins. But Adalhard and other Carolingians more commonly denote stockyards by this term (Adalhard &lt;I, 4&gt;, 105 and &lt;IV&gt;), 108ff in contrast with piscarium. volatilia: Poultry. The consumption of fowl, a controversial matter in monastic life, was one on which Benedict failed to make explicit comment, a lapse interpreted by later generations to mean that he condoned it. vomitorium: Opening at the upper end of hidden corridors (cryptae) in the substructure of Roman theaters and amphitheaters, through which people gain access ("are spit out into") to the spectators' tiers (maeniae). VOUSSOIR: A brick or wedge-shaped stone used to form an arch. W wacta: Guard, and guard duty, perhaps also used to mean guard towers. See the Capitulare de villis, quoted II, 33ff. WALL PIECE: A vertical timber rising from a corbel against the upper inside face of a masonry wall, usually receiving an angle brace or arch brace related to a superincumbent timber roof. Wall pieces engaged in the gable walls are principal roof-supporting members; those in the aisle walls lock the tie beams into which they are tenoned against the masonry. WALL PLATE: See PLATE. WALL POST: See POST. Warf, or Wurte (NHG): In protohistoric tideland settlements of northwest Germany and Holland, an artificial earth mound thrown up to raise the level of the ground above the heavy winter tides. WATER TABLE: See DRIP MOULD. Westwerk (NHG): A multistoried avant corps on the entrance side of the church, in which two lateral staircase towers gave access to a raised tribune from which the emperor and his entourage might attend services; a Carolingian innovation expressing the close association between state and church (see regnum et sacerdotium) which characterizes the Age of Charlemagne. The absence of this feature from the Church of the Plan may be conditioned by a reluctance on the part of certain reformists to grant the secular sovereign so important a station in the house of God. Winchilsul (OHG): Corner post. See the Lex Bajuvariorum, quoted II, 27ff. Wurte: See Warf. Y YARD: In US/English standard measure, 36 inches (91.44 cm), or 3 feet. See ELL, FOOT, INCH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION To keep the text uncluttered by the tedious repetition of full or abbreviated bibliographical citations, as well as to protect the reader from the ennervating search for bibliographical sources that occurs when one is forced to leaf through pages and pages of op. cit.'s, loc. cit.'s, and ibid.'s, authors are cited in the footnotes to the text of this and the two preceding volumes solely by (1) the surname, (2) the year of publication of the study, and (3) the pages on which the cited passage is to be found. Full bibliographical entries for these citations can be found only in this Bibliography. The Bibliography is arranged in strict alphabetical order by authors' surnames or by title. We decided not to organize entries by subject matter, type of publication, or any of the various other internal devices of bibliography, judging that such refinements would only complicate the reader's task. The few abbreviations used in the notes to indicate complex and frequently referred-to publications (Patr. Lat., Mon. Germ. Hist., etc.) are listed for the reader's convenience on the next page. The citation of publications occurring in series has been simplified by placing the series title as the last element of the entry. A few works referred to only in captions to illustrations and cited fully in them, do not appear in this Bibliography. An advantage of this system is that the reader knows exactly where to turn for a listing of the full title and that he can do so in only one movement away from his reading. Attention to page design has been directed to facilitate the use of and attract the reader to an element of the work that, too often, has bestowed upon its arrangement only the most casual notice. Nevertheless, our method is not free of danger. If a title by inadvertence is omitted from this Bibliography (quod absit!), its abbreviated form in the footnotes may not contain sufficient information for proper identification, particularly if the study referred to was published in a journal. We hope to have avoided such oversights. Cross references from one listed title to another occur wherever it appeared to us to be in the reader's interest to provide them. We have added brief explanatory comments to some of the more important publications referred to in this work, or to those that are centrally related to the conduct of our own inquiry. We are listing in this Bibliography translations into English, German and French, whenever they are available, although in the text such works may only be referred to in the original edition. This applies especially to narratives written in languages—Old Norse, Anglo Saxon, and even Latin—that may lie outside the linguistic range of competence of the average reader. Where passages from the Rule of St. Benedict are quoted, we made it a point to refer to them simultaneously in the most recent critical edition in Latin published by Rudolphus Hanslik in 1960, the skillful and sensitive translation into English by Abbot Justin McCann in 1952, and the excellent and richly annotated translation into German by Father Basilius Steidle in 1952. In doing this we hope not to appear redundant; it was our desire to give quick and easy access to translations for the benefit of those to whom the original language is an insuperable barrier. The Rule of St. Benedict is the rock on which the entire development of medieval monasticism is based—and not least of all the master plan for a monastic settlement that forms the subject of our study. To read the Rule in translation is better than not to read it at all; and neither of the two translations is any mean accomplishment. In a few instances we have listed books that bear on our subject but could not be exploited for this study because of their late date of publication. Where this is done, it is so indicated in an explanatory remark. As in so many other areas of this book I am indebted to Charles W. Jones for numerous invaluable comments and criticisms in the preparation of this Bibliography, and to my editor, Lorna Price, for her skills in organizing and patience in seeing it through various stages of printing. W.H. "WHEN I first engaged in this work, I resolved to leave neither words nor things unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, with the obscure recesses of northern learning which I should enter and ransack; the treasures with which I expected every search into those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with which I should display my acquisitions to mankind. When I had thus enquired into the origin of words, I resolved to show likewise my attention to things; to pierce deep into every science, to enquire the nature of every substance of which I inserted the name, to limit every idea by a definition strictly logical, and exhibit every production of art or nature in an accurate description, that my book might be in place of all other dictionaries whether appellative or technical. But these were the dreams of a poet doomed at last to be a lexicographer. I soon found that it is too late to look for instruments, when the work calls for execution, and that whatever abilities I had brought to my task, with those I must finally perform it. To deliberate whenever I doubted, to enquire whenever I was ignorant, would have protracted the undertaking without end, and perhaps, without much improvement; for I did not find by my first experiments, that what I had not of my own was easily to be obtained: I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another, that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to find was not always to be informed; and that thus to pursue perfection was, like the first inhabitants of Arcadia, to chase the sun, which, when they had reached the hill where he seemed to rest, was still beheld at the same distance from them. I then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance than assistance: by this I obtained at least one advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not completed." Samuel Johnson, Preface to A Dictionary of the English Language, 1755 A NOTE Disorderly in life, Samuel Johnson was nonetheless among the most articulate of scholars who have tried to make an exemplar of order, that unruly thought might at least possess a vision of its aspirations. In the illustrious context of the Preface to the first fascicule of the OED (A New English Dictionary . . . 1883) Dr. James A. H. Murray, a wise as well as a learned man, quoted Johnson on reaching an end of matters. The authors, having reached an end of their labors if not of their enquiries, ponder that end and this Bibliography. Although it is very much the creature of their footnotes and thus lacks certain airs and graces, nevertheless its planning has been given close attention in the awareness that this detail of book design often gets short shrift. Is this because, coming at the end of a work, bibliographies appear merely as lists of proper names and book titles, unworthy of the same care at times bestowed on title and occasionally on text pages? Or did the designer, weary of the main work and too tired to go further, decide to dismiss himself from what seemed a mere final drudgery? Whatever the reason, the authors hope the reader may peruse this assembly of works, finding assorted old acquaintances but also perhaps making many new ones. Far from being a concise literary sarcophagus, a bibliography holds keys to minds of many men, who continue freely to aid and sometimes to inspire us. Authors and editor consider that the bibliography should be cut from cloth of not less quality than that of the work itself. When Carl Purington Rollins admonished, "In the designing of books there's no sin like complacency," he spoke well. E.B., L.P. ABBREVIATIONS IN THE NOTES Cons. Mon.

Boeckelmann was the first to suggest that the incompatibility of certain measurements listed in the explanatory titles of the Plan were not intrinsic dimensional inconsistencies of the drawing, but the expression of a change of mind amongst the leaders of the monastic reform movement about the desired length of the Church. He also observed that the recurrence of certain line or area values of the Plan, corresponding to ten feet or multiples of ten feet, suggested that the Plan was drawn to a definite scale.

Its parts are severed; one is in the National Library, Bucharest (formerly in the Batthyaneum at Alba Julia, Roumania); the other in the Vatican Library (Pal. Lat. 50). Its two ivory covers (one in the Museo Sacro of the Vatican, the other in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London) were through Braunfel's efforts reunited in the Council of Europe Exhibition "Karl der Grosse" (Aachen, 1965), and subsequently published in this outstanding edition. Braunfels, Wolfgang, Die Welt der Karolinger und ihre Kunst, Munich, 1968. A persuasive, beautifully written and illustrated summary of historical insights the author gained about art and culture in the Age of Charlemange in his role as organizer of the Council of Europe Exhibition "Karl der Grosse" (Aachen, 1965) and as principal editor of the collaborative five-volume work that crowned this brilliant display (see Karl der Grosse, Lebenswerk und Nachleben). Braunfels, Wolfgang, Abenländisches Klosterbaukunst, Köln, 1969. A second, enlarged edition of this work, including a new chapter on the cathedral monasteries of England, was published in English as Monasteries of Western Europe: The Architecture of the Orders (London and Princeton, 1972). It is the first serious attempt to trace the history of monastic architecture and custom from its beginnings in Egypt through its triumphant expansion in the Middle Ages, its decay during the Reformation and revival in the period of the German baroque, terminating with a discussion of Le Corbusier's Dominican House of La Tourette.

Translation into French of the article "Description of the Ancient Plan of the Monastery of St. Gall in the Ninth Century" of 1848, by Willis, whose name by a rare sin of omission does not appear on the title page. The article includes Willis's redrawn version of the Plan of St. Gall, annotated with French titles. This translation forms the basis of Leclerq's treatment of the Plan of St. Gall, in Cabrol-Leclerq (q.v.). Canisius, Henricus, Thesaurus monumentorum, ecclesiasticorum, et historicorum sive Henricus Canisius Lectiones Antiquae, vols. 1-4, Ingolstadt, 1601-1614. The discoverer of the true character of the Plan, Canisius was the first to identify Gozb[er]tus of the dedicatory legend as Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall (816-836). He was not aware of the paradigmatic nature of the Plan, but thought that it was a site plan of the monastery of St. Gall in the stage it had reached under Gozbert, an error inherited by the learned Jean Mabillon. Capitula qualiter, ed. D. H. Frank, O.S.B., in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 347-51. Capitulare de villis. See Duby, Gareis, Guérard. A document of pivotal importance for the study of the rural Carolingian economy consisting of directives for the management of royal domaines, maintenance of buildings and tools, the legal and social rights of workers, and a list of more than 100 plants to be cultivated on royal estates. For an evaluation of the controversy concerning its date and the sovereign on whose order it was drawn up (Charlemagne before his coronation, or his son Louis while king of Aquitania between 794 and 813?) see Ganshof, 1958, 162. For a translation into French, see Guérard, 1853 (all 70 paragraphs of the capitulare) and Duby, 1968, 277-80, where only 12 of the 70 paragraphs are quoted; also translated into English in Duby, 1968, 361-62).

Elucidated by a superb critical apparatus, it includes in its first published volume (among other matter) the new editions of such crucial contemporary sources as the resolutions, preliminary and final, drawn up in 816 and 817 during the two reform synods of Aachen, as well as that masterpiece of administrative and managerial logistics, the so-called Statutes of Adalhard of Corbie (Consuetudines Corbeiensis) written in 821/22, a complete translation of which can be found here in Appendix II, vol.

In this first systematic exploration of Carolingian sequence, the author recovers the musical structure of the early West Frankish sequence through an intricate comparison of the work of Notker "Balbulus" of St. Gall (ca. 840-912) with West Frankish sequences preserved in 10th and 11th century manuscripts of Aquitaine.

Doppelfeld, Otto, "Der alte Dom zu Köln und der Bauriss von St. Gallen," Das Münster, Zeitschrift für christliche Kunst und Kunstwissenschaft II (1948), 1-12. Doppelfeld advanced the intriguing idea that the dimensional incompatibilities of the measurements listed in the explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall are resolvable if it were assumed that the scribe, in copying these titles from the prototype plan, inadvertently dropped a C in the Roman number CCC of the large axial title of the Church and by a similar inadvertency changed the word bis denos ("twice ten") to bis senos ("twice six") in the title that defines the interstices of the nave columns. The ingenious simplicity of this theory made it attractive to many students of the Plan, until challenged in 1956 by Boeckelmann's (q.v.) new and even more persuasive explanation.

Dopsch, Alphons, "Das Capitulare de villis, die Brevium exempla und der Bauplan von St. Gallen," Vierteljahrsschrift für Sozial- und Wirstchaftsgeschichte XIII (1916), 41-70. Alfons Dopsch was the first to suggest that the word exemplare in the letter of transmission of the Plan of St. Gall shows that the Plan was not an original but a copy. This view was shared by Beyeble (q.v.) and Hecht (q.v.) but disregarded by many others. Bischoff's (q.v.) masterful analysis of the paleographical aspects of the explanatory titles of the Plan finally resolved this problem. Dopsch suggested Reginbertus, headmaster of the scriptorium of the monastery of Reichenau, as author of the Plan, and Reginbertus, as Bischoff's analysis proved, appears in fact to have acted as corrector in the making of the Plan. Dopsch also was the first to suggest that the original scheme of the Plan might be a product of the monastic reform movement.

Though for three centuries Du Cange has been used as the basic dictionary of medieval Latin, as the title shows it is rather a glossary or explanation of unusual words. Since 1920, the Union Académique Internationale has sponsored the preparation of a "new Du Cange," which has evolved into publication of "national dictionaries" like Niermeyer (q.v.) and Arnaldi, based on Forcellini-De Vit (q.v.); these are being incorporated in the Mittellateinisches Wörterbuch bis zum ausgehenden 13.

In this study, which deals with the historical roots of the medieval bay system, the claim was first advanced that the Guest and Service Buildings of the Plan of St. Gall are a Carolingian variant of the aisled and bay-divided Germanic timber house, the origins of which can now be traced back to the 14th century B.C. This theory formed the basis of the reconstructions of these buildings in the model displayed at the Council of Europe Exhibition "Karl der Grosse" (Aachen, 1965; see Horn, 1965).

Proposes, in confirmation of a suggestion made by Alfons Dopsch (see Dopsch, 1916) that the Plan was conceptually a product of the monastic reform movement and argues in favor of Haito, Bishop of Basel and simultaneously Abbot of the Monastery of Reichenau, as the maker of the surviving Plan.

The so-called Polyptique of Irminon, drawn up by Irminon, abbot of St. Germain-des-Prés (A.D. 812-817), is an inventory of the estates and revenues of this rich monastery—the earliest and most complete document of its kind, and therefore an incomparable source for the history of agrarian society in the Age of Charlemagne. It analyzes the constituent parts of each estate, gives a full account of the tenants and registers the burdens of all their holdings. The Polyptique was brilliantly edited and exhaustively annotated by B. E. C. Guèrard (q.v.), in 1844; he spent most of his life preparing the work. A new edition by Lognon was published in Paris in 1886, under the auspices of the Société de l'histoire de Paris.

Keller, Ferdinand, Bauriss des Klosters St.-Gallen vom Jahr 820, Zurich, 1844. The first scholarly description of the Plan illustrated with a lithograph reproduction that formed the basis for all later studies till the appearance in 1952 of an eight-color offset facsimile print (see Reinhard). Keller was the first to interpret the Guest and Service Buildings as "court-yard houses" and thus may be considered the founder of what in this study is referred to as the Classical School. Keller's so-called facsimile reproduction rendered the outlines of the buildings and their explanatory titles with a high degree of accuracy (although, inexplicably, it failed to include the dedicatory note), but it was not a facsimile in the modern sense of the term. The Plan and its legends were completely redrawn for a stone that matched the size of the original. But in the preparatory phases of the work this stone broke, and since no substitute stone of the same size could be found, the final reproduction turned out to be one fifth smaller than the drawing of the original Plan. The reproduction was nevertheless a masterpiece of its kind (considering its early date) and highly superior to the imperfect copper engraving published in 1704 by Jean Mabillon (q.v.). It was reprinted at a reduced scale and not quite as successfully in Willis' (q.v.) study of 1848 and in Cabrol-Leclerq (q.v.), VIII, 19.

The first comprehensive and still basic collection of the lives of the saints of the Order of St. Benedict, prepared by the erudite Jean Mabillon (son of a peasant from near Reims) of the congregation of St. Maur who was for twenty years of his life a member of the great literary workshop of the Maurists at St. Germain-des-Près in Paris, and who died in 1707 working on the last volumes of his monumental edition of the Benedictine Annals. Mabillon, Jean, Annales ordinis sancti Benedicti occidentalium monachorum patriarchae . . ., 6 vols., Paris, 1703-1739. Volume 2 (1704) of this history of the Order of St. Benedict contains the first graphic reproduction of the Plan of St. Gall (facing p. 570), a copper engraving made after the drawing presented to Mabillon by Hermann Schenk, then head of the Library of St. Gall. The drawing is not free of errors and many of the explanatory titles are omitted. Mabillon, like Canisius (q.v.), thought the Plan was a contemporary portrayal of the actual monastery of St. Gall as it appeared at the time of Gozbert ("tabula quaedam . . . in qua basilicae sancti Galli, totiusque monasterii ichonographica delineato repraesantur"). He was not aware of the paradigmatic nature of the Plan and attributed its authorship to Einhard. On Mabillon's relation to St. Gall, see Heer. Mabillon, Jean, Iter Germanicum, Hamburg, 1717.

This is the most comprehensive and most carefully planned 19th-century collection of critically edited historical sources from the end of the Roman empire to the middle of the 13th century—a remarkable achievement of German scholarship. Conceived by men of great foresight and vision, at a time when Germany was divided into a heterogeneous array of autonomous states (and boldly carried on under these conditions throughout the major part of the 19th century) this great collective enterprise is now coming close to reaching its ultimate goal. When its plan was first announced in 1824, the series was to consist of five principal sections: 1) authors, 2) laws, 3) imperial ordinances, 4) letters, and 5) antiquities, a division that was retained in the implementation of the project. The first volume came out in 1826. The volumes most important for our study are those of the series Leges which contain the administrative directives issued by the Carolingian rulers.

Matthew Arnold's well-known laudation was only one of many of this tremendous library, which has been for more than a century the standard source for all Christian-Latin texts composed before A.D. 1200. Because Abbé Migne and his editors only copied pre-existent texts (with typographical fidelity varying greatly from volume to volume), the reliability of the texts is no stronger than Migne's sources. Several 20th-century ventures are now replacing it (notably the Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina, Turnholt: Brepols, edited by the Benedictine brothers of St. Peter's Abbey, Steenbrugge, Belgium). Yet it is still unique in its vast scope and indispensable where other more recent and more critical editions of special works do not exist.

Corbie is extensively treated. Peltier, H., "Saint Adalhard, abbé de Corbie," in Corbie abbaye royale (q.v.), 61-94. The author died before he could publish his projected book on Adalhard but this essay doubtless contains most of its substance. Peltier, H., "Wala, disciple d'Adalhard," in Corbie abbaye royale (q.v.), 95-104. Count Wala, brother of Adalhard and therefore cousin of Charlemagne and a prominent courtier and politician, became abbot of Bobbio and succeeded his brother as abbot of Corbie. Unfortunately Canon Peltier died before this essay was finally shaped, and the documentation is somewhat incomplete. Perry, John, The Story of Standards, New York, 1955.

Sowers, Ossa Raymond, "Mediaeval Monastic Planning: Its Origins in the Christian East and Later Development in Western Europe," (dissertation) Columbia University, 1951. It is highly regrettable that this excellent and most carefully annotated thesis of Columbia University (brought to my attention by Prof. Meyer Schapiro, who suggested the study and supervised its progress) has never been published. It re-investigates, though on a considerably broader basis, a subject masterfully treated some 60 years earlier in Julius von Schlosser's (q.v.) now somewhat superannuated dissertation of 1889, and is superior to other published studies dealing with the same subject, such as those of Fendel (q.v.) and Hager (q.v.); for a more recent treatment of the subject, see Horn, 1974.

"Toward a Medieval Aesthetic," Viator: Medieval and Renaissance Studies (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London), 6 (1975), 309-51. A triad of interdisciplinary essays dealing with the emergence of modular concepts in medieval literature, music, and architecture. Together these three essays elaborate the striking parallelism in the transformation of cultural materials inherited from Antiquity as they are revived and appropriated by the Carolingian Franks. These articles emerged from a three year sequence of an interdisciplinary course, "The Age of Charlemagne," offered at the University of California, Berkeley, 1970 to 1973. Their basic findings were first presented in a meeting of the Medieval Association of the Pacific (Stanford University, January, 1973).

      <field name="fulltext">CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE INTRODUCTION The Plan of St. Gall emerged at the height of a search for cultural unity that struck through the whole of Carolingian life. The role of the Plan was to stand in some degree as both agent and result of a quest uniquely intensive in the epochs of Western history. The web of intellectual, political, and religious life that appeared as a close-woven tapestry, however briefly, under Charlemagne left behind it images of dramatic potency to the future life of Europe and the West. The common thread of that tapestry lay in the emergence and establishment of Christianity in the West. Having been recognized as a leading religion of the Roman state by Emperor Constantine in 325 A.D. the faith had to be guarded against both the efforts of the state to interpret the new belief in its own terms, and against any tendency to sap its strength through internal splits (as presented by such heresies as Arianism, Donatism, Pelagianism, and the growing diversity of monastic observances). This defense was accomplished on one hand through the institution of national synods assembled to hold in check doctrinal contrariety, and on the other through development of an administrative structure parallel to the organization of the Roman state. By this means Christianity could step, as a traditional force, into the gap created by the collapse of Roman secular power. This transition was hard won. During the barbarian invasions of Rome the unity of the Church was shattered by the fact that the Germanic conquerors were either pagans or adherents of Arianism. Three centuries were needed to quiet the claims of other forms of faith in favor of a common creed. A great turning point was reached with the conversion ca. 496 of the Frankish king Clovis to the orthodox faith, and the resulting adoption of it by all pagan and Arian nations that fell under the sway of the Franks. Church and state once more began to draw together. As Frankish power grew the increasing sense of unity was expressed through a series of alliances that changed the face of the world. It was under Charles Martel, a Frankish statesman of highest caliber, that this new world was rescued from the threat of being overrun by the Moslems in 732; it was by Frankish rulers of Martel's house that the Papal See was delivered from the prospect of submission to the Lombards. The alliance was formally recognized when Pope Stephen II in 754 annointed Pepin king of the Franks in Paris; it attained its fullest expression in the year 800 when Charlemagne allowed himself to be crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in Rome. In this manner there came into existence a new Imperium Christianum that had its center not in Rome but in the transalpine kingdom of the Franks. The reality was brief. The Carolingian empire, beset by selfish demands of lesser scions of a great house, broke apart after the death of its founder, but the ideal survived and maintained itself as a major force in the shaping of modern Europe. Like the concept of empire itself, the scheme for an ideal monastic settlement transmitted to us in the Plan of St. Gall survived the collapse of the Carolingian power structure by which it was first nurtured, and left a permanent imprint on monastic planning for centuries to come. In the chronological table that follows we have tried to assemble under the rubrics EVENTS, STRUCTURES, and WRITING, a chain of significant historical, artistic, and intellectual events that contributed most to the shaping of this new cultural entity, intertwined as they were in the maelstrom of those great population shifts that distinguish settlement patterns of the new from those of the ancient world. It is intended as a working sketch supplementary to our principal task, and made in the hope that it might allow one to see the Plan of St. Gall somewhat synoptically in its broader historical context. Under the rubric STRUCTURES we list of Roman monuments only those we have reason to presume were known to Charlemagne and his court, or which may have influenced Carolingian architecture in ways not yet able to be defined with precision. We hope our selection reflects the richness, variety, and contrariety of that wave of new architectural forms that flooded the empire after the official recognition of Christianity. The monuments listed that were built in the turbulent territory of the nascent Christian kingdoms of the North will, we hope, reflect with sufficient strength the syncretic character of the architecture of a new, very disparate cultural environment exposed to strong stimuli received simultaneously from the Near East as well as the vernacular traditions of the barbarian North. Above all we hope that our treatment of the Carolingian period succeeds in setting into strong relief the emergence, within a multitude of varying forms, of an architectural style of fundamental importance for the future. This architecture owes its strength to the ability of its creators to resurrect the greatness of the Roman past (revival of the Early Christian transept basilica as a standard form of Carolingian church construction) as it owes to their capacity and determination to simultaneously transform this borrowed architectural concept along Northern modular concepts of space. It has not been acknowledged by our illustrious profession with the conviction that abundant evidence merits, that the formation of the Western world owes as much to the aesthetic and intellectual bent of the "barbarian" heirs of Rome as it does to the stimuli received from the sophisticated traditions of the South. The entries under the rubric WRITING we hope will support our contention that this is a truth applying not only to architecture but also to the creation, in a comparable process of interaction between North and South, of new and distinctly medieval concepts in Carolingian literature and music. W. H. EVENTS THOUGHT, TECHNOLOGY, MOVEMENTS 1 STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGY, RELATED ARTIFACTS 2 WRITING, MANUSCRIPTS, PAINTING, OTHER ART WORKS 3 55 B.C. Julius Caesar's (102-44 B.C.) first expedition to England followed by a second in 54. 13 B.C. Rome, theater of Marcellus. 1st century B.C., subsequent to Roman conquest of Greece, the Greek Y and Z, upsilon and zeta, were adopted as y and z, and placed at the end of the Roman alphabet. With these 2 additions the alphabet, by this time, was brought to a more or less final form of 23 letters-A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, P (original shape of R, from Greek rho), S, T, V, X, Y, Z. From here on, growth of Roman writing is largely concerned with adaption to other languages and the evolution of cursive scripts. E.B. Built by Augustus, it was dedicated to Marcellus in this year (I fig. 51.A-C). 4 B.C. Birth of Christ. 12 B.C.-12 A.D. Rome, Basilica Aemilia. Timber-roofed hall; clerestory, gallery surmounted double aisles on four sides; no evidence of terminating apses. 0 1ST CENTURY 1ST CENTURY 1ST CENTURY late 1st CENTURY B.C. /early 1st CENTURY A.D. beginnings of London (a Celtic name). 1st century. Augusta Raurica (Augst), Switzerland. Roman forum with timber-roofed aisled basilica; apse, counterapse; large galleried court attached to one long side. 49-61. Letters to Galatians, Thessalonians, Corinthians, Romans, Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon, by St. Paul. 28-30 A.D. Christ abandons the belief that only the Jews are chosen of God; he is rejected by Jewish leaders and crucified. 1st-2nd century. Hodorf (Holstein), Germany. A vivid portrayal of Paul's personality and a superb account of the worship and organization of the early church, these letters display in frank and spontaneous language the thoughts and feelings of the man who recognized the universal implications of the Christian faith and became the primary force in making it a worldwide religion. Germanic timber houses; aisled, bay-divided prehistoric antecedents of Lower Saxon Wohnstallhaus. 43. Under Claudius, Roman conquest of England begins. 1st-2nd century. Earliest Christians assemble for religious services in private houses, sometimes altered internally for liturgical use. 50 49-50 A.D. Council of the Apostles. 1st-4th century. Feddersen-Wierde, Bremerhaven, Germany. Site of Hodorf-type Germanic timber houses; aisled, bay divided; excavated in 7 successive Warf layers (I fig. 176; II figs. 315-16). ca. 50. De materia medica, by Dioscurides Pedanius of Anazarbos. Paul argues that converted pagans should be free from observing Jewish law. 1st-4th century. Fochteloo, Friesland, The Netherlands. Site of timber-built aisled homestead of a West Germanic farmer, with a main house and 3 smaller ones. Describing properties of some 600 medicinal plants (fig. 204, I258), this herbal became a leading reference for pharmaceutical medicine in the Middle Ages, through an illustrated copy made in 512 (q.v. below). Its author was a Greek physician who served in the army of Nero. 1ST-2ND CENTURY 80 A.D. Rome, Flavian amphitheater (Colosseum). Begun by Vespasian, it was finished and dedicated by Titus in this year (I fig. 50). * The Christian community, led by priests in turn ruled by bishops, is established. The bishop of Rome gradually becomes head of the church. By ca. 200, adherents of the faith number around 20,000-30,000 people. ca. 85 A.D. Rome, basilica of the imperial palace. Barrel vaulted, with narrow aisles and internal apse for the emperor's throne. It is a curiosity of the history of Roman writing, a writing in capitals† † "The early Roman Empire knew no minuscules.

In its first 6 centuries it possessed no characteristics of particular visual interest, was singularly unimpressive. Then in the first century B.C. appear portents of a magificence that was to make its writing one of Rome's greatest achievements. For this writing is the Variants of this type became a standard form of later imperial audience halls and served as prototypes for Charlemagne's audience halls at Aachen and Nieder-Ingelheim (see Trier, so-called "hasilica," ca. 330). 1ST CENTURY A.D. The Apostolic Age 90-120. Kastel Künzig, Passau, Germany. The work of the Apostles among Gentiles is so effective that pagan converts soon outnumber Jewish followers. Unity of church is maintained by letters and visits. Typical transalpine Roman military camp (I fig. 71.B). continue below 100 2ND CENTURY 2ND CENTURY 2ND CENTURY 2nd century. Silchester, Hampshire, England. vehicle that has linked successive generations in a continuum of thought and action, through war, peace, and revolution to carry western civilization across two millenia. The characters of its alphabet remain scarcely changed. In languages new to him, Marcus Aurelius, if here today, would recognize his alphabet as he knew it. For English, three letters are added, J, U, W. 2ND-3RD CENTURY Age of Persecution Roman basilica with apse, counterapse; galleried court surrounded by shops attached to one long side (I fig. 202). Rise of Christianity in cities, and development of hierarchical structures in the church that parallel those of the state, enable the church to assume many state functions when the state institutions collapse centuries later. Remains of Sikhester-type transalpine basilicas could be seen in Merovingian/Carolingian times. With their great Roman archetype, the basilica and forum of Trajan, they may have influenced formation of the Carolingian claustral scheme codified in the Plan of St. Gall. Christian communities reject secular control of religion. The Roman state, unable to tolerate "an empire within the empire" (imperium in imperio) inflicts endless persecutions, causing the church intermittently to go underground. 2nd-3rd century. Worms, Germany. Site of Roman forum with timber-roofed basilica, aisled; large galleried court attached to one long side. By 114 A.D. an inscription on Trajan's Column was carved in letters so noble in character and perfect of form they have never been excelled. Nothing so profoundly perpetuates and qualifies Rome as "Eternal", in the vast and varied legacy that civilization and culture gave the world in its WRITING. E.B. Given to Burgundian king Gunther in 413; perhaps used as his palace; destroyed in 600 to make room for the Merovingian cathedral of Worms. 116. Roman merchants visit Lo-yang, Honan, on the Hwang-ho River as emissaries of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Han Period). Other Roman traders are reported in 226, 284. ca. 118-ca. 128. Rome, Pantheon. Cylinder-shaped space (dia. 144 feet); semi-circular dome rising from masonry shell of great thickness. The shape expresses the volumetric simplicity of the Roman concept of spatial corporeality with great eloquence. * 120. Emperor Hadrian visits York. 113. Rome, Trajan's forum and basilica dedicated. Roman basilica with apse, counterapse; large galleried court attached to one long side (I.291). 105. Invention of papermaking by Ts'ai Lun, China. Papermaking was to reach Europe 1100 years later, to doom parchment, manuscript, and scribe as prime agents in the scheme of western education, learning, and literature. Papermaking technology was to stimulate the invention of mechanical replication of identical images in alphabetical writing,-the thing we call PRINTING. E.B. One of the three great fortresses of Rome in Britain, the others, Chester and Caerleon. Enough of the magnificent work of the forum was left when Charlemagne first visited Rome so that it may have exerted some influence on the Carolingian infatuation with double-apsed basilicas (Cologne, Fulda, Plan of St. Gall). 123. Hadrian's Wall built (from Solway to the mouth of the Tyne). 164. Galen (ca. 130-ca. 200), widely travelled Greek physician, founder of experimental physiology, and after Hippocrates the most distinguished physician of Antiquity, wrote some 500 medical treatises. In this year he settled in Rome and served in the army under Marcus Aurelius. ca. 180. Mousmieh, Syria. Praetorium (or temple?). Roman secular antecedent to layout of cross-in-square church; barrel-vaulted arms, domed crossing. 3RD CENTURY 3RD CENTURY 3RD CENTURY 200 205-208. Rome. Forma Urbis Romae. 211. Severus dies at York. Monumental lapidary inscribed delineation of plans of public buildings of imperial Rome at the scales of 1:240 and 1:245 (I figs. 46-47, 50-51). 203-ca. 254. Origen produces about 6,000 works in these years: letters, textual criticism, exegesis, apologetics, dogmatical and practical theology. A theologian of prodigious erudition, probably the most prolific writer of the ancient church, he was trained in and eventually head of the catechetical school of Alexandria, where Christians were instructed in both Greek sciences and Scripture. ca. 250 Establishment in Rome of a consensus of priests, deacons, and laymen to decide matters of faith. 216. Lepcis Magna, Tripolitania. Basilica of Septimius Severus dedicated. 250, 258. Germanic tribes invade Gaul. Double-apsed basilica; gallery-surmounted aisles; large galleried court attached to one long side. 276. Franks and Alamanni devastate Gaul. * 284-305. Reign of Diocletian under whom the most vicious persecution of Christians takes place. ca. 240. Dura Europos, on the Euphrates River. Remains of house-church typical for the period. UNCIAL 293-331. Reorganization of the empire by Diocletian (245-313). The uncial hand is a majuscule evolved at an early period by the Greeks (possibly about the 4th century B.C.) as an informal alternative to the monumental lapidary script. In Latin, the uncial appears about the 3rd or 4th century A.D., and continued in use for many centuries. Latin uncials,* * Rule of St. Benedict, Hatton 48 (for illustrations, see Volume I,p. 329 et seq. p. 345). The somewhat earlier Speculum of St. Augustine is written in an uncial of great elegance. like the early Greek uncials, were a search for a script more rapidly executed than the squarish majuscule. E.B. He makes Trier capital of both Belgica Prima and the entire "diocese" of Gaul. 250-350. Bärhorst, Germany. Site of Migration Period village of aisled timber houses destroyed by fire. Constantine the Great, generally residing there from 306-331, enriches the city with great works of architecture. Magnificent imperial villas such as Konz (I fig. 241.A-B) rise on the banks of the Moselle. end, 3rd century. Adherents of the faith number an estimated 2 million people. Spreading from Spain to Persia and India, Christianity has become, particularly in the east, numerically the strongest religious community. 4TH CENTURY 4TH CENTURY 4TH CENTURY 300 early 4th century. Rome, pavillion in Licinian Gardens (so-called Temple of Minerva Medica). SEMI-UNCIAL Domed decagon with billowing niches. By the 5th century the semi-uncial evolved in response to need for an even more rapidly executed script of books and for utilitarian and commercial practice, and lasted till about the 9th century. The essential characteristic of uncial and semi-uncial is roundness of hand, the uncial stressing the majuscule but allowing the miniscule, while the semi-uncial stressed the minuscule but accepting the majuscule; uncials were slower of execution than semi-uncials (see remarks on speed page 215, column 3). Each type in its fully developed expression is a hand of great beauty. The Irish-Anglo half-uncial is one of the most original scripts, perhaps the most original, in the history of Roman writing. E.B. Used with increasing frequency from the 1st century onward in imperial villas and garden palaces, this building type may have influenced the layout of the Golden Octagon in Antioch (327-341) and the church of San Lorenzo at Milan (ca. 370). 305. Diocletian retires to Spoleto. 300-350. Sites in Nitrian and Celian deserts of Egypt: caves, abandoned tombs and huts of sundried brick inhabited by solitary hermits and hermits living in groups. 306. Constantine proclaimed Augustus by his army at York. 300-350. Abu Mak'r, Wadi 'Natrun, Egypt, laura of St. Maccarius. Rare but archaeologically well-attested example of group-eremitic monastery with mud huts scattered loosely around unenclosed site. 307-312. Rome. Basilica of Maxentius. * 310-330. St. Anthony, St. Macarius, and St. Ammun establish eremitic and group-eremitic settlements in the Nitrian and Celian deserts of Egypt. Nave covered by 3 monumental groin vaults; aisles transversely by barrel vaults; east porch; shallow apse at west. 320-347. Rule of St. Pachomius. 311. Emperor Galerius on his deathbed grants toleration to Christians. 308-316. Barbegal (Arles), France, site of 16-wheel Roman flour mill, believed the principal source of flour for the Roman army stationed in Narbonne. Archaeological evidence exists for a similar mill at Prety (Pistriacum) near Tournus, Burgundy, to serve the army of Northern Gaul. The Egyptian founder of coenobitic monachism postulated communal living based on discipline and uniformity in prayer, eating, work, and clothing. 313. Edict of Milan establishes freedom of religion. 324. History of the Christian Church, by Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea. The most important ecclesiastical history of ancient times. Emperors Constantine and Licinius thus make Christianity a legal religion. 313-320. Rome, church of St. John Lateran. On the council of Nicea (325) Eusebius first sided with the moderates but in the end voted to repudiate Arianism. Five-aisled timber roofed basilica with low transept and semicircular apse. Built on imperial grounds at the periphery but still within the walls of Rome. As the political, religious, and administrative center of Rome the Lateran became the seat of the bishop of Rome, and retained this function throughout the Middle Ages. 314. Tyre, Palestine (Lebanon), aisled basilica (described by Eusebius). Note I Writing as Book With atrium; apse flanked by side chambers (I fig. 104). In the ancient world the common form of the book was the roll, made at different periods from the inner bark of certain trees, tanned skins as leather, or linen, with papyrus eventually to become the principal material of writing and scribe. The important discovery of a process for converting skins to PARCHMENT created a writing material of spectacular significance, and marks the start of the demise of roll and papyrus. 306(?)-330(?). Trier, Germany, Aula Regia. Monumental imperial audience hall presumably built by Constantine. Semicircular apse for emperor's throne; timber roof. Narthex and galleried courts on each long side. 318 or 319. Excommunication of Arius at Alexandria. He is cast out by the College of Presbyters for his views that Christ is not truly divine but a creature called into existence ex nihilo who at one time did not exist. Even today excellently preserved, the hall must have been known to every Carolingian and doubtless to the builder of Charlemagne's audience hall at Aachen. 320. Hilarion of Gaza establishes himself as a hermit in the desert of Majum; monachism spreads into Syria and Palestine. 319/322-377. Rome, Old St. Peter's. By the second century B.C., Pergamum in Asia Minor was the chief trading center for the material. With rapid improvements, parchment (and vellum, see below, note: parchment, vellum) was to prevail for early Christian writings. Five-aisled timber-roofed basilica; tall continuous transept; semicircular apse; large atrium on entrance side. 320-327. St. Pachomius founds nine coenobitic monasteries for men and two for women in the Egyptian Thebaid. Only church of its kind besides St. Paul's Outside the Walls, and a type not in general use until revived in the Carolingian period. Parchment was in common use by the Romans of the late 1st century A.D., replacing CERAE, thin wood panels with a film of black wax used for writing with a stylus. Cerae, not suitable for literary writing but widely used for current business memorandums, when hinged by rings or thongs (booklike) were called caudex or codex, literally a stock or stack of wood, from their appearance stacked on a shelf. In replacing cerae, several sheets (frequently 4) of parchment folded in half were nested to form gatherings or quires, then were stitched together in the form of a book as we still know it today. These gatherings of parchment leaves corresponded to sets of hinged cerae and became likewise known as "codex". 321. Constantine grants grudging toleration to the Donatist movement of North Africa; the movement gains upper hand in North Africa. 320-325. Foundation of first large chain of coenobitic monasteries by St. Pachomius (none survives). 323. Reaffirmation of Edict of Milan. Twenty to forty monks were accommodated in separate houses, segregated according to skills. Within an enclosure wall were also; a modest church, porter's house, 2 guesthouses, refectory, kitchen, and an annex for those serving in the kitchen. 325 325. Council of Nicea. Constantine the Great recognizes Christianity as the leading state religion. Arianism is condemned as heresy. The council was the first attempt to assemble the entire episcopate of the empire, and was precedent for all subsequent ecumenical synods. 324. Orléansville, North Africa, aisled basilica. No transept; timber roof, rectangular east end with inner apse; counterapse added in the west in the 5th century. 328. Constantine the Great founds Constantinople through enlargement of the old town of Byzantium. after 325. Trier, Germany, double cathedral. Parchment had many advantages over papyrus: it was useable on both sides and also washable or erasable on both sides (papyrus for the market was never opisthograph), and so facilitated easy reference that jurists quickly adopted the parchment codex. Consequently the term CODEX became associated with law and legal writings and soon applied to certain other literary writings and mss of singular importance. Two parallel basilicas preceded by atria, terminating in the east in rectangular sanctuaries. 330. Constantine the Great transfers the seat of government from Rome to Constantinople, owing to his displeasure with the hostile Roman senate. 327-341. Antioch, Golden Octagon, adjoining the Imperial Palace on the Orontes. Thereafter no Roman emperor resided permanently in Rome, yet it retained the title caput mundi and after the collapse of the Western empire continued to use this title in a religious sense. Double shell with octagonal center space perhaps surmounted by timber-built dome, and surrounded by ambulatory and galleries. 329-331. Birth of St. Basil the Great. It may have anticipated by 200 years the design of SS. Sergios and Bacchos at Constantinople, and San Vitale at Ravenna. By or during the 4th century, the codex superseded the roll as book form at a time when parchment was taking predominance over papyrus. Papyrus, so long almost exclusively the material of writing in roll form, adapted to gatherings of leaves into codex in Europe (and Egypt) to become almost obsolete by the 6th and 7th centuries. Parchment rose to preeminence as the material of writing (see Note II, below column 3, page 207) and of bookmaking until parchment became replaced by paper (see Note III, below column 3, page 207), a word derived from the Latin papyrus. E.B. 339. St. Athanasius introduces anchoritic monachism in Italy, making it known worldwide through his Life of St. Anthony. 340. Eustathius of Sebaste (300-377), settling as a hermit in his homeland Cappadocia, thus introduces Egyptian monachism in Asia Minor. ca. 333. Bethlehem, Palestine, church of the Nativity. 341. Ulfila (311-383) is elected bishop, probably at the Synod of Antioch. Five-aisled timber-roofed basilica; preceded by atrium; attached in the east to an octogon enshrining the site of Christ's birth. He spends most of his life among the Goths north of the Danube and dies in Constantinople. 347. Donatus, with other leaders of the Donatist church, is exiled to Gaul where he dies in 355. * 350 351. Arian controversy is reopened; Arianism enjoys a brief revival (357). ca. 346-ca. 356. Philocalia, compiled by St. Basil the Great and St. Gregory of Nazianzus; a famous anthology of the works of Origen. 355-364. Further German invasions of Gaul. before 355. Milan, Italy, cathedral (later St. Tecla). 356. Pagan temples are officially closed and sacrifice is prohibited. Of aristocratic family that gave many distinguished supporters to the church, Basil was educated in Constantinople and Athens with Gregory of Nazianzus. Together they founded the monastery of Annesi (Pontos). In 370 Basil succeeded Eusebius as bishop of Caesaraea. Thereafter much of his writing was against Arianism. 359. St. Basil the Great studies monastic life in Egypt; with St. Gregory of Nazianzus he founds a monastery at Annisi (Pontus). Five-aisled basilica with inner transept created by cross partitions in the aisles separating the last five bays from the rest of the church; semicircular apse; timber roof. 361. Followers of Donatus return in triumph to North Africa. The Donatist church, although vigorously opposed by St. Augustine and suppressed by severe laws denying its adherents civil and ecclesiastical rights (405, 412, 414), manages to survive until the extinction of Christianity in Africa in the early Middle Ages. 360. Asketikon, by St. Basil the Great. Basil writes two rules for monks, propounding hard labor, charity, and a common life as being superior to prevailing eremitical asceticism. Thus he becomes the father of coenobitic life in the Eastern church. 361. Julian the Apostate reinstates paganism. In this same year he dies after being wounded in battle. 364. St. Martin founds the first monastery of Roman Gaul at Ligugé near Poitiers. ca. 370. Milan, church of San Lorenzo. 364. Birth of St. Augustine at Tagaste, Numidia, in North Africa. Dome-surmounted tetraconch with billowing niches opening into gallery-surmounted aisles. Descendant of a group of double-shell constructions found in imperial garden palaces from the 2nd century onward. ca. 370. Sites on the Ruwer (tributary of the Moselle): Ausonius reports water-driven corn mills and masonry saws used for cutting marble. 364. Contra Arianos vel Auxentium mediolanensem liber, and Contra Constantium Augustum liber, by St. Hilary of Poitiers (ca. 300-367). 370-400. Cologne, Germany, church of St. Gereon. In these treatises Hilary accused Auxentius, bishop of Milan, of heterodoxy. 371. Death of Hilarion of Gaza. Ovoid space surrounded by fenestrated semicircular niches; large semi-circular apse; narthex with lateral apse on entrance side. Hilary is regarded by some as the first Christian writer of Latin hymns, and with this type of composition may have influenced Sts. Ambrose and Augustine. 373. Milan is established as the See of St. Ambrose. Through Ambrose it becomes known for some decades as the spiritual center of the West, as well as one of the greatest architectural centers of the world (Krautheimer). 373-379. Life of St. Paul of Thebes, by St. Jerome (ca. 340-420). 374. St. Ambrose is baptised and installed as bishop of Milan. He gives his money to the poor and his land to the church. In these years a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome begins to study Hebrew, and militates against Arianism. 378. Battle of Adrianople. 378. Antioch Kaoussié, church of St. Babylas. 375 Ostro- and Visigoths onite to defeat the emperor Valens, and are subsequently settled as federati in Pannonia. Four undivided arms attached to central martyrium. 379. Death of St. Basil the Great. 379. Milan, Italy, Basilica Ambrosiana. 379. Jerome translates into Latin the Chronicon of Eusebius, and 37 Homilies of Origen. 380. Theodosius the Great formally reinstates Orthodox Christianity. Aisled basilica without transept; semicircular apse; timber roof. Ordained presbyter, he studied Greek in Constantinople under Gregory of Nazianzus. Pioneer in patrology and biblical archaeology, Jerome gained sainthood in recognition of services rendered rather than for eminent sanctity. As defined at the Council of Nicea, it becomes the official state religion. Pagan worship is banned; incentive to restricted toleration. ca. 380. Trier, Germany, north basilica. Enlarged by installation of galleries over nave aisles; in the east in addition a monumental cross-in-square structure was added (I fig. 151.Y). 381. Synod of Aquileia (presided over by St. Ambrose) leads to deposition of Arian leaders Palladius and Secundianus. This bold and for its period unusual grouping of masses may have influenced Carolingian Latin-cross churches, but lacks the modular control of the latter. 381. Second Ecumenical Council at Constantinople. ca. 380. Rome, church of San Clemente. 381-383. Jerome revises the "Old Latin" translation of the Bible. Arianism is again condemned; the Nicean creed is approved. Aisled basilica without transept. He was called to Rome by Pope Damasus to perform this task, and there taught Hebrew and Scripture to wealthy Roman women. after 384. St. Augustine comes under influence of St. Ambrose who baptises him in 387. 382 and later. Milan, church of the Holy Apostles. Unaisled nave 200 Roman feet long, and unaisled transept of nearly equal length intersect to form a huge cross. 384. St. Jerome travels in the Near East to avoid attacks in Rome. In Antioch he joins Paula and a band of Roman wardens; together they visit Nitrian desert convents. Eventually settling in Bethlehem, Paula builds three convents, one monastery, the latter headed by Jerome. 385. Rome, St. Paul's Outside the Walls. Five-aisled timber-roofed basilica; continuous transept; erected over tomb of St. Paul (I fig. 81). 385. Ambrose composes the 4-line stanza (the "ambrosian" stanza) in a battle hymn for the besieged Christians of Milan. 386-387. St. Jerome spreads the fame of coenobitic monachism through his translation into Latin of the Rule of St. Pachomius. 4th century. Ambrosian Iliad. 390. Birth of St. Simon Stylites, first and most famous of the Syrian pillar-hermits. Earliest extant example of a Greek illuminated manuscript and presumably the earliest extant illustrated book. 395. Theodosius the Great dies in Milan. It contains 58 pictures in Classical style (many framed) but of lesser quality than the best illuminations of the Vatican Vergil. The Great Empire is divided into East, ruled by Rufinus, and West, ruled by Stilicho. 395. Pretorian prefecture transferred from Trier to Arles; the Roman secular aristocracy gradually withdraw to the south of France. end, 4th century. Tebessa, North Africa. 395(?). St. Augustine composes the "augustinian" hymn form to fight the Donatists with their own method of "psalming." Aisled basilica with galleries; apse framed by side chambers; monks' cells attached to flanks of church. 396. St. Augustine is consecrated bishop of Hippo, in Proconsular Africa. A rare and not normative expression of the Greco-Roman literary tradition, this form and those developed by Hilary and Ambrose contributed greatly to formation of Carolingian modular verse. From this point onward St. Augustine is involved in all the great controversies of his time, combatting Donatism, Pelagianism, and refuting Manichaeism (to which he had adhered in his youth). 397. St. Ninian founds a church at Whithorn (Casa Candida) in Scotland and dedicates it to St. Martin of Tours. 399-410. De Trinitate, by Augustine. 397. Death of St. Martin. 4th-5th century. The "Vatican Vergil"; books 3-4 of the Georgics; books 1-9 of the Aeneid. ca. 400[?] Arianism becomes the creed of the Visigoths, finding a foothold in Western Empire after the capture of Rome in 410. ca. 400. Epidaurus, Greece. Five-aisled basilica with pseudo transept. Illustrations in the best Roman illusionistic style framed by bands of 3 colors, either entire folios or in-text illustrations; text written in capitalis rustica. 400 5TH CENTURY 5TH CENTURY 5TH CENTURY 400-600. Christianity survives in the mountain fastnesses of Wales in the period of Roman retreat. 5th century. Mainz, Germany, St. Alban's church. Box church without apse. beginning, 5th century. Sulpicius Severus (ca. 363- ca. 425) uses the term "Europe" to designate the Christian West, as distinguished from Christian Egypt and Asia. 401. Alaric, king of the Visigoths, invades Italy and is repelled by Stilicho in 402. 5th century. Gerasa (Jerash), Palestine. 5th century(?), Codex Romanus, illustrated with scenes from Bucolics, Georgics, and Aeneid of Vergil; considerably less refined than the Vatican Vergil and more manneristic in style. Exact date controversial. Two Early Christian sanctuaries on axis; cathedral ca. 400, St. Theodore's church 494-496 (I fig. 243). 406-407. Vandals and Suevi invade Gaul. 408. Saxons invade Britain; the last imperial troops withdraw. 5th century. "Vergilius Augusteus" (Georgics, books 1 and 3, fragments). 409. Vandals and Suevi control Spain. Written in an accomplished capitalis rustica, the ms displays the earliest known initials and is therefore of prime importance in the genesis of medieval initial decoration; in considerably more elaborate forms it becomes a principal trait of Hiberno Saxon and Carolingian book illumination. 410. Alaric reappears in Italy and proclaims Attalus emperor (404-410). 410. Sackage of Rome by the Visigoth Alaric. A shattering blow was thus dealt to Roman secular power; the eventual result was to strengthen the position of the church. ca. 400-ca. 450. Abu Mina, Egypt. 404. Rule of St. Pachomius, translated by St. Jerome into Latin from fragmentary sources in Greek and Coptic. Aisled basilica with aisled transept, timber roof. Until the death of emperor Leo I the pope is the de facto ruler of Rome, a title retained de iure by the emperor until the coronation of Charlemagne in 800. 410. De Civitate Dei, by St. Augustine. 410. St. Honoratus founds the monastery of Lerins modeled on group eremitic settlements of Egypt. In this epochal book written after the fall of Rome, Augustine sets forth a new philosophy of history that exerted profound influence on medieval theology and thought. 414. Ataulf succeeds Alaric as king of the Visigoths. 410-454. Confessiones, by St. Augustine. He marries Galla Placidia, daughter of Theodosius the Great; he is assassinated in 415. Autobiographical description of the struggle of Augustine's soul as he progresses from agnosticism to orthodox Christianity. 415. St. John Cassianus, a recluse trained in Palestine and Egypt, founds the abbey of St. Victor in Marseilles. 422-432. Rome, church of Santa Sabina. Timber-roofed basilica; apse directly attached to nave; no transept. 418. Honorius yields Aquitania to the Arian Visigoths of Spain who remain masters of Toulouse until 507. A high-water mark of Roman church building typifying in plan and proportions the new Roman standard basilica of the 5th century. 419-426. De Institutis Monachorum, by Johannes Cassianus. 425 424-434. Ravenna, Italy, church of San Giovanni Evangelista. 428. Vandals take Seville and Carthagena. Aisled basilica without transept; timber roof. In 12 books, a description of monastic customs with which the author was familiar as a monk in Bethlehem, and an anchorite in the Egyptian deserts, for 10 years. 429. Vandals cross Strait of Gibraltar, conquer North Africa, and become a leading maritime power in the Mediterranean. ca. 425. Ravenna, mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Cruciform, barrel-vaulted mausoleum with crossing tower. Although he considers eremitic life to be a heroic ideal, Cassianus provided guidance in practice for establishment of coenobitic monasteries. 430. St. Augustine (born 354) dies during siege of Hippo by Vandals. Galla Placidia married the Visigothic king Ataulf (ca. 413) and went with him to Spain. The design of her mausoleum may have influenced the layout of Visigothic 7th century churches and sepulchral chapels such as Santa Comba de Bande, Spain, (I. 193) and San Fructuoso de Montelios, Portugal. 432. St. Patrick a Romanized Briton (probably trained at Lerins-oriented Auxerre) introduces Egyptian-style eremitism in Ireland, and founds many monasteries and bishoprics. He brings also the Latin language which is soon turned to brilliant scholarly ends in sacred and profane writing. 430-440(?). Hermopolis (Ashmunein), Egypt. Aisled cathedral church; triconch transept. 432-440. Rome, church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Aisled basilica without transept; timber roof (I fig. 174). ca. 434-533. Life of Pather Romanus. 433. Burgundians establish themselves on the upper Rhône between Alps and the Jura Mountains. ca. 440. Deir-el-Abiad (White Monastery), Egypt. This vita includes the first mention of a water-powered monastic mill. Aisled basilica with tri-lobed presbytery. 440-461. Reign of Pope Leo the Great. NOTE II The position of the bishop of Rome begins to develop into the all-embracing office of pope. 444. Armagh, Ireland, monastery founded by St. Patrick. Writing: Parchmentand Vellum parchment is made from the split skin of (usually) sheep. The flesh side is converted to parchment, the wool or hair side is converted by tanning and hair removal to leather (of good quality, "top grain"). 441-450. Angles and Saxons cross the English Channel. Circular enclosure (dia. 140 feet) contains "Great House" (dia. 27 feet), "Kitchen" (dia. 17 feet), and "arbegal" (dia. 7 feet). They complete the conquest of southeast England. Christian Britons withdraw to the west, some emigrating to Ireland and French Brittany (Armorica). ca. 450. Romainmôtier (Kanton Waad), Switzerland, abbey church. 452. Attila, king of the Huns, invades and ravages Gaul. Box church; semicircular and square lateral side chambers at end of nave. VELLUM, as the name indicates, is strictly the skin of a calf, or may be of other animals such as goat and lamb. Unlike parchment, the entire skin, unsplit, is treated by long exposure in lime, hair removed, scraped, then rubbed smooth to a fine surface by abrasive stones such as pumice. Parchment, split and separated from the hair side, is free on both faces from any traces of hide grain or hair marks. The terms parchment and vellum, unfortunately, are commonly used interchangeably without respect to any technical difference of skin composition. Sometimes the finer grades of manufacture or of still-born or newly born animals are called vellum, or occasionally uterine vellum. Such material is quite thin and permits books with hundreds of pages to be formed without excessive or abnormal bulking. 450 Defeated at Chalons by a Romano-Gothic army, he returns to his base in Pannonia. ca. 450. Ephesus, Asia Minor, first church of St. John. 452. Attila invades and ransacks Italy, again returns to Pannonia; dies in 453. Largest Early Christian church of Latin cross plan, formed by aggregation of four basilicas built separately in successive stages against the square martyrion of St. John (I fig. 142). 450-460(?). Corinch-Lechaion, Greece, church of Leonidas. 453. Ripuarian Franks cross the Rhine and advance as far as Trier. Aisled basilica with semicircular apse, tripartite transept; timber roof (I fig. 161). 455. Genseric, king of the Vandals, invades Italy, captures Rome, and empties it of its movable wealth. Even in cuins it is one of the most impressive sights of Early Christian Europe, reaching, after the addition (518-527) on its entrance side of a semi-circular atrium and large rectangular forecourt, the remarkable length of over 610 Byzantine feet. 455. Capture of Trier by the Franks. After thrice previously sacking the city, the Franks take it into permanent possession. before 461. Ireland, "four-cornered oratories" of St. Patrick. VELLUM, having a hair side and flesh side, has a verso and recto, a somewhat yellowish hair side and a whitish flesh side. In the assembly of leaves into gatherings that comprise a codex, leaves were positioned so that hair side faced hair side, flesh side faced flesh side. In this way facing pages of a ms had identical color, surface finish, and appearance of writing (since pen behavior and ink response were not always identical on opposite sides of the same skin). ca. 460. Alamanni settle in Alsatia. Built of timber if available, or of packed earth; average size 10 × 15 feet. 461. Theodoric sent as hostage to Constantinople. 465. Gerasa (Jerash), Palestine, church of Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs. 461. Death of St. Patrick. 463-471. Burgundians occupy territory between the Durance and the plateau of Langres. Aisled cross-in-square church; nave, aisles of equal width; timber roof (I fig. 149.A-B). 468-476. Visigoths under Euric settle in Gaul; Burgundians establish themselves in Lugdunesis Prima. 468-483. Rome, San Stefano Rotondo, martyrium of St. Stephen, perhaps sheltering the relics of the saint. Paper which succeeded parchment and vellum as a material for conveyance of alphabetic writing by mechanical means was destined to exercise influence in the affairs of all society and all its institutions at all levels, that continues to the present. That a simple tangible substance should be of fragility infinitesimal relative to the depth and range of power wielded by it, too, borders on bewilderment. E.B. 475 A colossal cylinder of space, with wide ambulatory intersected with transeptal roofs in the form of a cross; timber roofed. ca. 470. Qualat-Siman, Syria, shrine of St. Simon Stylites. 476. End of the Roman Empire of the West. Four basilicas attached to octagonal martyrium enshrining the pillar of the saint. Romulus Augustulus is dethroned. Odoacar, chief of the Herulii, becomes king of Italy, recognizes the supremacy of the East Roman emperor, and receives the rank of "patrician." 480-529. Qalb Lauzeh, R'safa, Sergiopolis (basilicas A, B.), Tourmanin, Ruwêha, Syria. * ca. 480. Birth of St. Benedict of Nursia (now Norcia, province of Perugia). Group of aisled basilicas without transept apse framed by side chambers; entrances in both facade and flank; timber roofed. NOTE III 481. Odoacar seizes Dalmatia. 485. Southern Syria, monastery of Umm-is-Surab. Basilica with gallery-surmounted aisles; cimber roof; galleried court on northern flank surrounded by monks' buildings; the arrangement anticipates the layout of the classical Carolingian monastery (I fig. 194.A-B). Writing: Paper Technology 481-511. Reign of Clovis, pagan king of the Franks. After about 750, the Moslems in Syria are making paper which by the 9th century is of such fine quality that it is used for literary mss. Westward conquest to Egypt, then across North Africa, finds the Moors making paper in Spain by 1150, and from there, paper moves into France and western Europe. Meanwhile, Moslem conquests in Asia Minor bring contact with Byzantium and Greece, where paper-making does not find extensive use until the 13th century. In Italy in 1276 the manufacture of paper appears in mills at Fabriano, Ancona, and soon afterward mills appear in many other districts and in other countries. 486. Battle of Soissons. 490. Ravenna, Italy, church of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo. concluded on page 208, column 3 Clovis defeats Syagrius, last of the independent Roman governors of Gaul. Syagtius is executed in 487. Timber-roofed aisled basilica without transept. 488. The East Roman emperor Zeno gives Italy to Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. late 5th century. Salonica, Greece, church of St. Demetrius. Theodoric slays Odoacar with his own hand (493) and rules Italy until 526. Latin-cross church; five aisled and galleried in the nave; single aisle surrounding transept and choir; timber roof. 493. Clovis marries Clothilde, a Christian. end 5th century. Bethlehem, Palestine, new church of the Nativity. 494. Clovis extends his domain south of the Loire. Latin-cross church; five-aisled basilica; nave and transept arms terminating in apses; timber roof (I fig. 143). The church is perplexing for its numerous incipient medievalisms; nave and transepts of same width and twice that of each aisle; fore choir repeats dimensions of crossing square. 5th century. Id-Dêr, southern Syria, monastery. Aisled basilica; apse flanked by side chambers; galleried court attached to entrance side with monks' dwellings ranged around it; timber roof (I fig. 194.A-B). concluded from page 207 Antecedent of the layout of Fulda, Cologne, and Kornelismünster. With the presence of a papermaking technology the problem, long a dream of the visionary, of making a machine for reproduction of alphabetic writing in an edition of identical copies in large numbers from a basic ms could fittingly take possession of the mind of a man,—Gutenburg, born ca. 1398, and thereby open a new epoch in the West. While the Moors were making paper in Spain, nearly halfway around the world in China during the Sung Dynasty (960-1126), "the highest development of printing took place with a perfection of technical excellence never surpassed. All forms of literature were printed and much of this fine work remains in public and in private collections" (Dard Hunter, PAPERMAKING, Knopf, New York, 1943). Men make technology, technology remakes men. Remade men remake technology,—ad infinitum. 5th-6th century. Tomarza, Sivri Hissar, Halvadere, Capadocia. Small cruciform churches; barrel vaulted nave and transept; domed crossing (I fig. 148.A-X). 5th-6th century. Tintagel Head, Cornwall, England. Early Celtic monastery with church and scattered groups of buildings, all of rectangular plan. ca. 496. Clovis converts to Christianity urged by his wife and Remigius, bishop of Reims. 5th-6th century. Valais, Switzerland, church of St. Maurice D'Agaune. Thus he acquires church support for all further conquests. Aisled basilica; closed lateral porch; side chambers flanking semicircular apse. 5th-6th century. St. Blaise (Bouches-du-Rhone), France. E.B. Box church with apse and lateral porch. * 5th or 6th century. Tarragona, Spain, church of San Fructuosus. Aisled basilica; lateral side chambers flank semicircular apse. 500 6TH CENTURY 6TH CENTURY 6TH CENTURY 500. Clovis defeats the Burgundians near Dijon. 6th century. Thasos, Macedonia. ca. 500. On the Celestial and Ecclesiastical Hierarchies, by Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite. Cruciform church; aisles surrounding nave, transept, and presbytery (I figs. 94, 144-45). A transferrence to Christian thought of neoplatonic metaphysical speculations, these famous treatises proclaim that life streams from an ultimate source through all mediating orders of celestial and ecclesiastical hierarchies to man, God being at once transcendental and universally immanent. 6th century. Salona, Dalmatia. Cruciform church of the Thasos type (I fig. 146). 505-531. The Visigoths establish themselves in Spain. 6th century. Nikopolis, Greece, basilica A. Aisled basilica with tripartite transept. mid 6th century. Mount Sinai, Egypt, monastery of St. Catherine, built by Emperor Justinian I, the Great. The theory exerted profound influence on medieval metaphysical thought and became an integral part of the metaphysical schemes of William of Auvergne (fig. 187, I.231) and Thomas Aquinas. Aisled basilica with narthex; two closed lateral porches; lateral chambers flanking semicircular apse. early 6th century. The "Vienna Genesis." Thirteen original wooden roof trusses of the basilica nave exist intact, three of which carry invocation inscriptions on behalf of Emperor Justinian and his Empress Theodora and architect Stephanos, indicating the church was commissioned between 548 and 565 (rare circumstance). One of the finest Early Christian manuscripts, illustrated probably in Constantinople with biblical scenes of remarkable freshness. Painted on purple ground in the best illusionistic style of the East; text added in silver uncials and supplying continuous narrative to explain the illustrations. 6th century. Der Tourmanin, Syria. early 6th century. Codex Rossanensis. Aisled, timber-roofed church with narthex and two facade towers. Illuminated Gospel; in style and execution similar to the Vienna Genesis; but more hieratic and in certain illuminations perhaps reflecting the style of wall-painting. The latter motif may have exerted strong influence on the development of the medieval two tower facade. The ms includes a portrait figure of St. Mark, earliest extant prototype for evangelist portraits so popular in Carolingian and later medieval books. ca. 500. Cilicia, Asia Minor, church of Alahan Kilise. 6th century. Liber patrum, by Gregory of Tours. Barrel-vaulted, aisled, bay divided; internal apses in aisles and large internal main apse with side chambers. In a passage referring to the Visigothic ruler Alaric (485-507) Gregory draws attention to the construction of a water-powered monastic mill and observes their advantage: More than twice the size of the others, the center bay is surmounted by a tower which may have influenced the development of crossing towers in certain Carolingian churches. "The work that formerly had to be done by many monks on hand-operated mills (molam manu vertentes) could now be done by a single brother." 507. Clovis defeats the Visigoths at Vouillé. ca. 500. Maastricht, Belgium, Merovingian cathedral. 6th century. Codex Sinopensis. 511-558. Reign of Childebert I, king of the Franks. Rectangular box church, internally divided into three aisles of equal height. Of the same school as the Codex Rossanensis, but less finished in style. 520. St. Benedict founds Montecassino, mother settlement of all Benedictine monasteries. 508-533. Fulgentius of Ruspe (468-533) battles the Vandal Arians with literary compositions used by St. Ambrose against the imperial army, and by St. Augustine against the Donatists; this confrontation may have helped transmit these forms through Visigothic Spain to Ireland. 523-524. Childebert I conquers Burgundy. ca. 525. Constantinople, church of SS Sergios and Bacchos. 525 524. Theodoric, an Arian, orders execution of Boethius for treason. Domed octagon with billowing niches (alternating, square and semicircular) surrounded by aisles and galleries; within a square. 512. The "Vienna Dioscurides." 531-534. Childebert I conquers Thuringia and wrests Aquitania from the Visigoths. Built in elaboration of structural principles first displayed in Constantine's Golden Octagon (327341). A superb copy made for Julia Anicia, wife of the consul Aerobindus, of the 1st century treatise De materia medica (see ca. 50, above). 532-537. Constantinople, church of Santa Sophia. The ms displays many exquisitely colored drawings of medicinal plants, and one of the earliest surviving examples of the portrait of an author (Dioscurides seated in a wicker chair, writing on a scroll)-prototype for the Christian Evangelist portraits. It became a chief source for herbalists of future ages and nations. 535. Goths besiege Rome. A gigantic low curved dome over a monumental central square; attached to it on the east and west two huge domed conches with billowing niches, all within a nearly square space with vaulted ambulatories and galleries; one of the most daring structures of all ages. after 529. Sancti Benedicti Regula Monachorum, by St. Benedict of Nursia. (ca. 480-ca. 543). 536-537. Franks establish themselves in Provence. 539. Franks establish themselves in Italy. Benedict sets forth the tenets of a new form of coenbitic monachism, establishing a common mode of life for all, in which all members of the community were bound in a daily round of duties consisting of common prayer, manual labor, and reading. 540. Byzantines recapture Ravenna. ca. 540. Birth of St. Gregory the Great. First Pope of that name and last of the great fathers of the Latin Church. About 573 prefect of the City of Rome. In 579 resident ambassador at the court of Constantinople, 590 chosen pope by both clergy and people. During his papacy vigorously proclaims the authority of the Roman See over all other sees, even that of the patriarch of Constantinople. In Italy occupies an almost regal position, appointing governors to cities, issuing orders to generals and sending ambassadors to the Lombards negotiating peace. As a strong believer in monasticism St. Gregory protected monks from episcopal oppression. He died in 604 and was buried in the porticus of Old St. Peter's. ca. 532-546. Ravenna, Italy, church of San Vitale. Built along constructional principles of churches of SS Sergios and Bacchos, and Sofia, it is the most outstanding Early Byzantine church built in the Latin West (I. 202). Favored by the Papal See and later by the Carolingian ruling house, the movement profited by rich donations of property and land from barbarian kings and noblemen whose conquest of the former provinces of Rome had brought them unlimited territorial wealth. It was well known to Carolingian visitors to Rome and a principal source of inspiration to the architect of Charlemagne's palace chapel at Aachen. 538-594. History of the Franks, by Gregory of Tours. 550 541-542. Franks establish themselves in Spain. ca. 550. Parenzo, Italy, cathedral. From 573 Bishop of Tours, Gregory was biographer of the lives and miracles of numerous martyrs and church fathers. His lesser writings include a manual for determining the hours of the nocturnal offices by position of the stars. 546. Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, storms and takes Rome. Aisled basilica without transept; natthex and galleried forecourt, before it a baptistry coaxial with the church. 547. St. Benedict of Nursia dies in Montecassino. 550. Totila retakes Rome after a brief occupation by the Byzantines. after 560. Bethlehem, Palestine, church of the Nativity. after 551. Institutiones divinarum et humanarum litterarum, by Cassiodorus Senator (ca. 480-ca. 575). 553. Franks and Alamanni invade North Italy. 555. Cassiodorus returns from exile in Constantinople (540-554). Trefoil transept and chancel replaced the octagon enshrining the cradle of the Nativity within the Constantinian church of ca. 333. This encyclopedia of literature and the arts was written primarily for monks and ardently read and copied in monastic scriptoria. It was of pivotal importance for transmission of ancient knowledge to the Middle Ages. He founds the monastery of Vivarium in his ancestral domain at the bay of Squilace. 560. The Suevi are converted by Martin of Braga. Byzantine armies, having wrested North Africa from the Vandals, take the Bafearics, the Mediterranean coast of Spain, and Murcia, Cordoba, and Cartagena. The Visigoths move their capital inland to Toledo. 563. St. Columba (521-597) flees to Iona, having furtively copied a Gospel book belonging to another believer. 563. St. Columba (Columcille) founds Iona in the Hebrides, which soon becomes a major center of conversion for Scotland. 565. Ephesus, Asia Minor, second church of St. John. His flight is associated with the famous verdict by the judge who arbitrated the dispute: "As the calf belongs to the cow, so the copy belongs to the owner of the original." 568. Lombards invade Italy and settle in the north, thus re-establishing Arianism in Italy. Latin cross plan; domed over nave, transept, and choir; barrel vaults over surrounding aisles and galleries. ca. 570-636. Originum sive etymologiarum libri XX, and Regula monachorum, by Isidore of Seville. ca. 570. Mohammed born. 571-586. Grado, Italy, basilica of Sant' Eufemia. Aisled basilica without transept; side chambers flanking polygonal apse. In clerestory over nave arcades, pilaster strips rise from capitals over each second column, for this period a highly unusual feature. Spanish encyclopedist and historian, opponent of Arianism, archbishop of Seville (609), participant in the councils of Toledo (610, 633), and Seville (619), Isidore made a monumental contribution to medieval learning through the Etymology; his Rule was widely adopted in the monastic life of Spain. 575 575. Sigibert I is murdered. 575 574-604. Life of St. Benedict, by Gregory the Great. 580-590. Lombards sack Montecassino. The monks of Montecassino flee to Rome. There, under tutelage of the popes, Benedictine custom is established as the Italian standard form of monachism. 584. The Frankish king Gunthram I orders construction of a royal guest house with solarium and caminata, providing what appears to be the earliest recorded reference to a corner fireplace with chimney. During these years Gregory reformed liturgy and church music, and wrote numerous commentaries on contemporary religious doctrine. 589. Council of Toledo condemns Arianism. 590-604. Pope Gregory the Great establishes the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. 586. Rabbula Gospels, written and illuminated by the monk Rabbula. Superseding even the powers of the patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory acquires unprecedented secular powers and steps boldly into the gap left by the emperors as Rome collapsed. 594-604. Rome, Old St. Peter's, new crypt. Earliest extant Syriac codex, related to the Rossano Gospels but less refined in style and with distinctly more Syrian traits. Pope Gregory the Great raises the floor of the presbytery; beneath it he makes Peter's sepulchral monument accessible to pilgrims by a semicircular corridor crypt, first of its kind and prototypal for many to follow (I fig. 154.B). 597. Gregory sends St. Augustine to England. The raised-floor presbytery is used in the Plan of St. Gall. Landing at Thanet Augustine is welcomed by Saxon King Ethelbert of Kent and his Christian wife, Bertha. Augustine founds the first Benedictine settlement out of Italy in England at Canterbury, the capital of Ethelbert, which to this day remains the metropolis of the Church of England. 597. Canterbury, England, church of SS Peter and Paul. 6th-7th century. The heavy colter plow (probably of Asiatic origin) begins to replace the traditional Roman scratch plow (also used by the Celts). Box church with semicircular apse, narthex and closed lateral porches; founded by St. Augustine (I fig. 244). The scratch plow, a simple vertical stick, left a wedge of undisturbed earth between furrows, thus making cross plowing a necessity (which tended to create square fields). Wet and heavy alluvial soils of the North called for more powerful equipment. The colter plow, with colter, share, and mould board, tilled so effectively that the need for cross plowing was eliminated, tending to produce long, narrow fields. late 6th century. Echmiadzin Gospels. 6th-7th century. Establishment in Western agriculture of principles of crop rotation. Eastern in iconography and of a distinctly Syrian linear style. A three-field system allows two thirds of all arable land to be under continuous cultivation, thereby eliminating the need to search for new land to replace exhausted soil, and encouraging establishment of villages, and growth of population. before 597. Altus prosator, by St. Columba. In each three-field group, one was sown with winter wheat, one with barley, oats, and beans, one lay fallow. By this means the soil was not exhausted, and its productivity increased even beyond gains made by use of the colter plow the deep furrows of which provided drainage and access to minerals in deeper layers of soil. late 6th century. Antalya, Asia Minor. A versified digest of the Christian faith; each strophe starts with the successive letter of the alphabet. Cross-in-square church with arms of equal width and strong modulat implications; timber roof. 6th-7th century. Establishment in agricultural practice of pooling of draft animals, and human effort. Adoption of the colter plow leads to formation of cooperative agricultural communities and the emergence of the medieval manor. The scratch plow required one yoke of oxen. The heavy colter plow required four (i.e., 8 oxen). Few peasants could support so many draft animals alone. From the communal use of animals emerged a cooperative system in which all arable land was held in common, and divided into strips apportioned to individuals according to the contribution each made with his ox teams. 6th-7th century. Development of Insular script. Irish monks, copying the half-uncial script of Late Antique manuscripts, developed this new script, soon adopted by the English. 600 7TH CENTURY 7TH CENTURY 7TH CENTURY 7th century(?). Zamora, Spain, San Pedro de Nave. 7th century. Province of León, Spain. Evidence survives of use of water-powered trip hammers used for forging iron in Fructuosan monasteries of León. Aisled, Latin-cross pillar basilica; crossing tower, rectangular apse; principal spaces barrel vaulted. 7th century(?). Annait, Isle of Skye, Hebrides, early Irish hermitage. Rectangular oratory and three circular dwellings. 7th century(?). St. Macdara's Island, County Galway, Ireland, St. Macdara's church. Oratory with antae imitating in masonry the shape and structural features of cruck-built timber churches. 7th century(?). Skellig Michael, Kerry, Ireland. Corbel vaulted oratory, six "beehive" dwellings. (Small island offshore about 9 miles.) [Comments of general, a few somewhat technical, character, set in italic type, occurring in the Writing column (3) and appearing on several pages of this chronology, derive from several sources, including Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, David Diringer, Edward Johnston, Graily Hewitt, S. H. Steinberg, Alfred Fairbank, Daniel Berkeley Updike, Beatrice Ward. 7th century(?). Inishmurry Island, Sligo, Ireland. Monastery with square oratories and "beehive" dwellings; a converted pre-Christian ring fort (I fig. 195). beginning, 7th century. Ardward Isle, Kircudbright, Scotland, hermitage. The several remarks and this parenthetic note, addressed to the general reader, are prompted by an impression that, except for learned specialist and scholar, few are aware of the great wonder inherent in, or even that constitutes, letters and writing, in particular alphabetic writing. Small rectangular timber church; circular dwelling. 7th century. Escomb, Durham, England. Box church with rectangular apse. That the workings of one mind, thought, can be communicated to others by the visual device, writing, is central to the wonder. That with so few letters (Greek 24; Roman 23; Arabic 28) thoughts can be expressed of naive simplicity, enormous complexity, and abstruseness in a wide range of shades of meaning, degrees of precision, vagueness, emotions and feelings to satisfy needs of people in all walks of life,-makes writing a thing that fades away beyond the outermost reaches of comprehension. Yet, despite the profoundness of its nature,-writing, omnipresent it seems, taken for granted, so `understood', each day is passed by with indifference and without heed. 7th century. Spain: foundation of monasteries of Isidoran plan (none survive). 601-604. Augustine is Primate of England. Isidore (ca. 470-636) required that the cells of monks be next to the church, suggesting a layout similar to that of the 4th-century Tebessa. The plan includes: cellar, refectory, infirmary within, and a villa (for crafts and agriculture) without the monastic enclosure. 602. Frankish bishops accuse St. Columban of keeping Easter according to Celtic usage. Because of this, and his unremitting rebuke of the immoral court and life of Theodoric II and Brunhilde his mother, he is forcibly removed from Luxeuil and with 12 other monks withdraws to Switzerland to preach to the Suevi and Alamanni. One Gallus goes with him. 7th century. Orense, Spain, church of Santa Comba de Bande. Cross-in-square plan; nave and transept arms barrel-vaulted; crossing groin-vaulted; prototype for Germigny-des-Prés(?). (I figs. 151.Xa-c.) ca.600. Worms, Germany, Merovingian cathedral. Works under Writing (items listed, mostly in Latin script) to illustrate its development in the West, are but a few of a great body that survive in several languages, in some degree complete or fragmentary, but, taken collectively and in some cases individually, they bear ringing testimony to writing as perhaps the greatest force in advancing civilization on this planet. (Following Latin, Arabic is the second most extensively used alphabet today). 612. Columban founds Bobbio in Northern Italy and dies there in 615. Aisled basilica without transept; rectangular apse flanked by side chambers; built on site of the Roman forum of Worms. ca.612. Gallus (St. Gall, born ca. 550) founds a cell on the Steinach, a tributary of Lake Constance. after 602. Near Bregenz, Austria on east end of Lake Constance. Gallus was left behind by Columban because of illness; his foundation later became the famous abbey of St. Gall. Columban establishes Irish-style community of probably round cells around a rectangular timber oratory, with 12 companions, among them a monk named Gallus. "Without writing, culture, which has been defined as `communicable intelligence', would not exist (except, perhaps, in a form so rudimentary as to be virtually unrecognizable)" (Diringer). Writing is then a measure by which to measure culture. 616. King Aethelfrith of Northumbria is defeated and slain during a revolt of the native Britons. 612. Steinach River, Switzerland (tributary to Lake Constance). It is not difficult to understand how, at certain periods and stages of man's evolving development, writing has been viewed as magic, and among some, held to be a benefaction divine.] E.B. 625 Expelled, his son Oswald takes refuge in the monastery of Iona where he is baptized and educated. Timbered oratory and community established by St. Gall (later to develop into the famous monastery). * 617. Northumbria, under King Edwin, reverts to paganism. 630-646. Vagharshapat, Armenia, church of St. Gayané. after 615. Life of St. Columban, by Jonas. 627. King Edwin converts to Christianity. Cross-in-square plan; domed, barrel vaulted; typical for Armenian churches in later periods (I fig. 151.A-B). Contains the earliest known occurrence of the term dormitorium designating a communal monastic sleeping room (see Glossary, s.v.). 629-639. Reign of Dagobert I, king of the Franks. 630-655. Galicia, Spain (and northern Portugal), monasteries at Compludo, Rufia, Visonia, Leone, San Salvadore de Montelios, and others, established by Saint Fructuosus (none survive). ca.625. Cathach of St. Columba. Earliest ms to treat initials as display characters emerging from and receding into the body of the text at increasing or diminishing scale-a feature that became a distinctive trait of Hiberno-Saxon book illumination. 632. Mohammed dies. 633. Oswald defeats and slays the British king Cadwallon and reconquers Northumbria. 640. Nivelles, Belgium, abbey. ca.640. Death of St. Gall. Box church with rectangular apse founded by mother of St. Gertrude, who succeeded her in 562. 630-635. Regula monachorum, and Regula communis, by St. Fructuosus. His body is deposited in a tomb between the altar and wall (inter aram et pariatem) of the oratory of his settlement. 649. Seine-Maritime, France, foundation of Fontanella by St. Wandrille. Two rules for monks adopted in monasteries of northern Portugal and Galicia, in Spain; from them it can be inferred that monks slept in a common dormitory under supervision of a prior. 639-644. Arab conquest of Egypt. Box church 290 feet long; 37 feet wide; 4 subsidiary churches; monastic structures scattered, Irish-fashion, through the grounds. 642. Oswald is defeated and slain by Penda, pagan king of Mercia. ca.650. Durham Gospels, Fragment I. 650 This ms was written in Lindisfarne. 650 653. St. Aidan establishes Lindisfarne on the coast of Northumbria; it becomes the center of conversion for northern England. ca. 650 or 700. Church Island, Kerry, Ireland. ca. 650. Hisperica famina. 653. The Lombards convert to Christianity. Hermitage with circular wooden hut (dia. 6m); oratory (2 × 3m); later replaced by masonry structures of similar design. A collection of mannered poetry written by foreign secular students who came to Ireland to study in monastic schools. 654. King Penda slain by Oswin of Northumbria. Penda's son Peada and a daughter marry into the Christian royal house of Northumbria. 650-800. Warendorf, Westphalia, Germany. They wrote a Celtic form of language (Hisperic Latin) in which Hebrew, Greek, Vulgar Latin, and words of unknown origin are so esoterically mixed that even the most adept students of this language run into impenetrable phrases. Site of important settlement (186 timber structures) for history of northern vernacular architecture (II figs. 325-26). 655-656. Aethelhere, pagan king of the Angles and former ally of King Penda, is killed in combat. ca. 655. Seine-Maritime, France, foundation of Jumièges, by St. Philibert. 654. Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, England. Burial site. ca. 655-660. Oswio (Oswy, Oswey, Oswiu, Oswin) king of Northumbria (ca. 612-670) founds monastery of Whitby. Cruciform church; 4 minor sanctuaries; guest-house; and two-storied structure of remarkable size (50 × 290′) containing refectory and cellar on ground floor, with monks' domitory above. Probably the grave of Anglo-Saxon king Athelhere, it contained a mastless clinkerbuilt oared boat 80 feet long, filled with lavishly decorated artifacts, many solid gold. 657-661. Queen Balthilde, wife of Clovis II, founds Corbie on royal demesnes, after the custom of Columban. 657. Whitby, Yorkshire, England, monastery. Their ornamentation of incerlaced beasts and checkerboard pattern reflect a stylistic tradition that formed one of the main sources of the Book of Durrow and the Lindisfarne Gospels. 664. Synod of Whitby declares in favor of Roman vs Irish observance with regard to the Easter calendar and other conflicting rites. Box church surrounded by scattered rectangular houses. 661. San Juan de Baños, Palencia, Spain. 658-680. The Caedmon Poems. This turn of events was critical for the ultimate ascendancy of the Benedictine over the Celtic mission. Wilfrith of York led the debate. Aisled basilica of nearly square (10.85 × 11m) plan; rectangular porch, narrow transept; 3 rectangular barrel-vaulted chapels. Striking early examples of the adoption in the Christian poetry of Ireland of such artistic patterns as alliteration, stress, and beat, as well as a variety of compositional pauses common in the oral traditions of both Germanic and Celtic peoples. 665-666, 671-672. Benedict Biscop founds Monkwearmouth and Jarrow near Durham, centers of conversion for northern England. before 665. Braga, north Portugal, church of San Salvadore de Montelios. Cruciform chapel; domed tower; mansonry-vaulted arms; founded by St. Fructuosus. In subsequent centuries, their amalgamation with Ambrosian and Augustinian forms of literary composition leads to an artistic expression that eventually peaks in the creation of rhyme and scansion. 668-690. Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury, imposes Roman liturgy. 671. Kairouan, Tunisia, founded by Sidi Okba ibn Nafi. He brings the African Hadrian of Miridanum to England, as well as Benedict Biscop, who for some years was a monk at Lerins. 671-672. Jarrow, Durham, England, monastery. 679-704. Life of St. Columban, and De locis sanctis, by Adamnan, abbot of Iona. 672/673. Birth of The Venerable Bede, great English historian and theologian. Saxon box church; large buildings sited parallel to the church. No evidence of four-cornered cloister. The latter, a treatise, includes descriptions and plans of churches of the Holy Land based on an oral account of the Frankish bishop, Arculf who visited the Holy Land ca. 680 and, blown off course, was shipwrecked in Ireland. Adamnan's work was copied by Walahfrid Strabo (see I, 5355, figs. 41-42). His relatives gave him at age 7 to Benedict Biscop (and afterward to Crolfrid) to be educated in the twin monasteries of St. Peter and St. Paul at Wearmouth and Jarrow. 674. Wearmouth, Durham, England, monastery. Saxon box church and other scattered buildings, both rectangular and circular; founded by Benedict Biscop. Bede spends his entire life in these monasteries studying (with aid of Benedict Biscop's superb library) scripture, theological, and historical writing. He dies there in 735 at age 59. 675. Abbington, Oxfordshire, England, early Irish monastery. 675 673. Relics of St. Benedict of Nursia transferred to Fleury (St.-Benôit-sur-Loire). A circular enclosure (dia. 120 feet) containing 12 round dwellings for monks; 12 small oratories; a church; outside near the entrance, a parlor. ca. 680. Book of Durrow. 676. St. Cuthbert builds himself a hermitage on Farne Island off the Northumbrian coast. 676. Farne Island, Northumbria, England, hermitage of St. Cuthbert. The earliest of the fully decorated Hiberno-Saxon Gospel books to incorporate canon tables; ornamental (diaper) pages of decorative motifs preceding each Gospel, followed by a folio illustrating each Evangelist's symbol in a decorative frame; monumental embellished initials opening the text of each Gospel (often nearly the full height of the folio); also the first ms to combine Celtic and Germanic ornaments not yet integrated, and therefore in their earliest state of development. 678. Wilfrith of York makes a first attempt to evangelise Friesland. Circular enclosure with diameter of "4 to 5 poles." 680. Pepin of Heristal becomes mayor at the palace of the Austrian Franks. 7th-8th century(?). Reask, Dingle Peninsula, Ireland, monastery. 684. St. Cuthbert becomes bishop of Lindisfarne. Within a circular enclosure, a rectangular oratory; "beehive" huts single and conjoined; all of dry masonry. 686. St. Cutbbert resigns his bishopric at Lindisfarne and withdraws to Farne Island. Only surviving example on the mainland of a once common type of monastery. Cuthbert dies on Farne Island in 687. 687. Pepin of Heristal attacks and defeats a Neustrian army near St. Quentin and becomes sole master of the Frankish kingdom. 7th-8th century. Illauntannig, Magharee Islands, Kerry, Ireland, monastery. late 7th century. Codex Amiatinus. Copy by a Northumbrian monk of a lost illuminated 6th century ms of the Institutiones of Cassiodorus presumably brought to Jarrow by Benedict Biscop. 695. Pepin routs the Frisians who retreat across the Rhine. Converted ring fort with rectangular oratory; "beehive" huts with corbelled vaults; in dry masonry. 696. Willibrord forms the bishopric of Utrecht. It was well known to the illuminator of the Lindisfarne Gospels, whose portrait figure of St. Matthew is modeled after the seated portrait figure of the prophet Ezra in this codex. 698. Willibrord founds the monastery of Echternach near Trier. 7th-8th century. Castelseprio, Italy, church of Santa Maria Foris Portas. Issuing from York, he carries the Benedictine mission into the territory of the Frisians. Architecturally insignificant rectangular sanctuary; entrance porch and apse on three other sides; on grounds of former summer residence of the archbishop of Milan. ca. 698. Lindisfarne Gospels. The most accomplished of all early Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts, combining the best of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon decorative tradition. The modest church contains one of the most fascinating early medieval cycles of frescoes illustrating the childhood of Christ-a summit of religious wall painting. Their date is controversial. Exhibiting an intensive process of linear transformation, its portraits of seated Evangelists use the illusionist tradition of Late Antique illuminated mss, as seen in the Codex Amiatinus. According to a late but trustworthy tradition this ms was written and illuminated by the Anglo-Saxon Eadfrith, bishop of Lindisfarne (698-721), perhaps in connection with or soon after the transfer of the bones of St. Cuthbert to a reliquary shrine in 698. 8TH CENTURY 8TH CENTURY 8TH CENTURY 700 711-713. Arabs conquer Spain. 8th century(?). Inishmore, Aran Islands, Ireland, Temple McDuag and Temple Benen. 712-744. Reign of Luitbrand, greatest king of the Lombards, who rejects Arianism. Masonry churches imitating shape and structural details of earlier cruck-built timber churches. 716-719. Lex Alamannorum. 717-741. Charles Martel succeeds his father Pepin II. Codification of Alamannic law laid down by an assembly of dukes, counts, and bishops under the presidency of Duke Lantfrid I. He unifies Neustrian and Austrian Franks and forces many other Germanic tribes to recognize his suzerainty. early 8th century. Pier, Cologne, Germany, church of St. Martin. His military success is enhanced by the organization of a heavy cavalry, its abilities apparently strengthened by use of stirrups, a Eurasian invention unknown to the Greeks and Romans. Stirrups were in common use in Germanic territories of the West by the 4th century; in China and Korea by the 5th; in Japan and the Byzantine empire by the 6th. Small aisled church, rectangular apse; timber built; probably common in Merovingian-Carolingian countryside. It is an important source for the description of Almannic house construction (see II, 26-27). 8th century. St. Gervais, Geneva, Switzerland. Fortified Carolingian villa clearly influenced by the layout of the Roman castrum (I fig. 72). The device enabled a horseman to stand firm, thus employing the full inertia of his body and that of his mount against adversaries without himself being thrown to the ground by the impact. This made cavalry a formidable weapon of shock attack. ca. 700. Pfalzel, near Trier, Germany. 719. Charles Martel becomes mayor at the Frankish palace. Cruciform, timber-roofed church; may derive from Cappadocian churches of similar design (I fig. 148.C). In this capacity he attacks the Saxons, Bavarians, and Frisians in campaigns between 719-732, forcing them to submit to Frankish rule. ca. 700. Regensburg, Germany, church of Niedermünster. 719. Narbonne taken by Saracens. Box church with rectangular apse. 719. Otmar assumes abbacy of monastic settlement that had arisen around the tomb of St. Gall. 720-721. Saracens take Toulouse. 700-1000. Leens, Groningen, The Netherlands. Site of aisled Germanic houses with turf walls. 723-724. Windfrid of Wessex, called Boniface, preaches among the heathen of Hesse and Thuringia, consolidating his mission by founding Benedictine monasteries. 706. Echternach, Germany, abbey church of St. Willibrord. Box church with rectangular apse; behind altar is site of first burial of the saint. 723. Charles Martel gives Boniface safeconduct for missions in Thuringia, Alemannia, and Bavaria. 724 and after. Reichenau, Mittelzell, Germany, church of SS Mary, Peter and Paul. 725-731. Arabs take Carcassonne and plunder Autun. Box church with rectangular apse. 725 726. Byzantine emperor Leo III issues edict against image worship. 727. Pope Gregory II denounces as impious the edict of Leo III against image worship. 731. Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, by Bede. ca. 730. Birth of Alcuin. He is educated in York under Aethelbert. after 726. Dorestadt, The Netherlands, site of Carolingian castellum (I fig. 72). By this work the Venerable Bede justly earned the title, "Father of English History." 732. Charles Martel defeats Arabs at Moussais-laBataille near Poitiers. Less original (more obviously based on earlier, still surviving compositions) historical works are his History of the Abbots (after 716), and Shorter and Longer Chronicles (703; 725) embodied in his computistical treatises in which he addressed himself to the bitter controversy between the Roman and Celtic churches about the ecclesiastical and civil calendars. As mayor at the Merovingian court he acquired powers exceeding those of the king. Victory at Poitiers was decisive for the future course of history, comparable with the defeat of Attila at Chalons in 452. 732. Martel begins to confiscate church property for distribution to his vassals. He does this to strengthen his military forces by attractive rewards of property, a system from which the feudal fief originated. His sons Carloman and Pepin pursue this policy even more ruthlessly. His hagiographical works include two lives of St. Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, one in verse (a form normally used for scholastic instruction) and one in prose (a form used for lections in Office). Pope Zacharias acquiesces because of the danger presented to the Franks by Saracens, Saxons, and Frisians ("pro eo quod nunc tribulatio accidit Saracinorum, Saxonum vel Fresconum"). Bede's latest exposition, his Epistle to Egbert, Archbishop of York, was finished in 734, only six month before his own death. The aggregate of Bede's writings, more than half of them exegetical, adequately summarize all the learning of Western Europe available at his time. 738. Death of St. Willibrord. 739. Luitbrand, king of the Lombards, besieges Rome. Pope Gregory III invokes aid of Charles Martel against them, promising him the Roman consulate-beginning of a new papal policy. 740-745. Lex Bajuvariorum. 741. Charles Martel dies at Quiercy. Codification of Bajuvarian law compiled at a time when their territory was already controlled by the Franks. He is buried in the royal abbey of St. Denis; his realm is divided between his sons Pepin the Younger and Carloman. It contains detailed references to the component members of the Bajuvarian standard house (see II, 27-33). 741-754. St. Boniface influences state policies. Between the death of Charles Martel and his own in 754, Boniface is the most powerful churchman east of the Rhine. Cooperating with Carloman and Pepin the Younger, and popes Gregory II and III, he prepares ground for alliance of the Carolingian monarchy and the papacy. 742. Pepin the Younger and Carloman subjugate Aquitanians and Alamanni. 742. Birth of Charlemagne. 742-766. Chrodegang, bishop of Metz, founds the abbeys of Gorze (748), Gengenbach (761), and Lorsch (764). 743. Concilium Germanicum convoked by house mayor Carloman (son of Charles Martel). It places the church of Austria under the tutelage of St. Boniface and orders the return of alienated acclesiastical property. 743-751. Reign of Childeric III, last Merovingian king. 744. Synod of Estinnes (Henegau) binds Frankish monachism to the Rule of St. Benedict. 744. Fulda, Thuringia, Germany, monastery founded by Sturmi. 744. Synod of Soissons attaches the church of Neustria to the whole of the Christian church. Small basilica; western crypt (details unknown); cloister to the south of the church. 747. Carloman resigns his office; Pepin the Younger becomes sole ruler as mayor of the Franks. 747. Otmar establishes Benedictine rule in St. Gall, by order of Pepin the Younger. after 747. St. Gall, Switzerland, monastery of St. Gall, church of St. Otmar. In the same year he falls from favor in conflict with Sidonius, bishop of Constance, and several local lords over property rights and abbatial jurisdiction. He is made captive, banished to the isle of Werd in the Rhine, and dies there in 759. Aisled church with crypt; in 830 demolished by Gozbert. 750 ca. 750. Birth of Benedict of Aniane. 751. Lombards capture Rome. ca. 750. A Spanish source written shortly after the battles of Tours and Poitiers (732) refers to all combatants following Charles Martel as "Europeans" (Europeenses); whereas the invading Moslems are described as living in the Orient and Occident (Orientis et Occidentis). 751. Pepin the Younger [King Pepin the Short] deposes Childeric III. With approval of Pope Zacharias Pepin assumes the crown in a ceremony conducted at Soissons by St. Boniface. 752-759. Septimania is reconquered by Pepin the Younger. 754. Pope Stephen II annoints Pepin the Younger king at Paris, together with his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. 758. Ms of the writings of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite is presented to King Pepin by Pope Paul I. ? The Carolingian Dynasty officially begins. Translated into Latin by Hilduin of St. Denis (819-840/44) and again by Johannes Scottus Erigena (ca. 858), this great metaphysical vision became a source of boundless fascination to medieval theologians. ca. 754. Chrodegang, bishop of Metz, establishes a new rule for his clergy to regulate their common life as canons. * Shortly afterward the Roman mass replaces the Gallican liturgy at Metz. 756. Pepin the Younger enters Italy. The purpose of writing is to be read, hence legibility is one of its essential features. `Legibility is not an abstraction'. It is, though, subjective and criteria for its evaluation include purpose (how and where is it to be used), the materials used, and a capacity for response to change with the times. The history of writing identifies with the rapidity of its execution, in short, speed. 756. Death of Aistulf, king of the Lombards, who also in this year beseiged Rome. 759. Narbonne retaken from Arabs by Pepin the Short. ca. 760. Pope Paul I urges Pepin the Younger to adopt Roman liturgy for all the Gallican church, furnishing him with the Antiphony and Responsorial. 765-775. Lorsch, Germany, monastery of Gundeland. Box church with rectangular apse. SPEED, the rate at which a script is written, is inseparable from components of legibility, appropriateness and,-the evasive and tantalizing abstraction of beauty. In a Book of Kells, speed, certainly present, was the tiniest of its ingredients, whereas to an Alcuin at Aachen in the later part of the same century in a momentous period in the West, engaged in far reaching reforms (some aspects of which would penetrate a thousand years into the future), endeavoring to assist in uniting an Empire in a pressing program of systematized writing as an agent of fusion, speed was a criterion: but not to the exclusion of beauty,-re- 764. Foundation of first monastery of Lorsch by Chrodegang. Conversion of Roman villa rustica to monastic use; monastic buildings around 3 sides of a central court. Earliest example of its kind in Carolingian Europe (I figs. 198-99). after 768/69. Neustadt-am-Main, Germany, Savior's Church. 768. Death of the brothers Pepin the Younger and Carloman (sons of Charles Martel). Cruciform cellular structure; arms of nearly equal length; disengaged crossing; incipient modularity (I figs. 133, 167). concluded on page 215, column 3 769. Charlemagne is crowned king of the Franks at Noyon. 768-774. Lorsch, Germany, abbey of Lorsch "Torhalle". 781-783. Godescalc Gospels. Like his father he maintains close contact with the papal see in ecclesiastical policies. He becomes the foremost champion of ecclesiastical romanization in the barbarian territories of transalpine Europe. A jewel of Carolingian architecture surviving in an impeccable state of preservation, it was built in the shape of a Roman triumphal arch carrying over its passages a large hall that may have served as aula regia to the visiting emperor or as audience hall for the abbot. First link in the chain sumptuously illustrated Gospels of the Court School, it was written by the scribe Godescalc at command of Charlemagne and his wife Hildegarde, as attested in a dedicatory poem introducing the miniscule script newly adopted at the Carolingian court, which became the basis of the modern Roman alphabet. Liturgical parts of the book are written in uncials, headings in Roman capitals. The large opening initials of each Gospel derive from Hiberno-Saxon mss; figures of the Evangelists and many illusionistic elements derive clearly from an Italo-Byzantine source. 769. Relics of St. Otmar transferred to the abbey of St. Gall and deposited in the crypt of the basilica built by him. 771. Death of his brother Carloman makes Charlemagne sole ruler of the Franks. The external relief of pilasters and capitals as well as the interior wall decoration of the hall are remarkably classical in style and mark, together with the illuminations of the Godescalc Gospels (771-773) the first exuberant phase of the Carolingian revival of classical forms. 772-774. Reign of Desiderius, king of the Lombards, who takes title "Patrician of the Romans." 772-804. Charlemagne's Saxon wars. 772-795. Rome, S. Maria in Cosmedin, crypt. ca. 787. De emendatione librorum (encyclical). A series of ferocious wars with the Saxons ends with total submission, and conversion of Saxony. A noncharacteristic Early Christian hall crypt owing its unusual shape to its service as a repository for an entire collection of relics (I fig. 153. A-B). Charlemagne recommends Alcuin's edition of the Vulgate to the Frankish bishops. 774. Charlemagne besieges Pavia, proclaims himself king of the Lombards. 774. Salzburg, Austria, dedication of cathedral. 789. Capitulary issued by Charlemagne. He makes his first visit to Rome, is proclaimed "Patricius Romanorum," and guarantees the papacy its ancient and lawful possessions in Italy. Aisled basilica; no transept; semicircular apse attached directly to nave. It decrees the use of the Gregorian chant brought north to the Frankish kingdom (ca. 750) at the initiative of Pepin II. 775. Paris, France, abbey church of St. Denis consecrated. * 775 concluded from page 214 777. Monastery of Lorsch transferred to a more suitable site, a short distance from the first foundation. Aisled basilica; westwork; continuous transept; first in a long line of Carolingian churches to revive the layout of Old St. Peter's in Rome (I fig. 166.X). flect on the great Caroline script (Fig. 524, p. 12). This hand culminated in a blend of a new minuscule with majuscule, minuscules carrying the burden of message. Uncouthness and archaism in regional hands of the time disappear as new minuscule teams with majuscule. The old Roman half-uncial and minuscule hand are restudied, reworked, transformed into the CAROLINE SCRIPT which was to gain supremacy during the 9th and 10th centuries in Europe (and affect Insular usage). 778. Charlemagne begins his battle with Arab Spain. 777. Paderborn, Germany, church of SS Peter and Paul. After serious setbacks, most notably the defeat of his rear guard at Roncevaux, the campaign culminates in the establishment of the Spanish March. Box church with rectangular apse. 779-780. Benedict of Aniane founds monastery of Aniane. 780. Adalbard becomes abbot at monastery of Corbie. By the 13th century a `standard' Caroline script took on diverse regional and national characteristics as the dynastic organization and authority of Charlemagne disappeared, followed by political disruption and Norse invasions. Grandson of Charles Martel and first cousin to Charlemagne [that is Martel is grandfather of Adalbard and of Charlemagne. See GENEAOLOGY p. 127), with whom he was educated at the palace school. Adalbard made Corbie a training ground for noblemen, at times supporting a military contingent of 350-400 knights (miles christi). Of several offshoots of the Caroline script two are clearly discernable, one of which, through successive development and including mergence with printing later, would endure to the present wherever the Latin alphabet was used as the writing vehicle. Both hands are referred to as black letter. 781. Pope Hadrian annoints Charlemagne's sons Carloman and Louis kings of Italy and Aquitaine, at the ages of 3 and 4. 781. Alcuin is called by Charlemagne (whom he met at Parma) to the court as an educator. One, of pronounced angularity, was adopted north of the Alps, the Low Countries, and England. In Germany this evolved into the "fractur" of the printer. The other variety, characterized by roundness of form, descendant of antique models, budded in Italy and blossomed. A letter of illustrious beauty, it spread throughout Europe and England. With the rise of the humanistic minuscule in the Rinascimento, and appearance of punchcutter and printer, it was embraced by the presses of north Italy. At this period the slanting type, italic, an outstanding innovation in the history of alphabetic writing was created by Francisco da Bologna for Aldo's Vergil of 1501. 781-782. Charlemagne makes second visit to Rome. 781-796. Alcuin heads the palace school in which the emperor's children and those of his nobles were educated. 784-804. Lorsch, Germany, church of abbot Richbold. ca. 787. Charlemagne officially recommends Alcuin's edition of the Vulgate to the Frankish bishops in his encyclical De emendatione librorum. Aisled basilica; rectangular apse; westwork preceded by open court accessible through gate flanked by towers (I figs. 200-201). 787. Charlemagne, at Capua and Benevento, forces the Duke of Benevento to recognize his sovereignty. The face used for text type of these volumes derives from the round form black letter and its entry into Venetian printing (COLOPHON p. 266). By comparison with most trade books their pages are notable for strength of `color', a haunting remote savour of a great period at Aachen and a man of genious at Tours on the Loire, Alcuin. E.B. 787-789. Charlemagne orders establishment of monastic and cathedral schools. 788. Charlemagne incorporates Bavaria into the kingdom of the Franks and conquers Istria. 789. Charlemagne issues the Admonitio generalis reaffirming adoption of the Roman liturgy by his father Pepin the Younger. * He orders it extended to all territories under Frankish control, directing every bishop to test the theological education of his priests, and to establish reading schools everywhere. 790-799. St. Riquier, Centula, France, church and cloister of Angilbert. ca. 790. Modular verse of Paul the Deacon. Aisled basilica; westwork; eastern transept, extended choir; earliest Carolingian church laid out in modular sequence of squares. A clear example of Carolingian modular verse in rhyme and measured stress, a phenomenon comparable to the emergence in the same period of modular concepts in architecture. ca. 791. Charlemagne appoints Angilbert councilors and abbot of St. Riquier. Einhard appears at court shortly thereafter and becomes friend, counsellor, and biographer of Charlemagne. Two smaller churches, one circular and one rectangular in the corners of the vast triangular cloiser yard; claustral structures sited within (not around) this enclosure (I figs. 135, 168, 196-197). 791-805. Charlemagne secures the eastern boundaries of the empire. 791-817. Fulda, Thuringia, Germany, church of Ratger. 791. Libri Carolini. He makes several expeditions against the Avarii along the Theiss and Danube, and imposes tribute on the Bohemians. Pannonia is converted to Christianity. Monumental aisled basilica; vigorously projecting continuous transept; semicircular apse in the west; modeled after Old St. Peter's in Rome, but with evidence of modular planning in dimensions of nave and transept (I fig. 169). A proclamation drafted for Charlemagne, probably by Bishop Theodulph of Orléans, setting forth the response of the Frankish church to readmission of the veneration of images by the Council of Nicea in 787. 793. Lindisfarne plundered by Norsemen; its monks flee with the body of St. Cuthbert. 794-795. Capitulare de villis. 794. Council of Frankfurt. Ordinance issued by Charlemagne to curtail mismanagement of royal estates and regulate their future conduct. Charlemagne refutes image worship restored in 787 at the Council of Nicea, with arguments set forth in the Libri carolini (789-791). 796-805. Aachen, palace grounds of Charlemagne. Site of Roman Aquae Granis; on a tract 360′ × 626′ were: emperor's audience hall (north); palace chapel (south); site divided by covered corridor into inner and outer courts (I fig. 71.Y). The enumeration and descriptions of the various houses found on these estates are vitally important for the history of house construction in the kingdom of the Franks (see II, 33ff). 796-805. Aachen, palace chapel of Charlemagne. Octagonal center space surrounded by 16-sided ambulatory with superincumbent gallery reached by 2 staircases; preceded by atrium; flanked by two structures, a royal vestiary (north) and a meeting room (south) (I figs. 71.Za-c). ca. 795. Epitaph for Pope Adrian I (†795), Rome, porch of St. Peter's. Lapidary inscription, slab size 2.20m. high, 1.17m. wide, cut in Belgian Black marble (Namur bassin, near Aachen), letters gilded. Made on order of Charlemagne, possibly initiated by Alcuin, then sent to Rome. 796. Alcuin becomes abbot of St. Martin in Tours and establishes a flourishing school there. 799-806. St. Benoit-sur-Loire, France, church of Germigny-des-Prés. The lapidary inscription in capitales quadrata, strongly influenced by fine Roman precedent, projects vigorous character of its own, is clearly lapidary, strongly independent of manuscript style. end, 8th century. Benedictine rule is so completely established that all others have sunk into oblivion. Small cross-in-square church; tower-surmounted crossing; barrel-vaulted arms; residual spaces in corners domed. Built by Theodulf of Orléans on grounds of his summer residence. Perhaps inspired by Visigothic cross-in-square churches of the type of Santa Comba de Bande (I figs. 52.A-C). between 800 and 807. Book of Kells. In the main aspe a mosaic of two winged cherubim worshiping the Ark of the Covenant. Written presumably on the island of Iona and taken from there to the mainland when the monks of Iona, pressed by Norse raiders, fled to the monastery of Kells about 806-807. end, 8th century. Valais, Switzerland, church of St. Maurice d'Agaune. Sixth-century church rebuilt at larger scale; counter-apse added. Stylistically it relates closely with the Tara brooch and Ardagh chalice, each of about mid 8th century. end, 8th century. Regensburg, Germany, church of Niedermünster. Box church with rectangular apse; replaced earlier church (ca. 700), smaller but of similar design. The Book of Kells ranks as one of the outstanding works of its kind, reflecting the Insular manuscript probably in richest form, its pages saturated with patterned design of greatest intricacy and complexity. late 8th/ early 9th century. Müstair, Graubünden, Switzerland, Johanneskirche. Large rectangular hall with 3 apses rising to full height, all surfaces covered with frescoes (overrestored) in series of rectangular panels extending from floor to roof level. ca. 800. Beowulf. Finest heroic poem in Old English; in poetic diction richer than all other similar epics. An arrangement perpetuating a compositional principle already established in Castelsperio and anticipating that of Ottonian paintings in churches of the Lake Constance region. It consists of 3,182 metric units, each line divided into two halves of equal weight linked by alliteration, a technique largely conforming to traditional German practice. late 8th/ early 9th century. Breberen, Germany, church of St. Maternus I. ca. 800. Corbie Psalter. Aisled timber-built church; no apse; inner transept; a common type in Germanic-occupied territories, with roots in vernacular architecture. Unique among early Carolingian manuscripts for the richness of its initials combining ornament and figurative motifs with imaginative freshness (fig. 527, p. 90). 9TH CENTURY 9TH CENTURY 9TH CENTURY 800 800. Charlemagne allows himself to be crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III. early 9th century. Malles, Italian Tyrol, oratory of San Benedetto. 800-810. France. The Court School Risking war with Constantinople by this act, Charlemagne thereby establishes medieval ecclesiastical and secular policy for half a millennium to come. Rectangular hall; timber roof. Recessed in its west wall are 3 tall niches with frescoes of Christ, St. Stephen, St. Gregory, and 2 donors. Ada Gospels Harley Gospels Gospels of St. Médard of Soissons 801. Charlemagne takes Barcelona, extending the Frankish kingdom to the Ebro River; he also makes an expedition to Dalmatia. early 9th century. Brescia, Italy, San Salvatore. Lorsch Gospels Aisled, timber-roofed basilica without transept. (Listed in presumed chronological order.) 805-806. Charlemagne conquers Bavaria. Church of a monastery founded in 753 by Aistulf, king of the Lombards and rebuilt during reign of Louis the Pious, its walls were decorated with remarkable paintings and stuccoes. The Evangelist portraits of this illustrious series of Gospel books combine corporeal Roman figure style and manneristic Byzantine drapery treatment with strong touches of Northern linearism and geometricity (especially well balanced in the Lorsch Gospels). 806. Einhard goes to Rome as missus to obtain papal approval of plan to divide the empire among Charlemagne's sons. 800-819. Cologne, Germany, cathedral of SS Peter and Mary. 807-833. Ansegis reorganizes monasteries of St.-Germer-en-Laye, Luxeuil, and Fontanella and institutes Benedictine rule. Aisled, double-asped basilica; western transept, eastern extended choir; layout on modular square grid; monks' dwellings ranged around atrium at western end of church (I fig. 172). This stylistic evolution is parallel to a comparable synthesis in contemporary architecture between classical corporeality and Northern trends of organizing space in modular unit sequence (Fulda, Cologne, St. Gall). 809-812. Charlemagne conquers Venetia and establishes the Italian March. 812. Michael Rhangabe, East Roman Emperor, sends envoys to salute Charlemagne as "Basileus" at Aachen, thereby acknowledging equality of the Carolingian and Byzantine empires. ca. 800-820. Nieder-Ingelheim, Germany, imperial palace. 813. Charlemagne names Louis the Pious, his son, to be his consort and successor. Site of a Frankish villa regia; walled enclosure divided into separate courts; on northern edge the emperor's audience hall with narthex, semicircular apse; perpendicular to it on southern edge, a cruciform church without aisles, preceded by a large atrium. ca. 812. Brevium exempla ad describendas res ecclesiasticas et fiscules. In a ceremony at Aachen Louis is crowned. Specimen descriptions of property, drawn up for guidance of royal agents in assessing property and produce of royal and ecclesiastical domains; a manifestation of the powerful drive for codification and standardization of law and practice under Charlemagne. 814. Death of Charlemagne. At his death the empire reached from the Ebro in Spain to the Elbe in Germany and included Istria, Dalmatia, and the entire Italian peninsula except Byzantine-controlled territories. The walls of both imperial hall and church were covered with frescoes. Their subject is described in the Life of Louis the Pious, by Ermoldus Nigellus. 814-840. Reign of Louis the Pious. 805. Mainz, Germany, new church of St. Alban dedicated. 814. Works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite translated into Latin, under supervision of abbot Hilduin of St. Denis. The deaths of his two brothers in 810 and 811 left him sole heir of Charlemagne. Asiled basilica with narthex and semicircular apse. 814. Louis, on accession, banishes Adalhard of Corbie to Noirmoutier (island off the mouth of the Loire) for about seven years. 806-819. Reichenau-Mittelzell, Germany, church of SS Mary, Peter, and Paul. Hilduin incorrectly identified this author with the Parisian martyr Dionysius (passio sanctissimi Dionysii). 814. Benedict of Aniane becomes abbot of Inden (Kornelismünster). Aisled basilica with eastern transept, extended choir; layout of modular grid of squares and rectangles; alternating supports in the nave (a leitmotif in Ottonian and Early Romanesque architecture of Saxony and the Rhineland). (I figs. 117, 134, 171.) 816. Statutes of Murbach. The model monastery was built for him and 30 monks by Louis the Pious, Friend and counsellor of Louis, he is the force behind the Benedictine reform and becomes abbot over all monasteries in the empire. In this document Haito of Basel promulgated to monks of Reichenau and Murbach resolutions taken at the first reform synod of Aachen. 814. Louis the Pious makes Einhard responsible for educating his son Lothair. 816, 817. Imperial capitularies issued promulgating resolutions taken at the first and second reform synods of Aachen. 815. Louis the Pious makes Einhard abbot of four great monasteries. 815. Inden (Kornelismünster), Germany, model monastery built by Louis the Pious for Benedict of Aniane and 35 monks. 816-835. France. The School of Reims 816. Louis the Pious makes Ebo archbishop of Reims. Small pillar basilica; tripartite transept, extended choir; cloister attached to entrance side of church (as with Cologne and Fulda). (I fig. 147.) Utrecht Psalter Ebo Gospels (Listed in presumed chronological order.) Born ca. 778, educated at court with Louis, Ebo was deposed in 835 for rebellion against him (833); reinstated by Lothair (840); irrevocably banished by Charles the Bald (841). 816-862. France, cathedral of Reims, begun by Ebo (816-35) and completed by Hincmar. Under archbishop Ebo the center of Carolingian illumination shifted to Reims. 816. Pope Stephen IV performs a second coronation ceremony at Reims for Louis the Pious. Aisled basilica; westwork, transept; details uncertain. The Utrecht Psalter combines with its Late Antique stylistic antecedents a spirited linear liveliness that is a striking example of medieval expressionism. 816. Gozbert is elected abbot of St. Gall. The Ebo Gospels illustrations by contrast supress inherited classical elements in a barbarian linearism without counterpart in Roman illusionistic art, and clearly in reaction to Hellenistic figure and drapery style typical of the Court School. 816, 817. Synods of Aachen. They are held to reaffirm earlier directives establishing Benedictine custom as universal, and to rule on issues heretofore unsettled. In the search for unity of monastic custom these two synods produced that masterpiece of architectural planning to which these volumes are devoted. 818-822. Fulda, Thuringia, Germany, abbey church. 817-822. Vita Caroli, by Einhard. 817. Louis the Pious arranges the division of the empire among his three sons. To Ratger's basilica, Eigil adds two crypts; begins construction of new cloister at west end of church (I fig. 122). Invaluable source for information and overall view of the reigns of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious; incorporates much of Charlemagne's voluminous correspondence. 818. Gozbert of St. Gall secures from Louis independence from the bishop of Constance, recovers lost properties, and increases holdings in the library. 820. Norsemen appear at the mouth of the Seine. ca. 820. Plan of St. Gall; master plan for a monastic settlement worked out during the two reform synods of Aachen in 816-817. before 820. Codex Augiensis CXXXVI (Karlesruhe, Landesbibliothek). Hagiographical ms, probably written in Fulda; subsequently acquired by Reginbert for the library at Reichenau. 821. Death of Benedict of Aniane, and Theodulf of Orléans. The Plan displays the most accomplished example of a square-divided Carolingian basilica with apse and counterapse. In the layout of its claustral structures around a galletied open court on the southern flank of the church, it becomes prototypal for all future monastic planning. Design of guest and service buildings has roots in vernacular architecture. On fols. 21-19 appears a Vita s. Bonifatii written by the main scribe of the Plan of St. Gall (as Bischoff has shown). The Vita predates the Plan and shows the hand of the scribe in transition, from a miniscule leaning slightly to the right (see p. 12, fig. 524) to the same miniscule written vertically, the form appearing on the Plan of St. Gall. Louis the Pious recalls Adalhard from exile at Noirmoutier, reinstates him at Corbie, and eventually makes him his main advisor. The Plan of St. Gall incorporates in its layout structures accommodating these technological devices: Two water-powered mills and mortars; three Roman hypocauses with external firing chambers and chimneys to heat dormitories and warming rooms; some 20 corner fireplaces as amenities in chambers of higher ranking officials. Their presence on the paradigmatic Plan offers evidence that henceforward such equipment was to be considered standard for Carolingian monasteries. 822. Upon return from exile Adalhard writes his famous Customs of Corbie (translated above, pages 89ff). 822. Consuetudines Corbienses, by Adalhard of Corbie. 820-822. Fulda, Thuringia, Germany, cemeterial church of St. Michael. Managerial directive setting forth measures to insure an even flow of supplies for the monastery of Corbie. 823. Lothair crowned emperor by Pope Paschal I at Rome. Two-storied circular structure; ambulatory at both levels around center space. This important document is a remarkable managerial counterpart to the Plan of St. Gall. He spends most of his reign in strife over division of the empire with his father Louis. Begun during abbacy of Eigil by the monk Racholf, in accordance with design furnished by Hrabanus Maurus. ca. 822-867. Gesta SS Patrum Coenobii Fontanellensis. 823. Drogo, a natural son of Charlemagne, is made bishop of Metz. 822. Saxony, foundation of Corbeia nova by Adalhard of Corbie upon his return from exile. Its three parts (written before 830, ca. 845, and ca. 850-867) narrate the history of the monastery from its foundation in 649 by St. Wandrille to the last half of the 9th century. Adalhard transferred a monastery earlier founded at Hethis to this new site on the Weser at Höxter. 824. Louis the Pious establishes the right of the emperor to supervise the temporal administration of the pope through a permanent envoy in Rome. 823-833. Fontanella, Seine-Maritime, France. With the Chronicle of the Abbots of St. Maurice d'Agaune it is the oldest monastic history of the Middle Ages; it is modeled after the celebrated Liber gontificalis (History of the Popes). Like the latter it interprets history as being shaped by outstanding individuals rather than by development of institutions. New cloister built against the northern flank of the church built by St. Wandrille in 649 (for details see II, 276ff, and fig. 478.A-B). 825 826. Death of Adalhard of Corbie. 826-847. Höchst-am-Main, Germany, church of Otgar of Mainz. ca. 825. Aeternae rerum conditor, by Hrabanus Maurus. His brother Wala succeeds him. Aisled basilica with tripartite transept; 3 semicircular apses of identical size (I fig. 114). This hymn (direct imitation and development of Columba's Altus prosator), together with Paul the Deacon's earlier poems in measured stress and rhyme (ca. 790), is one of the most characteristic verse compositions of the Carolingian period. 827. Steinbach im Odenwald, Germany, completion of Einhard's church. Aisled pillar basilica; semicircular apse; low transept arms (or lateral choirs) each with apse; cruciform shaft, barrel-vaulted crypt beneath eastern half of church. ca. 828. Maastricht, Belgium, abbey of St. Servatius, Maastricht reliquary. 830. Sons of Louis the Pious revolt. 830. Einhard retires to the abbey of Seligenstadt where in 840 he dies. ca. 830. Hitsau, Germany, church of St. Aurelius. Gift of Einhard; in the form of a triumphal arch; beneath it equestrian figures of Constantine and the reigning Carolingians sovereign, their bodyguards, the Evangelists, and scenes from the life of Christ. (Lost in the French Revolution.) Box church with semicircular apse. 830-834. Seligenstadt-am-Main, Germany, abbey church founded ca. 827 by Einhard. 830-836. Gozbert of St. Gall rebuilds the abbey church with the aid of the Plan of St. Gall. Aisled pillared basilica; narthex, tripartite (?) transept; annular crypt for relics of SS Peter and Marcellinus. ca. 830. Liturgical writings of Amalarius of Metz (ca. 775-850). Amalarius concerned himself with the state of Gregorian chant in the Frankish kingdom; his liturgical works include many details about it. 830-836. St. Gall, Switzerland, abbey church. Upon site of Otmar's church, Gozbert builds one modeled after that delineated on the Plan of St. Gall (II fig. 522). 831. Louis the Pious regains power from his rebellious sons. In complying with a title of the Plan, Gozbert reduces the length of the church to 200 feet, thereby destroying the principle of square schematism on which it was designed. after 830. In honorem Hludovici imperatoris, by Ermoldus Nigellus. During the next two years his sons continue intransigent. This poem in 4 books treats the life and exploits of Louis the Pious from 781 to 826. 835-851. France. School of St. Martin of Tours 838. Coronation of Charles the Bald. ca. 836. Calculus Victorii Aquitani. 838. Death of Pepin of Aquitaine. This Carolingian copy of a 5th-century Aquitanian calculator of the Christian calendar has inserted in its text an alphabet exemplar of capital letters executed in the most accomplished style of the Carolingian scriptural renascence (see figure 523, p. xxxiv). 838. Saracens devastate Marseilles. 840. Death of Louis the Pious. ca. 839 (or ca. 800?). Vreden, Kreis Ahaus, Germany, abbey church of SS Felicissimus, Agapitas, and Felicitas. On his deathbed he sends the imperial insignia to Lothair. With death of Louis the Pious, the evil decline of the Carolingian Dynasty accelerates. Three-aisled cruciform basilica westwork; extended choir; annular crypt (I fig. 136). 840-877. Reign of Charles the Bald. 838-841. Life of St. Gall, Life of St. Otmar, and Hortulus, by Walahfrid Strabo. 841. Battle of Fontenoy. 841-847. St. Gall, Switzerland, abbot's house of the monastery. Educated at Reichenau, and subsequently at Fulda under Hrabanus Maurus, in 838 Strabo returned to Reichenau as abbot, where he died in 849. Lothair attempts to claim Louis' partitioned kingdom for himself, but is defeated by his two brothers. Rebuilt by Grimoald with aid of masons from the imperial court. 842. Charles the Bald and Louis the German form an alliance to resist pretentions of their brother Lothair I. 841-859. Auxerre, France, church of St. Germain. Cruciform basilica; westwork; aisled hall crypt accessible by circumambient U-shaped corridor (like that of the church of the Plan of St. Gall). Author of numerous widely read theological and historical treatises, his most famous poem Hortulus (after 841) is an account of a little garden he loved to tend, and the virtues of medicinal herbs grown in it. ca. 840. Bible of Moutier-Grandval. 843. Treaty of Verdun. In the north arm of the corridor crypt extraordinary frescoes with scenes from the life of St. Stephen, made presumably before 857, the year of bishop Heribald's death (plan, I fig. 157). ca. 845. Commentary to the Rule of St. Benedict, by Hildemar of Corbie (written in the monastery of Civitate). Unity of empire is destroyed by its division into three parts ruled independently by Louis the Pious's three sons. Lothair receives the "Middle Realm" (North Sea to Italy), Louis the German the "Eastern Territory" (coterminous with later Germany), Charles the Bald the "Western Territory" (coterminous with later France). Beside receiving the Middle Kingdom, Lothair retains title of "Emperor". Of the St. Germain frescoes in the crypt at Auxerre, says J. Hubert, "that the mural painters of this period could surpass the illuminators in skill and imagination. Some analogies have been rightly drawn between these frescoes and manuscript paintings from the scriptorium of Saint-Denis." 845-846. Vivian Bible. ? The Golden Age of Carolingian Dynasty comes to an end. 849, 851. Lothair Gospels. 843. Norsemen sack Nantes and other places along the Loire. 844. Corvey near Höxter on the Weser, Saxony. Addition of westwork and fore court to Adalhard's church. Under abbots Adalhard (834-843) and Vivian (844-851), Gospels, sacramentaries, and Bibles were illuminated with fixed cycles of illustrations: Majestas Domini, Evangelist portraits, emperor portraits, historical biblical scenes. 845. Norse invaders destroy Centula, the basilica of St.-Geneviève in Paris, and force the monks of St.-Germain-des-Prés and St.-Philibert-de-Grandlieu to flee to Coulainville and Cunault. The most noteworthy books of this school (listed above) influenced medieval illumination for centuries afterward. 847-859. France, crypt of church of St.-Philibert de-Grandlieu. Mss of this school enriched the iconographical repertoire of Carolingian art with the unprecedented revival of narrative biblical scenes. In style the illustrations consistently linearize classical prototypes forms, subordinating them to essentially geometric concepts, thus continuing an esthetic ambivalence already evidenced in mss of the Court School. Originally a barrel-vaulted transverse shaft intersected by three shorter longitudinal arms; in 843849 made accessible by a U-shaped corridor built around it, perhaps under influence of Plan of St. Gall (I fig. 156). Plundered by Norsemen in 853, the school of illumination that flourished at Tours never recovered from this shock. 849-850. Saracens raid Provence. 850 850. Norsemen destroy the monastery of St.-Bavo in Ghent. ca. 850. Paderborn, Germany, church of SS Peter and Paul. ca. 850. Evolution of the Frankish sequence. Basilica with apse, counterapse, western transept, western towers. New styles and forms of the chant were developed, especially in the region northeast of the Loire to the Rhine. 850-875. Heiligenberg, Germany, church of St. Michael. Aisled transept basilica; 3 semi-circular apses directly attached to transept. 852. Reims, France, abbey church of St. Rémi dedicated by Hincmar. Details of upper church unknown; crypt said to be "of the finest workmanship." 851. Norsemen raid and destroy the abbey of Fontanella (St.-Wandrille). 852. Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany; dedication of church of the Savior, built by Louis the German. Aisled transept basilica; semicircular apse; west-work (?). 853. Norsemen raid abbeys of St.-Germer near Beauvais and St.-Florent near Saumur, and devastate Angers, Poitiers, and Tours. 852-872. Hildesheim, Germany, cathedral church. Aisled cruciform basilica; westwork (?); extended choir; circumambient corridor crypt. 855. Death of Drogo, bishop of Metz. 855-892. Würzburg, Germany, cathedral. 855. Death of Lothair. Aisled basilica with western transverse room; details uncertain. Falling ill, he divides his land among his three sons, enters the monastery of Prüm, and there dies. 864-875. Werden, Germany, abbey church. ca. 858. Works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, translated into Latin by Johannes Scottus Erigena (head of Court School of Charles the Bald). Erigena based his translation on mss in the scriptorium of the abbey of St. Denis. 856. Norsemen attack Paris and Orléans. Layout of Werden I unknown (ca. 800); it was furnished ca. 864 with annular crypt (preserved). In 875 original church replaced by aisled basilica with alternating supports. 857-875. Annual raids of Norsemen bore deeper and deeper along the rivers into the heart of France. 864-878. Flavigny-sur-Ozerain, France. 870-873. France. Court School of Charles the Bald 867. At the abbey of St. Gall, relics of St. Otmar are transferred to the new church of St. Otmar. Aisled basilica with apse (details unknown); beneath and behind apse a hall crypt accessible by a circumambient U-shaped corridor with access in the east through rectangular fore room to a hexagonal chapel built in honor of SS Peter and Paul (I fig. 158). 870. Codex Aureus of St. Emmeran. ca. 870. Bible of San Paolo fuori le mura; possibly written at Reims. 875 875-877. Reign of Charles the Bald. 867. St. Gall, Switzerland, abbey, church of Otmar consecrated. 871-873. Second Bible of Charles the Bald; written at St. Amand. Roman emperor and king of the West Franks, his reign witnesses a revival of arts and letters, but Norsemen incursions continue. Located west of Gozbert's church and connected to it by a porch serving as entrance to both and surmounted by a chapel of St. Michael consecrated in same year. Stylistically based on the tradition of the schools of Tours and of Reims, their baroque opulence betrays the passing of the zenith of Carolingian art, and signals that the end of the great Carolingian revival of Antiquity is not far off. 881. Charles the Fat crowned emperor by Pope John VIII, at Rome. before 872. St. Gall, Switzerland, abbey church. The youngest of the three sons of Louis the German returns to Germany and launches an expedition against the Norsemen of Friesland, but rather than risk battle, he prefers to come to terms by paying tribute. Tower erected by Hartmut on north side and near apse of Gozbert's church, with vaulted strongrooms for abbey treasures (II figs. 508. 509). 881, 882. The deaths of his brothers Carloman and Louis the Young make Charles the Fat possessor of all his father's dominions. ca. 890-896. Reichenau-Oberzell, Germany, church of St. George. ca. 880. Liber ymnorum, by Notker of St. Gall. Notker's work contained 32 texts set to 25 sequence melodies, some West Frankish, some from his own region, representing the first major accomplishment of Frankish chant. 886-887. Norsemen besiege Paris. Basilica with tripartite inner transept; rectangular apse above groin vaulted crypt; circular apse in west (I fig. 121). Within a century of its formal adoption by Charlemagne, the Gregorian chant (of Eastern origin) was converted from the long, raphsodic, infinitely convoluted and expressive form of Carolingian times to the extremely complex and subtle, superbly structured composition of the Frankish sequence. Charles the Fat buys their retreat with heavy ransom and permits them to ravage Burgondy without interference. 887. Charles the Fat is deposed by an assembly held at Frankfurt or Tibur. end, 9th century. The Age of Charlemagne produced a new type of church architecture based on both the revival of the T-shaped Constantinian basilica (of the type of Old St. Peter's, Rome) and a process of simultaneous reorganization along modular lines of spatial composition (evidenced in St. Riquier, Cologne, Fulda, and most conspicuously in the church of the Plan of St. Gall). Only toward the end of the 10th century did it become clear that modularity in the proud beginnings had entered the mainstream of European architecture, with far-reaching consequences. 882. De ordine palatii, by archbishop Hincmar of Reims. 888. Death of Charles the Fat. On Carloman's accession to his father's (Louis the Stammerer) throne Hincmar presented him with his treatise setting forth the Carolingian system of government and duties of the sovereign, a work based in part on a lost treatise by Adalhard of Corbie. He dies in poverty at Neidingen on the Danube. In earlier works (De regis persona et regio ministerio, Instructio ad Ludovicum regem) Hincmar had already touched on these subjects. ? The Carolingian Dynasty virtually comes to end. Technically, it survived until the death of Louis the Sluggard (Louis V), the last French king of the Carolingian line. Dying childless in 987, he was succeeded by Hugh Capet, first of the House of Capet, 987-1328. 883-904. Formulae Sangallenses miscellaneae. Contains earliest literary reference to waterpow-ered triphammers. end, 9th century. After the death of Charles the Fat, as central authority continues to lapse, the empire is transformed into a mosaic of local protectorates forming prime cells of medieval feudalism. Religion and the arts decline and will not recover until Cluniac reform, and the emergence of the House of Capet in France and the Saxon House in Germany, give new strength and life to Western Europe. 9th-11th century. Elisenhof, near Tönning, Germany. 888-896. The Siege of Paris, by Abo of St.-Germain-des-Prés. Site of aisled timber houses in Warf layers, identical in design with Hodorf structures (1st-2nd cent.) and Feddersen-Wierde (1st-4th cent.). (II figs. 319-20.) The epic written by this monk is a blatant example of Carolingian "numerical composition" (for details see above, pp. v-vi). 900 The accomplishments of the great Carolingian renovatio of the Roman empire survived the troubled century that followed and remained a driving force in shaping future European history. They close the gap between Iron Age and Migration Period examples of this house type and their medieval derivatives, including guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall.

The letter is characterized by use of a very thin line, corresponding to the thin stroke of the Roman capital, and by use of a double stroke composed of a single broad solid line parallel to the broad solid stroke, this double stroke corresponding to the thick stroke of the Roman capital. Notable too is the broad stroke to the observer's left, the thin one to his right. These characteristics, the double stroke broad, heavy, and the other quite thin and separated by a white space of generous width, startling and of rare occurrence in early manuscripts, appear some centuries after the invention of moveable type, during the 18th century (P. S. Fournier in France, about 1750, J. Rosart, Haarlem and Brussels, about 1759). Types of this kind are referred to as shaded, open, or inline without much consistency or exactness of meaning by the makers. At the time of the Brittany Gospel Book a letter of this kind must have seemed as novel and audacious as the bizarre portrayal of its Evangelists with animal heads that are typical of this "monstrous off-shoot" (Porcher), a school issuing from England, first appearing in Spain and England about the 7th century. The adaptation used here, deriving from a single model initial M, conforms largely with present-day design practice in this style of letter, with one exception: following the model, the broad solid element of the double stroke occurs at the left.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE, FIG. 514 This illustration was developed long after studies for these volumes were under way, and at a point when the authors became curious concerning how the red trace of the parchment plan of Gozbertus would appear if it were delineated on a modern cadastral plan in the area of the present great Baroque church at St. Gall, with both plans shown at the same scale. A drawing of the cadastral plan, shown in buff color, was made‡ at scale 1/64 in. = 1 ft. (1:768), convenient for drafting and which, reduced by one half to 1:1536, composed nicely at book page size. Furthermore, the scale, 1:768, one fourth of the size of the Plan (1:192), had been used for much other documentation previously for this work, and facilitated procedure in technical preparation. Next, a photographic print of the red outline plan was made on transparent film ("film positive") precisely to the scale of the cadastral plan drawing. This permitted the image made on transparent film to be positioned in exact register visually with the cadastral plan drawing beneath it, the axes of the two churches coinciding and with the tomb of St. Gall superimposed over the altar of the Baroque church (marked by cross printed in buff color). The graphic inquiry revealed impressive visual relationships of planning layout, and although the study was pursued objectively without anticipation or expectation of any particular kind, still there were surprises. Further discussion is not appropriate in this brief note. However, one condition is mentioned here, since at the scale of fig. 514 it is not in full evidence: where a line (N—S) between the centers of the middle bays of the nave arcade§ intersects the axis common to both churches (E—W), it marks a point that appears to define the geometric center of the circular curve of the bulking form of the Baroque church that is one of its distinguishing architectural features. No inference is drawn from this observation, but it does not seem reasonable to assume that so many conditions and relationships as can be seen in fig. 514 are all merely accidental coincidences inherent in a drafting exercise of combining two images at identical scale.

      <field name="fulltext">COLOPHON Type for the main text, 12 point Monotype 108, Italian Old Style, 2 point leaded, is set in columns 25 picas wide, with measures of 52 picas used for prefatory or introductory matter. Footnotes without exception are set in 10 point 108, 2 point leaded, with 9 and 8 point sizes used for other notes. Extended captions to illustrations generally are set in 11 point 108 italic, 3 point leaded, with smaller sizes used with relatively small illustrations. Display type is Monotype 258 Perpetua Titling in 42 point or 36 point for main openings, with smaller sizes used in subordinate position to relate with the text type. Typographic composition is by William Clowes Ltd., London. The three-column chronological tabulation preceding the Index is set in Linotype Cloister by Halle-Cordes, San Francisco. Printing of The Plan of St. Gall is by offset photolithography. Tonal black and white illustrations are printed in two passes of ink (extended range technique) from plates of 200-line screen. Certain illustrations, such as several subjects from the Utrecht Psalter, employ a variation of extended range using three different inks. The Note on page 13 briefly discusses technical procedure concerning the many color illustrations of the Plan reproduced at original size, and 1.5 times original size. Printing including all camera work, stripping, and plate work was done by the Southeastern Printing Company, Inc., Stuart, Florida. Paper, Colophon Text, 90 pound weight, made as a mill run for this work, was produced by the Curtis Paper Company Inc., James River Corporation, Newark, Delaware. Bookbinding is by the Nicholstone Bookbindery, Inc., Nashville, Tennessee. End papers are "Thistle" Multicolor, produced for and marketed by Process Materials Corporation, Rutherford, New Jersey, and were printed by Southeastern Printing Company from identical plates using three ink colors in three combinations of two colors, producing a different color combination for each volume. Binding cloth is Centennial (35200), Joanna Western Mills Company, Chicago, Illinois. Nota e commiato At a time, long ago it seems by now in May 1979, when the many divisions of this work were being put in order and named, the last link in the chain of parts was christened "Colophon." The name seemed appropriate for a traditional sign-off: wording terse, content brief, usually limited to identification of type or types used in printing the work, and possibly the paper on which it was printed, sometimes with a laconic reference to the printer—all matters neatly disposed in a slender paragraph. This taciturn and habitual practice certainly seems restrictive in circumstances where so many have done so much to advance this work as it evolved from concept to realization. This note is thus intended as a supplement to the Acknowledgments, in order to include a few remarks concerning persons whose assistance has gone beyond routine courtesy in bringing these volumes to a superior level of printing design, craftsmanship, and artisanship. The manuscript for this work was already taking form in 1966, the year following the Council of Europe exhibition "Charlemagne" in Aachen. Notes of that year indicate an exchange between authors, by letter, memorandum, and conference, of an array of queries: what format, what manner of presentation, what drawings particular to the work and how many, and of what kind. In addition, to the "whats" were "wheres", often "whys", and a myriad other matters to be resolved. Enter here the University of California Press. August Frugé, Director of the Press, now retired, at that time was complemented by Conrad Mollath, Manager of Production. Mollath, one-time printer and of a printer's family, was familiar with printing practice and the many techniques currently in use, and, as well, with printing house resources in this country and abroad. Conferences between Mollath and this author, and Kendrick Stark at Clowes, resulted in a splendid eight-page specimen received from William Clowes and Sons Ltd., London, dated 27 September 1967. It was followed by revised second specimen of 28 October 1969 and a third dated 13 December 1969. (The third piece for the first time showed the use of the horizontal-stroke lower case "e" in the roman font of Monotype 108. Of this, more follows.) These pieces, in addition to setting typographic style and standards for The Plan of St. Gall, firmly established a close working relationship with Clowes which continues to the present day. For the main text many type faces were carefully considered. The one chosen, Italian Old Style Monotype 108, was issued originally as Veronese, series 59, in response to the interests and needs of J. M. Dent (of Everyman's Library and Temple Classics fame); it appeared about 1911. Of notable Morris flavor, its vigor and strong color were too emphatic for wide acceptance in trade printing. In the early 1960s Veronese (range of sizes, 11 to 36 point) was declared obsolete as a name and was combined with series 108 (in range 6 to 12 point) under the name Italian Old Style (not to be confused with Goudy's type of the same name). The face adapts well to offset printing and large page format. In the smaller sizes (8, 9, 10 point) it is one of the most legible of types. It has, however, like most "Venetian" faces, a slanting-stroke lower case roman "e", a characteristic that seemed, to me, to savor too much of "period" design for the purposes of this scholarly, historical—not antiquarianistic— book. Moreover, no alternative character was available in the face for this letter. The replacement of the unwanted "e" with an alternative character of straight horizontal stroke came to mind; but how to get it was the trick. I turned to Albert Sperisen, a bibliophile friend who seemed to know everybody who was anybody in printing, type, books. In a long letter dated 20 April 1966 I explained my concern and need for a special lower case roman "e" with horizontal stroke in text and note sizes. My problem was just crazy enough to catch his fancy. Long a friend of Beatrice Warde, he addressed himself to her with a copy of my many paged letter. Her response, dated 12 May 1966, came promptly: "Dear Albert . . . if necessary I will doubtless be able to get a special character cut. All the same, I agree with Stanley Morison—to whom I showed the correspondence—that the book would gain in elegance if it was set throughout in Bembo. Or if a darker tone is required, Plantin 110. . . . That, however, is only a personal opinion. Born will make a handsome book of it in any case. . . . With best wishes to you always, Beatrice." Not long afterward in a letter dated 23 June 1966 she wrote to Albert Sperisen, after a lengthy technical typographic discourse: ". . . if I were to do a book on the Plan of St. Gall I should be very inclined to use Poliphilus. Apart from its aesthetic and antiquarian appeal, it is remarkably adaptable. . . . And the Blado [companion italic] is still my favorite Italic. . . ." Both letters were written from Pomfrets, Mrs. Warde's home in Epsom, Surrey. Her incredible drive and energy and enthusiasm continued as though this were the most important thing in her life. At this time, still radiating her magic powers, she had not long been in retirement from The Monotype Corporation and Fetter Lane. Then on 5 October 1966 a letter arrived from Albert ringing with triumph: "At last an answer . . . I hope you can go through with this." He enclosed a letter from John Goulding at the Monotype works in Redhill written to Mrs. Warde: "Dear Mrs. Warde, Thank you for your letter dated 25 August 1966 regarding the needs of Mr. Ernest Born and the special horizontal stroke lower case `e' required in Series 108. . . . You can let this gentleman know the cost for making this alternative `e'. . . ." The quotation given by Mr. Goulding was most modest. Conrad Mollath had been kept advised of my quest and the rest was routine procedure for him with Kendrick Stark at Clowes. The trick was turned. Thus Albert Sperisen and the great Beatrice Warde are hero and heroine in the prologue to the choice of type used, and design of these volumes. Without their collaboration the books would never have been seen in the manner in which they appear. With the death of this remarkable woman on 14 September 1969—the history of printing knows no person like Beatrice Warde—I shall never know how she would have viewed in its printed form a work for which, with Albert Sperisen, she did so much to help its designer at a critical period of development. Her great Perpetua broad sheet for The Monotype Corporation, THIS IS A PRINTING OFFICE, has correctly been called "immortal." In the closing months of production, a decision was made to set the body type of the Chronological Table in San Francisco, since its preparation required a closely linked pattern of relationship among authors, editor, designer, and typesetter; it also facilitated a publishing schedule of some urgency. Linotype Cloister had sufficient color resemblance to Italian Old Style 108, at least for the purpose of narrow columns. Matrices for it were held here by Halle-Cordes; and in that face the columns of the Chronology are set, with supervision by Robert Elliott. Cloister Old Style, created for American Type Founders in 1897, an adaptation from Morrisonian models, was later applied to Linotype and issued as Cloister, then to Intertype (which uses a horizontal-stroke roman "e"). During the decade and a half that has elapsed since the work started, both Stark in London and Mollath in Berkeley have retired from their respective posts. Retirements brought successors: Czeslaw Jan Grycz, appointed by August Frugé before he retired, became new Manager of Production succeeding Mollath; Geoffrey Armstrong of Clowes succeeded Stark. James Clark soon afterward received appointment as Director of the Press and gave warm support to the St. Gall project. Under Grycz contracts were thoughtfully and carefully awarded for production of the work. Despite changes in corporate and administrative staff, trade practice, and technological upheavals of revolutionary dimensions in the printing arts, this effort comes to a close in 1979 with no diminution of standards or deterioration of quality: no mean achievement. In these fifteen-odd years a work of considerable complexity in all its parts has been produced. Many men and women have assisted in the creation, and by more than labor, in the formation of these books, often stretching competences to the utmost in a reach for better than "good enough." Here, how can fitting acknowledgment be expressed by the images of the alphabet? Their endeavors transcend "business as usual" and reveal uncommon human spirit, perhaps a touch of inspiration. We are most particularly aware of our indebtedness to the staff at Clowes—typesetters, readers, compositors, printers —whom we know only by evidence of these, their presents: skilled practitioners in a most honorable profession. In all phases of printing and procedures Leo Hussey, president of Southeastern Printing Company, extended his personal attention unceasingly, together with Charles Wood, himself a printer of vast reputation and now in retirement. Wood willingly served as consultant to supervise the work for its entire course of production. We are likewise aware of the discriminative attention to task by the job staff of Southeastern Printing and their warm response to fastidious and insatiable requests seemingly beyond reach. During the period of his active practice in photolithography, George Waters gave generously of time and counsel over seven years, in regard to technical problems and camera in photolithography as related to the making of drawings for their most effective reproduction. This assistance, given without stint or charge, was invaluable in the preparation of a large part of the line drawings specially made for this work. Irwin Welcher, former owner of General Graphics, San Francisco, bestowed on this work from its inception an encyclopaedic knowledge with a lifetime of experience in photographic shop technology that may be seen in each of the volumes. Besides supplementary and supportive services to the maker of the drawings, he photographically reduced them to various scales for correct reproduction, and also applied photography in an opposite manner to transform certain classes of copy in order to make them usable as line copy with a minimum of (subjective) alteration by hand (see Note, Hatton 48 inscription illustration, I, 345). Carol Kummer translated and sensitively interpreted each of the designer's original work sheets into camera-ready copy for the printer. Her expertise in page assembly is complemented by a rare dexterity that enabled her to make, even in final proofs, minor corrections or small changes deemed necessary or desirable, thereby giving invaluable assistance to both authors and editor. The authors are fortunate that Norma Farquhar, Los Angeles, could accept the difficult responsibility of creating the Index for the three volumes. Consulting as necessary with the editor, but working nearly alone, she brought one mind, alert and trained to the special task of text analysis. A manuscript forged from about 10,000 entry cards emerged in a style of great elegance and spareness, practically pre-edited and even a pleasure to specify for type. A reader may never find the perfect index, but then, no cellar has every wine. In conclusion I choose to be redundant of Walter Horn's acknowledgment of the place of editor Lorna Price in this book. For to serve one author to a book is problem enough—but to serve two of a kind, to the same book, is analogous to life among the demons. Her survival, rational and radiant, identifies her to be a number-one grade-A angel, for that is what she has been to Walter and me. But I knew it all the time.
