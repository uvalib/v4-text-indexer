      <field name="fulltext">Ninth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1938-39 THE NINTH year since the establishment of the Archivist's office has been distinctive in two respects. The Archivist, Dr. Lester J. Cappon, has been on leave of absence by virtue of a grant from the University's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences; and it coincides with the first twelvemonth of occupation by the University Library of ample quarters in the new Alderman Memorial Library building. The former of these two facts has conditioned, and the latter has in very large measure enhanced, the progress of the University's archives during the past year under the guidance of an Acting Archivist. It has been customary in these reports to discuss some of the developments within the increasingly vigorous and self-conscious archival profession as a whole, but spacial limitations preclude the possibility of extensive remarks upon forward steps elsewhere in the state and nation. Yet one cannot forbear comment on the prophetic nature of the Archivist's review a year ago of the problem of archival training, in which emphasis was placed upon the need for broad and sound scholarship rather than upon the mechanics of technique.1 1. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, pages 1-4. Soon thereafter a report coinciding with that viewpoint in all essentials and in many details was presented to a round table meeting, October 24, 1938, of the Society of American Archivists by its Committee on Archival Training. Both the Archivist and Acting Archivist were in active attendance upon that occasion and welcomed the later publication of the report2 2. It appeared in slightly revised form as an article by Samuel Flagg Bemis, "The Training of Archivists in the United States," in The American Archivist, II, no. 3 (July, 1939), pages 154-161. as an official influence in the proper direction. In similar vein the Library Committee of the University has considered the possibility of introducing here for future archivists a program of curricular studies and of practical training in library craftsmanship. The remarkable but not wholly unexpected multiplication of archival materials in the University Library within the nine years of its formal archival program can be indicated by contrasting the exact count of 2,177 manuscripts and photostats in December, 1929, with the conservatively estimated total of 1,155,000 manuscripts (exclusive of microfilms, photoprints, broadsides, and other printed items) in June, 1939. The pace of acquisition has been so vastly accelerated recently that the already substantial holdings were approximately doubled within the last twelve months. This fact is a pointedly indicative meter of the degree of magnetism possessed by the lodestone of a new building and an increased staff affording more ample quarters, greater protection, and better care. It is also a significant commentary on the rapidly increasing, though relatively newborn, public realization of the desirability of preserving under proper conditions in a public institution personal and official records illuminating phases of the past and present which are worth remembrance. There lies cause for rejoicing in this notable expansion in terms of sheer bulk. Yet it should not be overlooked that in final analysis there is only a limited satisfaction in the mere accumulation and hoarding of historical materials. Physical growth should not be permitted to obscure the research ideal which constitutes the raison d'Ãªtre of archives. Neither statistics of accessions nor cubic feet of occupied space can be an accurate index to archival progress. Acquisition and preservation become archival virtues in the truest sense only when they assure significant historical content accessible to scholars. A succeeding portion of this report will attempt to appraise the value of recent additions to the University's archives. But, since stress has been laid upon accessibility as well as upon acquisition, it would seem appropriate first in general terms to inform serious readers of these pages how readily they might mine the wealth they seek. To those familiar with the herculean task of providing a key to the information buried in an average manuscript collection it will not be astonishing to learn that few accessions of the past year and of previous years are covered by complete guides. But ease of access has improved recently in even greater proportion than physical growth. Thus, though manuscripts are received here faster than they can be supplied with checklists and calendars, it is satisfying that the accumulation of unexamined collections has not increased quite so fast as the number of accessions. It seems likely that two valuable calendars, providing guides to eighteenth century and Civil War manuscripts in the University's collections, will be published within the next twelve months. Calendars of two other collections, the Jefferson and the Berkeley, have been begun in accordance with an organized program designed to extend eventually much further, and a handbook of all manuscript collections is contemplated for issuance in 1945. Improved methods of recording and arrangements for filing acquisitions have been adopted by the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division. These have been rendered possible by the new building and supply a basic contribution to accessibility. In this creditable program of preparing calendars, checklists, card indexes, and other guides, the microfilm collection, representing the newest phase of the library's archival activities, has fallen farthest in arrears and has been designated first order of business for the coming year. Acquisitions have been received by the Library during the past year, as formerly, by outright gift or purchase, by deposit for safekeeping during an indefinite period, and by temporary loan to permit photographic reproduction as microfilm or photoprints. These three methods will be considered in that order in the following enumeration and evaluation of major accessions. Among outright accessions to the University's manuscript collections during the past year the bulkiest group is the Miles Poindexter (b. 1868) Papers. A descendant of a family prominent in Virginia since the earlier half of the seventeenth century, Miles Poindexter was graduated in law at Washington and Lee University and removed in 1891 to the state of Washington. As a Republican delegate from that state he served in the House of Representatives during 1909-1911 and in the Senate during 19111923. Thereafter he was ambassador to Peru until his resignation in 1928. It is estimated that his papers exceed half a million manuscript and printed items, covering principally the two decades of his participation in national affairs and almost rivalling in size and scope the voluminous Taft and Roosevelt collections in the Library of Congress. They will be of particular interest to students of the Congressional "insurgent revolt" of 1909-1912, for Poindexter was a leading Insurgent; of the three-cornered presidential campaign of 1912, in which he was a prominent Progressive; of the bloc against entry by the United States into the League of Nations, which was opposed on the floor of the Senate first by Poindexter in November, 1918; and of Latin-American relations in general and of Peruvian culture in particular, concerning the latter of which he has published two studies.3 3. Peruvian Pharaohs (Boston, c1938); Ayar-Incas (New York, 1930), 2 vols. Comparably large, but of more economic than political importance, is the Edward L. Stone (1864-1938) Collection, which includes a notable library of 4500 volumes (among them a few bound mediaeval manuscripts) illustrative of the history of printing and of the book-making crafts; a few autographs of such persons as Washington, Monroe, Beverley Randolph, and Henry Lee; and his own personal business and official papers, ca. 1890-1938, estimated to number somewhat less than a quarter million manuscript items. The late Edward L. Stone was an outstanding Roanoke citizen, printer, and businessman; his papers contain, for example, his records as president of the Borderland (W. Va.) Coal Corporation. Several other figures prominent in national or local affairs during the past half-century are also represented among recent acquisitions. Professor Emeritus Richard Heath Dabney of the University has presented about 100 letters written to him by Woodrow Wilson during the years 1881-1924. To the collection of Senator John W. Daniel's papers4 4. Cf. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, pages 3-4, 7; Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 9; and post, page 9. have been added about 1,000 items concerning especially his interest in Confederate military history, his father and other relatives, and his congressional career. One of Daniel's nephews was the late Don P. Halsey, Jr. (1870-1938), of Lynchburg, whose career as a lawyer, state senator during 1901-1912, commissioner to present a copy of the Houdon statue of Washington as a gift from Virginia to France in 1910,5 5. Issues of sixteen separate Paris, France, newspapers for August 19, 1910, are available in this library and constitute a complete journalistic "coverage" of the dedication ceremonies and of the speeches of Senator Halsey, Minister of War Brun, and Ambassador to the U. S. Jusserand. orator, author,6 6. A bibliography of Judge Halsey's published writings would include: The Speech of Hon. Don P. Halsey on the Bill to Provide a Statue of Robert Edward Lee to be Placed in Statuary Hall in the Capitol at Washington, D. C. Delivered in the Senate of Virginia . . . 1903. Reprint from Southern Historical Society Papers (Richmond, 1904); A Sketch of the Life of Capt. Don P. Halsey of the Confederate States Army. Patriot, Scholar and Counselor at Law. Reprint from Southern Historical Society Papers (Richmond, 1904); The Limits of Centralization: . . . Address . . . before the Virginia State Bar Association . . . 1907 (Richmond, 1907); Centenary of St. Paul's [Episcopal] Church, Lynchburg, Virginia: Historical Address . . . [Lynchburg, 1922]; The Art of Oratory: an Address Delivered at the Commencement of Emory and Henry College . . . 1925 (Emory, Va., [1925]); The Evidence for Immortality (New York, 1931); Historic and Heroic Lynchburg (Lynchburg, 1935). and judge of the Sixth Judicial Circuit, 1925-1938, is revealed in a collection of almost 20,000 letters, legal and financial papers, speeches, newspaper clippings, and scrapbooks. The Harry Wooding (1844-1938) Papers are composed of roughly 2,000 letters, speeches, and newspaper clippings portraying the long life of a man who served as a captain in the Confederate Army and as Mayor of Danville for forty-six years beginning in 1892. Wooding earned clear title to the distinction of longest consecutive mayoralty service in United States history, and his papers will supply personal data to students of municipal government as well as to the military historian. The original manuscripts in this collection are augmented by a microfilm comprised in part of three rough autobiographical sketches and of a twelve-page autograph letter dated August 1, 1861, describing Confederate victories near Centreville. Notable as an almost complete record of a prominent family's history through four generations of lawyers and planters are the Watson Papers from Louisa County, which cover the century and a half beginning with the Revolution.7 7. This important collection supplements the much smaller group of Minor-Watson Papers acquired a number of years ago by the Library of Congress. The 5,000 or more letters and financial papers in this collection deal successively with Major James Watson (1742-1828) of "Ionia", Major David Watson (1773-1830) of "Bracketts", Thomas S. Watson (1819-1895) of "Bracketts", and Thomas S. Watson, Jr. (1856-1927), of "Burnley". In lesser degree they concern also such relatives as Colonel Garrett Minor (d. 1799), J. H. Minor, Peter Minor, and Joseph W. Morris, and such friends as Francis W., Peachy R., and Thomas W. Gilmer8 8. Cf. Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35, page 7, on the Gilmers; also post, page 15. and Dabney, Peter, and Samuel Carr. Seventy-three volumes of manuscript account books reveal the nineteenth century plantation economy of the Watsons, Morrises, and Minors. Major David Watson, a graduate of William and Mary College in 1797, was a state legislator and a member of the first Board of Visitors of Central College, 1816, and of this University, 1819,9 9. Calendar of Virginia State Papers, X, pages 437, 481. but he resigned from the latter body, perhaps because as a stalwart conservative he distrusted Jefferson's liberalism or because the new institution threatened his alma mater's long leadership. Some letters to him have already been published.10 10. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, XXIX, no. 2 (April, 1921), pages 129-179, no. 3 (July, 1921), pages 257-286, XXX, no. 3 (July, 1922), pages 223-249. The G. R. B. Horner (1804-1892) Papers are noteworthy as a record centering chiefly in a single individual's career and as a source for research students in several distinct fields of knowledge. Gustavus Richard Brown Horner graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 182611 11. Among his teachers was a relative, Dr. William Edmonds Horner (1793-1853), who was professor of anatomy, dean of the medical department, author of several published medical treatises, and father-in-law of Richard Eppes, concerning whom cf. post, page 14. and was commissioned immediately a Surgeon's Mate in the U. S. Navy. In this service he advanced to the position of Medical Director on the Retired List in 1871, whereupon he returned to his native Warrenton. Some 5,000 letters and official documents covering the years 1820-1892 reflect much of his and his family's life. Even more significant are the hundred-odd manuscript volumes among his papers. These begin in 1817 with approximately fifty student notebooks stretching from his preparatory schools in Fauquier County to post-graduate classes as late as 1835. Eight volumes record notes concerning his official and private patients (18261863, with some gaps); and thirty-five volumes of ledgers, day books, and other accounts cover the years 1831-1891. Thirty-eight volumes of diaries and journals, extending from his graduation to his death, are of value to medical, naval, topographical, meteorological, and archaeological students, for they narrate minutely and with a fine avocational curiosity the details of dozens of distant voyages on naval vessels. Portions of these journals provided the basis, in much revised form, for his published books.12 12. Medical and Topographical Observations upon the Mediterranean; and upon Portugal, Spain, and other Countries (Philadelphia, 1839); Medical Topography of Brazil and Uruguay . . . (Philadelphia, 1845); Diseases and Injuries of Seamen: with Remarks on their Enlistment, Naval Hygiene, and the Duties of Medical Officers (Philadelphia, 1854). His manuscripts include also his free translation in 1838 of Antonio Quadri's history of Venice, 421-1797 A.D. Investigation of both diaries and loose manuscripts will prove particularly fruitful to naval historians of the Civil War, during which Dr. Horner remained in the Federal service and was stationed with the Gulf Blockading Squadron and at hospitals in Pensacola, Florida, and the Brooklyn, New York, Navy Yard. Together with his papers were acquired fourteen volumes of account books of his relatives, chiefly of Benjamin F. Horner of Warrenton, for the years 1810-1885. Two manuscript accessions are of consequence because they illustrate the story of inland water transportation. Each of these also contributes directly to the military history of the Civil War. The James Peter Williams (1844-1893) Papers include 100 or more of his personal letters, 1854-1889, among them a significant group during the Civil War,13 13. His war letters were partially and privately published in a mimeographed volume of 69 pages issued in only a limited edition of about 20 copies, of which one may be found in this library: cf. Evelyn Cary Williams, ed., Letters of James Peter Williams, 1861-1865 [Lynchburg, Va., 1937]. together with ten letter-press and account books and about 500 loose letters and documents portraying his work as freight agent and last superintendent of the Lynchburg division of the James River and Kanawha Canal, 18671881.14 14. A published study of this canal is Wayland F. Dunaway, . . . History of the James River &amp; Kanawha Company . . . (Columbia University Studies in History, Economics, and Public Law, CIV, no. 2, whole no. 236, New York, 1922). The Virginia State Library has some of the company's official records, which were transferred to it by the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Papers consist of about 300 letters, legal documents, newspaper clippings, and broadsides, cover four decades beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, and center principally in the figure of Colonel Alfred Spates, president of the company during the sixties, and in the direct control exercised upon its management during 1861-1865 by various Federal military authorities. They also throw light upon its successive, antagonistic administrations, its desperate financial manipulations, and its rÃ´le as a disturbing factor in Maryland politics. To a number of collections previously preserved in the University's archives substantial additions have been made during the past year. The Jefferson Papers have been notably enriched by roughly 1,000 manuscript and photostated items dealing with virtually every phase of Thomas Jefferson's life. Among these, specific comment is warranted by some seventy-odd letters written by him to Joseph C. Cabell; by photoprints from the Library of Congress of his three memorandum and account books, 17671782; by somewhat less than 200 photostats from the Franklin Collection in the Yale University Library; and by a group of over 400 miscellaneous items including papers concerning Jefferson's lands, his grocer's accounts during his first presidential term, and documents of the Williamsburg law firm of George Wythe and Robert Carter Nicholas concerning their business for prominent Virginia and Maryland clients, 1747-1757. Also added to the Jefferson Papers are photoprints from the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery of Peter Jefferson's account book, 17281755, and of the account book for 1757-1765 of John Harvie, executor of Peter Jefferson. The Lee Papers have been augmented by numerous manuscripts of the eighteenth century, among them a group of fourteen letters written in French to Arthur Lee, 1777-1780, while he was commissioner to France.15 15. Concerning other Arthur Lee materials cf. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 8. The Minor Papers16 16. Cf. ibid., page 7. have been enriched by eleven personal letters from John B. Minor to Lucian Minor during 1831-1845, most of them being written prior to the former's election to a chair of law in this University. Of similar interest in connection with the University are ten additional letters, 1830-1875, of Professor Henry Tutwiler of the University of Alabama.17 17. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 8. The General John D. Imboden Papers18 18. Cf. ibid., page 9, and the Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35, page 5. have been enlarged by photostats of three significant military items regarding the Civil War and by approximately 75 manuscripts reflecting his personal and business affairs before and after the war. Approximately 1,500 letters, invoices, and legal documents dating ca. 1775 to ca. 1850 concern Capt. Isaac Davis, Sr., Isaac Davis, Jr., and state legislator Thomas Davis, all of Orange County, and include autographs of Patrick Henry, John C. Calhoun, James Barbour, and Philip Pendleton Barbour;19 19. For a summary of the Barbour Papers locally available see the Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35, page 6, and the Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, page 6. these papers also relate in part to Kentucky. The Reid Miscellaneous Collection of an estimated 2,500 items ranging in date from ca. 1790 to ca. 1910 (a majority being ante bellum) is varied in respect both to the sources from which it was assembled and to the subjects and personalities it involves; however, a thread of unity may be discerned in that nearly all of its materials are related to Pittsylvania and neighboring Southside Virginia counties. It is composed of letters, militia returns, postmasters' receipts and accounts, some papers of the state auditor's office, many business memoranda concerning slaves, tobacco, railroads, schools, and hotels, and a number of letters illuminating the course of post bellum state politics. Many items pertain to Peter D. Holland, businessman of Halesford in Franklin County; there are a few letters of John Hook,20 20. For other materials of Holland and Hook see next paragraph. of Colonel Henry Eaton Coleman, C. S. A., of Richard Randolph, and of John W. Daniel21 21. Cf. ante, page 4. in regard to one of his early and local political campaigns; and a casual inspection discloses also a few letters of, or items pertaining to, Professor George Tucker of this University, Dr. John Peter Mettauer, Benjamin Harrison, Fitzhugh Lee, Governor F. W. M. Holliday, and Beverley B. Munford the author.22 22. Beverley B. Munford, Virginia's Attitude toward Slavery and Secession (New York, 1909). A few of the small acquisitions by gift or purchase fall within the eighteenth century, but the large majority are of the succeeding hundred years. Earliest of all are photoprints from the Draper Collection in the University of Wisconsin Library of manuscripts relating to James Patton of Augusta County, ca. 1700-ca. 1750. Another group includes an account book for 1790-1795 and more than a score of loose manuscripts, ca. 1780-1808, of John Hook (d. 1808), a Scotch merchant at New London in Bedford County, best known as the Loyalist who was prosecuted by Patrick Henry during the Revolution for his refusal to sell beef to the Continental Army. In connection with these original papers a microfilm copy has been made of his two letterbooks of mercantile correspondence for 1758-1784 and of another score of loose manuscripts, half of which are documents illustrative of his Toryism. The same group is also composed of about a dozen journals and day books and nearly 100 individual manuscripts, ca. 1800-ca. 1850, of Bowker Preston, Hook's son-in-law, and of Peter D. Holland, both of whom were dealers in general merchandise.23 23. Cf. above paragraph, and the Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 24. Other John Hook manuscripts are available in the Duke University Library. The so-called "Carrington Letters, 1796[1780]-1823" âpreserved only by virtue of the fact that they were copied into a bound volume, and even then mysteriously "borrowed (or rather stolen)" long enough to permit of partial publication24 24. Anonymous, "An Old Virginia Correspondence", in Atlantic Monthly, LXXXIV, no. 504 (October, 1899), pages 535-549. They were used with proper permission and credit by Albert J. Beveridge in the writing of his definitive Life of John Marshall. â constitute a notable correspondence from Mrs. Edward Carrington (and others) to Mrs. Ann Fisher (and others), revealing many engrossing details about the private life and character of their brother-in-law, Chief Justice John Marshall. Of both maritime and economic significance are 27 letters of a Yankee shipmaster, Captain Enoch Greenleaf Parrott, written from Norfolk and Alexandria to his wife in New Hampshire and brother in Massachusetts during the autumn of 1809 and the fall and winter of 1810-1811. Though primarily of personal interest, these reflect some noteworthy sidelights on Virginia's ports in Hampton Roads and on the Potomac. Slightly larger in both number and appeal are 33 letters of James Monroe, 1811-1831, written chiefly to Stephen Pleasonton, and other manuscripts of the Pleasonton family during the Civil War period. The ante bellum era is represented by thirty-odd letters, 1813-1858, written largely to William McCutchan of Middlebrook, Augusta County, by relatives who had become farmers in Indiana, and by twenty-odd letters, ca. 1840-1855, addressed largely to William R. Stuart at Lewisburg, Greenbrier County (now in West Virginia), by correspondents from Orange, Madison, and Greene counties. Fifteen manuscript items, 1861-1868, relate to claims of C. B. Ackiss, Sheriff of Princess Anne County, against the state auditor arising from the conquest of the Norfolk area by the Federals and from complications of the rival Richmond and Alexandria governments. From Staunton come a few hundred items of correspondence and legal papers, ca. 1850-1915, of George M. and John B. Cochran, attorneys, of George M. Cochran, Jr., and of his law partner, Colonel John Briscoe Baldwin (1820-1873).25 25. A published study of him is the Memorial of Col. John B. Baldwin, of Staunton, Virginia (Staunton, 1874). Concerning manuscripts of the Baldwin and related families cf. post, page 13. Approximately 175 manuscript and printed items, 1897-1938, concern the authenticity of William E. West's portrait of the poet Shelley, which was presented to the Alderman Library several months ago. One of the many interesting single items is a document signed in 1739, shortly before his death, by ex-governor Alexander Spotswood and titled "Proposals for Leasing my Iron works at Tuball . . . ." Another is a facsimile of the warrant issued in 1648 for the execution of King Charles the First. An official archive which has gravitated to the University's collections is "An Entry Book for Lands Entered and Located with the principal Surveyor [Jacob Rinker] of the County of Shenandoah . . . Virginia. No. 1", 1783-1794. To the collection of student notebooks under University professors has been added that of John Herbert Claiborne, Sr. (1828-1905), later an eminent physician in Petersburg, state legislator, and author,26 26. Cf., e. g., his Seventy-Five Years in Old Virginia . . . (New York and Washington, 1904), Clinical Reports from Private Practice (Petersburg, 1873), and numerous contributions to medical journals. on the physiology lectures of Dr. J. L. Cabell, 1849. The plantation diary of John W. Jarvis of "Torreyville", Mathews County, covering some thirteen months of the years 1849 and 1850, is of peculiar significance because of his narrative of a ten-day trip to the Fauquier White Sulphur Springs (Warrenton Springs), his manuscript drawings of the hotel and grounds, and his description of the state legislature in convention there during the summer of 1849 by adjournment from a cholera epidemic in Richmond.27 27. For another traveller's account of these once-famous springs see Six Weeks in Fauquier. Being . . . Letters Illustrating the . . . White Sulphur Springs, at Warrenton . . . Virginia . . . By a Visiter [sic] (New York, 1839). Historians of the Civil War may have occasion to refer with profit to a manuscript volume containing contemporary copies of telegraphic dispatches from New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, various military headquarters, etc., to the Bath, Maine, Merchants' Exchange during some seventeen months of the years 1863 and 1864; these concern such subjects as military, naval, and political war news, the arrivals and departures of ships in northern and southern ports, and the fluctuating quotations on gold and commodities. Other individual acquisitions include letters to or from Caleb Wallace, Charles Pinckney, Bushrod Washington, Governor J. M. McDowell of Virginia, James K. Polk, Winfield Scott, John Randolph Tucker, William H. Cabell, John Letcher, William Cabell Rives,28 28. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 7. John T. Mason, Jefferson Davis, Alexander H. Stephens, P. G. T. Beauregard, Fitzhugh Lee, and Abel P. Upshur. As in preceding years, a portion of the new materials acquired by gift or purchase will probably be of reference value almost exclusively to economic historians. Such, for example, are some 275 bound volumes and 1,000 or more loose manuscripts and printed office forms constituting a comprehensive and detailed record of the workings and business of the LaGrange Furnace Company and Southern Iron Company of Stribling and McKinnon in Stewart County, Tennessee, 1886-1893. Much less complete and more varied is a group of approximately 1,000 William W. Davis Papers. Like William Weaver, whose records have previously gravitated to the University's collections,29 29. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, pages 1011, 35. Davis was a prominent figure of the mid-nineteenth century iron industry in Rockbridge County. His manuscripts, consisting chiefly of financial memoranda and letters to him during the forties and fifties, are a significant record of the California and Buena Vista furnaces and Lebanon, Gibraltar, and Globe forges and of such iron manufacturing firms as Jordan &amp; Davis, W. W. &amp; J. C. Davis, and Isaac &amp; William M. Bryan. John W., S. F., and W. H. Jordan were three notable ironmasters among his correspondents. Other materials in the Davis Papers include about 30 militia returns, ca. 1845-1865, of the Fairfield Rifle Company, Brownsburg Invincibles (volunteer cavalry), Brownsburg Volunteer Artillery, and 144th Regiment of Virginia Militia; about 20 items pertaining to the Bethesda (Presbyterian) Church, ca. 1850; and a much larger number of letters and financial papers, 1840-1907, of Jacob and John Horn, Robert B. Anderson, Benjamin F. Firebaugh, and other members of these related families. Also miscellaneous in content are the business records, 1833-1915, of Thomas Baxter and of his son, William H. Baxter, of Petersburg, which include about 70 volumes of bound account books, bank books, and check stub books and approximately 1,500 less valuable loose manuscripts, chiefly financial in nature. These papers deal principally with the Blandford (lumber) Mill Company, organized in 1833, and to a lesser extent with two public utilities of later date, the Petersburg Gas Light Company and the Petersburg Car Company. Five volumes in this collection are unique: accounts of the Petersburg Benevolent Mechanics Association, 1849-1866;30 30. The Petersburg Public Library has the original minutes for 18251903 and other records as late as 1921 of this Association, which was incorporated in 1826. a letterbook for 1836-1838 of the Mill Company containing a sporadic diary of Thomas Baxter, 1851-1852; accounts of William H. Baxter as treasurer of the Old Street (Presbyterian) Sabbath School, 18691871; a commissary record evidently kept by Captain John P. May, Company A, 12th Regiment, Virginia Volunteers, [186-?]; and a record of requisitions by Petersburg schools for supplies and textbooks, 1868-1869. The history of a single firm since its establishment soon after the close of the Civil War is rather fully available in 83 volumes from Lexington covering the business of H. H. Myers (d. ca. 1905), H. H. Myers &amp; Sons, and Myers Hardware Company, 1869-1918; two volumes among these deal with two 1890 Lexington real estate companies with which Myers was associated. Typical of grist mill records are 49 account books, 1872-1930, of the Germania Mills, Inc., of Fredericksburg.31 31. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 36. A major Virginia industry is represented in eight manuscript volumes of accounts and records of R. E. Gish (d. 1920) &amp; Company, Lynchburg tobacconists, 1871-1892, and in the accompanying 75 or more individual loose letters and statements of British importers to this firm, 1887-1892.32 32. The late Major S. P. Halsey (d. 1939) of Lynchburg was financially interested in R. E. Gish &amp; Company. A variation of the firm name was Gish &amp; Neal. Among the deposits of manuscripts and other historical materials loaned to the Alderman Library for safekeeping the Stuart-Baldwin Papers are preeminent. These consist of almost 4,500 items ranging from ca. 1760 to ca. 1865, a large majority of which fall within the half century beginning about 1785. They constitute essentially the legal and financial papers of two outstanding lawyers of Staunton, Judge Archibald Stuart (1757-1832) and General Briscoe G. Baldwin, Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals. Judge Stuart, a well-known Jeffersonian who influenced the history of Virginia in many respects from the outbreak of the Revolution until his death,33 33. Cf., e. g., Hugh Blair Grigsby, The History of the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788 (Virginia Historical Society Collections, new ser., IX-X, Richmond, 1890-1891), II, pages 9-15. was a son of Alexander Stuart, a Revolutionary officer and a founder of Liberty Hall Academy (parent institution of Washington and Lee University),34 34. Cf. Hugh Blair Grigsby, "The Founders of Washington College," in Washington and Lee University Historical Papers, no. 2 (1890), pages 1-111, esp. 72. and the father of the noted Alexander H. H. Stuart. About 100 of Archibald Stuart's papers directly concern his father and about half as many his son, while well over 1,500 relate to himself and his wife. Judge Baldwin, father of Colonel John B. Baldwin35 35. Cf. ante, page 10. and father-in-law of Alexander H. H. Stuart, was for a time law partner of Judge Stuart, whose wife was Judge Baldwin's aunt. About 100 of his papers directly concern his father-in-law, Judge John Brown (d. 1826), Chancellor of the Staunton District, the remainder being very largely his own. It may be regretted that only about a score of the hundreds of letters in this collection were written by Judge Stuart and Judge Baldwin, but some significance lies in the fact that an overwhelming majority were written to them by hundreds of legal clients and friends in Augusta, Rockbridge, and other counties. Among these letters are several from John Coalter and a few from William Waller Hening, John Taylor of Caroline, the Richmond merchant A. W. Dunscomb, and Philip Norborne Nicholas; also of interest are Baldwin's few extant lectures and other papers concerning his private law school held at "Spring Farm," his Staunton home. Of interest in the same connection is a much smaller deposit of Alexander H. H. Stuart (1807-1891) Papers, ca. 1810-1891, which were partially used by his son-in-law and biographer.36 36. Alexander F. Robertson, Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart, 1807-1891: a Biography (Richmond, c1925). Cf. also the biographical article by the same author in the Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia, I, no. 3 (November, 1894), pages 59-68. These materials comprise family letters of Archibald Stuart and other relatives; school-boy letters of A. H. H. Stuart from the University of Virginia and William and Mary College to his parents; letters, newspaper clippings, and both manuscript and printed speeches illustrative of his affiliation with the Whig and American parties, his particularly able administration as Secretary of the Interior, and his significant influence during the Reconstruction decade; letters to or from Henry Clay, Millard Fillmore, his cousin J. E. B. Stuart, U. S. Grant, and Robert C. Winthrop of Boston; and letters to him as a member of the Board of Visitors from several professors of the University of Virginia and from its benefactor, W. W. Corcoran. The Richard Eppes IV (1824-1896) Papers, 1795-1896, are also outstanding among recent deposits. Eppes was a college graduate of this University and a medical graduate of the University of Pennsylvania;37 37. He married (1) in 1850 Josephine Dulles Horner (d. 1852) and (2) in 1854 Elizabeth Welsh Horner (d. 1905), both of whom were daughters of Dr. W. E. Horner of the University of Pennsylvania faculty. Thus he was by marriage a distant kinsman of G. R. B. Horner, M.D. Cf. ante, page 6. his student career is partially revealed by five notebooks, 1838-1845. In or before 1851 he settled as a gentleman farmer in his ancestral home in City Point, "Appomattox Manor", at the confluence of the James and Appomattox rivers, an estate which is notable because it was patented to the Eppeses about 1640 and, longer than any other tract in the United States, has remained in the ownership of the same family. During the Civil War he returned to direct medical practice as a surgeon in the Confederate forces. His diary covers in nineteen volumes the years 1851-1854, 1858-1861, and 1865-1896, while three of his account books reflect the business for 1851-1890 of his four farms. A dozen volumes and sundry letters and passports are records reaching back as far as 1795 of his relatives, Archibald Eppes, Benjamin Cocke, and others. The Berkeley Family Papers, previously deposited,38 38. Cf. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, page 6. have been augmented by a final installment consisting of about a score of agricultural ledgers and notebooks, of political papers of state legislator William Noland, and of other miscellaneous manuscripts ranging in date from the Revolution to the present century. About half a hundred deposited letters of Peachy R. and Francis W. Gilmer, 1809-1838, have considerable literary and political interest..39 39. Cf. ante, page 5. Three journals of Sterling Claiborne of "Bellevette" in Nelson County, 1819-1832, 1836-1845, and a journal of the general merchandise partnership of David Hume &amp; Thomas R. Towles at Orange, 1858-1861, are typical examples of deposited business records available to researchers in economics. Not so representative but worthwhile also as social documents are a ledger for 1855-1856 and two registers for 18701872 of the once-proud Sweet Springs, West Virginia, Hotel.40 40. For other records of noted Virginia and West Virginia spas cf. ante, page 11; post, page 20; Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, pages 5-6; Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 22. A volume containing records of the Albemarle Confederate Memorial Association for 1884-1939 is not merely local in appeal, for it involves founders of the first United Daughters of the Confederacy organization. The correspondence, invoices, and similar records, 1925-1936, of the late Tracy W. McGregor concerning the assembling of his valuable library of rare books and pamphlets41 41. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, pages 14-15, and post, page 24. have been entrusted to the University's care by the trustees of the McGregor Fund. Among the several individuals whose extant manuscripts have been photographically copied on microfilm during the past year the John Wickham (1763-1839) Papers, 1766-1880, will be of greatest service to future biographers of prominent public figures. Two volumes of diaries contain complementary accounts of his European travels and impressions during 1784, while a portion of the second diary and six other volumes reflect some of the legal, intellectual, and personal interests of this immigrant into Virginia who became a leader of the Williamsburg and Richmond bars. Approximately 275 letters and miscellaneous documents further illuminate his career, though only a score were written in his hand. An equal number of the total deal directly with his rÃ´le as chief counsel for the defense in the trial of Aaron Burr, and the political historian will be particularly concerned with these fresh footnotes to the episode for which he is best known. Several scores of the many letters to him are from members of his family and from other relativesâa few from his noted father-in-law, Dr. James McClurg (1746-1823) of Williamsburg and Richmond.42 42. Wickham was born on Long Island, New York, and became a protÃ©gÃ© of his uncle, General Edmund Fanning of the British Army, Governor of Prince Edward Island and Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. He married (1) his cousin, Mary Smith Fanning (d. 1799), daughter of the Rev. William Fanning of Williamsburg, and (2) Elizabeth Selden McClurg, who survived him. The Fannings, McClurgs, and the related Porcher family of South Carolina are all represented in the Wickham Papers. The fact that these Papers extend some forty years after John Wickham's death is largely explained by some relating to his son, Littleton W. T. Wickham. His devoted friend since schoolboy days at William and Mary College, Littleton Waller Tazewell, the Norfolk lawyer, is also one of his chief correspondents,43 43. Hugh Blair Grigsby, Discourse on the Life and Character of the Hon. Littleton Waller Tazewell . . . (Norfolk, 1860). and other names of note involved in his manuscripts are those of Joseph C. Cabell, Isaac A. Coles, and Benjamin Watkins Leigh. The Francis McFarland (1788-1871) Papers, 1815-1871, are those of an exceptional Presbyterian clergyman. Born in Ireland of Scotch-Irish stock, McFarland was brought in early youth by his immigrant family to Pennsylvania, was educated in Ohio, at two Pennsylvanian colleges, and under the famed theologians of Princeton Theological Seminary, by whom he was graduated in 1820. Following missionary labors in New Jersey, Indiana, Missouri, and Georgia, he became pastor in 1823 of the Bethel Church in Augusta County, and with this community he was identified throughout the remainder of his long life, except for the five years of 1836-1841 when he served as corresponding secretary of the church's Board of Education at Philadelphia. Though plagued relentlessly by ill-health from his college days onward, he managed nevertheless to exert a forceful influence in religious and educational councils: he was for years stated clerk of the Synod of Virginia and a trustee of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University), moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1856, and moderator pro tempore of the separatist Assembly in 1861 at Augusta, Georgia, which divided his denomination into "southern" and "northern" churches. His microfilmed papers are of special value to local and religious historians, but students of political and military developments, of economics and genealogy, and even of Augusta County meteorology during 18531870, will not find the McFarland cupboard bare. Two volumes of his student writings, 1815-1820, throw light upon his training; two volumes of missionary journals, 1819-1821, are excellent travelogues which illuminate religious and social conditions in as many as ten states; and five volumes of financial notations, 18231836 and 1839-1869, include a record of his salary payments and marriage fees during all but the last two years of his two Bethel pastorates. Of primary consequence are the fourteen volumes of his diaries commenting on personal, local, and national affairs for portions of the years 1832, 1834-1836, 1839, 1841, 1852, and 1871, and for every day of the years 1853-1870. Twenty-five manuscript letters and documents to McFarland from as many different correspondents, covering brokenly the years 1821-1848 and 1861-1864, and two typescript biographical sketches of him complete this collection.44 44. Two other collections of Francis McFarland manuscripts are preserved at Washington and Lee University and by the Historical Foundation of the Presbyterian and Reformed Churches at Montreat, North Carolina; the former group relates to his aforementioned service during 1832-1836 and 1842-1868 as a trustee, and the latter collection portrays in part his several connections with various aspects of church history. Cf. also post, page 18. In connection with the papers of this eminent minister it may be reported that a separate microfilm copy has been made of the extant early official records of three Augusta County Presbyterian churches. These include two session books, 1817-1869, of the Bethel Church, first built of logs in 1779,45 45. Cf. the 30-page booklet by Herbert S. Turner, D. D., A History of Bethel Presbyterian Church (privately printed in Staunton, Va., [1925 or later]). which are of special value as supplements to the personal papers of the Reverend Francis McFarland, D. D.; a typescript copy of the earliest known records of the Tinkling Spring Church, 1741-1793, with notes on its history prepared by the county historian, Joseph A. Waddell,46 46. His diary is in the University Library: cf. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 4. and others; a register for 1850-1908 of the same congregation; and a session book, 1840-1892, and a register and minute book, 18401882, of the Tinkling Spring and Waynesboro churches. Still another group of important manuscripts photographically reproduced comes from the same immediate locality. These are the Bumgardner Papers, 1770-1930, numbering three scrapbooks, two other volumes, and about 150 unbound letters and financial papers concerned primarily with the "Bethel Green" estate, located across the old Howardsville Turnpike from the Bethel Church. The papers of this large, widespread, and stable family of merchants and farmers provide much unpublished genealogical data about Jacob Bumgardner, Sr. (1767-1857), of "Bethel Green" and his descendants,47 47. For the completest genealogical summary of the Bumgardner family available in print see [Rev.] James Alexander McClure, [D. D.,] The McClure Family (privately printed in Petersburg, Va., 1914), pages 190-192. but they are also quite pertinent to students in other fields on both the local and the national scale. They reveal that Jacob Bumgardner, Sr., established in 1820 the long-lived J. Bumgardner Distillery Company, that his son James Bumgardner, Sr. (1801-1890), continued to maintain with success the varied business pursuits which had become traditional at "Bethel Green", and that five of his other sons settled in Hart County, Kentucky, and Fayette County, Missouri.48 48. James Bumgardner, Sr., married Malinda McCorkle, possibly a daughter of the Rev. Alexander B. McCorkle who was pastor of the Bethel Presbyterian Church, 1837-1840. Aside from their local and economic information, these papers will prove fruitful to Civil War historians. It may be mentioned incidentally that among them are an autograph letter of Francis McFarland,49 49. Cf. ante, pages 16-17. and one of the late President Edwin Anderson Alderman of this University. Apropos of sundry research interests of scholars who have use for original plantation records, this type of material in the University Library has been enriched by two notable microfilms. The Lightfoot Account Books from Caroline County, 1781-1793, 18051872, are composed of three ledgers, two day books, and a slave book recorded almost entirely by Philip Lightfoot (1784-1865) of Port Royal but also in small measure by his father, son, and others.50 50. Concerning this branch of the Lightfoot family see William and Mary College Quarterly, III, no. 2 (October, 1894), pages 104-111, esp. 109. From the Valley come the Henry B. Jones (1797-1882) Papers, 1821-1894, portraying life and business at the "White Hall" estate in northern Rockbridge County. These comprise four diaries covering the years 1842-1882 (except 1853-1857), eight volumes of financial, court, and church records, and about 500 individual manuscripts of diverse content concerning Jones and his son. Also worthy of comment are some corporate stock records for 1835 and 1857-1858 of the Middlebrook and Brownsburg Turnpike Company, quite a number of items pertaining to Brownsburg schools, 1822-1894, an account of the "Liberty Hall Volunteers at First Manassas" and other Civil War materials, and a collection of extracts from The Union, predecessor of the present-day Lexington Gazette, during 1832-1834, the first years of its publication and a period for which none of its copies are extant.51 51. These significant papers have previously been introduced to the historical profession by the Rev. Henry W. McLaughlin in a paper, "The Annals of a Virginia Planter," read before the American Historical Association during its annual meeting in 1924. A typescript copy of this paper, based chiefly upon Jones' diary, was photographed with the manuscript. Among other microfilmed manuscripts are six groups of items bearing upon the military history of the Revolution and the Civil War: almost a score of muster rolls and other documents of Captain Custis Kendall's Company, 1st Virginia Regiment, 1777-1779; a diary by Captain G. B. Strickler of operations in March, 1862, and in the same volume sundry other records through 1864 of Company I, Fourth Virginia Infantry, Stonewall Brigade (the "Liberty Hall Volunteers" unit); a diary of Solomon Augustus Lenfest of the Nansemond Union Guards, Company G, 6th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, for nine months beginning August 29, 1862, depicting the siege of Suffolk; a book of soldiers' autographs collected by Lieutenant Andrew Wallace Varner, Company H, 27th Regiment of Virginia Infantry, Stonewall Brigade, while he was a recuperating prisoner in 1864 at Johnson's Island near Sandusky, Ohio; 21 items related to the Reverend Walter Q. Hullihen (1841-1923), long an Episcopal rector in Staunton, chiefly illustrative of his war career as aide or courier of J. E. B. Stuart; and one volume containing the complete minutes, 1883-1931, of the Jackson Memorial Association, an organization of his veterans which erected and cared for the well-known statue of General T. J. ("Stonewall") Jackson in Lexington. Through a vagary of archival preservation and by channels too devious for tracing, an official Lynchburg tax book, 1813-1816, became private property loaned for photographing; the Town Council's official minutes of Louisa from the incorporation of the municipality in 1873 through 1905 also were made available for microfilming. Business records similarly reproduced include John D. Murrell's records, 1819-1830, of the Ferry Bank at Lynch Dock on the James River, reputed to be the first banking institution at the site of Lynchburg; a volume in which Edward Bland (1767-1831), grandson of Richard Bland "the Antiquary", recorded his legal fees for the years 1806-1827; and three account books for the summer seasons of 1816-1817, 1827-1828, and 1830-1831 and two registers for the seasons of 1896 and 1898-1899 of the distinguished Greenbrier Hotel at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.52 52. Concerning other locally available records of similar spas cf. ante, pages 11, 15. To this resort these volumes indicate that Henry Clay, John Tyler, John Wickham,53 53. Cf. ante, page 16. and many other prominent and fashionable Virginians repaired. A unique genealogical item from the pen of a celebrated divine is the 78-page manuscript "Biography of the McPheeters and Moore Families" compiled by the Reverend William McPheeters, D. D. (1788-1842). Finally another group of manuscripts pertains directly to the University of Virginia, among them being a brief biographical sketch of Professor Henry Howard, M. D., by his daughter, Miss Anna Elgar Howard (1838-1927); a sporadic diary of her sister, Miss Eliza Elgar Howard (18361894), chronicling "doings" of such University families as those of professors Howard, McGuffey, Cabell, Maupin, Gildersleeve, and Minor54 54. For the Minor Papers cf. ante, page 8. during portions of 1858, 1860, and 1868, notably at Virginia's mineral springs resorts during summer vacations;55 55. Cf. ante, pages 11, 15. a letter dated March 8, 1865, from William Dinwiddie of Greenwood to the Misses Howard describing the survival of the University and nearby damages inflicted by raiding Federal troops; and a group of letters from Dr. Henry Howard to his son-in-law, the renowned Dr. William H. McGuffey. A small number of broadsides have been separately added to the treasures of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division. These include a circular letter of April 29, 1845, from the faculty of the University to parents and guardians of its students concerning recent student riots; a circular constituting letters of Charles L. Cocke to the students and "patrons" of the Female Seminary at Botetourt Springs (now Hollins College) in explanation of the belated opening of the 1853-1854 session because of a dysentery epidemic; a contract of the Culpeper Medical Society in 1852 listing the minimum "Rates of Medical Charges" which they agreed to require for specified services and prohibiting "engagements to practice in families by the year"; a curt broadside dated May 15, 1861, and alleged to have been printed in Romney, now West Virginia, defining "Treason in Virginia"; and an impassioned appeal by P. G. T. Beauregard, dated shortly before the First Battle of Manassas, to the people of Prince William and neighboring counties to arise in defense of their homes against invading Federals.56 56. Concerning Unionist sentiment in Prince William County cf. Lester J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935: a Bibliography . . . (New York, 1936), page 15. An extensive enlargement of the newspaper collection, which has been expanded within the past year by issues estimated to total several tens of thousands, has paralleled the unprecedented growth of the manuscript collections. The card index, which was reported a year ago to be in progress as a key or checklist for local holdings,57 57. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 13. has been completed, has virtually maintained in its elastic expansion the exceptional pace of new accessions, and has won the plaudits of critical visiting librarians. From the viewpoint of the bibliographer the prize acquisition of all in this category is the February 5, 1790, issue (slightly mutilated) of The Staunton Gazette, or, the weekly Western Star (volume I, number indeterminable) âa paper which is significant because it moves back three years the known date of Staunton's first newspaper.58 58. For previously known information about the earliest newspaper published there see Clarence S. Brigham, "Bibliography of American Newspapers, 1690-1820, Part XVIII: Virginia-West Virginia," in American Antiquarian Society Proceedings, new ser., XXXVII, part 1 (April, 1927), page 142. Cf. post, page 30. From Warrenton come three additional weekly newspapers of which no other copies are known to be extant: Venus, January 5, 1839, Minerva, January 26, 1839, and The File-leader, August 1, 1882;59 59. Concerning the last-named cf. Lester J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, page 218. and the same degree of scarcity seems to hold true also in the cases of the Franklin Times-Democrat of Rocky Mount, June 1, 1910, and of The Trumpeter, September 10, 1914 (volume I, number 4; "last issue"), published in Richmond as an organ against statewide prohibition by the Virginia Association for Local Self-Government. Scarcely less rare are The Hartford Connecticut Courant, October 29, 1764, "Number 00 [prospectus]" (facsimile); the first issues of two very shortlived weeklies published in Virginia by Federal soldiers during the Civil War, The Pennsylvania Fifth, June 10, 1861, issued from Camp McDowell at Alexandria, and The New York Ninth, July 31, 1862, printed in Warrenton;60 60. Cf. ibid., pages 44, 219, and Lester J. Cappon, "The Yankee Press in Virginia, 1861-1865", in William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine, 2nd ser., XV, no. 1 (January, 1935), pages 81-88. and the first issue, June 1, 1895, of a "free silver" daily, the Chicago Daily Coin, published by W. H. ("Coin") Harvey, author of the well-known volume of Populist campaign literature titled Coin's Financial School.61 61. Concerning this newspaper see Winifred Gregory, ed., American Newspapers, 1821-1936: a Union List of Files Available . . . (New York, 1937), page 120. Notable as the largest and earliest file of a comparatively rare newspaper is a bound volume containing half of the first seven years' issues of the prominent Leesburg Genius of Liberty, 1817-1823.62 62. Cf. Cappon, op. cit, page 111, and post, page 29. About 200 scattered copies for 1883-1897 form a broken file of an interesting school publication which may not be elsewhere available, The Goodson Gazette, published weekly in Staunton by the Virginia Institution for the Education of the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind. While a number of other recent newspaper accessions are quite rare,63 63. These include, for example, the following single issues or partial files, concerning which cf. ibid., passim: Broadway Enterprise, December 23, 1892; Danville Evening Star, May 2, 1895; Harrisonburg Virginia Citizen, July 1, 1859; Lynchburg Farmer's Guide, June 30 and July 7, 1910; New Market Spirit of Democracy, September 12 and October 31, 1856; Norfolk Journal of Commerce, December 20, 1890; Petersburg Daily Courier, April 28, 1870, Virginia Citizen, April 19, 1876, Daily Post, 1877-1878, Daily Progress, 1907-1911, and Evening Record, 1910-1911; Richmond Popular Messenger, March 15, 1883; Scottsville Register, September 22, 1860; and Warrenton Virginia Times, November 3, 1838. greater reference value attaches to sundry incomplete files or additional issues of such papers as the Danville Register, 1898-1938, and Bee, 1915-1938; Harrisonburg Rockingham Register, 1822-1865; The Norfolk Landmark, 1877-1900; Petersburg Express, 1858, 1861, and Index-Appeal, 1873-1913; Richmond Enquirer, 1835-1870, State Journal, 1869-1871, Daily Dispatch, 1870-1872, Whig, 1875-1877, and Virginia Patron, 1876, 1878; Staunton Virginia Messenger, 1849-1852; Tappahannock Tidewater Index, 18731886; The Alderson (West Virginia) Advertiser, 1911-1938; and the New York City Herald, 1898. The Library has subscribed to the project for microphotographic reproduction by the Harvard University Library of three outstanding foreign dailies and is currently receiving microfilms of the English Manchester Guardian, Le Temps of Paris, and Il Giornale d'Italia of Rome, each beginning with the issues of July 1, 1938. Like the Library's resources of other types of historical materials, the music collection, begun only two years ago and designed to be primarily representative of southern musical imprints and of scores played and sung during the nineteenth century in the polite parlors of Virginia homes,64 64. Cf. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 9; Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 15. has shown notable growth. Thousands of ante bellum songs, including some additional Stephen Foster numbers, have been acquired, but only a small minority were published south of the Mason and Dixon line. A relatively few unusual Civil War, Populist, and World War items deserve mention in passing. Comment should also be made to the effect that some scores of sheet music are Virginia music imprints.65 65. These include more than twenty songs issued by Frederick W. Walter at Staunton, Va., Raleigh, N. C., and later (about 1872) Baltimore, Md., and one imprint each of the more obscure Dan B. Hamaker of Staunton and Kirke M. Hart of Front Royal, Va. The collection also includes two manuscript compositions by Vincent Czurda. This historical collection has been distinct from the Music Library of the University's School of Fine Arts. The removal of the latter to the Alderman Library at the end of the 1938-39 session has brought under one roof two collections in which the emphasis is very different. Though questions as to the final method of cataloguing and arranging the music have not been decided, the contents of the collection are much better known now than previously, for workers of the American Imprints Inventory, a Work Projects Administration project, have to date listed a majority of the compositions. A separate checklist has been prepared by the library staff of the fifty-odd imprints of William Blackmar, an outstanding southern music publisher at Augusta, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana. Thousands of volumes have entered the periodical, rare book, and general book collections through the archival office during the past year. Among these are partial files of three unique magazines so rare as not to be found in the Union List of Serials: The Baltimore Olio, and American Musical Gazette, A Monthly Parlor Companion for the Ladies, Devoted Chiefly to Music, the Arts, and Musical Intelligence Generally . . . (published by W. C. Peters, Baltimore), volume I (1850); The Game Fowl Monthly, Devoted to the Fancier, Cocker and Breeder (published by C. L. Francisco, Sayre, Pennsylvania), volume IV, number 4 (April, 1888)âvolume VII, number 3 (March, 1891), with exceptions of two issues;66 66. Valuable in conjunction with this periodical and apparently equally rare is a volume compiled by its editor, printed on the same press, and titled The American Game Cock or the Old-Fashioned Game. A Practical Treatise . . . (Sayre, Penna., 1890), which has been made available in this library by microphotographic reproduction. and about three-quarters of the issues for 1890-1930 of The Sectarian: a Monthly Magazine Devoted to the Cause of the Anti-Means, Old School, Predestinarian, or Bible Baptist (Occoquan, Prince William County, Virginia). It was announced in the preceding issue of this Report that appropriate quarters would be provided in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division for the valuable library of the late Tracy W. McGregor of Detroit.67 67. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, pages 14-15. The completion of necessary alterations was fittingly signalized on April 14, 1939, by ceremonies dedicating the luxuriously appointed room and by the unveiling of a portrait of Mr. McGregor.68 68. For a reprint of the presentation address on McGregor by Judge Henry Schoolcraft Hulbert of Detroit, and of President John Lloyd Newcomb's remarks of introduction and of acceptance, see University of Virginia Alumni News, XXVII, no. 8 (May, 1939), pages 159-162, 169-172. The library has benefitted by the labors throughout the past year of two workers of the American Imprints Inventory, a subsidiary program of the Historical Records Survey of the Work Projects Administration.69 69. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 15. Reference has been made in another connection to their examination of the music collection. They have also brought and maintained up to date a card record of all United States imprints through 1876 (or 1890 for eight Rocky Mountain states) in the general and rare book and pamphlet collections. The bibliographical fruits of this project bid fair to be of enormous importance to the scholarly world as a whole. Announcement was made last year70 70. Ibid., pages 15-16. of the publication of the first volume in the Inventory of the County Archives of Virginia series, issued by the Historical Records Survey, with which this office had formerly a direct rather than an advisory connection.71 71. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, pages 2-3; Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, pages 2-3. This series has now been creditably enlarged by the appearance in mimeographed form of three additional volumes: No. 27, Dinwiddie County; No. 60, Middlesex County; and No. 73, Powhatan County. It is hoped that similar publications for other counties can be steadily produced. In conclusion, it can not be too strongly emphasized that the progress of the University's archives during the past year has resulted from the coÃ¶peration of many persons. More than three hundred individuals have been directly concerned with the sources of accessions, while still more have assisted indirectly in the work. To many members of the library staff in particular a grateful word of acknowledgement is due for services rendered. The frequent counsel of Mr. Harry Clemons, Librarian, and of Dr. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist, has been especially helpful. W. Edwin Hemphill, Acting Archivist. 1 September 1939</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix By Glenn Curtis Smith, Senior Library Assistant in Charge of Newspapers A CHECKLIST OF NEWSPAPERS TO 1821 IN THE ALDERMAN MEMORIAL LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The purpose of this checklist of United States newspapers is to bring up to date in published form the record of newspapers printed prior to 1821 that are to be found in the Alderman Memorial Library. Since 1928, when Dr. Clarence S. Brigham completed his checklist of United States papers prior to 1821 in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society (New Series, Vols. 23-37; Worcester, Mass.), the Library has acquired scattered files of various papers. For the period following 1820 Dr. Lester J. Cappon's volume on Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935 (New York &amp; London, 1936) not only lists Virginia newspapers and where they are to be found, but also gives an editorial summary for each title. The mechanics of this checklist follow the system used by Dr. Cappon.
