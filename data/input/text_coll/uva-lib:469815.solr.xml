To carry into effect the powers herein enumerated, and all other powers conferred upon the said town or its council by the laws of Virginia, said council shall have power to make and pass all needful and proper orders, by-laws, and ordinances, not contrary to the constitution and laws of said State, and to prescribe and impose reasonable fines or penalties, or to impose imprisonments in the county jail for a period not exceeding thirty days, in cases of contempt, or to enforce the collection of fines; which fines, penalties or imprisonmenes shall be imposed, recovered, or enforced, under the judgment of the mayor or any one of the aldermen of said town. And the authorities of said town may, with the consent of the county court of Albemarle county, entered of record, use the jail of said county for any purposes for which the use of a jail may be needed by them, under the acts of the council or of the state of Virginia; provided, however, that in all cases where a fine is imposed by the mayor, any alderman, or by the the council, exceeding ten dollars, the party or parties so fined shall have the right of appeal to the county court. 15. The mayor and each one of the aldermen of said town, for the time being, are declared to be, and are hereby constituted, conservators of the peace within said town and within one mile from the corporate limits thereof; and shall have all the powers and authority in civil as well as criminal cases of justices of the peace. 16. The council shall cause to be made up annually and entered upon its journal, an accurate estimate of all sums of money which are or may become lawfully chargeable on said town, and which ought to be paid within one year; and said council shall order a town levy for so much money as in its discretion shall be sufficient to meet all just demands against the corporation. 17. The levy so made may be laid on all male persons who are residents of said town, over twenty-one years of age; upon dogs, and upon all personal and real estate within said town, except such persons, personal and real estate as are exempt from taxation under the laws of this state, and also upon all other such subjects within said town as may, at the time, be assessed with state taxes; provided, however, that the tax on real estate and personal property, including choses in action, shall not exceed in any one year, one dollar on every one hundred dollars value thereof: and provided moreover, that the tax on income shall not exceed the rate of taxation on the same, as fixed by the laws of this state at the time of said levy. But nothing contained in this section, as hereby amended, shall limit or restrict the power of the town council to levy such additional taxation as they may deem necessary for the use and benefit of the town: provided, such additional taxation shall be authorized and sanctioned by a vote of the qualified voters of said town, in the mode and manner prescribed in section twenty-three of the new charter of said town as hereinafter amended, for creating a loan or loans of money. 18. In all cases in which the laws of the state require a license to be taken out by any person engaged in the pursuit of any business, trade, occupation, or calling, or for any other purpose, the said council shall have power to require a license to be taken out in all such cases for the benefit of said town before such person shall be permitted to pursue such business, trade, occupation, or calling within the corporate limits of said town, or within one mile from said limits. Said council may also grant or refuse license to owners or keepers of wagons, drays, carts, hacks, and other wheeled carriages kept or employed in said town for hire or as carriers for the public, and may require the owners of such wagons, drays, carts, and so forth, using them in the town, to take out a license therefore, and may require taxes to be paid thereon and subject the same to such regulations as they may deem proper. 19. The revenue from these and other sources shall be collected, paid over, and accounted for at such times, and to such persons as the council shall order. 20. The council shall require the treasurer of the said corporation to make out a quarterly report of the receipts and expenditures of said town for the preceding quarter, which report shall state on what account the expenditures were made, and from what source or sources the receipts were derived; which report the council shall cause to be published in one or more newspapers of the town, on or before the fifteenth day of October, January, April, and July, of each year. 21. The council of the said town of Charlottesville is hereby authorized to make and issue the registered or coupon bonds of said corporation, payable ten years after their date, bearing interest at not more than eight per centum per annum, payable semi-annually; said bonds to be used exclusively in paying off and discharging the principal and interest of the present bonded debt of the corporation of Charlottesville. Said registerd and coupon bonds shall be regularly numbered, signed by the mayor, clerk, and treasurer of the town, and recorded in a book kept for that purpose. 22. The council of said town shall annually invest in Virginia state or United States bonds, as a sinking fund, such proportion of its annual revenue as shall be equivalent in cash value to at least one twentieth of the bonded debt of said town, out of which to pay, as they fall due, the bonds which are authorized to be issued in the next preceding section: provided, nevertheless, that the said council, may instead of investing its revenue in Virginia or United States bonds, use said revenue, which is to be annually invested in said bonds, in paying off and discharging the principal of the bonds which are authorized to be issued by the twenty-first section of this bill, but for no other purpose or purposes. 23. The council of said town may negotiate any loan or loans, for the purpose of improving the streets, lighting the same, buying necessary real estate, erecting public buildings, supplying the town with water, and for other purposes; and shall have authority to issue registered and coupon bonds for the said loan or loans, payable not more than twenty years after the date of said bonds, unless such loan or loans be made for the purpose of supplying the town with water, in which case the bonds may be made payable not more than forty years after their date; and said bonds shall bear interest at a rate no greater than eight per centum, payable semi-annually: provided that two-thirds of the council of said town shall approve and authorize said loan or loans: and provided, further, that said loan or loans shall be sanctioned by three-fifths of the qualified voters of said town voting upon the question; which three-fifths shall include a majority of the votes cast by those tax-payers of the town, at such election, who pay a tax on real or personal property assessed at five hundred dollars or upwards; and, also, a majority of the registered voters of said town; to be ascertained by a vote taken and conducted in the manner authorized for any election under the charter of the said town, after having given notice thereof, by publication for four weeks successively, in one or more of the newspapers published in the said town. And at any election held under this section, each ballot shall be endorsed with the name of the voter, which shall be inspected by the officer or officers conducting the election at their respective voting places: and provided further, that the counsel of said town shall, annually, invest in Virginia state or United States bonds, as a sinking fund, such proportion of the revenue of said town as shall be equal, in cash value, to one-twentieth of said loan or loans; or in case said loan or loans be made for the purpose of supplying the town with water, such proportion of such revenue as shall be equal, in cash value, to one-fortieth of the loan or loans made for that purpose; which sinking fund shall be used exclusively for payment of the bonds issued for said loan or loans. Any bond issued under the provisions of this section, shall be regularly numbered, signed by the mayor, clerk and treasurer, and recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose. 24.
