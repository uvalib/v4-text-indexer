There will be additions to both. A complete catalogue will be issued giving full information. If interested, write at once for one. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. Summer rates are given by the railroads to this point. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give three plays. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. [8] RAILWAY RATES.âAt the present time on account of war conditions and the new problems of railroad administration, no definite announcement about railroad rates can be made. However, those attending should be sure to inquire of their local ticket agent, a few days before leaving for Charlottesville, about special rates, as they have been tentatively promised. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $5.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $5.00 to $6.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a double room. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 15th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, conducted by Mr. S. I. Carter, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $5.00 for a single week. $18.00 a month or $4.50 per week, if paid weekly, or $25.00 for the session of forty-one days. A lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see full catalogue, or write to Miss Bertha Deane, Secretary, University, Virginia. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. [9] Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virignia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. IMPORTANT NOTICE.âEvery teacher who is applying for a Virginia State Teachers' Summer School Professional Certificate of any kind should bring with her and before registering have whatever certificate she holds and which she desires to use as a basis of entrance on such professional work, approved by a representative of the Department of Public Instruction who will be present for that purpose. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. The Virginia certificates with which the courses of study at the University Summer School are immediately concerned are the following: The Elementary Professional CertificateâFor Primary and Grammar Grades. The Special CertificateâFor High School Teachers. The Collegiate CertificateâFor High School Teachers. The Collegiate Professional CertificateâFor High School Teachers. Courses will also be offered to meet the requirements of the Department of Public Instruction for High School graduates, who wish to obtain certificates. There will also be courses preparing for the State Examinations for first and second grade certificates. A Special Institute will be held at Midway School Building for those preparing for the State Examinations for first and second grade certificates. Observation work will be provided by the vacation school held in the same building. PREPARATION FOR STATE EXAMINATION FOR FIRST AND SECOND GRADE CERTIFICATES The State Examinations will be held at the Summer School July 25, 26, 1918. Heretofore these courses have been offered at the University, but last year a much better arrangement was made with Supt. Johnson and the Charlottesville School Board, whereby the classes were held in Midway School building. The advantages of this plan are: [10] 1. The work is given in one building, the classes are divided into sections small enough for drill, the periods are forty-five minutes each, and the Topical Outlines furnished by the Department are strictly followed and thus a thorough review guaranteed. 2. A vacation school will be in daily session in the building affording an excellent opportunity for observation work in all the grades, and special demonstration work in primary grades will be given. 3. The afternoons and evenings will be open for extra work in special subjects and for the general lectures and entertainments which are such attractive and valuable features of the University Summer School. 4. Excellent boarding accommodations at very reasonable rates may be obtained in the vicinity of Midway School building, thus relieving the congestion at the University and reducing somewhat the cost of living. All teachers desiring to secure accommodations in Charlottesville should apply to Dr. J. G. Johnson, Charlottesville, Va. 5. Those registering for this course will be entitled to all the privileges of the Summer School without additional cost. The Registration fee for Virginia teachers is $1.50 for the term of six weeks. IMPORTANT NOTICE Complete catalogue of the Summer School will only be sent to those who are sufficiently interested in receiving one to write for it. If you contemplate attending any Summer School, you should get a copy of the complete announcement of the University of Virginia Summer School before making a final decision. Your name and address on a postal card, addressed to Miss Bertha Deane, Secretary, will insure your receiving one promptly.
