ANNOUNCEMENTS The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academics and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional or life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. In addition to courses for high school teachers, the demand for courses for primary and grammar grade teachers is fully met. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. The large Education Building with laboratories for Manual Arts and Domestic Arts will be ready for occupancy this summer. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 A. M. to 1:30 P. M., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 P. M. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopÃ¦dias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, and a brief prayer and song service. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used when held in the chapel is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. When the weather permits the service is held out of doors on the north steps of the Rotunda. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director. No fee will be charged for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. Last session a Lyceum Course consisting of twenty high class entertainments was given for $2.00 for a season ticket. The numbers included the Frank Lea Short Players, Evan Williams, John Kendrick Bangs, Henry Southwick, The Mary Sherrier Concert Company, and similar attractions. This year contracts have already been made for three plays each by the Frank Lea Short Company and the Coburn Players, and for a return engagement by the Mary Sherrier Company, Dr. H. S. Southwick, Henry Hatfield, Karl Jansen, and many others will be arranged. This has proven one of the very best features of the Summer School. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 13th and July 18th will be devoted to the study of problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication; improved methods of cooperation; the improvement of sanitary conditions; good roads; etc. Especial emphasis is to be placed on woman's work in the country, and the country preacher. Distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in these conferences. There has been no more helpful, interesting, and vital enterprise connected with the Summer School than this conference. It is of interest not only to the students attending the Summer School, but to county superintendents, progressive farmers, and citizens' improvement leagues. The proceedings of the Conference for last year were published and distributed and there was a wide-spread demand for copies. Many similar conferences have been organized as the result of this one. The Virginia State Horticultural Society will meet in connection with the Conference on Wednesday, July 15. Governor Stuart, of Virginia, has already accepted an invitation to make an address on the 15th and Secretary Houston, of the United States Department of Agriculture, has been invited. The chief topics for the remainder of the week will center around the Rural Church, and a large gathering of country preachers and leaders is expected. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates. At a meeting of the Conference Committee of the Southeastern Passenger Association, the individual lines announced that they would authorize fares for the University Summer School on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 for the round trip. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the applicant should write promptly to the Director of the Summer School, or Mr. Joseph Richardson, Secretary Southeastern Passenger Association, Atlanta, Ga. Reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following dates: June 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th. The Southern Railway Company, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, the Norfolk and Western Railway Company, and all railways within this territory will co-operate in the sale of these reduced rate tickets. Application has also been made to the Trans-Continental Passenger Association for similar rates, from the territory west of the Mississippi, and teachers coming from the Western states should write to the Director of the Summer School for instructions. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. Announcement of dates will be made later by the Department of Public Instruction. Application has been made to have them correspond with the above. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 22nd to July 1st, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. A committee of ladies from the Y. W. C. A. will assist in welcoming teachers attending for the first time. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single rooms and one hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 22nd. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Double rooms will be furnished with two single beds complete, unless a double bed is especially desired; one chiffonier, except where there are more than two in room; one rocking chair or one morris chair and two single chairs. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.75 a week. The University Commons will be managed this year by Mr. Charles Jaimes a caterer and restaurateur of wide experience. A Restaurant a la Carte and lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee, to Mr. C. H. H. Thomas, Assistant Bursar, University, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, see page 68. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Wednesday, June 24th, at 8:30 A. M. Students should be present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday except possibly on Saturday, June 27th, when classes will meet at the usual hours. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Tuesday, August 4th, Wednesday and Thursday, August 5th and 6th, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to six buildingsâthe Education Building, Cabell Hall. Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory, Rotunda and the Law Building. REGISTRATION.âTuesday, June 23rd, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 24th will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in the New Education Building, will be open continuously June 23rd, 24th, and 25th from 8:30 a. m. until 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, July 1st, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 23rd, 24th and 25th should enter twenty days prior to July 23rd. Promptly at 9:30 Tuesday morning, June 23rd, all applicants for registration will assemble in the auditorium of the New Education Building for instructions in regard to filling out their cards, the location of lecture rooms, and for consultation with members of the faculty in regard to the courses of study they desire to pursue, or any other matters upon which information is desired. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive a card with space for name and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be presented to the Registrar, after it has been filled out, for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive two cards filled out and signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, together with the fee, if any, for each course. The Bursar will sign and return one card to the student, who should present it to the instructors in charge of the courses prescribed on the card. The student, after presenting the card to the various instructors for enrollment in the classes, will retain the same as a receipt from the Bursar, and for future use. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit students to any course not mentioned on their registration cards, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. IMPORTANT NOTE.âEvery teacher who is applying for a Virginia State Teachers' Summer School Professional Certificate of any kind should bring with her and when registering file whatever certificate she holds and which she desires to use as a basis of entrance on such professional work. NON-VIRGINIA TEACHERS.âThe regulations in regard to teachers' certificates and the requirements for entrance to certain courses in the Summer School do not apply to teachers from other states than Virginia unless they desire to apply for a Virginia Teachers' certificate. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, students should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of their boarding place or the number and location of their room in the University. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of twelve dollars will be charged each person who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. Fees for Virginia Teachers.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee attached to each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Fee for Course of Entertainments.âA Lyceum Course of high grade entertainments and lectures will again be provided, as announced on page 12. There will be altogether about twenty entertainments and lectures, for many of which a single admission of $1 to $1.50 is usually charged. Some of the plays will be "Pomander Walk," "Merry Wives of Windsor," and "Robin Hood" by the Frank Lea Short Company; "The Taming of the Shrew," "Joan d'Arc" and "Iphigenia" by the Coburn Players; no one of which could be seen for less than the prices mentioned. Season tickets of admission to all the entertainments will be sold to registered students of the Summer School for $2.50, though no person will be required to purchase such ticket. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. When all of the certificates issued by the Director, which are required for any State Teachers' certificate applied for have been received, the Department of Public Instruction should be notified, and the appropriate State Teachers' certificate will be issued in exchange for the individual certificates noted above. Notice of the completion of courses counted towards University credit should be made to the Registrar of the University of Virginia. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. (f) Courses which satisfy the conditions above stated will be credited toward the B. A. and B. S. degrees offered in the College of the University as follows: 1. Courses in which not less than thirty (30) hours of lecture instruction are given will be credited as one session hour. 2. Courses in which not less than thirty hours of lecture instruction and not less than sixty (60) hours of laboratory instruction is given will be credited as two sessional hours. (g) No student wishing University credit will be permitted to take more than three courses in one session except by special permission of the Director upon the recommendation of the professors offering the courses he desires to take. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a certificate issued in this State. In this case only state certificates from other states will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work.

Credit will be allowed for such practical work as is completed, and the remainder may be taken during the regular University session without requiring attendance upon the sessions of the class and without additional fee. BIOLOGY The courses in biology have been organized with two ends in view. First, to give teachers adequate training to carry courses in botany, zoÃ¶logy and biology in their public school work and to give them instruction that will supplement their work in physiology, hygiene and agriculture. Second, to enable premedical students to fulfill the medical entrance requirements as prescribed by the American Medical Association in June 1913. 1. Botany.âThis course is outlined primarily to give the student a knowledge of how plants live, grow and propagate themselves, and of their structure. An introduction to the systematic study and naming of ferns and flowering plants will be included in this course. The teacher completing this work will be prepared to place an introductory course of botany in his or her high school curriculum. This work will also supplement, in a helpful manner, his or her work in drawing geography and physiology. No text-book required. Laboratory fee for teachers $1.00, for premedical students and for those seeking University credit $10.00, which fee includes the registration fee. Daily, 8:30 to 9:30; Laboratory 9:30 to 11:30; Laboratory for premedical students and University credit students 11:30 to 12:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Zoology.âThis course is outlined primarily to give the student a knowledge of how animals live, grow and propagate themselves, and of their structure. The teacher completing this work will be prepared to place an introductory course of ZoÃ¶logy in his or her high school curriculum. This work will also supplement, in a helpful manner, his or her work in drawing, geography and physiology. No text-book will be required. Laboratory fee for teachers $1.00, for premedical students and for those seeking University credit $10.00, which fee includes the registration fee. Daily, 2:30 to 3:30; Laboratory 3:30 to 5:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional Certificate Advanced GradeâBiology, 1 and 2; Summer School Professional CertificateâCollege GradeâBiology 1 and 2. University Credit.âStudents who complete the work of either of these courses, together with at least thirty additional laboratory periods in experimental work, will be given credit for a term's work in a B1 course of biology. FIELD BOTANY The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated should be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily exercises will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth. Rotunda, Room 3. Text-Book.âGray's Manual of Botany. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade and College Grade.

A daily discussion of the elementary principles of the science will be held and simple lecture table demonstrations made. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Professor Bird. West Range Laboratory. 2. Laboratory Course for High School Teachers.âThe sole object of this course is to train each member of the class to give laboratory instruction in secondary schools; the situation that is likely to confront each one will be considered individually. The following topics will be discussed: the particular branches of the subject which should be taught high school students; the apparatus and chemicals necessary and their cost; how to equip a laboratory and how to make the best use of facilities likely to be found in a high school. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that the pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changes, especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, 2 hours before 2 P. M. Professor Bird and Professor Edgar. West Range Laboratory. 3. The Principles of General Chemistry.âThis course is offered especially for those who desire University credit in general chemistry, or who are preparing to enter some medical school requiring chemistry for entrance. It will deal mainly with the more important phenomena of inorganic chemistry and the fundamental laws of chemical science. Daily, hours to be arranged. Professor Bird. 4. Laboratory Course.âThe facilities of the laboratory and library are offered to those who wish to do special work in general or analytical chemistry. The instruction in this course will be such as to meet the needs of the following groups of students: those who desire experience in the analytical methods used in a particular line they may seek to enter; those who contemplate taking a civil service examination in chemistry and who wish additional laboratory instruction; those who need additional laboratory experience in order to meet the entrance requirements of professional schools; those who desire to apply for University credit. Daily, hours to be arranged. Professor Bird and Professor Edgar. West Range Laboratory. 5. Household Chemistry.âThis course is to be given in connection with the work in domestic science. The lectures will consider the chemistry of air, water, food, and sanitation, with reference to the processes that go on in the home. So far as their previous training will permit, students will be expected to study experimentally the composition of pure and impure air; the chemistry of combustion; the composition of cleansing agents, their reactions with "hard" water, their effects on fabrics, etc.; the chemistry of disinfectants; the composition of foods and the changes they undergo when cooked; the chemistry of fermentation and decay; the adulteration and preservation of food. The laboratory work will consume about two hours a day. Daily, lectures 8:30 to 9:30, laboratory hours to suit, before 2 P. M. Professor Bird and Professor Edgar. West Range Laboratory.

CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY It will be the aim of the courses in Latin and Greek to open to all teachers and students the advantages of University instruction in those subjects. Courses 1-4 are especially intended to illustrate the teaching of Latin in the secondary schools. Courses 5-7 are intended to open to teachers and summer students the more important fields of college Latin. The desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is specially commended to all who wish to reap the full cultural and scientific benefit of the college courses in Latin. Greece is the fountain head of European culture, and Rome its universalizer and transmitter to the modern world. The instruction will aim to exhibit these relations and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. Course 1 is preparatory. Thereafter the work is organized in all courses as follows: Latin languageâsystematic study of Latin grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition; Latin literatureâsystematic study of the Latin authors, as nearly as possible in culture-historical sequence; Roman lifeâsystematic study of Roman culture-history in English, in conjunction with the reading of the authors. 1.

ENGLISH The courses in English are designed to meet the needs of the following groups of students: present or prospective high school teachers; professional or technical students who have entered upon their professional courses and found that their training in English is so defective as to interfere with their prospects in their chosen professions; students preparing for college entrance examinations; students conditioned on their entrance examinations or in their college courses at other institutions; college professors and instructors who may be especially interested in methods of teaching English; teachers in elementary schools who are interested in language study for small children. It is desirable that all students of English take advantage of the work in composition, upon which special emphasis will be laid. Private conferences for criticism and personal supervision of theme writing will be arranged for by the instructor. 1. Advanced English Grammar for High School and College Teachers.âThis course is designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods of teaching it.

Rhetoric and Composition.âThe purpose of this course is three-fold: first, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the text-book, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage among teachers and pupils alike good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. Short themes will frequently be called for and several longer papers required. Weekly personal conferences will be held at hours to be appointed. Text-Books.âEspenshade's Composition and Rhetoric (D. C. Heath); Nutter, Hersey, and Greenough's Specimens of Prose Composition (Ginn &amp; Co.). Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Myers.

The course will be conducted mainly by lectures and class assignments, but parallel reading and occasional written reports will be required.

Daily, from 4:30 to 5:30. Professor Metcalf. Law Building, Room 2. 8. Advanced Composition: Narration and Exposition.âThis course in writing is designed for students whose work in general rhetoric and composition has advanced sufficiently to justify specialization in the types of discourse. Those who at a previous session have had the course in Rhetoric and Composition, No. 2, or its equivalent, will be prepared for this advanced class. The work will precede by a study and discussion of the principles of narration and exposition, especially the short story and the short essay, by critical reading of some of the best specimens from recent American authors, and by exercise in both types. Text-Books.âEsenwein's Writing the Short-Story (Hinds, Noble, &amp; Eldridge); Canby's English Composition in Theory and Practice (Macmillan); specimens of stories and essays from the best current magazines.

Elementary Grammar.âThis course aims primarily at giving teachers a deeper, surer knowledge of the subject matter of grammar, and those completing the work satisfactorily should find themselves thoroughly, prepared for the State examination in this subject. The instruction will cover the work of the seventh and eighth grades. Language will be considered mainly from the functional side, and presented so as to provide training in the actual process of thinking. There will be a condensed study of the essential features of descriptive grammar, with especial emphasis upon the more difficult points âthe abstract noun, the comparison of adjectives, the function of case, the personal pronoun, all phases of analysis, and, above all, the verb and the verbals. Frequent touches of comparative and historical grammar will be employed for the sake of the new light and interest to be gained therefrom. There will be, in addition, some consideration of the historical development of grammar teaching, the elementary schools, the relation of grammar to language work, and grammar as a record of usage rather than a law of usage.

SCHOOL MUSIC Courses for Supervisors of Music.âThese courses are primarily intended for the training of supervisors of music and special teachers of music in the public schools. In order to complete the work and receive a supervisor's certificate, it is required to attend three summer sessions. Detailed information in regard to home study during the academic year may be had on application to Professor â. Courses for Grade Teachers.âThe probability is that the near future will witness a requirement made by school boards and state boards of education, demanding that the grade teacher shall qualify in music as she must qualify in every other subject in the elementary curriculum. Such a requirment is already in force in several states. This makes a special course of music for grade teachers an actual necessity. A teacher who takes the first-year and second-year courses and completes the work satisfactorily, will have received thorough training in sight reading, in ear training and dictation, will have taken an elementary course in melody, and will have received instruction in the methods of presenting public school music. It gives the teacher as much freedom in knowledge of methods and materials in music as in the subjects of geography, spelling, arithmetic, and the like. Courses for First Year Students. 1. Sight ReadingâA. This is an elementary course. The requirements for the completion of this course include the ability to read at sight simple music, such as is taught in the first four grades of the public schools, using Latin syllables. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor â. Madison Hall. 2. DictationâA. (Study of tone and rhythm). This course covers the first four grades of public school music. The subject matter of music is presented first to the sense of hearing. In this course the student gains power to think tones and to sense rhythms, and at the same time acquires a practical knowledge of scale relations and the application of the Latin syllables used in sight reading. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 3. MaterialâA. This course is devoted to the material for the kindergarten and the first four grades in music. It also includes the presentation of material, and the methods of teaching rote songs.

Thursday and Fridays, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor â. Madison Hall. 8. DictationâB. This course deals with the problems of tone and rhythm included in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades of public school music. The purpose of this course in ear training and dictation is to make the student familiar with scale relations, simple chromatic inflections, and the simpler rhythms. It thus becomes of direct value, both in sight reading and in listening to music. Special lessons are provided in showing how to prepare and present dictation lessons, both oral and written, in the classroom. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 9. MaterialâB. This course requires the study of charts and books employed in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grammar grades. The development of the subject and the interrelation of songs and studies are emphasized. Sight reading of words and music simultaneously, supplements the singing with the syllable names. The courses in Material A and B are given by experienced supervisors. The methods employed are those used in the schoolroom. These courses, therefore, become a laboratory demonstration of the material and methods used in teaching music in the public schools from the kindergarten to the high school. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 10. MethodsâB. This course includes methods for the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grammar grades, and is open only to students who have completed Methods A.

The many difficult problems which confront the music teacher in the high school and the normal school are carefully studied: such as the arrangement and distribution of voices, programs for the high school music recitations, supplementary music, formation of school orchestras and glee clubs, the relation of high school music to the grades and its place as a credit study in the curriculum, and the means of cultivating the musical taste and ideals of the school and community. A prominent feature of the work in this class is a practical course in conducting. Each pupil will be required to prepare and conduct choral selections under the supervision of the instructor. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 13. Practice TeachingâC. Practical use of the material of all grades, and application of methods of teaching, are required. The students of this course demonstrate their understanding of the principles of school music in lessons given to a class under the supervision of the instructor. The presentation of the material, its relation to what the pupil has already acquired, the text to be studied, and the principles to be illustrated by original blackboard work, form the basis of the lesson. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 14. HarmonyâC. This is a practical course in music writing and analysis. The analysis of melodies, on scale and chord basis, and the art of writing for four voices from the subject of daily lessons, for which considerable written work is demanded.
