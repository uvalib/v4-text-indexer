He left a memorandum stating his desire that there be placed on his tombstone the following inscription: Here lies Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of Independence, Of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, And Father of the University of Virginia. 2. Morison, Samuel Eliot, The Founding of Harvard College. Cambridge, 1935, p. 264; 3. The earliest printed form of this story seems to be in Clap, Thomas, The Annals or History of Yale-College, New Haven, 1766, pp. 3,4. The authenticity of certain details â the date, and whether the books were actually given or merely offered â has been questioned, for example by Dexter, Franklin Bowditch, The Founding of Yale College (in his A Selection of Miscellaneous Historical Papers of Fifty Years, New Haven, 1918, pp. 59-83), and by Oviatt, Edwin, The Beginnings of Yale, 1701-1826, New Haven, 1916, pp. 159-161. But there seems to be agreement that the offering of books marked the beginning of the College. 4. A detailed account is given in The Early Years of the University Library by Sarah Dowlin Jones in the Fall 1950 Bicentennial Issue of The Library Chronicle issued by the Friends of the University of Pennsylvania Library. The Academy was opened for classes in 1751, and the charter of the combined Academy, College, and Charitable School of Philadelphia was granted in 1755. The College Library also inherited the services of Peter Collinson, who had acted as foreign agent for the Philadelphia Library Company since 1732. 5. The letter from William Dickson to Eleazar Wheelock, dated 22 April 1763, and announcing this gift, has been preserved in the Dartmouth Library. A list of the twenty titles is given in Shores, pp. 97, 98. See also Shores, p. 46. 6. Collins, Varnum Lansing, Princeton, New York, 1914, p. 28; Wertenbaker, Thomas Jefferson, Princeton 1764-1896, Princeton, 1946, p. 106.

Full accounts of the acquisition of Jefferson's second library for the Library of Congress are given in Johnston, pp. 65-104, in Mearns, pp. 15-25, and in the Peden dissertation, pp. 142-155. 16. Virginia, Acts of General Assembly, 1823-1824, p. 11 (6 March 1824). This appropriation was contingent on the payment by the Federal Government of a claim presented by Virginia for advances and expenditures by the State for local defense during the War of 1812-1815. 17. Manuscript minutes of University of Virginia Board of Visitors for 7 April 1824. 18. Minutes of Board of Visitors for 5 April 1824. 19. The fullest account of Gilmer is given in Davis, Richard Beale, Francis Walker Gilmer: Life and Learning in Jefferson's Virginia, Richmond, 1939. The quotation from Gilmer is taken from a letter written in Edinburgh 26 July 1824 to Major David Watson, the letter being printed in full in Davis's biography, pp. 213-214. 20. The "Catalogue furnished by Dr. Samuel Parr' is in the manuscript collection of the Alderman Library. It consists of eighteen manuscript pages, folio size, it is dated 23 August 1824, and it bears also the name of Benjamin Kennedy, who may have acted as amanuensis. There is a sketch of Samuel Parr (1747-1825) by Leslie Stephen in vol. 43, pp. 356-364, of the Dictionary of National Biography. 21. The mention of Bohn appears in a letter from Gilmer to Jefferson, written in New York 30 November 1824, shortly after Gilmer landed on his return. This letter is printed in Correspondence of Thomas Jefferson and Francis Walker Gilmer, 1814-1826, edited by Richard Beale Davis, Columbia, South Carolina, 1946, pp. 121, 122. 22. On 19 January 1825 in fact. The arrival in Charlottesville is recorded in the University Proctor's Day Book (1821-1828, p. 321) and in the Proctor's Journal (vol. 2, 1819-1828, p. 348), both of which are in the manuscript collection at the Alderman Library. The express charges amounted to $25.38, and the payment to Col. Bernard Peyton of Richmond, who handled the transportation of these books from England, was of $50.41. 23. The statement is quoted as follows in the Peden dissertation, pp. 171, 172:- "Mr. Hansford, of the County of King George, had made an early present of some good books to the University. Mr. Bernard More Carter, a native of Virginia, now resident in London, has lately sent a valuable collection of between 3. and 400 volumes, well chosen, and well bound; and more recently, Mr. Coolidge, a gentleman of Boston, has given nearly a hundred volumes, of peculiar choice and value, and notice of other intended donations have been recieved from others who may be assured that their talent shall not be hidden in the earth." In the 1828 Catalogue the titles of the three gifts mentioned are listed. Under the name of Mr. Theod: Hansford there are eight titles, fifteen volumes; under that of Mr. Bernard M. Carter there are seventy-two titles, 337 volumes; and under that of Mr. Joseph Coolidge, there are thirty-eight titles, eighty-five volumes. 24. The statements concerning the arrangements with William Hilliard of Cummings, Hilliard and Company are taken from Cometti. 25. The list was enclosed with Jefferson's letter to Hilliard of 3 June 1825, printed in Cometti, p. 25. A copy of the list, apparently in the handwriting of Nicholas P. Trist, is preserved in the manuscript collection of the Alderman Library. See a fuller statement in Note 54. 26. This manuscript catalogue, dated 16 May 1825, is preserved in the rare book and manuscript division of the Alderman Library. On the first page it records the following totals:- 168 folios 388 4tos 1609 8vos 171 12 mos et infra 2358 in 526 general articles by another computation 2,436 vols. With alphabetical index. Perhaps by "articles" Librarian Kean meant titles. 27. See letters from Jefferson to Cummings &amp;Hilliard, written by Jefferson at Monticello 9 and 22 April 1826 and printed in Cometti, pp. 39-44. 28. The statement in the manuscript Faculty Minutes for 19 December 1826 is as follows: "On motion of Mr. Key, a Catalogue of the Books of the Library is ordered to be printed under the Superintendence of Mr. Key and Dr. Dunglison." 29. The catalogue was printed in 1828 by Gilmer, Davis &amp;Company of Charlottesville. It is the 1945 reproduction in facsimile that is referred to in these notes as 1828 Catalogue. 30. A count of the titles in the 1828 Catalogue gives a total of 3,111. For a few titles the number of volumes is not indicated. The total for those that are indicated is 8,099. The exact total of volumes was therefore something over 8,100. 31. The American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge for the Year 1830... Boston, Published by Gray and Bowen, New York, By G. and C. and H. Carvill. The list of "Colleges in the United States" is on pp. 226, 227. 32. The present estimate is fifty-two volumes for The Papers of Thomas Jefferson... Julian P. Boyd, Editor... Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1950- 33. Pennell, E. R. and J., The Life of James McNeill Whistler, new and revised edition, Philadelphia, Lippincott, 1911, p. 171. 34. That Jefferson's education was in effect gained from a succession of four private tutors is pointed out in Malone, p. 55. The college phase of it was the result of chaotic conditions in the William and Mary Faculty during Jefferson's student days (1760-1762). As is stated in Malone, p. 51: "When Jefferson arrived on the scene... [Professor Small] was then teaching physics, metaphysics, and mathematics, and through force of circumstances was soon teaching practically everything." Of William Douglas, it is recorded in Kimball, p. 31: "He appears to have had a considerable library as his books were valued at 150 pounds in the inventory of his estate." The footnote reference is to the "Louisa County [Virginia] Records, Will Book No. 5, pp. 196-97." Of James Maury, Mrs. Kimball's volume records: "At the Reverend Mr. Maury's he came in contact with a library such as he had never before known, and it is inevitable that his own passion for books was stimulated by it. It is a source of regret that no catalogue or list of Maury's books has been preserved. The inventory that was filed with his will merely makes mention of `1 Book Press with 400 volumes of Books, 44 Pamphlets.' " The footnote reference is to the "Albemarle County Will Book No. 2, p. 256." The influence exerted by William Small and George Wythe is discussed in Malone, pp. 102-104. Jefferson succinctly paid tribute to these teachers in his Autobiography, Lipscomb, pp. 3 and 4. When George Wythe died in 1806, his private library was willed to Jefferson. Cf. Peden dissertation, pp. 136, 137. 35. Kimball, pp. 53, 102, 103. 36. It is stated in Mearnes, p. 4, that full privileges of the New York Society Library were granted to the members of "The Gen'l Gov't of the United States" while those members were assembled in New York; and that similar privileges were later extended in Philadelphia by the Library Company in that city. Of course the Library of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia was familiar to Jefferson, as he was not only an active member but was, in January 1797, elected its President. It is taken for granted that Jefferson became acquainted with libraries abroad during the six years (17841789) of his diplomatic mission. His interest, however, was then concentrated more on booksellers and printers than on libraries, and he bought books steadily for himself and for others, notably for James Madison. 37. The Library of Congress was established in 1800. But it was during Jefferson's presidency (1801-1809) that the enabling act, the first charter of governance, was passed by Congress (1802). Jefferson's letter of 14 April 1802 to Senator Abraham Baldwin concerning the selection of books is printed in Mearns, pp. 12, 13. As President, Jefferson appointed the first two Librarians of Congress, John James Beckley (1802-1807) and Patrick Magruder (1807-1815). 38. An example is a letter of 3 August 1771 to Robert Skipwith. This letter and its List of Books for a Private Library are printed in Boyd, vol. 1, pp. 76-81. The list is arranged by subjects, and the price is indicated for each book. Among other somewhat similar letters are the following:- To Peter Carr, 19 August 1785. Lipscomb, vol. 5, pp. 82-87. To Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., 27 August 1786. Ford, vol. 5, pp. 174-179. To Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., 6 July 1787. Ford, vol. 5, pp. 298-301. To Peter Carr, 10 August 1787. Ford, vol. 5, pp. 322-328. To John Garland Jefferson, 11 June 1790. Ford, vol. 6, pp. 70-77. 39. See letter to John Minor, 30 August 1814. Ford, vol. 11, pp. 420426. Jefferson's statement to Minor was: "I have at length found the paper of which you requested a copy. It was written nearly 50. years ago for the use of a young friend whose course of reading was confided to me; and it formed a basis for the studies of others subsequently placed under my direction, but curtailed for each in proportion to his previous acquirements and future views. I shall give it to you without change, except as to the books recommended to be read; later publications enabling me in some of the departments of science to substitute better, for the less perfect publications which we then possessed. In this the modern student has great advantage." Kimball, p. 79, notes that the "young friend" was Bernard Moore of Chelsea, King William County, Virginia. 40. A booklet entitled A Virginia Gentleman's Library, containing an Introduction by Arthur Pierce Middleton, the Jefferson-Skipwith correspondence of 1771, and the list of books was issued in 1952 by Colonial Williamsburg as "a keepsake to those attending the joint meeting of the Bibliographical Society of America and the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia on May 9-10, 1952." 41. Kimball, pp. 12, 13; Malone, pp. 32, 33. 42. A list of the "Books Purchased by Thomas Jefferson Through the Office of the Virginia Gazette" is given in the Peden dissertation, pp. 228-231. 43. The entry is "Dr. Emmet for a Book." Cf. Peden dissertation, p. 107. John P. Emmet was Professor of Natural History in the earliest Faculty of the University of Virginia. He was a cousin of the famous Irish patriot. 44. The following list of booksellers with whom Jefferson is known to have done business has been culled from the pages of the Peden dissertation, the numbers following the entries indicating pages in that dissertation. The Peden sources are chiefly the account books of Thomas Jefferson. In some cases the account book items are not very clear. Aiken (or Aitken), Robert. Philadelphia. 105, 110, 122. Aikman.

The original 1783 catalogue and list is in the possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society. Details concerning it are given in the Peden dissertation, pp. 73-75. 48. This catalogue (with some changes in form which did not please Jefferson) was printed toward the end of 1815 by Jonathan Elliott of Washington with the title Catalogue of the Library of the United States To Which Is Annexed, A Copious Index, Alphabetically Arranged. A full account of the catalogue is given in the Peden dissertation, pp. 75-82; and on pages 142-155 the Peden dissertation recounts with much detail the story of the sale of this library of Thomas Jefferson to the Federal Government. The same story, with emphasis on the party politics involved, is narrated with gusto by Mearns, pp. 16-25. Mearns concludes his record of the House roll call of eighty-one to seventy-one with the illuminating comment (p. 24), that "the purchase of Mr. Jefferson's library (however close the squeak) was not a triumph of the children of light over the powers of darkness, but a victory of the administration over the minority." As to the comparative sizes of the burned and of the purchased collections, Mearns states, on p. 15, quoting Congressional Librarian Spofford in 1876, that the Library of Congress "amounted only to 3,000 volumes up to the year 1814"; and, on p. 19, that the Jefferson collection was "said to contain 6,487 volumes." Some not inexpert estimates of the value of Jefferson's collection put it at the round figure of $50,000. Jefferson, however, accepted without demur the price, $23,950, offered by Congress. But the Peden dissertation shrewdly notes, p. 154, that Jefferson later referred to the transaction as "ceding" his library. 49. See letter of 10 June 1815 from Jefferson to John Adams, Lipscomb, vol. 14, p. 301. 50. "Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist" is one of Charles Lamb's Essays of Elia. 51. The sale catalogue of Jefferson's third private library was printed by Gales and Seaton of Washington and bore the title: Catalogue. President Jefferson's Library. A catalogue of the extensive and valuable library of the late President Jefferson, (copied from the original MS., in his handwriting, as arranged by himself,) to be sold at auction, at the Long Room, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington City, by Nathaniel P. Poor, on ... February, 1829 ... In his brilliant essay on "Thomas Jefferson, Librarian" in Three Americanists, Philadelphia, 1839, pp. 68-96, the late Randolph G. Adams told of the final location of a few volumes from this dispersed collection. 52. The use of the vague expression "three or four" is a confession of puzzlement. On page 78 of Librarian Frederick W. Page's article on "Our Library" in the November 1895 issue of the Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia, the following four titles are given of books presented by Jefferson during his lifetime: American Philosophical Transactions, Vol. 2, new series. Josse's Spanish Grammar and Exercises. Sales' Spanish Hive. Phantasm of an University, with Prolegomena, by Charles Kelsall. 4to. 1814. But on page 107 of the 1828 Catalogue, in the section on donations, there are only three titles recorded as having been given By MR. THOMAS JEFFERSON (Independently of a Testamentary Donation of his Library not yet appropriated to the University.) American Philosophical Transactions, vol. 2, new series Josse's Spanish Grammar &amp;Exercises Sales, Spanish Hive, Spanish However, on page 90 of the 1828 Catalogue, in the chapter on Architecture, Designing, Painting, Sculpture, and Music, there is this entry, but with indication that it is a folio volume: Kelsall, Phantasm of a University. London, 1814. 53. Jefferson drew on many for information. His respect for the counsel of the three who are named as examples is frequently revealed in his correspondence with them. George Ticknor was a Professor at Harvard, whom Jefferson and the Board of Visitors vainly tried to persuade to join the Faculty of the University of Virginia. James Madison the Statesman and James Madison the President of the College of William and Mary and the first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia were cousins. 54. This directive about works of mere amusement is a paraphrase of the ninth of eleven general statements with which Jefferson prefaced the list prepared for Cummings, Hilliard and Company. The title for the preface is "An Explanation of the Views on which this Catalogue has been Prepared." The eleventh of Jefferson's general statements is quoted in full in the paragraph which follows in the text of this historical sketch. That it can be quoted is a noteworthy piece of good fortune. This extraordinary list of desirable books in all fields of learning was evidently preserved in the Library in the Rotunda in two forms. The first was the list with the explanatory preface, the second was a copy of the list without the explanatory preface. (Since in the second form there are eleven leaves left blank at the beginning, there was very possibly the good intention of filling in the explanatory preface later.) In the summer of 1895, seventy years after the list had been compiled by Jefferson, the then Librarian, Frederick W. Page, prepared an article on "Our Library" for the Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia, and in it he quoted from a "manuscript volume" (obviously the with form) the explanatory preface in full, in the belief that it had never before been printed. Apparently he was correct in this belief. This article was dated 10 September 1895. But before it appeared in the November issue of the Alumni Bulletin there occurred the disastrous burning of the Rotunda on 27 October 1895 â and by the time the Page article had emerged into print, that manuscript volume had disappeared. The copy of the list without the explanatory preface was, however, among the items saved from the fire. That it was the 1825 list was clear from the following note, dated "June 3, 1825" and signed "Th. Jefferson Rector": "The preceeding [the spelling is of the note] catalogue is that of the books with the purchase of which Mr. Wm. Hilliard is charged on behalf of the University of Virginia." It was formerly conjectured that this copy was made by Jefferson's granddaughter, Virginia Randolph. But it now seems more likely that the handwriting is that of Nicholas P. Trist, a youthful admirer of Jefferson (and of this granddaughter, whom he afterwards married), who was from 1826 to 1829 Secretary of the Board of Visitors. At any rate, by adding this explanatory preface copied in 1895, a few weeks before the fire, to this list copied in 1825, we fortunately still have the full text of the Jefferson document which was so notable a contribution towards the establishment of the University of Virginia Library. 55. The importance of editions is suggested in the sixth of the general statements in the explanatory preface to the 1825 list. It is emphasized in the letters to Hilliard. Examples in Cometti can be found on pages 29, 31-34, 37. 56. Kimball, pp. 106-110. 57. Kimball, pp. 107, 108. Jefferson's An Essay Towards Facilitating Instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and Modern Dialects of the English Language was later, in 1851, printed by John F. Trow of 49 Ann Street, New York, by order of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. 58. The total number of titles (not volumes) in the 1825 list was 3,087. There were 450 in law under seven headings (21-27), 389 in history under five headings (1-5), 379 in science under seven headings (6-8, 11-13, 15), 328 in medicine under two headings (9, 10), 296 in ethics and religion under these two headings (19, 20), 253 in belles lettres under nine headings (31-39), 231 in geography (16), 197 in politics (28), and 178 in mathematics under two headings (17, 18). Other headings were technical arts, 77 titles, architecture, 45 titles, gardening, printing, sculpture, music, 21 titles, bibliography, 21 titles, philology, 153 titles, and polygraphical, 69 titles. 59. Of the eight medical authors mentioned by Jefferson, all are represented by writings in both this 1825 list for the Boston bookseller and in the 1828 Catalogue, except Benjamin Rush, who is omitted in the 1825 list. But Jefferson had four works of Rush's in his own third private library, which he had willed to the University; and he might also have felt assured that others would donate the writings of this well known American author. Rush is amply represented in the Pathology and Therapeutics chapter of the 1828 Catalogue. Here are brief notes concerning the eight respected leaders in medical theory who were recognized as such by the Sage of Monticello:- Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738) was a Dutch physician and a professor of medicine at the University of Leyden. William Cullen (1710-1740) was a Scottish physician and a professor of the institutes of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. William Harvey (1578-1657), an English physician, was the discoverer of the circulation of the blood. Hippocrates, the "Father of Medicine", was a Greek who lived about 400 B.C. His name is connected with a collection of medical books and with the Hippocratic Oath. Friedrich Hoffmann (1660-1742) was a German physician and a professor at Halle University. Benjamin Rush (1745-1813) was an American physician and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and was a friend of Jefferson. Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734) was a German chemist and physician. Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) was an English physicist and the founder of modern clinical medicine. He is sometimes called the English Hippocrates. 60. That the last visit to the University was in April 1826 is conjectured from Jefferson's letter of 22 April 1826 to William Hilliard, as printed in Cometti, p. 43. In the first paragraph of that letter Jefferson mentions "my last, of the 9th." In the second paragraph he states "I have been to the University since that ltr" â an abbreviation which may stand for "letter." He goes on to mention his inspection of the boxes of books, which was one of the purposes of his last visit. 61. There are several accounts, differing somewhat in details, of Jefferson's last visit to the University. The purpose was a conference with the youthful Librarian, William Wertenbaker, concerning the unopened boxes of books from the Boston bookseller and other library matters. Years later Wertenbaker wrote his story of the visit for Baldwin's Monthly, a house organ issued by Keen, Childs and Baldwin of New Jersey, wholesale manufacturers of ready-made clothing. This account was repeated in part in the Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia for April 1909, pp. 204, 205. It was retold twice in reminiscences by the Librarian's son, Col. Charles Christian Wertenbaker, in the Alumni Bulletin for May 1897, pp. 2125, and in the Alumni News for 21 January 1914, p. 118. Prof. James A. Harrison referred to the story in an article in the Alumni Bulletin for May 1896, pp. 1-7. In fuller detail it was given by the ninth Librarian, John S. Patton, in the Alumni Bulletin for October 1913, pp. 693-695, and by Prof. Francis H. Smith in the Alumni Bulletin for April 1914, pp. 160168. Professor Smith seems to have been in error in stating that Jefferson was seated "at one of the upper windows of the Rotunda." The house on the neighboring hill was Monticello. Nearly forty years before, on 12 August 1787, Jefferson had written to George Gilmer, "all my wishes end, where I hope my days will end, at Monticello." Cf. Ford, vol. 5, p. 330; Lipscomb, vol. 6, p. 265; and Malone, Dumas, Jefferson and the Rights of Men, Boston, 1951, p. 137.</field>

The Alderman Library building was erected in 1936-1938, and in May 1938 there were moved to it the books from the Rotunda and from several other buildings which at that time contained sundry school and special collections. 65. Examples are Kimball, Fiske, Thomas Jefferson Architect... with an Essay and Notes by Fiske Kimball, Boston, 1916; Kimball, Fiske, The Genesis of Jefferson's Plan for the University of Virginia, in Architecture, vol. 48, no. 6, December 1923, pp. 397-399; Lambeth, William Alexander, Thomas Jefferson as an Architect... Boston, 1913. 66. There is in Kimball, Fiske, Thomas Jefferson Architect, a chapter, pages 90-101, on "The Architectural Books Owned by Thomas Jefferson." This lists four editions of Palladio acquired at various times by Jefferson (the first Leoni London edition of 1715 in Italian, French, and English; the third Leoni London edition of 1742; an edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture translated into English by Richards; and the first edition in French, by de Cambray, published in Paris in 1650); there are listed also three editions of the French Bibliotheque d'Architecture de Jombert which contained material by or about Palladio. The text acquired for the University of Virginia Library on Jefferson's recommendation was an 1801 Italian edition in one volume. 67. A full story of the building of the Rotunda and its intended uses is given in Bruce, volume one, pages 260-269. Details are also given in Lambeth, Thomas Jefferson as an Architect, page 55. 68. The building-to-be is called the Library in minutes of the meetings of the Board of Visitors for 2 April 1821, 30 November 1821, 7 October 1822. The first use of the name Rotunda in the Visitors' minutes is for the meeting of 7 April 1823. 69. Harlan, Richard.

Figures for faculty and student loans and for faculty approvals of student loans during the first session have been obtained by checking the items in the manuscript circulation record against the names of the faculty and students as listed in the University of Virginia Catalogue for 1825. Of the students, William T. Maclin had the highest number, thirty-three, of times of borrowing during that session (the count is for times of borrowing, not of volumes borrowed).. Next to him were Henry E. Coleman, Benjamin H. Magruder, and Henry C. Thweat, with thirty-one times each. John Vaughan Kean and William Wertenbaker, the first two Librarians, both of whom were students during that session, were low in number of borrowings. Of the faculty, Thomas Hewitt Key, Professor of Mathematics with a Cambridge University background, led in number of borrowings, forty, and in approvals for student loans, 319. George Blaettermann, Professor of Modern Languages with a background of Heidelberg and Leipsig Universities, was second to Professor Key in approvals for student loans with 242; but the small number of his personal borrowings from the Library, twelve, possibly reflects his irritation over the policy of making faculty members subject to the library regulations. 68A. Abernethy, Thomas Perkins, Historical Sketch of the University of Virginia, Richmond, c1948, p.9; Bruce, vol. 2, pp. 230-232; Patton, pp. 274-277. 72. Following is a list of the eight original professors, Lomax receiving his appointment as Professor of Law in 1826. There are given the subjects of each professorship, the years of service at the University of Virginia, and the names of the institutions from which college training had been received. GEORGE BLAETTERMAN. Modern Languages (1825-1840). Educated at Heidelberg and Leipsiz Universities. CHARLES BONNYCASTLE. Natural Philosophy (1825-1827); Mathematics (1827-1840). Educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, England. ROBLEY DUNGLISON. Medicine (1825-1833). Educated at the Universities of London and Erlangen. JOHN PATTON EMMETT. Natural History, Chemistry (1825-1842). Educated at West Point and at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. THOMAS HEWITT KEY. Mathematics (1825-1827). Educated at Cambridge University. GEORGE LONG. Ancient Languages (1825-1828). Educated at Cambridge University. GEORGE TUCKER. Moral Philosophy (1825-1845). Educated at the College of William and Mary. JOHN TAYLOR LOMAX. Law (1826-1830). Educated at St. John's College, Annapolis. 73. Records of Professor Blaettermann's insurgency can be found in the Faculty Minutes for the following meetings: 5 July 1828 (concerning keys to library building); 2,5,8 November 1828 (concerning fines for professors); 5,8 November 1828 (concerning the gentleman's agreement); 7 October 1829 (concerning comments written in the margins of library books). 74. For record of authorization by professors of student loans see note 71. Edgar Allan Poe was a student during the second session and is recorded as having borrowed books from the Library on six dates, all in 1826, as follows:- "June 13. 1,3,4 vols. Rollin's A. hist." The entry in the 1828 catalogue, page 10, is Rollins, complete works, Fr. Paris 1807 60 vols. 8vo. Also Atlas, 1 vol. 4 to. The "A. hist." evidently meant Ancient History, the Histoire Ancienne of Charles Rollin's Oeuvres ComplÃ¨tes. This set, except for volumes 10 and 15, survived the Rotunda fire of 1895. "Aug. 8. 33,34 vols. Rollin (`hist. Romaine'). "These volumes belonged to the same set of Charles Rollin's Oeuvres ComplÃ¨tes, being the Histoire Romaine. "Aug. 15. 1 &amp;2 vols. Robertson's America." The entry in the 1828 catalogue, page 18, is Robertson's History of America, Dublin, 1777. 2 vols. 8vo. These two volumes by William Robertson survived the 1895 fire. "Aug. 29. 1 &amp;2 vols. Marshall's Washington." The entry in the 1828 catalogue, page 17, is Marshall's Life of Washington with Maps, Philadelphia, 1804, 5 vols. 8vo. The whole five volumes set by John Marshall survived the burning of the Rotunda. "Sept. 12. 9,10 Voltaire." The loan entry is so brief that this item is a puzzle. There were two Voltaire sets in the 1828 catalogue, page 101, which had a ninth and a tenth volume. They were Voltaire's Works complete, French, Paris, 1817, 25 vols. 8vo. and Voltaire's Collection of Letters, French, Paris, 1785, 12 vols. 8vo. The Alderman Library has a set of Recueil des Lettres de M. de Voltaire, Paris, 1785, lacking volume nine, which may have been the set listed in the 1828 catalogue. There seems to have been no 1817 Paris edition of the Oeuvres ComplÃ¨tes in 25 volumes. There was one of 56 volumes which appeared between 1817 and 1821, and the Library may have acquired only the first twenty-five of these. Volumes nine and ten contained poetry, the long poem "La Pucelle d'OrlÃ©ans" being in volume nine. The set originally owned by the University has disappeared and probably destroyed in the fire of 1895. There is another copy now in the Alderman Library. "Nov. 4. 1 &amp;2 Dufief's Natural display." The entry in the 1828 catalogue, page 25, is Dufief's Nature Displayed, Fr. &amp;Eng. Philadelphia, 1823, 2 vols. 8vo. This work by Nicholas Gouin Dufief, the full title being Nature Displayed, in her Mode of Teaching Language to Man: or, A New and Infallible Method of Acquiring a Language ... Adapted to the French, survived the burning of the Rotunda. For a careful discussion of those borrowings by Poe see Arthur Hobson Quinn, Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography, New York, 1941, pages 102-104. 75. The first regulations of the Library were drafted by Jefferson in that early spring of 1825 when he was busily preparing for the opening of the first session and compiling the book list for the Boston book agent. They were passed at a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on 5 March 1825, and were as follows, the capitals, punctuation, and spelling being copied as in the original minutes. "For the use and care of the library the board now establishes the following regulations. "The Professors of the University shall at all times have free use of the books of the library, in confidence that they will not keep them out longer than while in actual and active use, and leaving with the Librarian a note of the books borrowed. "Books may be lent to the Students of the university, by the Librarian, and by no other person, on a written Permit from a Professor whom such Student attends, specifying the day beyond which they shall not be retained. but it is meant that the books lent are for reading only, and not for the ordinary purpose of getting lessons in them as schoolbooks. "No Student shall carry any book borrowed from the Library, out of the precincts of the University; nor shall any Student be permitted to have more than three volumes in his possession at any time. "If a Student shall not return a borrowed book on or before the date limited in his Permit, he shall recieve no other until it be returned; and he shall pay moreover for every week's detention, beyond the limitation, 10. cents for a 12mo. or book of smaller size, 20. cents for an 8vo. 30. cents for a 4to. and 40. cents for a folio. "Not every book in the Library shall be free to be lent to Students, but such only as shall not be expressly prohibited by the Faculty on account of their rarity, value or liableness to injury. "No Student shall ever be in the Library but in presence of the Librarrian, or of some Professor whom he attends, nor shall be allowed to take any book from the shelves, nor remain in the room to read or consult any book, but during such presence. "If any Student deface, injure, or lose any book of the library, he shall pay the value of the book if defaced, double value if injured, and threefold, if lost; and shall be suspended from the privilege of borrowing during such term as the faculty shall adjudge. "On some one day of every week, during term, and during one hour of that day, (such day and hour to be fixed on by the Faculty) the Librarian shall attend in the Library, to recieve books returned, and to lend such others as shall be applied for according to rule. and at some one hour of every day (to be also fixed by the Faculty) the Librarian shall attend, if requested by any Professor, to lend to such Professor such book or books as he may require, &amp;to recieve any he may have to return. "The Librarian shall make an entry of every book lent, and cancel the same when returned, so that it may always be known in what hands every book is. "Strangers whom the Librarian may be willing to attend, may visit the library; but, to prevent derangement of the books, they are to take no book from the shelf, but in his presence. they may also be permitted to consult any book, to read in it, make notes or quotations from it, at the table, under such accomodations and arrangements as the Librarian shall prescribe, on his own responsibility. "Resolved that the salary of the Librarian be raised to the sum of 150. Dollars. "Resolved that when the monies, expected as before mentioned from the General government, shall be paid, the board consider it advisable to employ mr. Hilliard of the firm of Cummings, Hilliard and co. of Boston to purchase the library of the University, according to the Catalogue which has been made." 75A. Thomas Jefferson to John L. Thomas, 9 January 1825. A file copy by Jefferson is no. 2130 in the Jefferson Collection at the Alderman Library. The text is as follows: "Sir We have as yet no library nor consequently employment for a librarian, and [when] we need one we propose a compensation of 50. D. a year only, counting that some one of the professors will undertake it for that. the fact is also that a librarian must ever be a man of a high order of science and able to give to enquirers an account of the character and contents of the several books under his care. be pleased to accept the assurance of my great esteem &amp;respect. Th. J." As has been stated, these regulations and resolutions were adopted by the Board of Visitors on 5 March 1825. That their tenor was approved by the other members of the Board is evidenced by the equally strict and somewhat more elaborate regulations which were adopted at a meeting of the Visitors on 6 October 1826, three months after Jefferson's death. Minor changes were made or at least discussed during this period at meetings of the Visitors on 19 July 1827 and 7 July 1840, and by the Faculty at meetings held on 2 December 1826, 9, 17, and 27 October 1845, 1 July 1846, and 3 November 1846. 76. The letter of appointment of John Vaughan Kean as Librarian was dated 30 March 1825. There is a file draft (number 2164) among the Jefferson Papers in the Alderman Library. The text is as follows: "Sir You are hereby appointed Librarian to the University of Virginia, with a compensation of 150.D a year to be paid by the Proctor from the funds of the University. an important part of your charge will be to keep the books in a state of sound preservation, undefaced and free from injury by moisture or other accident, and in their stated arrangement on the shelves according to the method and order of their Catalogue. your other general duties and rules of conduct are prescribed in the printed collection of the enactments of the Board of Visitors, of these rules the Board will expect the strictest observance on your own part and that you use the utmost care &amp;vigilance that they be strictly observed by others. Given under my hand this 30th day of Mar. 1825. Th. J. Rector of the University" The letter of temporary appointment of William Wertenbaker as the second Librarian was dated 30 January 1826. The original and a file draft of the first paragraph (number 2283) are among the Jefferson Papers in the Alderman Library. The letter was printed (page 82) in Frederick W. Page's article on "Our Library" in the Alumni Bulletin, vol. 2, no. 3, November 1895, pp. 78-85. The text is as follows: "Sir The office of Librarian to the University of Virginia having become vacant by the resignation of mr Kean, and the authority of ultimate appointment being in the Board of Visitors, it becomes necessary in the meantime to place the library under the temporary care of some one; you are therefore hereby appointed to take charge thereof until the Visitors shall make their final appointment. you will be entitled to a compensation at the rate of 150. D. a year to be paid by the Proctor from the funds of the University. "An important part of your charge... [the text of this paragraph is identical with the text of the Kean letter] "Given under my hand this 30th day of January, 1826. Th.

See chapter I, note 24, of this historical sketch. 79. The story of the printing of the 1828 Catalogue is outlined in the following quotations from minutes of faculty meetings. There is no specific reference in the minutes of meetings of the Board of Visitors. It appears probable that the payment to the printer, Gilmer, Davis, &amp;Co. of Charlottesville, is merged in accounts of the Proctor which were approved by the Visitors. 19 December 1826. "On motion of Mr. Key, a Catalogue of the Books of the Library is ordered to be printed under the Superintendence of Mr. Key and Dr. Dunglison." 21 February 1827. "Resolved that the Proctor be recommended to purchase sufficient paper for 500 octave copies of the Library Catalogue about to be printed." 19 April 1827. "On motion Resolved that in preparing the catalogue of the Books of the Library for publication, the original prices of the books be inserted in the catalogue as far as it may be practicable to ascertain the prices, and where books have been presented to the University that the names of the donors be published on one of the pages of the catalogue and the initials of their names opposite to each donation in the catalogue." 22 May 1827. "The Chairman laid before the Faculty a letter from Mr. Wertenbaker stating certain difficulties which had occurred to him in pricing the catalogue of books as he was directed at the last meeting. Whereupon Mr. Tucker moved that the publication of the catalogue and the preparations which were here to and are ordered for the printing thereof be suspended until after the meeting of the Visitors." 10 September 1827. "On Motion Resolved that the Catalogue be printed without the prices. "On Motion ordered that in the catalogue the books in the Ancient &amp; foreign languages shall be published with their English names designating with suitable contractions which language they belong to." 13 October 1827. "Resolved that in printing the catalogue, the names of persons who have given Books to the Library, together with a Catalogue of the Books presented, be published at the end of the Catalogue." 15 February 1828. "On Motion - Resolved that Dr. Dunglison be appointed a committee to superintend the printing of the catalogue." [Professor Key had by this time resigned and returned to England.] The Catalogue appeared later in 1828. In 1945 it was reprinted in facsimile as number six of the University of Virginia Bibliographical Series, issued by the Alderman Library. 80. See Mearns, David C.

After the burning of the Rotunda in 1895 the Dewey Decimal System of Classification came gradually into use at the University of Virginia Library. A change to the Library of Congress Classification began in 1929. 82. More elaborate discussion of Jefferson's adaptation of Francis Bacon's classification of the fields of learning may be found in Adams, Randolph G., Three Americanists, Philadelphia, 1939, pp. 91-94; Page, Frederick W., "Our Library", in the Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia, vol. 2, no. 3, November 1895, pp. 79, 80; and in the Peden dissertation, pp. 72-85. 83. Of the twenty-nine "chapters" of the 1828 Catalogue, the twenty-eighth â Architecture, Designing, Painting, Sculpture, and Music â includes subjects which were not in the initial curriculum; and the twenty-ninth â Miscellaneous, including Poetry, Rhetoric, Education, &amp;c.- is a catch-all of the remaining subjects. The numbers of the other twenty-seven chapters are given below as they apply to the eight original Schools. 1. Ancient Languages - 1 2. Modern Languages - 2,3,4 3. Mathematics - 5 4. Natural Philosophy - 5 5. Natural History - 6-11 6. Anatomy and Medicine - 12-22 7. Moral Philosophy - 23,27 8. Law â 24,25,26 84. It was a plan of the organization of the University that there should be a Chairman of the Faculty appointed by the Board of Visitors from among the Professors. The Chairman was to receive appointment for two years, and might be reappointed. His duties were much like those of a present-day Dean. There was at first some difference of opinion about the length of the term of office. Bruce, vol. 2, pp. 48-52, gives the details of the discussion. There is a list of the Chairman of the Faculty down to the turn of the century in page 78 of Patton, John S., and Doswell, Sallie J., The University of Virginia: Glimpses of its Past and Present, Lynchburg, c1900. 83A. "Montpellier" was the spelling used in Madison's day. This was later changed to Montpelier. See articles on James and Dolly Madison in Dictionary of American Biography. 85. Minutes of the meeting of the Board of Visitors 17 July 1827. "Resolved that hereafter there shall be a standing committee of the Visitors to be appointed on the first day of every meeting, whose duty it shall be to examine and report to the board, the state and condition of the Library ..." The first committee â Joseph C. Cabell, John H. Cocke, and William C. Rives â was appointed the following July, 10 July 1828. 86. See minutes of the faculty meeting of 5 July 1828. Professor Bonnycastle made the motion, and Professor Dunglison was the first Inspector elected â on the second ballot. 87. The first action was taken by the Faculty at its meeting on 8 October 1834, Professor Emmet being selected as Chairman of the special committee. The report of that committee apperas in the minutes of the faculty meeting of 11 November 1834, and is an important document concerning the administration of the Library. At a meeting of the Faculty on 30 December 1834 Professor Emmet was directed to draw up resolutions "to render effective the suggestions of the report." The resolutions were presented and approved at a meeting held on 9 January 1835. On 30 June 1835, on motion of Professor Emmet, it was voted "that in the opinion of the Faculty the state of the Library, especially in relation to the irregular performance of the duties assigned, by the Enactments, to the Librarian, require the immediate attention of the Board of Visitors." The minutes of the Board of Visitors for 8 July 1835 record the resignation of Brockenbrough and the reappointment of Wertenbaker. A fuller statement of this matter is given in the sketch of William H. Brockenbrough in chapter five of this history of the Library. 88. The first regular Faculty Library Committee was appointed at a meeting of the Faculty on 31 October 1836. It was composed of Professors Bonnycastle, Tucker, and Gessner Harrison (who had in 1828 succeeded Professor Long in the School of Ancient Languages). 89, The faculty minutes of 10 September 1827 record that this fact was to be called to the attention of the Board of Visitors. 90. This matter was mentioned at a meeting of the Board of Visitors on 23 July 1828; it was further considered on 21 July 1830; and final action was taken on 20 July 1831. 91. The action is recorded in some detail in the minutes of the faculty meeting of 15 April 1829. 92. For early examples of such petitions, see the minutes of faculty meetings on 10 September 1927, 7 July 1930, 9 July 1931, 2 November 1932. This last was an eloquent appeal which the Faculty forwarded to the Governor of the State, and it resulted in a $500 appropriation the following June. 93. For the ten sessions beginning with July 1927, the Visitors' minutes record six general library appropriations: $500 on 21 July 1829, $250 on 17 July 1932, $500 on 20 July 1833, $300 on 18 July 1834, and $500 on 13 August 1836. 93A. Bruce, vol. 2, p. 192. See footnote 51. The Executor was Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph. In the letter referred to the following footnote, the number of volumes is given as about 950 and the estimated value $2,000. 93B. Robley Dunglison to Joseph Carrington Cabell, 25 December 1828. This letter is among the Cabell Papers in the Alderman Library. 93C. John Tayloe Lomax to John Hartwell Cocke, 29 September 1827. This letter is among the Cocke Papers in the Alderman Library. 93D. Robley Dunglison to Joseph Carrington Cabell, 10 January 1829. This letter is among the Cabell Papers in the Alderman Library. 94. The reference is, of course, to The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Julian P. Boyd, editor... Princeton, 1950- 95. The action of the Visitors on 29 July 1845 was as follows: "Resolved. - That the Rector be authorized to have a suitable press made for the purpose of keeping the papers of the Board of Visitors, and that he be requested to prescribe a suitable method of arrangement on advisement with the Secretary." An admirable account of these archives and of the Lee Papers may be found in an article on "The University of Virginia Library" by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., in the Winter 1952 issue (Vol. IV, no. II) of the Autograph Collectors' Journal, pp. 32-36. 96. The grandson, after he had completed his Memoir of the Life of Richard Henry Lee, Philadelphia, 1825, two volumes, divided the papers he had collected among the American Philosophical Society (a notice of the gift in the Society's records is dated 17 June 1825), the Library of Harvard University (there is mention of the Arthur Lee papers under date of 24 July 1827), and the University of Virginia (which therefore probably received them in 1825, the year of the first session of the University of Virginia.) The six sons of Thomas Lee (1690-1750), who married Hannah Harrison Ludwell in 1722, were as follows: (1) Philip Ludwell Lee (1726-1775), heir of Stratford, a preRevolutionary figure; (2) Thomas Ludwell Lee (1730-1778), a popular but less prominent member of the family; (3) Richard Henry Lee (1732-1794), a signer of the Declaration of Independence; (4) Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797), a signer of the Declaration of Independence; (5) William Lee (1739-1795), Commissioner to Courts of Berlin and Vienna; (6) Arthur Lee (1740-1792) Commissioner to France with Silas Deane and Benjamin Franklin. There were also two daughters, Hannah (1728-1782) and Alice (1736-1818). There are sketches of the last four sons in volume eleven of the Dictionary of American Biography, those of Richard Henry, William, and Arthur by Edmund C. Burnett and that of Francis Lightfoot by H. J. Eckenrode. There is an extended discussion of the six sons in Part II, "The Six Sons of Stratford", pages 85-175, of Burton J. Hendrick's The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family, Boston, 1935. 97. Interesting details concerning the Lee Papers are given on page 34 of the article on "The University of Virginia Library" by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., in the Winter 1952 issue of Autograph Collectors' Journal. Supplementary to these footnotes is a typed copy of the references to the Lee Papers in the minutes of meetings of the Board of Visitors and of the University Faculty. 98. The regulation concerning "Strangers" is included in the list of the original regulations in footnote 14. Negative actions with regard to loans of library material outside of the precincts are recorded in the minutes for the Visitors' meeting of 19 July 1827 and for the Faculty meeting of 4 January 1845. 99. The early handling of the Madison endowment is recorded chiefly in minutes of meetings of the Board of Visitors. The dates of the meetings in which this matter was discussed were 17 August 1837, 5 July 1843, 5 July 1844, 4 July 1845, 27 June 1846, 28 June 1847, 27 June 1851. At the time of the decision of 1851 there was an accumulated income of approximately $900. It required, however, an action of the Faculty on 25 October 1852 to pry loose that amount; and it was not until a meeting of the Visitors held on 28 June 1856 that the order was given for a regular appropriation to the Library of $90 annual interest from the Madison endowment. 99A. The spelling "Dolley" in a signature appears in facsimile in Time, vol. 61, no. 6, 4 February 1953, p.4. The inscription on the tombstone (courteously copied for these Notes by Mrs. William J. Phillips of Charlottesville) is as follows:- In Memory of Dolley Payne wife of James Madison Born May 25, 1768 Died July 8, 1849(?) 100. The record of the Madison bequest of books dragged through many meetings of the Visitors and of the Faculty. The list, in chronological order is: Visitors 17 August 1837; Visitors 5 July 1838; Faculty 2 April 1840; Visitors 5 July 1843; Visitors 3 July 1845; Visitors 30 October 1845; Faculty 27 November 1852; Faculty 3 May 1854; Visitors 27 June 1854; 29 June 1854. There was one pleasant feature in the legal action. The Board of Visitors offered to James W. Saunders, its agent and attorney, a fee of one hundred dollars and five percent of the value of the books recovered. Saunders accepted the fee, but the Visitors' minutes of 29 June 1854 records that he "relinquished his right to the 5 per cent." Various statements concerning the number of the Madison books can be found. In The University of Virginia: Glimpses of its Past and Present, by John S. Patton and Sallie J. Doswell, Lynchburg, c1900, page 30, the number is given as "about two thousand volumes." Philip Alexander Bruce in his History of the University of Virginia, volume two, page 196, states that the legacy was "of about one thousand volumes." The minutes of the Visitors for 27 June 1854 records that 431 volumes were recovered. But the University Catalogue for the session of 1857-1858 gives the number as 587, and this has been accepted. That Dolly Madison was empowered by the will of James Madison to retain such of the volumes as she might choose is stated on page 336 of Katharine Anthony's Dolly Madison: Her Life and Times. Garden City, 1949. Some of the responsibility for the delay should doubtless be placed on the widow. In Bruce's History of the University of Virginia, volume two, page 196, and volume three, page 102, it is wholly charged to her. The biographies of Dolly Madison seem to be silent about this matter. But the inept management of "Montpellier" by John Payne Todd is freely acknowledged, and he is specifically mentioned in the Visitors' minutes of 3 May 1854. Dolly Madison's warm friendship with Jefferson and her personal interest in the University while James Madison was Rector are well known. Concerning Jefferson's purchases in France for Madison's private library there are apposite references in Dumas Malone's Jefferson and the Rights of Man, Boston, 1851, pp. 87, 162, 163. 101. The adjectives descriptive of Christian Bohn are quoted from the University Catalogue for 1844-1845. In connection with the Bohn gift there are many references in the minutes of meetings of the Visitors and of the Faculty. A list of those meetings, arranged in chronological order, is as follows: Visitors, 5 July 1838; Faculty, 25 September 1838; Visitors, 3 July 1839; Faculty, 7 September 1839; Faculty, 29 June 1840; Visitors, 7 July 1840; Faculty, 4 September 1841; Faculty, 19 November 1851; Visitors, 29 June 1853. The Bohn gift is stated in the 1857-1858 Catalogue of the University to have contained 3,380 volumes. The special faculty committee on examining the books was composed of Professors Harrison (Ancient Languages), Bonnycastle (Mathematics), and Blaettermann (Modern Languages). There were two successive committees on the Engravings. The first, appointed 25 September 1838, was composed of Professors Tucker (Moral Philosophy), Griffith (Medicine), and Davis (Law). The second, appointed 4 September 1841, was composed of Professors Kraitsir (Modern Languages), Cabell (Anatomy and Surgery), and Tucker (Moral Philosophy). Some of the engravings were placed on display in the Rotunda. By 29 June 1853 the Library Committee of the Board of Visitors had become tired of seeing them and it was directed that they be removed from the walls. 102. The various economic histories of the United States analyze the reasons for this growing prosperity. The main reason was the effect of the cotton gin in reducing the cost of harvesting cotton. 103. There are indications that the feeling of tension was more pronounced on the part of the families which sent their sons to northern colleges than it was on the part of the sons themselves. In general the southern students won some measure of sympathetic understanding from the northern university communities, particularly at Princeton. Though their numbers decreased during the 1850's, there were southern students at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton right up to the firing on Fort Sumter. Indications of the situation can be found in Bruce, vol.3,p.4; Collins, Varnum Lansing, Princeton, New York, 1914,pp.93-95, 159-162; Dwight, Timothy, Memories of Yale Life and Men, 18451899, New York, 1903, pp.62-66; Pier, Arthur Stanwood, The Story of Harvard, Boston, 1913, pp.163-165; Wertenbaker, Thomas Jefferson, Princeton 1746-1896, Princeton, 1946, pp.265,266. 104. The tracks of the Virginia Central Railroad Company (originally the Louisa Railroad Company) reached Charlottesville from the direction of Richmond in 1850. The tunnels through the Blue Ridge, an engineering achievement by Claudius Crozet which was completed in 1858, extended the line westward over the Blue Ridge Railroad. This opened transportation east and west, and is now the line of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Meantime the Orange and Alexandria Railway had extended its tracks from Orange to Gordonsville in 1840, and from there it made use of the tracks of the Virginia Central. The continuation to Lynchburg was not completed before the war of 1861-1865. This north and south connection later became the Washington City, Virginia Midland, and Great Southern Railroad, and was finally merged with the Southern Railroad system. The general fact of the opening of Charlottesville to railway communication is clear, but the references are a bit confusing as to dates. See Bruce, vol. 3,p.3; Couper, William, Claudius Crozet: Soldier-Scholar-Educator-Engineer (1789-1864), Charlottesville, 1936, pp.127-173, especially p.131; Meyer, Balthazar Henry, History of Transportation in the United States Before 1860, Washington, Carnegie Institution Publication No. 215c, 1917, pp.460-464; Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion, American Guide Series, New York, c1940, pp.94-96. 105. The contribution of the graduates of the University of Virginia to secondary education during this period receives full exposition in Bruce, vol. 3,pp.3, 224-244. 106. Bruce, vol.3,p.3; vol.4,p.323. 107. Bruce, vol.3,pp.30-34. The establishment of a School of History and General Literature was approved by the Board of Visitors in May 1856, and the School went into operation in the session of 1857-1858. The first Professor was George Frederick Holmes â and he continued to hold that chair until 1882. 108. The order that there be seven hours of opening on weekdays was given by the Faculty on 1 December 1858. Various schedules had been experimented with. One complicated schedule that was approved by the Faculty on 19 October 1858 called for opening on Mondays and Thursdays from 8:45 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and from 2:30 to 4:00 p.m., and on the other four weekdays from 8:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. 109. The Visitors tried two methods of increasing the Library appropriations. On 28 June 1850 the Board voted "That if in any of the Schools, there should be a surplus over the maximum limit of $3000 [for the salary of the Professor], such surplus shall remain in the hands of the patron subject to appropriation for enlargement of the Library &amp;of the philosophical and chemical apparatus..." On 28 June 1856 the Board voted "that the fee for matriculation and the use of the library &amp;public rooms shall hereafter be $20 [instead of $15] and one fourth part thereof shall be annually appropriated for the increase of the library." 110. As was stated in the first section of this historical sketch and in its footnote 30 the approximate size of the original library was 8,000 volumes. The University Catalogue for the session 1849-1850 gives 20,000 volumes, and for the session 1859-1860, 30,000 volumes. 111. The Faculty at its meeting on 2 December 1848 voted "that a committee be appointed to make temporary provisions for the books now accumulating and to suggest to the Board of Visitors the kind of cases most suitable for the reception of future additions to the Library â Dr. Schele, Dr. Courtenay and Mr. Minor were appointed the committee." On 7 December 1848 Dr. Schele de Vere made an oral report for the committee and this was approved. The Faculty at its meeting on 17 October 1856 voted "that the Proctor be instructed to provide immediately additional accommodation for Books in the Library, under the direction of the Committee heretofore appointed to report upon a plan for the same." [Apparently this was the committee appointed eight years before.] An action with similar wording was taken at the Faculty meeting of 9 October 1857. 112. The question "began to emerge" - though not yet in specific words. Cf. Faculty minutes 1 November 1859. 113. See minutes of meetings of Visitors held 19 August 1837 and 4 July 1839. 114. See minutes of meeting of Visitors held 29 June 1848. 115. See minutes of meetings of Faculty held 3 January and 1 February 1861. The books included some presented to the Library by the American Tract Society and (as stated in the University Catalogue for the session of 18481849)" 234 works presented by an unknown benevolent lady through the Rev. Dr. Alexander of Princeton." The location of the reading room on West Lawn is given by Bruce, vol.3,p.142. 116. See action of Board of Visitors at its meeting of 3 July 1838. 117. The following minutes was recorded for the Faculty at its meeting of 1 March 1861:- "The Chairman reported that the cornice of the Rotunda where it joins the roof of the Front Portico on the west took fire this morning from a coal accidently dropped by Plumbers at work on the top of the building. - By the early discovery of the fire and prompt and well directed efforts of students and others the Rotunda was saved from serious damage if not destruction. Among the students conspicuous for their services on the occasion Mr. Wm H. Chapman deserved to be honorably mentioned - whereupon "Resolved that the Chairman be requested to tender the thanks of the Faculty to the students and others and particularly to Mr W. H. Chapman for the prompt and efficient services on the occasion referred to." 118. This action was taken by the Faculty at its meeting on 18 April 1859. 119. See footnote 57 in first section of this historical sketch. 120. Minutes of meeting of Board of Visitors 28 June 1856. It is of interest that the motion was apparently offered by Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett, a young lawyer and booklover of parts, who had recently completed a brilliant student record in the College Schools and in Law. His home library has been preserved intact in the Garnett Room in the Alderman Library. See article by William H. Wranek, Jr., in University of Virginia Alumni News, vol. 26,no.7, April 1938,pp.138,139. 121. Minutes of meeting of Faculty, 2 July 1856. 122. Minutes of meeting of Board of Visitors, 27 June 1857. 123. Biographical references are recorded in the footnotes to the sketch of William Wertenbaker in section five of this history. An early reference, by his son Charles Christian Wertenbaker, appeared in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin, vol.4,no.1, May 1897,pp.21-25. 124. See previous note; also Bruce, vol.2,pp.200,201. Bruce gives Street and Sanxey as the firm name of the Richmond owners of the bookstore at the University. 125.

Minutes of meeting of Board of Visitors 28 June 1856. 130. The indications are that this was Muscoe Garnett. See footnote 120. 131. See the Chapter on "The Smithsonian Library" by Cyrus Adler, pages 265-302, in Goode, George Brown, ed., The Smithsonian Institution 1846-1896: The History of its First Half Century, Washington, 1897. Charles C. Jewett, the first Librarian at the Smithsonian, 1847-1855, was a pioneer in librarianship. He had compiled a catalogue of the Brown University Library in 1843, and after appointment at the Smithsonian he proposed the making of a union catalogue of all the libraries in the United States. In 1855 he left Washington for the Boston Public Library. In 1866 the Smithsonian Library was incorporated with the Library of Congress. It is not clear what the Visitors meant by "the plan recommended by the Smithsonian Institution." But Jewett is credited with having introduced a method of descriptive cataloguing. (It may be of local interest that the steel shelving in the corridor on the first floor of the Alderman Library was originally used for the Smithsonian collection at the Library of Congress. It was moved by Library of Congress officials to its present location in order that there might be transferred temporarily to these shelves the newspapers on lM of the stack, thus releasing that stack for the Union Catalogue of the Library of Congress. When the Union Catalogue was returned to Washington after the Second World War, the Alderman Library purchased these stacks from the government.) 132. Minutes of meeting of Board of Visitors 27 June 1857. 133. Minutes of meeting of Faculty 9 October 1857. The special committee "to report on a plan for preparing a Catalogue of the Library" was composed of George Frederick Holmes, Professor of History and General Literature, Francis Henry Smith, Professor of Natural Philosophy, and Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, Professor of Greek. 134. Minutes of meeting of Faculty 1 December 1857. 135. The full report of 1 December 1857 was recorded in the minutes of the Faculty as follows:- "Mr. Gildersleeve from the committee appointed to suggest a plan for the catalogue of the Library submitted the following report - "I For convenience of reference they would recommend the adoption of the alphabetical arrangement. "II To obviate the necessity of renewing the task and to preclude all doubt as to the editions of the respective works, they would suggest that the titles be given in full, with such bibliographical notices as may be proper in the case of rare editions. "III For the sake of enabling the student to ascertain the resources of the Library in the different departments, they propose to add a classified index, to be arranged in a few simple categories, under which the titles will be merely indicated, with references throughout to the full catalogue." 136. Visitors' Minutes, 4 September 1858. The minute with regard to the plan for a catalogue was as follows:- "The plan of a catalogue of the Library adopted by the Faculty on Dec. 1st, 1857, is approved with the following modifications. "1. Where the title is long it may be abridged provided so much of it is preserved, as may be necessary, to identify the book, and in all cases the date and place of publication, the edition, and the size of the volume shall be indicated. "2. The catalogue into which the classified index is to be divided, shall be fixed by the Faculty in consultation with the Librarian." 137. Bruce, vol. 3, pp. 104-106.

"Professor Holmes submitted the following preamble &amp;resolution which on motion were adopted - "It is conceived to be of supreme importance to the communities among whom grave political &amp;social transactions occur, that the best materials for reliable information in regard to the character and causes of the change, the nature and consequences of the actions, the motives, pretexts and conduct of the agents, should be procurred &amp;preserved in an acceptable form for the instruction of future inquirers. - Such sources of accurate historical knowledge can be obtained with certainty in an unbroken series and in adequate fulness only during the pendency and progress of the revolutionary movement; and, if not secured coincidently with the occurrences of the events can scarcely be brought together in later days, when such authoritative memorials are felt to be indispensable for the formation of a correct judgment of the past and a due estimation of the policy of the times then current. - 153A. Visitors' Minutes, 11 September 1862. "These and other analogous considerations, which induced Thucydides to collect all serviceable information relative to the fatal dissensions of the Greek States from the very commencement of the Peloponnesian war, and which are illustrated by the value deservedly attached to the various Memoirs of the Great Rebellion in England, to the Documentary History of the French Revolution, and to the contemporaneous Memorials of the American Revolution, - under manufest the urgent importance of procuring &amp;preserving, from the beginning of the great contention, all the authentic contemporaneous documents relating to the great controversy which is now distracting the Country, and destroying the integrity of the United States of America - Such a collection would hereafter be received as a priceless and everlasting possession, and would afford the only trustworthy means of ascertaining and appreciating the right, and of commemorating and censuring the wrong, which may be involved in the mighty political discussion. - The only assured mode of obtaining an adequate body of such memorials is by commencing and continuing their collection during the progress of the struggle, and in the hour of their publication. - It is due, moreover, to the interests of the future, to the claims of historic truth, to the perpetuation of the convictions of great political parties, and to the defence of public sentiment in the Southern States; - it is equally due to the credit of this University of Virginia, and incumbent upon it as one of the Conservators and dispensers of accurate &amp;liberal knowledge, that it should discharge the function of providing in time and of carefully preserving a complete body of authentic contemporaneous historical memorials in regard to the great political dis-silience of the formerly United States of America, - "Therefore the Faculty of the University of Virginia Resolve "1. That a sum of money not exceeding one hundred dollars for the present be appropriated from the Library fund for the purpose of procuring for the Library the regular issues of the most important newspapers, periodical publications, and other authentic documents, recording and illustrating the growth, progress, and fluctuations of these unhappy dissensions which threaten &amp;have in part accomplished the overthrow of the confederation of the United States - "2. That a permanent Committee of three members be appointed to select and obtain for the Library such documents of all kinds, appearing regularly or occasionally, as constitute important sources of information in regard to the current discords: and that it shall be their duty also to correspond with the proper authorities and request from the General and Local Governments, from their Legislatures and Executives, the presentation of their Public Papers. - "3. That this Committee shall superintend the arrangement, and secure the careful preservation of the materials which may be brought together through its agency - "4. That this collection of the sources of present History be kept by the Librarian distinct from his general body of the Library under the title of Memorials of the American Disruption: that no portion of the collection be allowed to be removed at any time from the Library rooms without the special order of the Faculty; and that particular care be taken in maintaining unbroken each series of Newspapers and other Periodical publications. "5. That the members of the Committee shall be changeable from time to time by substitution: that the Committee shall be always controllable by the general body of the Faculty; that they shall report their proceedings to the Faculty whenever it seems expedient to do so, and whenever they may be called on for that purpose; and that they communicate to the Faculty such future additions to the Collection as may be deemed necessary. "6. That the Librarian be requested to procure a book suitable for a full index of this collection, and to enter therein under appropriate titles, and under the several years and months to which they particularly relate, the various documents received; so that a satisfactory means of reference to the contents of the Collection, or to the authorities on any particular topic or period may always be accessible, without the unnecessary handling of those parts of the Collection which do not contain the desired information. "Under these Resolutions the Chairman appointed the following members of the Faculty to constitute the Committee "Messrs. Holmes, Cabell &amp;Minor." (These three Professors were George Frederick Holmes, History and General Literature; James Lawrence Cabell, Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery; John Barbee Minor, Law.) 163.

The story of this proposal is told in "A Plan of 1861 to Preserve Civil War Materials" in volume I, 1940-1941, of Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, pages 37-39. This article itself is reprinted from Southern Historical Society Papers, vol. 16, 1888, pp. 56-58. Details of a somewhat similar attempt which was begun about 1930 may be found in the introductions to the first ten Annual Reports of the Archivists, University of Virginia Library, and in the Introduction to the General Index to First Fifteen Annual Reports on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, 1931-1945.

The cooperation of the University of Virginia with the Athenaeum Library in the matter of the extensive bibliography of Confederate material that is being compiled in 1950 is mentioned on page 204 of the text. Mr. Wyllie has made the very interesting suggestion that William F. Poole or Francis Parkman, who had much to do with starting the Confederate Collection at the Boston Athenaeum, may have caught the idea from seeing one of the Holmes communications. 167A.

The Visitors' inclusion of former members of their Board among residents of Charlottesville to whom borrowing might be permitted is recorded in Visitors Minutes 3 July 1879. The conservative tendency of the members of of Visitors is also shown in Visitors Minutes 11 June 1894, and the more liberal tendency of the Faculty is also shown in Faculty Minutes 1 June 1867, 21 March 1879, 2 June 1879, and 4 June 1894. 201.

On the death of Daniel Burton Fayerweather, a New York leather merchant, in 1890, it was found that he had bequeathed the bulk of his estate of several million dollars to a score of colleges, There was a prolonged contest of the will, but the decision was in favor of the beneficiaries designated by the will. The case for the University of Virginia was argued by an alumnus, Robert Coleman Taylor. His briefs for this case were presented by his widow to the manuscript division of the Alderman Library. The amount received by the University of Virginia was $100,000. 216. Alumni Bulletin, vol. 1, no. 2, July 1894, p. 39. 217. Alumni Bulletin, vol. 1, no. 3, November 1894, p. 92. 218. During 1894 occured the railway strikes ordered by Eugene V. Debs and crushed in Chicago by Federal troops under orders from President Cleveland. This was also the year of the march on Washington of some 20,000 unemployed, led by Jacob S. Coxey. 219. Visitors Minutes 10 June 1895. 220. For the "valiant group of university defenders" see footnote 149. 221. There are many accounts of the Rotunda fire. Most of them, like the attempt, are largely based on a vivid narrative by Morgan Poitiaux Robinson, who was a student eyewitness and participant. Robinson was later State Archivist of Virginia. His account was expanded from a twenty-eight page letter which he wrote to his mother on the night of the fire. Taking much verbatim from the letter, he prepared the article printed in the University of Virginia Magazine for October 1905- ten years later. This article, somewhat revised, and with an Introduction by Philip Alexander Bruce, was separately printed by the F. J. Mitchell Printing Company of Richmond under copyright of 1921 â a booklet of thirty pages with twelve illustrations. An account by another eyewitness appeared in The Commonwealth for June 1951, pages 14, 15, 39. This corrects Robinson in at least one detail. The author was Lewis Catlett Williams, a student during 1893-1898 in both college and department of law, with B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Virginia, and later during 1922-1946, a member of the Board of Visitors. An independent description appeared in the Alumni Bulletin for November 1895 (vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 67-74) under the title "The University Ablaze." Bruce, vol. 4, pp. 252-265, and Patton, pp. 278-284, tell the story in detail, with quotations from the Robinson account. That the Rotunda fire is still newsworthy was demonstrated in March 1952 when the account to which this is a footnote was being written. For in the student newspaper, The Cavalier Daily, for 14 March 1952, was printed a story of "The Great Rotunda Fire of 1895" by Charles G. Anderson III. There seems to be agreement that defective wiring was the most probable cause of the fire. 221A. Mr. Wyllie recalls that in his student days (his B.A. was received in 1930) Professor Echols was called "Zeus" because of the thunderbolts thrown at the time of the Rotunda fire. 222. The map inserted in the University Catalogue for the session of 18951896 indicates the location of the students' reading room. 223. No comment can add to the pathos of the following minutes from meetings of the Faculty on the dates indicated;- Faculty Minutes 31 October 1895. "Resolved, that Mr. F. W. Page, the Librarian, be instructed to inform the Faculty as to the measures taken by him to save the most valuable portions of the Library from the fire on the 27th inst." Faculty Minutes 13 November 1895. "The following paper is submitted by Mr. F. W.

The books were transferred to the Alderman Library in May 1938. Since the completion of the repairs and improvements that followed, the former library room has been used occasionally as a public hall. Partitions erected between the pillars of that hall have made available an outer ring of offices. These offices, the two oval rooms below, and the four wings have been taken over as administrative offices for some of the Deans, for the Bursar, for the Director of Admissions, and for the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. The southwest wing has been assigned to the Bureau of Public Administration, and the small collection of books, pamphlets, and documents maintained by that Bureau is the only library material now remaining in the Rotunda buildings. 238.

It is stated in the letter prepared by the Faculty for circulation among alumni and friends of the University that "the Medical Department suffered no loss of buildings and apparatus, but their entire library, including a valuable file of professional journals, is utterly swept away." 246. See Section I of this historical sketch, especially pages 4 and 5. 247. The reference is to chapter seventy-two, "Concerning Snakes", of The Natural History of Ireland by a Danish writer, Nils Horrebow, which had appeared in an English translation in 1758. The complete text of that chapter is: "No snakes of any kind are to be met with throughout the whole island." The chapter was made famous by Samuel Johnson's reference to it as recorded by Boswell in the diary entry for 13 April 1778. In the Oxford edition of 1934, edited by George Birkbeck Hill and L. F. Powell, this appears on page 279 of the third volume. 248. See Section I of this historical sketch, especially pages 4 and 5. 249. Faculty Minutes, 31 October 1895. 250. See notes 269 and 270. 251.

The general library appropriation seems to have been limited to income from endowment funds for all sessions 1896 to 1904 inclusive except 1901-1902, when an additional $534 was granted, and 1903-1904, when an additional $75 was granted, this amount being for the purchase and binding of periodicals. A sum of $500 was regularly appropriated for the Law Library, with an additional $500 in 1901-1902 and again in 1904-1905. 253. Bruce, vol. 4, p. 270. The printed report of the President of the University of Virginia to its Board of Visitors for the session 1950-1951 has on page 15 a table of capital outlays for buildings. That table records the following amounts during this period: Restoration of Rotunda, $200,000; Cabell Hall, $143,621; Rouss Physical Laboratory, $55,000; Mechanical Laboratory, $60,000; Randall Hall, $20,000. These make a total of $478,621. There was a State appropriation of $200,000 for the Rotunda restoration, there was a contribution from Charles Broadway Rouss for the Physical Laboratory, and Randall Hall was paid for by the J. W. and Belinda Randall Charities Corporation. According to Bruce some money was available from the Fayerweather bequest. 254. See page 55. That was on Thursday, 31 October 1895, four days after the fire. 255.

General Douglas MacArthur ended his address of 19 April 1951 before a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington by recalling a barracks-room ballad popular in his youth "which proclaimed most proudly that `old soldiers never die: they just fade away. And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away..." This text is quoted from page 15 of The General and the President, by Richard H. Rovere and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., New York, c1951. 316. Herbert Putnam became Librarian of Congress in 1899. An early statement of his concerning the classification of the books is quoted by David C. Mearns in The Story up to Now: the Library of Congress 1800-1946, Washington, 1947, p. 172: "The present classification of the Library is but a slight expansion of that adopted by Thomas Jefferson in 1815 for his library of 6,700 volumes. It is meager, rigid, inelastic, and unsuited to a library of a million volumes. The entire library ought to be reclassified." 317. See article entitled "D.C. versus L. C." in Libraries (a continuation of Public Libraries), vol. 35, no. 1, January 1930, p. 3. 318. There seems to be no record as to when and by whom the decision to adopt the Dewey Classification was made. In a letter of 20 May 1951 (which is filed with these notes), Prof. John W. Wayland of Madison College says of Librarian Page: "I do not think he ever had any intimation of modern library science or method." It was probably Librarian Patton who began the use of that system. In an article on "The Library" in the Alumni Bulletin, new series, vol. 7, no. 1, January 1907, p. 38, he reported on progress already made in applying that classification. There is in the Alderman Library a copy of the sixth edition of Dewey's Decimal Classification, published in 1899, which bears the name of Anne Seeley Tuttle, Assistant Librarian 1903-1911, as owner and contains marginal notes in her handwriting. 319. Visitors' Minutes, 14 November 1911. 320. The University Catalogues for 1911-1912 and 1912-1913 record Miss Dinwiddie's positions, the first as Assistant, the second as Assistant Librarian. As Assistant Librarian her beginning salary was $500 (Visitors' Minutes, 9 May 1912); during the last year, 1926-1927, of the Patton librarianship it was $1,900; at the time of her retirement 30 June 1950 it was $5,064. 321.

A tablet on the south portico of the Rotunda records the names of those who gave their lives during the first world war. The Alumni News, vol. 35, no. 3, December 1946, pp. 16, 17, records a similar list for the second world war. 335. General funds for books for the General Library were eliminated. In fact the budgets approved by the Visitors on 19 April 1917 and 15 May 1918 apparently indicate that the total expenditures budgeted for the General Library were slightly less than the income from library endowment funds. 336.

Wertenbaker's connection with the Library covered a span of fifty-six years, 1826 to 1882. His active service as Librarian was in three parts, of five years(1826-1831), twenty-two years(1835-1857), and sixteen years (1865-1881), a total of forty-three years. Miss Dinwiddie holds the record for the longest continuous term of service, thirty-nine years(1911-1950). During all except the first year she was Assistant Librarian. 444. There are special authorities for a number of the details about William Wertenbaker. The first is a letter of 17 July 1952 from Prof. Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker, a grandson of the Librarian. The letter is filed with these footnotes. The second is a memorial to William Wertenbaker, dated 12 June 1882, in volume two of the Sessional Records of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church. See footnote 463 for the text of the memorial. 445. Rawlings, Mary, The Albemarle of Other Days, Charlottesville, 1925, pp. 39-45. 446.

In an article "Early Days of the University" in Alumni Bulletin, vol. 4, no. 1, May 1897, beginning on page 21, his son, Charles Christian Wertenbaker, stated: "My mother, Louisiana Timberlake, of Poplar Plains, Caroline County, also came to the University in 1825, accompanying her sister, Mrs. Warner Minor. Mr. Minor was one of the six University hotel keepers in 1825, and occupied the central pavilion on the West Range, now the Hall of the Jefferson Society. My parents were married at Poplar Plains, in 1829, by the Rev. Addison Lewis, and lived on the East Range... 456. Bruce, vol. 2, pp. 185, 199-201. 457. Bruce, vol. 2, p. 198. 458.

The University Catalogue for 1829-1830 lists Wertenbaker as Assistant Proctor, but the Catalogue for 1830-1831 does not. 461. Visitors' Minutes, 8 July 1835. 462. The University Catalogues during 1848-1861 list the names of the Hotel Keepers. Wertenbaker's name appears in the Catalogue for the session 18541855. His resignation from that position is recorded in Visitors' Minutes, 29 June 1855. 463. McIlwaine, Richard, Memories of Three Score Years and Ten, New York, 1908, p. 100. The following memorial was entered for 12 June 1882 in volume two of the Sessional Records of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church. It is signed by the Rev. George L. Petrie who was Pastor and Clerk of the Session. The text is an uncorrected copy of a microfilm (M227) that was read with considerable difficulty. 12 June 1882 The committee appointed to prepare a paper with reference to the death of our esteemed brother, William Wertenbaker, presented the following, which was approved and ordered to be recorded. In Memoriam â William Wertenbaker, late a Member of this Session, died suddenly at his residence near the University on Friday the 7th of April 1882, and the surviving members of the Session esteem it to be their duty and privilege to place on their records some Memorial, though brief and simple, of his life and character. Mr. Wertenbaker was the son of Christian and Mary Wertenbaker. The former was of German descent and was born in Bladenburg, 457. Bruce, vol. 2, p. 198. The expression "chield among them taking notes" is borrowed from stanza I of Robert Burns' "On the Late Captain Grose's Peregrinations Thro' Scotland": "If there's a hole in a' your coats, I rede you tent it: A chield's amang you takin' notes, And faith he'll prent it." Maryland. The latter was Miss Grady of Caroline County, Virginia. Our late friend and brother was born in Milton, in the County of Albemarle, on the 1st of June 1797. When only 14 years of age he became the efficient Assistant of the Clerk of the County of Albemarle. Whilst thus employed, the War of 1812 began, and he soon entered the service of his country as a volunteer in the Company of Capt. Estes of Nelson, which formed a part of the Brigade commanded by Gen. John H. Cocke, late of Bremo in the County of Fluvanna. After the war Mr. Wertenbaker was again employed in the Clerk's office, where he continued for some years, and then served for one or more years as Deputy Sheriff of the County of Albemarle. This position he left at the opening of the University in 1825, and became a student of Law at the Institution under John Tayloe Lomax, the first Law Professor and afterwards one of the brightest ornaments of the Virginia Judiciary. In the summer of 1826, however, through the influence of Thos. Jefferson, who knew him well and esteemed him highly, he was appointed Librarian of the University, and then the course of his life was changed and thenceforward the University was to be the scene of his labors and his usefulness, as well as the object of his pride and devoted affection. This position he held during the remainder of his life with the exception of a few years; and for many years he was also Secretary of the Faculty. And the duties of both Stations were so discharged by him as not only to give entire satisfaction to the distinguished men with whom as Visitors and Professors during the long period he was in such intimate and honored association, â but also to win the respect and confidence and friendship as well of the great body of the Alumni of the University in whose progress and standing whilst there and their success and welfare in after life he exercised and manifested the deepest interest. For a year or two previous to his death, Mr. Wertenbaker was unable from age and declining health to discharge the active duties of Librarian, and they were devolved upon an Assistant. But whilst doing this, the Board of Visitors did honor to themselves and afforded substantive and touching evidence of their high appreciation of more than half a century's faithful and efficient service, by continuing his salary undiminished as long as he lived. Mr. Wertenbaker connected himself with the Presbyterian Church of Charlottesville on the 26th day of November 1842 â the Rev. Wm. S. White being then its Pastor, and on the 10th day of February 1844 he was elected a Member of this Session. Our friend and brother has now closed his long and useful life; and we desire now to record our testimony founded partly on tradition of the community and to a large extent on our own observation, to the great intelligence, integrity, and fidelity with which he met and discharged the duties imposed on him in the various stations which he filled, as well as to the quiet and unostentatious and unobtrusive but steady and consistent Christian character which marked his life for more than forty years. And finally in token of our sorrow for his death, and our respect for his memory:- Resolved, First â That the foregoing tribute of personal and Christian regard be spread on the records of the Session Second â That the same be read to the Congregation at the convenience of the Pastor, â and Third â That a Copy thereof be communicated by the Clerk of the Session to the family of the deceased, with assurances of our tender sympathy in their bereavement. 464. Bruce, vol. 2, p. 290; vol. 3, pp. 27, 131, 132; vol. 4, pp. 109, 110. 465. See page 27 of this historical sketch. 466. There seems to be no record of Wertenbaker's appointment as Secretary of the Board of Visitors. But Visitors' Minutes, 28 June 1866, fixed the salary of the Librarian and the two Secretaries combined, as $800. Wertenbaker resigned as Secretary of the Board of Visitors in 1871 â Visitors' Minutes, 27 and 29 June 1871 â and his salary was then reduced to $700. See also Visitors' Minutes, 19 September 1872. 467. Bruce, vol. 3, pp. 269, 270. 468. See letter of 17 July 1852 from Prof. Thomas J. Wertenbaker, which is filed with these notes. 469.

This is oral tradition of an objection made by a Professor in a faculty meeting discussion in the early days of Alderman's presidency. 486. Both this letter and its draft form are in the Jefferson Papers, number 2283, at the Alderman Library. It is quoted in full in the article on `"Our Library" by Frederick Page in Alumni Bulletin, vol. 2, no. 2, November 1895, p. 82, and in Culbreth, p. 22.

Professor Long was short in stature, and Bruce quotes a student couplet: "Harriet wants but little here below But wants that little Long." The familiar couplet, of which this was a parody, was perhaps known to the students from Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield, 1766, chapter eight, The Hermit. The form there is "Man wants but little here below, Nor wants that little long." Goldsmith enclosed the couplet within quotation marks. An earlier form appeared in Young's Night Thoughts, 1742, Night four, line 118, as follows: "Man wants but little Nor that little, long." The dictionaries of quotations record the use of the couplet by various more recent writers, including Dickens in Old Curiosity Shop, 1841, Chapter eight. 494.

The Congressional Directory, which is the reference for the following note, gives his date of birth as 23 February 1812 and his date of death 28 January 1850. He was therefore within a month of being thirty-eight when he died. 517. Biographical Directory of the American Congress 1774-1949... Washington, 1950, pp. 891-892.

The reference, of course, is to Matthew, Chapter 25, verses 14-30. 533. The following data have been supplied by Prof. Robert Henning Webb:"Robert Riddick Prentis: born April 11, 1818, in Suffolk, Va., fifth of the eleven children of Joseph Prentis II (1783-1851, son of Judge Joseph Prentis of Williamsburg and Margaret Bowdoin Prentis of `Hungars', Northampton Co.,; alumnus of William &amp; Mary College; lawyer, Surveyor and Inspector of the Port of Suffolk, Clerk of the Superior and Inferior Courts of Nansemond Co.; Visitor of William &amp; Mary College, Delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830) and Susan Caroline Riddick Prentis (1791-1862, daughter of Col. Robert Moore Riddick of `Jericho', Nansemond Co., and Elizabeth Riddick Carr Prentis, widow of Capt. Samuel Carr, 1746-1777, of Albemarle Co., brother of Dabney Carr, the husband of Martha, sister of Thomas Jefferson); attended Amelia Academy, student of the University of Va. 1838-1848; married March 21, 1844, Margaret Ann Whitehead (1826-1910, daughter of Elliott and Catherine Flynn Whitehead); father of twelve children, including Robert Riddick Prentis II (1855-1931), Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals; `Proctor and Patron' of the University of Va. 1853-1861, Proctor 1861-1865; Acting Librarian 1862-1865; Commissioner of Accounts 1867-1871; lived at `Monroe Hill'; died November 23, 1871; buried in the University Cemetery." 534. Bruce, vol. 3, p. 27. 535. Visitors' Minutes, 6 July 1865. 536. The title Commissioner of Accounts, which was first used in 1867, was retained until 1905, when it was changed back to Bursar. 536A. The authority for the statement that Prentis was Clerk of Albemarle County is Frederick Johnston, Memorials of Old Virginia Clerks, Lynchburg, 1888, p. 30. 537. The son, Joseph Prentis, is buried in the University Cemetery. His gravestone bears this inscription: "Joseph Prentis, Second Sergt. of Co. 1, 9 Reg't Va. Vol. Son of R. R. and M. A. Prentis. Born in Suffolk, Virginia, June 15, 1845, was killed in battle of Malvern Hill, July 1, 1862." 538. The first of the following references to the career of Chief Justice Robert Riddick Prentis II contains the statement that his father had been a "collector of internal revenue for the Confederacy." The references are: Alumni News, vol. 20, no. 3, November-December 1931, p. 65; Barringer-Garnett-Page, vol. 2, p. 134; Who Was Who in America 1897-1942, p. 992. 539. Professor Webb resigned in 1950. The raising of the endowment fund was started in 1952, the year when he would have retired had he not previously resigned, and was completed in 1953. The amount of the fund was approximately $1,500. See Alumni News, vol. 41, no. 8, June 1953, pp. 7, 29. Professor Webb died 2 November 1952. WILLIAM AYLETT WINSTON 540. See section III, page 42, and footnote 180, of this historical sketch. 541.

The highly probable conjecture that he was this William Aylett Winston is based on data supplied by Mr. Lucian D. Winston III of Winston, Virginia, and confirmed by the Rev. Clayton Torrence, Director and Corresponding Secretary of the Virginia Historical Society. A letter from Mr. Torrence is filed with these footnotes. 545. Schele de Vere, Maximilian, Students of the University of Virginia: A Semi-Centennial Catalogue... Baltimore, c1878, has this entry: "Winston, Wm. A. 1827. Hanover C. H., Va., 50 C.S.A.

Notices of his death appeared on 22 January 1894 in three Minneapolis newspapers, the Minneapolis Journal, the Minneapolis Times, and the Minneapolis Tribune. Copies of these notices are given in a letter of 17 August 1952 from James Kingsley, Jr., that letter being filed with these notes.

Only the 1907 reference is available in the Alderman Library. JAMES BISCOE BAKER 548. Visitors' Minutes, 29 June 1886. 549. That knowledge of Baker's bravery under fire may have been a contributing cause for his appointment as Librarian is merely a conjecture. But one of the members of the Board of Visitors, W. A. Stuart, was a resident of Saltville near Abingdon, where Baker was head of a boys' school. 550. 17 October 1834 is the date of birth given in Baker's matriculation entry. 551. These details are from a vivid account by Professor Thornton in the Alumni Bulletin, new series, vol. 3, no. 2, April 1903, pp. 37-39. The article carries a photograph of Baker â whose beard was nearly equal in length to that of Prof. Noah K. Davis! 552. Visitors' Minutes, 4 August 1886. 553.

The Albemarle County Deputy Clerk position is mentioned in Alumni Bulletin, third series, vol. 6, no. 2, April 1913, pp. 289-290; Alumni News, vol. 1, no. 1, 19 March 1913, pp. 2, 3, 5. 555. Visitors' Minutes, 12 July 1888. The initial salary of the new position, Clerk of the Chairman of the Faculty, was $500. Visitors' Minutes, 24 April 1890, record its increase to $600. This and the combined Librarian-Secretary of the Faculty salary, $1,000, together amounted to $1,600. When the positions were regrouped in 1891, the salaries of the library post and of the combined secretaryships were each made $800, thus leaving the total appropriation unchanged. But by the change Baker received $200 less and Page $200 more than by the previous arrangement. 556. Alumni Bulletin, new series, vol. 2, no. 4, October 1902, p. 35. 557. This and the following quotation given in the text are from Professor Thornton's article in Alumni Bulletin, new series, vol. 3, no. 2, April 1903, pp. 37-39. Both as Secretary of the Faculty and as Clerk of the Chairman of the Faculty, Baker would serve in Professor Thornton's office, Professor Thornton having been Chairman of the Faculty from 1888 to 1896.

James Morris Page (1864-1836) was a member of the Faculty of the University of Virginia from 1896 until his death. Thomas Walker Page (18661937) was Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia from 1906 to 1911, and was a member of the United States Tariff Commission from 1918 until his death.

Brydon it is indicated that his farming was first at Millwood near Winchester. Later he returned to Keswick. 566. Bruce, vol. 4, pp. 56, 322; Faculty Minutes, 5 October 1903. The tribute by the Faculty was printed in Alumni Bulletin, new series, vol. 3, no. 4, October 1903, p. 234. 567. See letter from Prof. John W. Wayland, 28 May 1951, filed with these notes," ... that estimable and cultured old gentleman (and I mentally underline gentleman), Frederick W. Page. In spite of his gray hair he had a keen eye and a quick step; was always obliging and courteous. I do not think he ever had any intimation of modern library science or methods, but he seemed to know just where each and every book was and could get it for you in a jiffy." 568. The feeling of discouragement may well have been accentuated by the actions of the Board of Visitors with regard to his salary. It had been placed at $800 when Page was reappointed Librarian in 1891. By Visitors' Minutes, 16 June 1897, it was raised to $1,000. By Visitors' Minutes, 16 June 1898, it was reduced to $800. By Visitors' Minutes, 13 October 1898, a request for restoration to $1,000 was declined. By Visitors' Minutes, 10 October 1899, a second request for restoration was declined. 569.

See Alumni Bulletin, third series, vol. 7, no. 3, July 1914, p. 387. 581. The Alumni Bulletin ceased publication in 1924 and the Virginia Quarterly Review was started. Prof. James Southall Wilson was the last Editor-in-Chief of the Bulletin and the first Editor-in-Chief of the Quarterly. 582. An item in which James H. Lindsay and John S. Patton collaborated was the pamphlet printed by the Progress Publishing Company in 1904 entitled The McCue Murder. In an article entitled "New Light in Philology" Patton contributed to the South Atlantic Quarterly an exposition of the theories of Prof. Thomas FitzHugh as stated in the latter's Bulletin of the School of Latin, University of Virginia. 583. The Metcalf review of the Poems of John A. Thompson appeared in Alumni Bulletin, third series, vol. 13, no. 2, April 1920, pp. 193-195.

      <field name="fulltext">12 June 1882 The committee appointed to prepare a paper with reference to the death of our esteemed brother, William Wertenbaker, presented the following, which was approved and ordered to be recorded. In Memoriam â William Wertenbaker, late a Member of this Session, died suddenly at his residence near the University on Friday the 7th of April 1882, and the surviving members of the Session esteem it to be their duty and privilege to place on their records some Memorial, though brief and simple, of his life and character. Mr. Wertenbaker was the son of Christian and Mary Wertenbaker. The former was of German descent and was born in Bladenburg, 457. Bruce, vol. 2, p. 198. The expression "chield among them taking notes" is borrowed from stanza I of Robert Burns' "On the Late Captain Grose's Peregrinations Thro' Scotland": "If there's a hole in a' your coats, I rede you tent it: A chield's amang you takin' notes, And faith he'll prent it." Maryland. The latter was Miss Grady of Caroline County, Virginia. Our late friend and brother was born in Milton, in the County of Albemarle, on the 1st of June 1797. When only 14 years of age he became the efficient Assistant of the Clerk of the County of Albemarle. Whilst thus employed, the War of 1812 began, and he soon entered the service of his country as a volunteer in the Company of Capt. Estes of Nelson, which formed a part of the Brigade commanded by Gen. John H. Cocke, late of Bremo in the County of Fluvanna. After the war Mr. Wertenbaker was again employed in the Clerk's office, where he continued for some years, and then served for one or more years as Deputy Sheriff of the County of Albemarle. This position he left at the opening of the University in 1825, and became a student of Law at the Institution under John Tayloe Lomax, the first Law Professor and afterwards one of the brightest ornaments of the Virginia Judiciary. In the summer of 1826, however, through the influence of Thos. Jefferson, who knew him well and esteemed him highly, he was appointed Librarian of the University, and then the course of his life was changed and thenceforward the University was to be the scene of his labors and his usefulness, as well as the object of his pride and devoted affection. This position he held during the remainder of his life with the exception of a few years; and for many years he was also Secretary of the Faculty. And the duties of both Stations were so discharged by him as not only to give entire satisfaction to the distinguished men with whom as Visitors and Professors during the long period he was in such intimate and honored association, â but also to win the respect and confidence and friendship as well of the great body of the Alumni of the University in whose progress and standing whilst there and their success and welfare in after life he exercised and manifested the deepest interest. For a year or two previous to his death, Mr. Wertenbaker was unable from age and declining health to discharge the active duties of Librarian, and they were devolved upon an Assistant. But whilst doing this, the Board of Visitors did honor to themselves and afforded substantive and touching evidence of their high appreciation of more than half a century's faithful and efficient service, by continuing his salary undiminished as long as he lived. Mr. Wertenbaker connected himself with the Presbyterian Church of Charlottesville on the 26th day of November 1842 â the Rev. Wm. S. White being then its Pastor, and on the 10th day of February 1844 he was elected a Member of this Session. Our friend and brother has now closed his long and useful life; and we desire now to record our testimony founded partly on tradition of the community and to a large extent on our own observation, to the great intelligence, integrity, and fidelity with which he met and discharged the duties imposed on him in the various stations which he filled, as well as to the quiet and unostentatious and unobtrusive but steady and consistent Christian character which marked his life for more than forty years. And finally in token of our sorrow for his death, and our respect for his memory:- Resolved, First â That the foregoing tribute of personal and Christian regard be spread on the records of the Session Second â That the same be read to the Congregation at the convenience of the Pastor, â and Third â That a Copy thereof be communicated by the Clerk of the Session to the family of the deceased, with assurances of our tender sympathy in their bereavement.</field>

The Institute for Research in the Social Sciences was established by a five year gift totalling $137,500 from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Foundation. See also Visitors' Minutes 5 November 1926. 599. See Section II, pages 15 and 16 of this history. 600. Among those who are known to have declined offers of the position are Dr. Earl Gregg Swem, Librarian of the College of William and Mary, and Dr. Henry Bartlett Van Hoesen, who was then Assistant Librarian at Princeton and who shortly after became Librarian at Brown University. 601. A detailed account of the Nanking Incident of March 1927 is given on pages 163-165 of the Americana Annual for 1928. Alice Tisdale Hobart's Within the Walls of Nanking, 1928, tells the story from the point of view of the foreign business community in Nanking. The story from the missionary viewpoint is told in William Reginald Wheeler's John E. Williams of Nanking. The story is briefly outlined in the article in the Dictionary of American Biography on John Elias Williams, the Vice President of the University of Nanking who was killed during the looting of the University. In the manuscript collection in the Alderman Library are contemporary personal accounts by Jeannie and Harry Clemons. 602. The information to Chairman Metcalf seems to have come from a circular letter concerning Clemons which was signed by Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, William Warner Bishop, Librarian of the University of Michigan, and Andrew Keogh, Librarian at Yale University. 603. The conference with President Alderman and Chairman Metcalf occurred early in July 1927. The appointment was approved by the Board of Visitors on 11 November 1927. 604. The course at Columbia was a special one in Library Administration, open to a selected group of Librarians and conducted by Dr. Azariah Root, Librarian of Oberlin College. Clemons's admission to the course was arranged by Dr. Charles Clarence Williamson, Director of the Columbia School of Library Service, as a result of the circular letter mentioned in footnote 602. 605. The academic record and library experience were as follows: student at Wesleyan University 1897-1903 (B.A., 1902; M.A., 1905), graduate student, Scribner Fellow, at Princeton University, 1903-1904 (M.A., 1905); Jacobus Fellow of Princeton in residence at Oxford Unversity, 1906-1907; library assistant at Wesleyan University 1902-1903; reference librarian, Princeton University, 1908-1913; librarian, University of Nanking, 1914-1927. 606. He had been the official representative of the American Library Association in charge of library war service, 1918-1919, for the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, and he had held appointment as special cataloguer for the Chinese Section in the Library of Congress for several months in 1922 while he was on a furlough from the University of Nanking. A pamphlet of his letters, The A.L.A. in Siberia, was edited by Dr. Henry Van Hoesen and published by the A.L.A. in 1919. 607. Annual Library Report, 1927, pp. 4,5. 608. The count was made in December 1927, and the total was announced at a staff party â the first Christmas party. 609. A considerable portion of the McCabe gift received in 1922 was still unpacked; the accumulation on the dome floor evidently dated back to the return to the Rotunda after the 1895 fire, since in it were later found a number of books from the original Jefferson library collection. 607A. Hubert Douglas Bennett was a college student in 1927. In 1950 he was a lawyer and political leader in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Joseph Lee Vaughan was a graduate student in 1927. In 1950 he was Director of the Institute of Textile Technology, Charlottesville, while on leave as Professor of English, Department of Engineering, University of Virginia. 608. The count was made in December 1927, and the total was announced at a staff party â the first Christmas party. 609. A considerable portion of the McCabe gift received in 1922 was still unpacked; the accumulation on the dome floor evidently dated back to the return to the Rotunda after the 1895 fire, since in it were later found a number of books from the original Jefferson library collection. 610. A Survey of Libraries in the United States... Chicago, American Library Association, 1926. Four volumes. Attention was centered chiefly on volume two. 611. Annual Library Report, 1930, p. 1. 612. The meeting was held 28 October 1930. 613. The volume of typed minutes of meetings of the Senate contains, at the beginning, a statement of the organization of that representative body, The location of that volume of minutes has varied, apparently for reasons of convenience, being at times kept by the Registrar, by the University Dean, or by the Secretary of the Senate. 614. Prof. William Harrison Faulkner was Secretary of the Senate in 1930. His minutes of the October 28th meeting was as follows:- "Present: President Alderman, Deans Lile, Metcalf, Flippin, Newcomb, Manahan, Maphis, Assistant-Dean Ferguson, and Professors Eager, Faulkner, Jordan, Lewis, Luck, Rodman, Royster, Wilson(J.S.), and the Librarian of the University, Mr. Clemons. President Alderman presided... "On request of President Alderman, with enthusiastic approval of the Senate, the Librarian of the University, Mr. Clemons, read to the Senate an able, informing, and encouraging paper on the reorganization, the work, and the plans for the future of the University Library. "(It is the Secretary's opinion that this paper should be recorded in the minutes of the Senate, and he hereby requests the transcriber of these notes to obtain the copy from the Librarian if it is available. This request was presented to the Librarian, who stated that the paper was not in an available form for this purpose, since he spoke from notes only.) "After the applause following Mr. Clemons's paper, the Senate, on motion duly made and seconded, adjourned." 615. Examples of such attempts were those made by Professors Balz for Philosophy, Fraser for Archaeology, Hill, Mellor, and Wood for Philology, Hyde for Economics, and Uhl for Public Administration. 616. The purposes and personnel of the various subcommittees were as follows:- 1931. On Specifications for New Building: Dean Metcalf, Chairman, President Newcomb, Professors Jordan and Rodman, Librarian Clemons. 1931. On Preparations for Moving: Dean Metcalf, Chairman, Professors Berglund, Dobie, House, Sparrow, Webb, Librarian Clemons. 1938. On Transfer of Department and School Libraries and Special Collections to New Building: Dean Rodman, Chairman, Dean Metcalf, Librarian Clemons. 1938. On Allotment of Faculty Studies, Seminar Rooms, and Stack Carrels: Professor House, Chairman, Deans Jordan and Metcalf, Professor Webb, Librarian Clemons. 1938. On Selection of Books for Browsing Room: Librarian Clemons, Chairman, Dean Metcalf, Professor House. 1944. On Extension of Alderman Library Building: Professor House, Chairman, Deans Lewis and Wilson, Professor Webb, Librarian Clemons. 617. Report on the 1942 survey by Chairman Webb, Chairman Emeritus Metcalf, and Librarian Clemons was made at a Faculty Library Committee meeting on 13 December 1944. 618. Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 11 December 1939. 619. Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 1 and 18 April 1940. The resolutions adopted at the second meeting were approved by the whole committee, as indicated in the minutes of 13 December 1944. 3. THE ALDERMAN LIBRARY BUILDING 620. See page 25, Section II, this history. 621. See pages 48-50, Section III, of this history. 622. See pages 86-87. Section IV, of this history. 623. The traditional objection to removal from the Rotunda is discussed in Alumni News, vol. 20, no. 5, February 1932, pp. 103, 104. 624. There seems to have been no fixed date at which agreement on the site was reached. In the late 1920's a joint committee of faculty and architeets marked the site of the Alderman Library as "reserved for an important future building." Several members of the Committee had in mind a general library. The fact that half a dozen individuals claimed to have made the original suggestion of that site doubtless expedited its tacit acceptance. Among other sites suggested were that of Cabell Hall, of Madison Hall, and of the President's house. These, however, would have meant the removal of existing buildings. 625. A letter requesting suggestions was sent to members of the Faculty on 7 September 1935. There is a file of the replies in the General Office under the heading Alderman Library Building â Suggestions. 626. The Dartmouth records covered minutes and reports covering a period from 1912 to 1926 and leading to the erection of the Baker Library. The Princeton records contained rather revolutionary studies made in the early 1930's by a committee headed by Prof. Charles Rufus Morey. 627. The Librarian at Dartmouth College was at that time Dr. Nathaniel Lewis Goodrich; the Librarian at the University of Rochester was Donald Bean Gilchrist. 628. In the summer of 1932 Dean Metcalf visited the libraries at Dartmouth College, Williams College, and Yale University, and reported concerning those libraries at a meeting on 13 October 1932 of the subcommittee on specifications for a new library building. 629. Careful and constructive replies were received from the Librarians of the University of Cincinnati, Dartmouth College, Iowa State College, the University of Michigan, Northwestern University, Princeton University, and the University of Rochester. 630. Gerould, James Thayer. The College Library Building, its Planning and Equipment, New York, Scribner, 1932. 631. A copy of those specifications is in the rare book collection of the Alderman Library. 632. See page 87, Section IV, of this history. 633. This was at a meeting of the Faculty Library Committee held on 15 October 1929. 634. Alumni News, vol. 19, no. 8, May 1931, pp. 175, 176. 635. President Alderman was representing State Universities at the inauguration of Dr. Harry Woodburn Chase. Doctor Chase had been President of the University of North Carolina from 1919 to 1930. He left the University of Illinois in 1933 to become Chancellor of New York University. 636. When the new medical group was dedicated in 1929, Dean Flippin stated privately that the use of President Alderman's name for the medical building had been considered, but that it had been deemed more appropriate to reserve his name for a new general library building. That the library should be a memorial to him was stated by President George H. Denny of the University of Alabama at a Finals address to the Alumni in 1931 (Alumni News, vol. 19, no. 9, June 1931, p. 198) and by Dr. John Huston Finley at the Alderman memorial address in Cabell Hall on 18 November 1931 (Alumni News, vol. 20, no. 3, November-December 1931, pp. 52-57). When the federal grant was received in 1936, P.W.A. regulations prevented the naming of the building until its completion. (Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 26 January 1937.) 637. See pages 3, 4, Section I, of this history. 638. "If you squeeze a cork, you will get but little juice." This was number 2791 in Thomas Fuller's Gnomologia: Adagies and Proverbs, London 1732. This Thomas Fuller was a doctor of medicine (1654-1734), not the more famous doctor of divinity (1608-1661). 639. Shakespeare's I Henry IV, act 2, scene 3, line 11. 640.

He had had one college year at Princeton, but had not been a student at the University of Virginia. He was appointed a member of the Board of Visitors in 1920, and in 1930, upon the death of Cyrus HardingWalker, he was elected Rector. Scott Stadium was donated by him that year, 1930. 645. Visitors' Minutes, 26 June 1936; 16 January 1937. A library fee of twenty dollars a session was to be collected over a period of thirty years. 646. See footnote 642. A copy of the original drawing is filed with the specifications. 647. Alumni News, vol. 24, no. 1, September-October 1935, p. 10. 648. Visitors' Minutes, 26 June 1936. 649.

Senator Glass was reported to have vigorously stated to Secretary Ickes that he (Senator Glass) disapproved of many of the P.W.A. grants for sewers and such, and that this one â which would be his sole request â would bring honor to the Public Works Administration. Professor Sparrow, a member of the Faculty Library Committee, later commented: "The Senator put all his begs in one ask-it." 651. The successful bids for the Alderman Library were as follows: 11 Nov.'36 Excavation - G. G. Waugh Co., Culpeper 6,250.00 24 Nov.'36 Foundation - G. G.

The Embree article ("In Order of Their Eminence: An Appraisal of American Universities") appears on pages 652-664 of the June 1935 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, vol. 155, no. 6. It is based in part on a study by the American Council on Education, the results of which were published on pages 10-26 of the January 1934 number of The Educational Record, vol. 15, no. 1. The Scott Stadium was erected in 1930, 1931. See note 644. 649B. There is in the Alumni News, vol. 24, no. 4, January 1936, an illustrated account of the "banquet" held in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington on the evening of 31 January 1936. Force account, Moving.

That total did not include the McGregor Room. 652. Statements from the largest contractor, Doyle and Russell, were an example of the enthusiasm. 653. Visitors' Minutes, 23 October 1937. The dates for moving were announced in Alumni News, vol. 26, no. 4, January 1948, p. 76. 654. Virginia, Acts of the General Assembly, Extra Session 1936-1937, chap. 4, pp. 28-30. 655. The eight additional collections which "came into being" between 1925 and 1938 were:- Colonnade Club collection - Pavilion VII, West Lawn Current newspaper files - Madison Hall Extension collection - Extension building Extension drama collection - Extension building Institute for Research in the Social Sciences - Old medical building Music collection - Music room, West Range Public Administration collection - Old medical building Rural Social Economics collection - Old medical building 656. The subcommittee "on the transfer of department and school libraries and special collections to the new building" was composed of Dean Rodman, Chairman, Dean Metcalf, and the Librarian. Its report was recorded in Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 8 February 1938. 657. The eight separate collections from which some books, but not all, were transferred to the Alderman Library were the Astronomy, Fine Arts, Geology, Law, Mathematics, Music, Physics, and Public Administration Libraries. 658. The calendar of the moving was as follows:- April 20 Wed. Fair. Rotunda, public documents 11 loads April 21 Thurs. Showers. Rotunda, documents, Virginia collection 14 loads April 22 Fri. Showers.

Woodrow Wilson. Memorial address delivered before a joint session of the two houses of Congress December 15, 1924, in honor of Woodrow Wilson, late President of the United States. Washington, Government Printing Office, 1925. The address was also published as a book by Doubleday, Page &amp; Company in 1925, An account of the circumstances surrounding the address is given in Dumas Malone's Edwin A. Alderman: a Biography, New York, 1940, pages 339-345. 660. Alderman, Edwin Anderson. Virginia: address delivered in response to the toast "Virginia", at the banquet given by the citizens of Petersburg, Va., to the President of the United States and the Governor of Pennsylvania on May 19, 1909. Charlottesville, The Michie Company, 1909. This was also published, in 1916, by Charles Scribner's Sons. There is mention of it in the Malone biography, pages 262, 263. 661. Dumas Malone was Associate Professor of History at the University of Virginia from 1923 to 1926 and Professor of History from 1926 to 1929. During the last session, 1928-1929, the title was Richmond Alumni Professor of History. He was a member of the Faculty Library Committee for the whole period, that is, from 1923 to 1929. In 1944 (Visitors' Minutes, 27 May 1944) he was named Honorary Consultant in Biography. 662. There is a fuller description in the Alumni News Special Issue on the Alderman Library, vol. 26, no. 10, which appeared in the summer of 1938. 663. Examples were the addition of a partition in order to form the McGregor Room in 1938 and the addition of a partition to form an entrance to the Taylor Room in 1949. 664. Architect R. E. Lee Taylor's original drawings and those developed in 1944 and 1945 are preserved in the General Office of the Alderman Library; so are the minutes of a subcommittee of the Faculty Library Committee which in 1944 and 1945 discussed the proposed additions. 665. The seven feet, six inches, is the distance between the top of one floor to the top of the next floor. The thickness of the floor should therefore be subtracted in order to ascertain the actual open space. 666. That "cardinal aim" is indicated in the specifications prepared for the use of the Architect. See footnote 631. 667. For the effect on one visitor see page 268 of "The Alchemy of Books" by Lawrence Clark Powell in A.L.A. Bulletin, vol. 46, no. 8, September 1952. 668. An account of the Garnett Library, with photographs of "Elmwood" in Essex County, by William H. Wranek, Jr., was printed in the Alumni News, vol. 26, no. 7, April 1938, pp. 138, 139. 669. There were fourteen seminar or conference rooms and twenty-seven studies. 670. As previously stated (on page 131) the preliminary study "stressed both needs and economy." 671. The pressure for stack space became increasingly heavy not only for processed books and manuscripts but also for shelving of unprocessed gift materials and for exchange materials. 672. The Chemical Library had acquired new space in the additions to the Cobb Chemical Laboratory in 1932. Remodeling of Fayerweather Hall in 1938 had expanded the space for the Fine Arts Library. With the acquisition of Adolph Lomb collection on Optics in 1934 (Visitors' Minutes, 7 November 1934) there came additional equipment. 673. Professor Gee had made application to President Newcomb for the second floor in Minor Hall when that building was vacated by the Department of Law. His request, however, had been about an half hour after the request from the Library for the same space! Therefore when the Library's "nucleus" collection was moved to the Alderman Library in 1938, Professor Gee was able to transfer to the Minor Hall second floor the collections for both the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences and the School of Rural Social Economics. 674. A collection of books for the nurses was actively carried on by Miss Josephine McLeod, Superintendent of Nurses, about 1930, and an effort to catalogue the collection was made by an extension class in cataloguing conducted by Miss Dinwiddie. It was in 1944, however, that a special room and appropriate equipment were secured, and at that time Miss Mabel Cook Wyllie, Medical Librarian, single handed catalogued the whole collection. 675. The transfer of the books in Music was made not long after the opening of the Alderman Library. The transfer of the collection of the Bureau of Public Administration was effected in 1948, books to be borrowed back temporarily as needed. 676. Extensive additions to Clark Hall were made in 1950 and 1951. 4. THE CATALOGUE 677. See pages 6 and following of Section I of this history. 678. See pages 16-18, Section II, of this history. 679. See page 29, Section II, of this history. 680. Wertenbaker retired in 1881. He was followed by Page, 1881-1882, Winston, 1882-1886, and Baker, 1886-1891. For the cataloguing problem at that time see pages 44 and 45 of section III of this history. 681. The third stage, the "involved attempt to achieve maximum utility with minimum cost", may be said to have followed the publication in the Library Quarterly of October 1941 (vol. II, no. 4, pp. 393-411) of Andrew Delbridge Osborn's "The Crisis in Cataloging." 682. See page 44 of Section III of this history. 683. Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 28 February 1929; Annual Library Report for 1929, page 3. The report seems to be in error in giving October 1929 instead of February 1929 as the date of the adoption of the Library of Congress classification.

Library of Congress Information Bulletins for 9-15 August and 27 September-3 October 1949 rank the University of Virginia notably high in contributions to the Union Catalogue. Reports of those rankings appeared in the Board of Aldermen Minutes for September and October 1949. 709. A standing Pamphlet Committee was in operation for the last fifteen years or so of this period, 1925-1950. Statements of its conclusions and of the procedures determined upon are filed in the Preparations Division and in the general office of the Alderman Library. The most elaborate statement was prepared by Mrs. Hinman in 1942 and is headed "Supplementary Notes on Pamphlet Cataloguing." 710. The figure 40,893 is taken from the sheet entitled "Size of Collections, 30 June 1950." The statement "about 36,000 volumes" may be found on page 55 of the University Catalogue for the session of 1880-1881. 5. THE COLLECTIONS 711. The acquisitions figures for the sessions from 1925 to 1930 are recorded in College and University Library Statistics 1919/20 to 1943/44 as published by the Princeton University Library in 1947. The figures for the sessions from 1945 to 1950 are given in the tables entitled University of Virginia Libraries, Size of Collections, which are issued annually at the General Office of the Alderman Library. 712. The count by bibliographic units grew out of investigations and discussions by two successive committees of the Association of Research Libraries, the record running through the minutes of meetings during 1940 to 1950. By 1950 the Universities of Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan and Cornell, Northwestern, and Duke Universities were among those which had adopted the new method of enumeration. 713. These items are taken from the 1950 table of Size of Collections. Of the 1,553 film reels, 232 were of newspapers, 528 of manuscripts, and 793 of books, the last figure comprising 8,043 book titles. 714. See Section II, pages 21, 22, of this history. 715. Annual Library Report for 1929, p. 6. 716. It is difficult to separate state and gift appropriations in the 19251926 budget â which may be found in the folio volume of Visitors' Minutes in the library vault. Combining the general and law library appropriations, the total library appropriation for the session 1925-1926 was $21,170, of which $10,704 apparently came from the State and $10,466 from endowment income. In 1949-1950 the total appropriation was $311,432, of which $267,062 came from the State and $44,370 from endowment income and gifts. The comparisons in total appropriations would therefore be:- 1925-1926 1949-1950 Increase Total appropriations $21,170 311,432 14.7 times From State 10,704 267,062 24.9 times From Gifts 10,466 44,370 4.2 times But for the purchase of books, the total for the session 1925-1926 was $7,075, of which $3,796 seems to have come from the State and $3,279 from endowment income. In 1949-1950 the total for books was $59,370, of which $37,500 came from the State and $21,870 from endowment income and gifts. The comparison in book appropriations would therefore be:- 1925-1926 1949-1950 Increase Book appropriations 7,075 59,370 8.4 times From State 3,796 37,500 9.9 times From Gifts 3,279 21,870 6.7 times Considering the salary appropriations separately, the comparison would be:- 1925-1926 1929-1950 Increase Salary appropriations 12,245 $208,592 17 times The pertinent conclusions in connection with the text are that while in these twenty-five years the general library appropriation was increasing 14.7 times and the salary appropriations were increasing 17 times, the increase in the book appropriation was 8.4 times; and that while the overall appropriation from the State was increasing 24.9 times, the book appropriation from the State was increasing 9.9 times. 717. See pages 145 and 146, Section VI, of this history. 718. The last extension of hours, from 92 to 98, with closing on six evenings at 11:00 o'clock, was put into effect in 1948. 719. The largest library group affected by the 1942 Personnel Act was the clerical staff which had had a salary range from $840 to $1,200. The latter figure became the minimum. 720. Automatic "cost of living" adjustments upward were put into effect as follows:- Clerical Staff Professional Staff 1946 July 1946 July 1948 July 1948 July 1949 July 1949 September 1950 December 1950 July 1951 March 1951 March 1952 September 1952 December 721. Because of the second world war, the range in total resident enrollment was from 1,175 to 5,119. The following record was supplied by the Registrar's office. During 1944-1947 there were continuous sessions, and the record gives the figures by semesters. The enrollments are the totals for all departments. 1940-1941 2,992 1941-1942 2,599 1942-1943 2,170 1943-1944 1,733 1944, first semester 1,345 1944, second semester 1,335 1944-1945, first semester 1,322 1944-1945, second semester 1,175 1945-1946, first semester 1,226 1945-1946, second semester 1,942 1946, first semester 2,733 1946, second semester 2,168 1946-1947, first semester 4,388 1946-1947, second semester 4,342 1947-1948 5,119 1948-1949 5,082 1949-1950 4,964 722. For a discussion of support of research by the federal and state governments, see pages 3-9 of President Darden's printed report to the Board of Visitors for the session 1950-1951. 723. Careful search has so far not been able to locate this saying in any of President Alderman's addresses or writings. 724. See page 132 of Section VI of this history. 725. See the tables of endowment and expendable funds which are supplementary to these notes. The totals for books are as follows: 1825-1925 1925-1950 Endowment funds $84,275.00 $190,091.74 Non-Endowment funds 14,825.00 284,987.47 Totals 99,100.00 475,079.21 726. To the extensive gifts of books during 1925-1950 may be added over three million manuscripts. 727, The specially designed bookplates include those for Alderman, the Bibliographical Society, Byrd, Cabell, Far Places, Harbison-Neff, Hispanic-American, Holmes, International Studies, Jabberwock, James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation, Lefevre, Luck, Mackay-Smith, Metcalf, Morton, Rushton, Simpson, Sparrow, Stone, Taylor, Tunstall, and Wyllie. 728. Among the bookplates representing earlier gifts were those for Charles Baskerville, Governor Holliday, Gaetano Lanz, Wilbur P. Morgan, Thomas Randolph Price, and Barnard Shipp. 729. The books of President Alderman were presented by Mrs. Alderman. See Alumni News, vol. 22, no. 3, December 1933, pp. 51, 52; Visitors' Minutes, 24 March 1933; also page 146, Section VI, of this history. President Newcomb donated a large portion of his private library shortly after his retirement. Mrs. Charles William Kent in 1929 presented many of the books which had been in the combined collections of her husband and of Professors Gessner Harrison and Francis Henry Smith, and had been housed in the middle pavilion on West Lawn. See Visitors' Minutes, 20 April 1929. Books from the private libraries of John Barbee Minor and Raleigh Colston Minor were presented by Mrs. Raleigh C. Minor and her son, Mr. C. Venable Minor, in 1932. See Visitors' Minutes, 13 June 1932. The gift by Mr. Collins Denny, Jr., of the extensive private library of his father, Bishop Collins Denny, has extended over a number of years. Correspondence concerning the books started in 1943, the books began to arrive in 1944, and consignments were still being received in 1951. A selection from the books of Walter Hines Page was presented to the Library in 1948 by his daughter, Katharine Page Loring (Mrs. C. C. Loring), and his two sons, Arthur Wilson Page and Frank Copeland Page. 730. The Elizabeth Cocke Coles Fund of $50,000 (reduced by tax to $47,616) was bequeathed in 1938 by Walter Derossett Coles. See Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 5, February 1939, pp. 85, 86 and Visitors' Minutes, 21 January 1939. An endowment fund for books to be purchased in memory of Dean John Calvin Metcalf was being raised in 1949-1950, and had by the end of that session reached the amount of $1,398.50. In memory of the late Urban Joseph Peters Rushton, the members of his family in 1950 established a fund for the purchase of books, especially in the subject of literary criticism, the initial amount being $1,000. See Visitors' Minutes, 14 July 1950. 731. The quotation is from Laurence Binyon's "For the Fallen", pages 40 and 41 of The Cause: Poems of the War, Boston, Houghton, Mifflin, 1917. In the International Studies Collection there were forty-four memorials, eight being endowments. The list follows: International Studies Fund, Endowment Memorials Berkeley, William Noland, Jr. Clemons, Henry Jenkins Ellett, Henry Guerrant, Jr. Green, Thomas Jefferson Hamm, James Douglas Morton, William Wylie Scott, John Young, Thomas Taggert Non-Endowment Memorials Acree, John White Allen, Geroe Cox Breed, William Henry Broome, Roger Grenville Brooke Connelly, Sam Roth, Jr. Curry, Charles, II Dayton, Donald Kuykendall Deputy, Louis James Eisner, Jacques Rodney Fleming, Carl, Jr. Fowlkes, Paschal Dupuy Goodwin, William Archer Rutherford, Jr. Hannabass, James Wilbur, Jr. Harbison, Clinton McClarty, Jr. Hardy, John Gardiner, Jr. Harris, John Daniel Hover, Thomas Strode Leonard, Edward Madison McGuire, James Mercer Garnett Mattes, Merwin Bogen Mead, Frank Roberts, Jr. Miller, John Henry Motley, James Coleman, Jr. Neff, John Henry, Jr. Nottingham, Severn Marcellus, Jr. O'Donoghue, James Francis, Jr. Palmer, James Meehan Smith, Louis Amonson Stafford, Richard Marshall Straus, Raymond I., Jr. Suhling, William Gerhard, III Taylor, Quintard, Jr. Triplett, Charles Hector III Turner, Frank Edward Wilde, Robert Michael Wonson, Charles Fred 732. The McGregor Room, a memorial to Tracy W. McGregor, was opened in 1939 (Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 6, March 1939, p. 117 and no. 8, May 1939, pp. 159-162, 169-172, and Faculty Library Committee Minutes, 14 February 1939). The opening of the Garnett Room, containing the home library of Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett, was coincident with the dedication in June 1938 of the Alderman Library (Alumni News, vol. 26, no. 7, April 1938, pp. 138, 139). There was an informal opening of the still unfurnished Taylor Room, containing the collection of American fiction gathered by Mrs. Robert Coleman Taylor, in June 1950. 733. The little collection of college books used by Robert Carter Berkeley at the University of Virginia between 1857 and 1861 was presented by his daughter, Frances Berkeley Young (Mrs. Karl Young). Mrs. Young paid for the bookcase in which the collection is contained. 734. The Cabell family library was presented to the University of Virginia in 1949 by Hartwell Cabell. 735. Alumni News, vol. 26, no. 7, April 1938, pp. 138, 139. See footnote 732. 736. See pages 24 to 29 of Section II of this history. 737. See pages 77, 78 of Section IV of this history. 738.

The establishment of a Harry Clemons Publication Fund was revealed in May 1950 by the appearance of a facsimile of the Peter Jefferson-Joshua Fry map of Virginia, 1751, published by the Princeton University Press and accompanied with historical notes on Peter Jefferson by Dumas Malone and a bibliographical memorandum by Coolie Verner. 743. John Calvin Doolan (1868-1947) was a graduate in 1890 of the University of Virginia Department of Law and a leading lawyer in Louisville, Kentucky. His map collection was presented to the University of Virginia by his widow in 1948. See Board of Alderman Minutes, April 1948. 744. In the Alumni News, vol. 26, no. 10, special Alderman Library issue, there is on page 221 a statement concerning Mr. McGregor's interest in cosmography and early geography. 745. The University of Virginia Library was named a depository of the Army Map Service in 1945. See Board of Aldermen Minutes for November and December 1945 and January and February 1946. 746. In North Carolina there was a vigorous competitive campaign in manuscript collecting being waged between Prof. William Kenneth Boyd of Duke University and Prof. Joseph GrÃ©goire de Roulhac Hamilton of the University of North Carolina. Both of those collectors were openly making inroads on privately held material in Virginia. It is a bit of inside history that a scathing criticism of the lethargy at the University of Virginia, made by Mr. Herbert Anthony Kellar, Director of the McCormick Historical Association of Chicago, to a group assembled in President Alderman's office in 1929, was the immediate stimulus of the awakening that led to the Thornton broadside. It so happened that the University Librarian had not been included in that group. But Mr. Kellar and he had conferences together directly before and directly after the meeting. 747. Copies of the Thornton broadside are on file in the Rare Book and Manuscript Division of the Alderman Library. 748. William Mynn Thornton was then Professor of Applied Mathematics. He retired from active teaching in 1931. He had been Chairman of the Faculty from 1888 to 1896 and Dean of the Department of Engineering from 1904 to 1925. There is reference to his skilled pen on page 112 of Section V of this history, in connection with the biographical sketch of James Biscoe Baker. 749. The signatures were as follows:- Edwin Anderson Alderman, President of the University. Cyrus Harding Walker, Rector of the Board of Visitors. William Mynn Thornton, Professor of Applied Mathematics. Richard Heath Dabney, Professor of History. John Calvin Metcalf, Dean of the Graduate School. Harry Clemons, University Librarian. 750. See page 21 of Section II of this history. 751. See page 37 of Section III of this history. 752. This was monograph number five of the publications of the University of Virginia Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. It was done under the direction of Prof. Dumas Malone. The full title was Cappon, Lester Jesse, Bibliography of Virginia History Since 1865, University, Virginia, The Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, 1930. 753. Prof. Wilson Gee and the Librarian early in 1930 made application in Washington to Dr. Waldo Gifford Leland, Director of the American Council of Learned Societies, and Doctor Leland persuaded Dr. Frederick Paul Keppel, then President of the Carnegie Corporation, to make the initial grant of $5,000 for the archival project at the University of Virginia. See Alumni News, vol. 18, no. 10, June-July 1930, p. 246. 754. For several years after 1930 Professor Gee generously carried Doctor Cappon's salary on Institute funds. In 1936 Doctor Cappon's Virginia Newspapers 1821-1935 was published on Institute funds both as Institute Monograph number twenty-two and as Guide to Virginia Historical Materials, part one. Doctor Cappon's monograph on the History of the Southern Iron Industry was, if completed, to be an Institute Monograph. 755. This text is taken largely from "Lester J. Cappon: An Appreciation", pages 3-8 of General Index to First Fifteen Annual Reports on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, 1931-1945. 756. Doctor Cappon was Secretary of the Society of American Archivists from 1942 to 1950. In the American Association for State and Local History he was made a Councilor in 1942 and was continuing as such in 1950. 757. Microphotography is a hundred years old. There are said to be examples of miniature texts photographically reproduced dating from 1852; and there was some use of the process during the Franco-Prussian War. But the development into utilization for business and industry and libraries did not get under way until the 1920's. The current encyclopaedias carry articles on Microphotography. 758. Alumni News, vol. 19, no. 7, March-April 1931, pp. 151-154. This article by Doctor Cappon on "Survey and Collection of Manuscripts in Virginia" is illustrated by a photograph of the southeast wing of the Rotunda buildings before the Virginia Collection was moved into it. The article was reprinted as a supplement to The First Annual Report of the Archivist. 759. The twenty-seven counties which were surveyed are given below, the dates in parentheses being the dates of survey. The survey of Culpeper County was made by Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill. The others were by Doctor Cappon. Albemarle (1930-31) Amherst (1932-33) Augusta (1931-32) Botetourt (1931-32) Brunswick (1933-34) Charlotte (1932-33) Culpeper (1934-35) Cumberland (1932-33) Essex (1930-31) Fauquier (1932-33) Frederick (1930-31) Goochland (1931-32) Halifax (1933-34) Isle of Wight (1931-32) Lancaster (1932-33) Montgomery (1932-33) Norfolk (1931-32) Northampton (1930-31) Orange (1931-32) Pittsylvania (1930-31) Russell (1933-34) Stafford (1931-32) Surry (1932-33) Washington (1931-32) Westmoreland (1932-33) Wythe (1930-31) York (1931-32) 760. See Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, page 2. 761. Doctor Cappon was State Director for Virginia of the Historical Records Survey for 1936-1937. The first volume for Virginia issued under the national supervision was the inventory of the archives of Chesterfield County, and this was published by the University of Virginia in August 1938. 762. The manual was issued by the Social Science Research Council in October 1942 with the title "A Plan for the Collection and Preservation of World War II Records." 763. Visitors' Minutes, 10 November and 29 December 1945. 764. Doctor Cappon received the B.A. degree in 1922 and the M.A. degree in 1923 from the University of Wisconsin; he received the M.A. degree in 1925 and the Ph.D. degree in 1928 from Harvard. 765. Francis Lewis Berkeley, Jr., received the B.S. degree in 1934 and the M.A. degree in 1940 from the University of Virginia. 766. Beginning in December 1944 a series of gifts at Christmas time came from Mr. Clifton Waller Barrett. The majority of the items were books, but manuscripts were also included. References to that series are as follows:- First, 1944. Alumni News, vol. 33, no. 5, February 1945, p. 2; no. 6, March 1945, p. 6; Board of Aldermen Minutes, January 1945. Second, 1945.

Board of Aldermen Minutes, January 1949. Sixth, 1949. Board of Aldermen Minutes, January 1950. Mr. Barrett donated also $1,000 towards the purchase of the Peter Jefferson Prayer Book and of a manuscript list of articles at Monticello. Mr. William Andrews Clark presented both books and manuscripts which he had purchased for the University of Virginia. The books included the presentation copy to Lafayette of Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia. The manuscripts included Jefferson's specifications for the university buildings, Jefferson's diplomatic cipher codes, and a group of Jefferson-Cocke letters. Mr. William Sobrieski Hildreth presented in 1948 a group of letters from Jefferson to General Samuel Smith. Alumni News, vol. 36, no. 5, February 1948, p. 15. Mr. Robert Coleman Taylor in 1938 presented a group of Jefferson-Cabell letters for which he paid $3,700. Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 5, February 1939, pp. 35, 36; no. 7, April 1939, pp. 137-139; Visitors' Minutes, 21 January 1939. 767. Mr. Robert Hill Carter in 1947 contributed $150 toward the purchase of Virginia historical materials. Board of Aldermen Minutes, June 1947. Col. Joseph M. Hartfield in 1938 joined with Messrs. T. Catesby Jones, Cazenove Gardner Lee, John Powell, and Robert Coleman Taylor in a contribution of funds for the purchase of various Jefferson letters. See Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 3, December 1938, p. 5. In 1949 he donated $220. for the purchase of a Jefferson letter to Samuel Taylor. Board of Aldermen Minutes, December 1949. Mr. T. Catesby Jones joined in the purchase recorded in Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 3, December 1938, p. 5. Mr. Cazenove Gardner Lee's contribution in that group action was a set of fourteen letters written by French officials to Arthur Lee in 1777 and 1780. Mr. Lee also made several other money contributions for the purchase of Lee family letters. 768. There were 2341 items in The Jefferson Papers of the University of Virginia: A Calendar, compiled by Constance E. Thurlow &amp; Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Charlottesville, University of Virginia Library, 1950. 769. An excellent and much more detailed statement is given by Mr. Berkeley in his article "The University of Virginia Library" in Autograph Collectors' Journal, vol. 4, no. 2, winter 1952, pp. 32-37. 770. See that same article by Mr. Berkeley, pages 35, 36. 771. From the effort to locate educational and philanthropic and church records, for the proposed Guide to Virginia Historical Materials, there resulted the transfer of a fair number to the Alderman Library. In some cases, photostat or microfilm copies were made for this Library or for some other Library in Virginia. Bibliographies of church records, wherever located, were appended to the fourth, fifth, and seventh Annual Reports of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library. 772. See supplement (compiled by Mr. Berkeley) to the eighth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library. 773. The number "over three hundred" comes from a count of the families listed in the indexes I to XV and XVI to XX of the Annual Reports on Historical Collections. 774. The introduction to the Thirteenth Annual Report on Historical Collections gives an exposition of the methods of handling manuscripts at the University of Virginia Library. 775.

McGregor which was given by Judge Hulbert on the occasion of the dedication and opening of the McGregor Room on 14 April 1939 was printed in full in Alumni News, vol. 27, no. 8, pp. 160-162, 169-172, and was afterwards issued as a separate. A much briefer sketch, abridged and adopted from Judge Hulbert's address, and approved by him, serves as an introduction to a Description of the Tracy W.

See page 153 of Section VI of this history. 949. There are standardization problems for example when positions like that of Circulation Librarian are compared for Sweet Briar College, the State Library, and the University of Virginia. 950. The "widespread impression" concerning the Staff at the University of Virginia Library is only in part based on documentary evidence, such as the letters received by the Faculty Library Committee in 1950 from some twenty or thirty Librarians who were consulted concerning a successor to Mr. Clemons. It is in part based on conversations with visitors to the Alderman Library, or with Librarians met by Mr. Dalton in the latter's 1949 and 1950 visits to leading American libraries. 951. The Reference Division was started in 1929 by the appointment of Mr. Wyllie as Assistant Reference Librarian. The Rare Book and Manuscript Division was formally started in 1938, in this case also Mr. Wyllie being the first head, as Director. The Virginia Collection which had been organized in 1928 was, however, a predecessor of the Rare Book and Manuscript Division. Of this Miss Harshbarger was the first head, followed by Mr. Wyllie. 952. The first meeting of the Board of Aldermen was held on 28 September 1938. Beginning with 6 October 1943 the meetings were held monthly. 953. Biographical data concerning Miss Farmer were obtained from the files in the office of the Department of Law. Details concerning the others were found in the files of the general office of the Alderman Library. Filed under the heading "McGregor Library, Curator Biographies," are somewhat fuller sketches of Miss Savage, Mr. Berkeley, and Mr. Wyllie. These were prepared at the request of the McGregor Advisory Committee. There are data concerning twelve of the fourteen (omitting Miss Farmer and Miss Koiner) in Who's Who in Library Service, edited by C. C. Williamson and Alice L.

Reports on the progress and extent of this service by the University of Virginia appears in successive Annual Library Reports. 958. See pages 73, 74 of Section IV of this history. 959. In addition to the data concerning Miss Dinwiddie in Who's who in Library Service, there are sketches of her career in Alumni News, vol. 38, no. 9, June 1950, pp. 9, 16, and in College and Research Libraries, vol. 11, no. 4, October 1950, p. 387. 960. See page 153 of Section VI of this history. 961. The expert Cataloguer who was in 1937 retiring from the Staff of the Library of Congress was Miss Jessie McLeish Watson. Details of the incident can be found, under her name, in the general office files. 962. The files in the general office and in the Preparations Division contain a really appalling amount of correspondence with the Library of Congress over classification details. 963. The first edition of the Union List of Serials was published in 1927. To it there were added Supplements dated 1931 and 1933. It was for these that contributions from the University of Virginia Library began. The great second edition, bringing the record down to 1940, was issued in 1943. Two supplements, the first coverning the years 1941 to 1943 and the second the years from 1944 to 1949, have been in progress since then. 964. The General Chairman of the Centennial Committee was Dr. John Lloyd Newcomb, See page 85 of Section IV of this history. 965. See page 146 of Section VI of this history. 966.

In 1950 he was Vincent Shea, University Bursar, Assistant to the President, and Secretary of the Board of Visitors. 972. In 1930 Dr. Lester J. Cappon was appointed as a member of the Library Staff, but it was understood that his title was University Archivist. This title, with the alternate title of University Records Administrator, was officially recognized by the State in 1949, after Mr. Lloyd S. Myer, State Records Administrator, had had surveys made of the records of state institutions by the Washington firm of Records Engineering, Inc. In 1949, therefore, Mr. Berkeley officially became University Archivist or University Records Administrator. 973. See page 161 of Section VI of this history. 974. The following is Mr. Berkeley's statement in the McGregor Library Curator Biographies: "Employed at Okinawa principally in making smoke screens to protect various battleships. Also shot down one Kamikaze plane... Sailed without damage, with my Task Unit, through the center of the Fifth of June Typhoon, adjacent to Admiral Halsey's Task Force, which on this occasion suffered more damage than in any engagement of the war." See The Caine Mutiny for a vivid story of a vessel not under Lieutenant Berkeley's command! 975. The promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander came in 1953. 976. See page 180 of Section VI of this history. 977. The use of the title Assistant Reference Librarian was a bit of salary strategy. It was hoped that when the title Reference Librarian came to be used, the salary could be advanced. 978. Alumni News, vol. 22, no. 2, November 1933, p. 37. 979.

Bardin and Mr. L. Gordon White; and Archivist, Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. 1000. The Studies in Bibliography supplied a much needed outlet for research in bibliography; and the excellent quality of the papers, of the editorial work, and of the printing won quick recognition both in the United States and in Great Britain. 1001. The Virginia World War II History Commission was created by act of the General Assembly in 1944, and was organized in October of that year. Dr. Lester J. Cappon was the first Director, and headquarters were established at the Alderman Library. Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill was Assistant Director, and followed Doctor Cappon as Director in 1945. See Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, vol. V, p. 81. Mr. Rachal was a member of the headquarters staff.

Of the twenty annual reports from 1930 to 1950, the first ten bore the title Annual Reports of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, and the second ten the title Annual Reports on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library. Of the whole series of twenty, Doctor Cappon compiled the first fifteen with the exception of the ninth, which was the work of Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill, and Mr. Berkeley compiled the last five. The sixteenth and seventeenth were issued in one volume and the eighteenth and nineteenth in one volume. Doctor Cappon's introductions to the fourteen reports which he compiled give statements of the original planning, details of survey and collecting activities, year by year records of the expansion of archival undertakings throughout the nation, a manual for collectors (fourteenth and fifteenth reports), and a description of the method of handling manuscripts in the Alderman Library (thirteenth report). In supplements to some of the earlier reports were contributions towards the guide to Virginia historical materials. There were, for example, "Parish Records of the Diocese of Virginia, 1653-1900" (compiled by Doctor Cappon and published as an appendix to the fourth annual report), "Parish Records of the Diocese of Southern and of Southwestern Virginia, 1648-1900" (compiled by Dr. W.

      <field name="fulltext">LEE PAPERS Records from minutes of meetings of the Board of Visitors and of the Faculty. Faculty. 8 December 1835. The Chairman laid before the Faculty the request of Mr. Richard H. Lee, Professor in Washington College, Pennsylvania, to be allowed to withdraw for a time, some manuscripts belonging to his Grandfather, R. H. Lee, as he stated and which he had presented to the University on condition of his having this privilege. His object was to make a copy of them, and he would then return the Originals to the University. Mr. Tucker offered the Following resolution which was seconded and passed. Richard H. Lee, Esq. having applied to the Faculty for permission to withdraw certain papers heretofore presented by him to the Library of this University, Resolved that with every disposition to comply with Mr. Lee's request, the Faculty do not conceive it within the scope of their powers to grant it. They however suggest that if Mr. Lee wishes copies of any of their papers they will afford him every facility in their power. But if Mr. Lee should find it more convenient to have possession of the papers themselves, they presume that on application to the Visitors, to whom alone it is competent to consent to their removal, his application will be granted. Faculty. 15 December 1835. The Chairman presented a report from the Librarian in regard to the revolutionary papers presented to the University by the descendants of R. H. Lee. Visitors. 12 August 1836. A letter from Wm. T. Joynes, late a Student of the University addressed to the Rector on the 30th of June containing an extract of a letter from Richd. H. Lee, Esqr. touching the papers of his grandfather, which were formerly given to the University having been read; in consideration thereof: Resolved, that the Visitors having regard to the value of the manuscripts referred to and the danger of loss or injury in sending them without the walls of the Institution feel it a duty to decline to part with the originals with the exception of a single letter or other manuscript to be selected by the Chairman of the Faculty from the collection of said manuscripts, one of the late Richd. H. Lee, one of Francis L. Lee &amp; one of Mr. Jefferson, and to be sent to Mr. Lee as autographs of his Grandfather, of Francis L. Lee &amp; of Mr. Jefferson. Resolved That the Secretary be requested to make copies of all the writings in said collection of the Late Richd. H. Lee Esqr. of the following dates viz: - 1775, 1776, 1777, 1784, 1785, 1788 &amp; 1789 and also all the letters of the late Edmund Pendleton Esqr. and to transmit the said copies to Mr. Richd. H.

Resolved, that it shall be the duty of the Secretary to retain copies certified by the Chairman of the Faculty of the three original papers directed to be returned by the preceding resolution. Visitors. 8 July 1841. 19. Resolved that the Chairman of the Faculty cause the papers and manuscripts deposited in the library by the Representatives of the late Richard Henry Lee decd. to be examined and classified by some competent hand on terms that he may deem reasonable &amp; and that they, together with a brief descriptive list of such as may appear to be of general interest or value be carefully lodged in such cases in the library as will best ensure their safety &amp; preservation, the expense of this work to be paid by the proctor upon the order of the Chairman. Visitors. 27 June 1856. On motion of Mr. Joynes [the former student who wrote the letter referred to in the minutes of 12 August 1836 was now himself a Visitor] it was Resolved That the original papers of Richard Henry Lee decd. in the possession of the University be placed in the hands of Professor Holcombe, who is hereby requested to examine the same and cause any of them to be copied which may be in such a condition as to require it, and of sufficient interest or importance to justify it, and to make such suggestions as may seem proper in relation to their future preservation. Visitors. 30 June 1857. On the suggestion of Professor Holcombe, (who represents that he cannot conveniently perform the duty) he is requested to transfer the original papers of Richd Henry Lee to Mr. N. Francis Cabell of Nelson County, with the request that he discharge the trust confided to Mr. Holcombe in reference to such papers. Faculty. 24 January 1881. The Chairman read a letter received from Prof. Cabell, now in Washington City, in relation to the sale of the Lee Papers to Congress. And a doubt arising as to the title of the University in these papers, and whether the authorities had a right to dispose of them: On motion Resolved, That a committee be appointed to investigate the matter and make report to the next meeting of the Faculty. The Committee, meanwhile to have authority to forbid the publication of any of the papers, till further action of the Faculty. Committee Professors Venable, Holmes, Fontaine. Faculty. 1 February 1881. Prof. Venable, Chairman of the Committee on the Lee Papers, submitted a report and resolution of the majority of the Committee â Prof. Holmes from the same Committee dissenting. On motion, the Report was received, and laid on the table for further consideration at the next meeting of the Faculty. On motion of Prof. Minor, Resolved that it is the opinion of the Faculty that no publication shall be made of any of the letters contained in the Lee Collection, so-called, now in the Library of the University, until and without the formal consent of the Board of Visitors shall be obtained thereto. Faculty. 1 March 1881. The Report of the Committee on the Lee Papers, which was laid on the table at the last meeting was taken up and adopted; it is as follows. Your Committee have found indubitable evidence that the Lee Papers belong to the University, being a gift from Richard Henry Lee, grandson of Richard Henry Lee of the Revolution. We recommend the passing of the following resolutions by the Faculty: 1. We respectfully recommend to the Board of Visitors to negociate for a sale of the Lee Papers to the U. States Government, with the consent of the present representatives of the Lee family, to be filed and preserved in the Congressional Library â and the purchase of a collection of books for the Library with the proceeds of the sale, said collection to be kept separate and styled the Richard Henry Lee Memorial - 2. That the Faculty cannot give their consent to any publication of copies of any of the hitherto unpublished letters or documents belonging to the Lee Papers, until the Board of Visitors at their next meeting, have acted on the above recommendation. The resolution was passed. Professor Holmes offered a series of resolutions in regard to the Lee Papers, which, on motion, were laid on the table for consideration at the next meeting of the Faculty. Faculty. 1 April 1881. Prof. Holmes' resolutions in reference to the Lee Papers were again postponed to the next meeting of the Faculty. Faculty. 30 April 1881. On Motion of Prof. Holmes, the resolutions offered by him and laid on the table, in regard to the Lee Papers were referred to the Committee on the Faculty Report. Faculty. 15 June 1881. [The annual report of the Faculty to the Board of Visitors was approved at this meeting. It included the following section.] 1. On three several occasions, within the last forty years, to wit: in July 1841, June 1856, and June 1857, the Visitors directed the examination and more or less complete transcription of what are known as the Lee Papers, presented by Richard Henry Lee Jr. to the Library of the University. Nothing has yet been done in this regard, except what is now in progress under the Authority of the Rector. Many of these Papers are already in a very dilapidated condition. Some have been apparently lost.- To prevent further injury, to retain a record of the several Papers, and also a copy of them in case they should be disposed of, it is recommended that the Visitors direct a fair copy to be made of all such of them as possess permanent interest. It seems advisable also that a Calendar or Catalogue of the Papers, with a brief indication of their contents, should be ordered for ordinary Consultation - It is further recommended that it should be ascertained and noted which of these Papers have been already published and where, and that correspondence should be opened with Harvard University, and with any other quarters where information is likely to be obtained, to discover what unpublished mss. remains among the Papers bestowed or left elsewhere by Richard Henry Lee, Jr. The information so obtained should be appended to the Calendar suggested - with a like Calendar of the Contents of such Papers, if the abstract of them can be procured. For the due execution of this important work, a suitable person should be employed and a small appropriation should be made for his compensation. 2. We also recommend that the Visitors negotiate for a sale of the Lee Papers to the U.S. Government, with the consent of the present representatives of the Family, to be filed and preserved in the Congressional Library; and that a collection of books be purchased for the Library with the proceeds of the Sale, such Collection to be kept separate and styled the Richard Henry Lee Memorial. Visitors. 29 June 1881. The [Visitors' Library] Committee feel especially called upon to endorse the action of the Rector and to respond to the recommendation of the Faculty with reference to the "Lee" papers &amp; to recommend the continuance of Col. Th. L. Preston in the duty of digesting &amp; collecting these valuable papers for their proper preservation upon reasonable terms of compensation to be approved by the Rector, for his past &amp; future services in the premises, until the completion of the same â but your Committee do not approve the recommendation of the Faculty for the sale of these manuscripts, believing them to be especially appropriate &amp; valuable to the archives of the University... [This report of the Visitors' Library Committee was signed by Jno. L. Marye, Jno. Goode, Jno. F. Lay.] On motion the foregoing resolutions are adopted and approved by the Board. Visitors. 29 September 1881. 2. Correspondence of Col. T. L. Preston with reference to his claim to additional compensation for work done by him in preparation of synoptical Catalogue of the "Lee Papers." ... The Board being informed, that since the payment of two hundred &amp; twenty five dollars to Col. Thos. L. Preston for his services in the preparation of a synoptical Catalogue &amp; Index of the Lee Papers, and the direction to suspend said work, he has voluntarily continued his labors in this matter and rendered his bill for 40 days of this continued labor amounting to one hundred dollars, the Board hereby authorize the payment of this Bill by the Proctor; and in view of the fact that the cost of this work has already exceeded the expectation of the Board, when the prosecution of it was authorized, the Board is compelled to decline any further outlay of money in this work, and the Secretary of the Board is directed to deliver a copy of this minute to Col. Preston. Faculty. 24 June 1882. [A report from Major Green Peyton, Proctor, is included in the faculty minutes of this date. This report includes the item] ... and of $325 for the Lee Papers.

On motion of Prof. Garnett, any letters of George Mason found amongst the Lee papers, may be copied in the library during library hours; but said letters are not to go out of the custody of the Librarian. Visitors. 28 June 1887. The chairman of the Faculty sent unto the Board the following documents: ... 9. Petition Rev. M. D. Conway for leave to make copies of the Edmund Randolph letters in the Lee correspondence, in the University Library. Resolved, that permission be granted to Mr. Moncure D. Conway to make a copy of any manuscripts or papers at the University by, or relating to the late Hon. Edmund Randolph and provided that all such copies be made in the Library and under the supervision of the Librarian. [In a Visitors minute of this same date is a recommendation from the Visitors' Library Committee that the above resolution be adopted.] Faculty. 1 February 1888. On motion Prof. Garnett is given permission to examine the "Lee Papers." Faculty. 2 April 1888.

On motion, Resolved, That the matter be referred to the Library Committee for consideration and report. Faculty. 4 October 1901. The following report submitted by the Library Committee in regard to the publication of documents in the Library is adopted:- The general subject of the publication of hitherto unpublished documents in the Library having been referred to the Library Committee because of some recent applications for the privilege of publishing certain letters now preserved in the Library, the Committee, after mature deliberation, respectfully submits the following report:- 1. No general rule seems possible except either to prohibit any such publications or to grant all applications for the privilege of such publication, neither of which rules seems wise. 2. The Committee, therefore, recommends that, in all cases of application for the privilege named, the application be acted on by the Faculty after reference to and report from an appropriate committee. 3. It is recommended that the application now before the Faculty be referred to a special committee composed of Professors Dabney, Harrison* * Professor Harrison was named against his protest by the other members of the Committee. and Kent. Committee Milton W. Humphreys James M. Page James A. Harrison Richard H. Wilson Faculty. 4 December 1901. On motion, Resolved, That Mrs. Ida A. Green be informed that the Faculty does not wish copies of letters of the Lee Papers to be made for publication. Faculty. 4 March 1903. Professor Dabney announced that Dr. Ballagh of Johns Hopkins University desired to be informed whether the University of Virginia would publish, in connection with Johns Hopkins University, the unpublished Lee Letters owned by the University of Virginia. The matter was postponed until such time as the University of Virginia shall have investigated more fully with a view to publishing these MSS. on its own account. Formal application to Mr. Carnegie for funds for such publication was authorized. Faculty. 4 April 1903. A letter from Mr. DeCourcey W. Thom on the subject of the publication of the Lee Letters was referred to a special committee composed of the Library Committee and the Professor of History. Faculty. 5 October 1903. The Chairman read again Mr. DeC. W. Thom's letter in regard to the Lee letters, after which Mr. Thom's request that he be permitted to publish them under the conditions named in his communication, was referred to the Board with the Faculty's approval. Prof. [Richard H.] Wilson voted No. Faculty. 10 November 1903. [The autumn report of the Faculty to the Board of Visitors contained the following:-] I. That the application of Mr. DeCourcey W. Thom to be permitted to publish the Lee Letters under the conditions named in his communication of June 19, 1903, be granted. Visitors. 10 November 1903. Resolved: Pursuant to recommendation I of the Faculty, that the application of Mr. DeCourcey W. Thom, of Baltimore, Md., to publish the Lee Letters, now belonging to the University, be, and it is hereby granted on the conditions named in the two letters of Mr. Thom to the Board dated June 19th, 1903, and Sept. 8, 1903, respectively, said letters to be recorded with this resolution. "Blaksford," Queenstown, Md. 8/8/03 To the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, Gentlemen: I beg to reproffer my request to have the "Lee Letters" entrusted to me or my agent for conveyance to this region for examination &amp; comparison with certain published "Lee Letters" that I may bring out a new and complete edition of them if it shall seem to me wise. I will be responsible for the safe guarding of the MSS. letters. Furthermore, I will bear the whole cost of transporting and publishing them if those things occur, and will present to Alma Mater any net profits in the venture. In the whole affair I will seek to properly advertise the University of Virginia. Believe me, gentlemen, respectfully yours, DeCourcey W. Thom Faculty. 4 March 1904. The Chairman read a letter from Mr. DeCourcey Thom saying that the "Lee Letters," property of the University loaned to Mr. Thom, had not been injured by recent severe fire in Baltimore. [There is inserted at this point in the chronology a paragraph from the annual report of the Librarian, John Shelton Patton, for the year ended 1 March 1913. This report was printed in the Alumni Bulletin, third series, volume 6, number 2, April 1913, pages 240-246.] I suggest in this place that the Lee Letters be mounted and bound after the manner in which the original letters in the Polk collection in the Library of Congress have been treated. Letters in bulk, however well cared for, decay. It has been learned by a long series of experiments and by observations in European archives, as well as in American, that manuscripts packed away and excluded from light and air decay much more rapidly than those kept in the open â that is, as the average book is kept in a library. It would cost something, but I believe the money would be well spent, and it would probably be proper to charge the expense to the Byrd fund. Faculty Library Committee. 20 March 1913. The Committee also decided that the manuscript case which it has had under consideration should be provided at once. Professor Thornton, chairman of the committee on furniture, reported the style of case that seemed to him the best suited for the Library and it was understood that he would proceed at once to have it made and installed.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">DANCING IN THE ROTUNDA F 3 June 1865. "Resolved that the regulation forbidding the use of the public rooms for any purpose not sanctioned by the Faculty remains unrescinded and will be enforced by the Faculty." V 1 July 1874. The Visitors' Library Committee reported that it had considered Librarian Wertenbaker's protest against the holding of public balls in the Rotunda, but had concluded that his fear of the danger of fire was unfounded. Moreover it was the impression of the Commitee that "As far as the visiting public and the young men are concerned the Annual Ball is one of the chief items of attraction of the session â and it is peculiarly proper that the handsomest hall at our command should be used for the occasion." V 20 June 1880. The Visitors' Library Committee reported that for two or three years daytime dances had been held in the Rotunda during the commencement period in addition to the annual ball on the evening of the day of the Final Exercises. It was therefore voted "That the Board disapprove of the use of the Library Room for dancing during the daytime of Commencement week, and request the Chairman of the Faculty to prohibit the same but this resolution is not intended to deny the use of the Room for the `Final Ball' under such regulations as to that privilege as the Chairman shall prescribe." V 27 June 1881. "... Dr. Jas. F. Harrison, Chairman of the Faculty, ... presented also a petition from a committee of Students requesting the use of the Library for the morning `Germans' during the Commencement week, Whereupon, on motion of Mr. Lay: "Resolved that the action of the Board in June 1880 denying to the students the use of the Library for the `Germans' during the Commencement week ... be rescinded and Dr. Harrison being present, was requested to inform the students of the action." V 1 July 1881. "The Board, upon further consideration of the matter, instruct the Chairman of the Faculty that, hereafter the Library-Room shall not be used for dancing except on the morning of Wednesday &amp; and on the night of the final-day of the Commencement season." F 17 June 1884. [The following is section X of the annual report of the Faculty to the Board of Visitors.] "X Occupancy of the Library Room by Dancers during the last week of the Session. "The Faculty regard the privilege accorded to a limited number of the students, with their friends, of occupying our finest public room during the closing week of the session, for the purpose of dancing, as one which it is highly desirable to withdraw. Such privilege is one of comparatively recent origin. It practically excludes the majority of students and visiting strangers from the most interesting apartment in our buildings at the most interesting public period of the session, and is, in several other respects, to be regretted. "The Faculty would leave, for the present, untouched the final ball, on the last night of the session, and the use of the library room for that object; but they respectfully ask the Visitors to withdraw the rather recently granted permission to hold dancing in the library room, either mornings or evenings, during the last week of the session." F 20 June 1885. [The following is quoted from the annual report of the Faculty to the Board of Visitors.] "Dancing in the Library-room during the last week of the session. The Faculty respectfully renews the recommendation made in the last annual report that, by an enactment of the Board, the use of the Library-room for purpose of dancing, during the closing week of the session, shall be denied. The usage is of recent origin, and practically excludes most of the students and strangers visiting the University from the Library during the period of the session when it is particularly important when strangers, especially, should have free and undisturbed access to it. By allowing such an employment of its most elegant and attractive appartment, the University sacrifices to the wishes of a few young people, the advantage of exhibiting to enlightened and cultivated visitors the most interesting portion of the Institution." F 4 June 1886. "Resolved, that if no overruling regulation to the contrary be found, the Chairman be requested to give orders in reference to the Library Hall for purposes of dancing in accordance with the recommendations of the Faculty Report just adopted, making at his discretion, an exception of one occasion." V 30 June 1886. "Resolved, that the Board disapprove of the use of the Library Room for dancing and requests the Chariman of the Faculty to prohibit the same, but this resolution is not intended to deny the use of the room for the Final Ball under such regulations as to that privilege as the Chairman shall prescribe." F 1 July 1886. "Resolved that, henceforward, the Library shall not be used for dancing; and that, if necessary, the Visitors be requested to give an order to that effect." V 4 August 1886. "Resolved, that in regard to the recommendation of the Chairman of the Faculty as to the use of the Library Room for dancing, the Board deem it inexpedient to impose any restrictions beyond those prescribed in the resolution of this Board at its last meeting." V 24 June 1889. "Resolved that the young people be permitted to have the use of the Library room for the `German' on the 25th, but that this is not to be considered as a precedent for future action." F 25 June 1890. "An application from some of the students is submitted for the use of the Library for dancing on Monday morning and Tuesday night of Commencement Week. "Resolved, That the application be forwarded to Board with the disapproval of the Faculty and a statement of the reasons therefor." V 27 June 1890. "A communication was received from Messrs Robertson &amp; others, Committee of Students, asking permission to use the Library for the `german' on Monday morning the 30th inst. etc., which was considered and on motion the following resolution was adopted: "Resolved, that the communication of Messrs. J. B. Robertson, R. W. Greenway &amp; F. L. Taylor, Committee be referred to the Faculty with the request that they reconsider their action and grant the use of the Library to the students for the Germans to be held on Monday morning the 30th inst. and on the following Tuesday &amp; Wednesday evenings and that said Committee be advised to renew their application to the Faculty." F 27 June 1890. [Extract from annual report of the Faculty to the Board of Visitors.] "7. Dancing in the Library Room. "In regard to the application of certain students for the use of the Library room on Monday morning and Tuesday night of next week for dancing purposes, the Faculty, in view of the very serious interruption to the work of the Librarian and Secretary of the Faculty, and to the filling up of the Diplomas of the various Professors, which was caused last year by a similar use of the only apartment in which these important duties of the Librarian and Faculty can be properly attended to, unanimously recommend that the request be not granted, should the application be made to the Board." F 28 June 1890. "The Chairman having submitted a communication from the Board of Visitors referring back to the Faculty for reconsideration the application of some of the students for the use of the Library for dancing ... the following resolution is unanimously adopted and ordered to be transmitted to the Board.- "Resolved, That the Faculty present to the Visitors a respectful expression of their conviction that to grant the use of the Library for dancing before the close of the session is a serious hindrance to the work of the University. "With every disposition to further the desires of the students as far as is compatible with the conduct of the serious work of the University, this question has been repeatedly considered by the Faculty and their views have been expressed in Reports to the Visitors to which your attention is respectfully recalled. "The Faculty feel constrained to express that, when their views regarding the business of the University conflict with the plans of a small number of the students as to their amusements, the former should by the decision of the Visitors be subordinated to the latter." [It would seem that the last paragraph is so worded as to say the opposite of what it was intended to say.] V 28 June 1890. "A communication was received from the Faculty reiterating their opposition to the use of the Library room for dancing, before the end of the session, which was read and on motion the same was ordered to be laid on the table." F 20 June 1891. "An application having been submitted from the `German Club' for the use of the Library during the Finals for dancing, "Resolved, That the application be referred to the Board of Visitors." F 4 April 1892. "A petition having been submitted by Prof. Mallet in behalf of the young ladies that they be allowed the use of the Library for a German, "Resolved, That the petition be granted, that the time be limited to one o'clock A.M., and that the expenses incurred be paid by the parties using the room." [It may be noted that 1892 was a leap year] F 5 December 1892. "An application is submitted from the University German Club for the use of the Library for dancing. "Resolved, That the application be not granted." F 4 March 1893. "An application is submitted from the Univ. German Club and the Eli Banana Club for the use of the Library for their Easter German. "Resolved, that the application be declined."
