      <field name="fulltext">Thirteenth Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, For the Year 1942-43 THE introductory essay of this report represents a departure from the recent policy of surveying the year's activities of the Library in the field of manuscripts and other research materials in relation to problems and developments in archives and manuscripts throughout the nation. Instead, an exposition on the accession and arrangement of manuscripts and kindred materials in the Alderman Library has been undertaken. In aiming to show to what degree our system is orderly and practicable we anticipate and invite outside criticism. Such criticism may confirm and supplement our own in the light of experience during the past dozen years. We believe that archivists, curators, and their associates are interested in how the other fellow handles his professional stock-in-trade and how well the public may fare by his service. We hope that other institutions may be willing to provide a view from the inside. Written records on this subject are unfortunately few in number. The basic criterion for judging a system of administering manuscript materials, or any other kind of records, is the simplicity and directness of the process whereby they can be located and made available for use. It is justifiable to expect this ready accessibility in respect to separate collections of papers, to manuscript volumes within collections or apart from them, and to many individual manuscripts because of their special importance or because of a specific reference provided by the inquirer to aid in finding an item. A second criterion requires that the papers within any collection be arranged in such orderly fashion as to render them of maximum research value, and, without vitiating this objective, to facilitate the search for individual items. Chronological arrangement is generally preferred, modified sometimes, however, by certain predetermining factors in relation to the original scheme of arrangement or to the evolution of an organic body of papers. Manuscripts brought together from diverse sources because of some common feature or the peculiar interest of the collector may have been subjected to some special organization to accommodate that interest; but the custodian who acquires such a collection may be able to justify a substitute arrangement to enhance the usefulness of the papers. A third consideration in judging the operation of the manuscript depository is the development of reference works concerning the physical nature and the contents of the collections. If both current operations and cumulative projects are to be served by these reference tools, they must be designed with due regard for their long-time functions. The average manuscript, unlike the average book, has an individuality that defies neat classification schemes ready for use and adaptable to most libraries of printed works. Likewise a corpus of manuscript papers, being something more than the sum of its parts, is not susceptible to regimented arrangement without loss of character. It should be preserved as an entity but, if its content is diverse in subject matter, its location in the depository can scarcely be determined on that basis. Great allowance must be made for physical characteristics—size, bulk, and form, especially whether bound or loose papers—in deciding where they can be placed. In a depository with a wide variety of records, archival or personal papers or both, it would seem advisable to avoid that excess of systematic order which may produce creeping paralysis. Such a system may necessitate frequent shifting of collections so that new acquisitions will fit into the proper niche that can never be anticipated. The curator of a depository with rapidly increasing resources may easily yield to the urge to evolve a system which meets his needs because the specifications are his own; yet it may be quite impracticable for anyone else to use. Simplicity of organization and arrangement thus suggests one of the curator's obligations to posterity. Another is to provide a concise guide-index as a sort of master key to the manuscript resources as a whole, supplemented perhaps by other keys for more specific purposes, so that he who runs may read. Surely the custodian who dies with the only index to his collections in his head should be condemned with the maximum penalty. The transfer of the University of Virginia Library from the Rotunda to the newly completed building in May, 1938, henceforth known as the Alderman Library, occurred at a critical time for the Manuscripts Division. Since its inception in 1930, an expanding program of field work for the collection of materials had yielded an ever larger number of acquisitions from year to year. Numerous gifts also came without solicitation from friends of the University and through correspondence often begun by some chance information reaching the Library. After five years had elapsed, serious congestion was developing in the limited quarters of the Division. Collections were shifted about to conserve space; many of the newspaper files were removed temporarily to Clark Hall (the Law School) pending completion of the Alderman Library; some work in microphotography was started in a small way with a Leica camera and a make-shift dark-room in another building. The librarian of the University and the staff of the Manuscripts Division had always asserted with a touch of pride that all manuscripts in their custody were promptly filed and made accessible for use and that none were in storage or out of reach, at least from the top of a step-ladder. After the first five years this assertion was made less readily or with reservations. Nevertheless, what the user asked for could usually be found quite promptly because the curator was familiar with the contents of most collections and their location could easily be kept in mind. Furthermore a general card index had been begun and special analytical work was in process on the Cabell, Jefferson, Lee, and Poe collections. The holdings of the Division did not seem especially numerous, but they were imperceptibly getting out of hand for want of adequate controls. Shortly after removal to the new building an increase of staff facilitated some reorganization amid new equipment and what appeared to be unlimited space. The University's rare books were transferred to the jurisdiction of the curator of manuscripts and the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts came into being. The gift of the Tracy W. McGregor Library to the University in June, 1938, necessitated some revision in the original floor plans for the Division in order to provide sufficient space for the McGregor Room as an integral part of the Division. The close proximity of the Division's offices to the manuscript reading room, the McGregor Room, and the book stacks on the second floor, and to the newspapers, maps, and photographic laboratory directly below on the first floor proved to be very advantageous for use of the variety of research materials at hand.1 1. For a brief description of this section of the Alderman Library see Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1937-38 (University, Va., 1938), page 5; also University of Virginia Alumni News, XXVI, No. 10, Aug.-Sept., 1938, pages 228, 230-32, 235. The manuscript room in the Alderman Library is equipped with a large number of four-drawer legal size all-steel vertical filing cabinets, arranged in double parallel rows, back to back. The trays are numbered consecutively from top to bottom, left to right. In order to provide a double check on all materials received by gift, purchase, or deposit, an Accessions Book was opened on July 1, 1938. This provides a chronological list of acquisitions (by date received), complementary to the alphabetical card file of names of collections, authors of manuscripts, and subject-headings which had been in process for some years. Beginning July, 1938, accessions have been numbered consecutively from No. 1. Gifts and purchased materials are received through the Acquisitions Division where a record of each accession is made and retained in that Division. A typed "main entry" card for each accession, giving the name of the person from whom acquired, whether gift or purchase, date received, approximate number of items, and inclusive dates of the collection if readily determined, is sent with the collection it represents to the Manuscripts Division by the Acquisitions Division.2 2. Manuscripts and other materials are cleaned by a blower and vacuum machine and fumigated, when necessary, in the Acquisitions Division before being released for further processing. Here the same information is entered in the Accessions Book, with a brief comment on the nature of the contents. The accession number given to the collection or single item, as the case may be, is entered on the card. In the Manuscripts Division analytical cards are made, and these, together with the main entry card received from the Acquisitions Division, are filed in the manuscript catalogue. Having been accessioned, the collection is unfolded and flattened, piece by piece, and arranged chronologically. If the collection is not especially large, this job can be done promptly and the manuscripts placed in folders (five to twenty-five to a folder), each of which is given the number assigned to the collection in the Accessions Book. The smaller collections of manuscripts are scanned and a summary of their contents is made and filed at the beginning of the first folder. A similar description is prepared for each large collection as time allows.3 3. These summaries are used in preparing the annual list of accessions published in the Eleventh (and subsequent) Annual Report[s] on Historical Collections. Unfortunately the practice of preparing such summaries was not adopted until recently. Subject entries in the card file guide to all collections have served the same purpose indirectly and to a limited degree. The accessions folder is labeled as follows: John Doe 6 Ivy Lane Anywhere, Va. Papers of Harry Brown ca. 700 items. No. 688 Gift, April 10, 1933 Placed in Tray 68 After the collection has been arranged in the folder, or folders, and properly numbered and labeled, it is filed in the vertical tray in the consecutive order of the accession number.4 4. On the label of each file drawer appear the number of the tray and the inclusive numbers of the manuscript collections therein. An extensive collection requiring a whole tray or more is filed separately and a dummy folder by accession number contains a reference to the tray or trays where the manuscripts are located. In processing a few of the more valuable collections, each manuscript is placed in a separate folder specially labeled and filed in chronological order. The chronological folder is labeled as follows: 1780, Jan. 1 ALS Harry Brown to James Smith Brown This detailed preparation, however, does not affect the general system of arrangement and location. Manuscript collections acquired before July, 1938, were at this time numbered consecutively with the prefix "38" and filed in a separate series. Main entry cards for these collections and some subject cards were already in the index-guide. In accepting manuscripts on deposit a special mimeographed form-sheet is filled out in quadruplicate; the original is sent to the depositor, the second copy is preserved in the Manuscripts Division, the third in the librarian's office, and the fourth in the Acquisitions Division. The deposit slip contains a brief description of the collection with inclusive dates and number of items, and the terms of deposit and withdrawal. A deposit, like a gift or purchase, is assigned a regular accession number, arranged properly in a labeled folder, and filed in the same numerical series. The deposit slip retained in the Division is stamped with the accession number and filed with the collection. If the deposit is withdrawn, the folder containing the description of the collection and the deposit slip with information about the withdrawal remains in the file tray as a sort of dummy entry. Some accessions consist entirely or in part of bound manuscript volumes which cannot be conveniently kept with the loose papers in the file trays. The description of such a collection is filed in a folder according to its accession number. The folder contains a reference to the location of the volumes on shelves in the locked stack adjoining the office of the Division. Thus, for a collection consisting exclusively of bound volumes the folder filed by accession number serves mainly as a dummy to locate them. In the stack, at the head of a group of manuscript volumes belonging to one collection is a wooden dummy with the accession number followed by the number of volumes. Such collections consist mainly of the records of business firms,5 5. Cf. "A Checklist of Bound Business Records in the Manuscript Collections of the Alderman Library, University of Virginia," Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist, . . . 1937-38, pages 17-38. religious, educational, and other social organizations. An extensive body of bound volumes that should be mentioned at this point is the archival records of the University of Virginia, as distinguished from certain loose papers preserved in the vertical files. The earlier volumes, previously in the custody of the bursar, were transferred to the Alderman Library in 1939.6 6. These volumes are included in "A Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia," Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, . . . 1935-36, pages 9-27. Some records of student organizations, student notebooks and letters, and numerous other unofficial manuscripts about the University have been acquired, but these are filed as separate collections as accessioned. Because of their importance and frequent use the Jefferson manuscripts have been given special attention. Beginning as a small collection before the Library had a Manuscripts Division, these papers have been steadily augmented by originals, microfilm, photostats, and photographic prints, mostly as single items or in small groups. In accordance with the numerical system of filing, these Jefferson accessions would be scattered throughout the files under their respective accession numbers. Instead, they have been brought together as the Jefferson Collection, chronologically arranged, each item in a separate folder. As the collection was arranged, a calendar was made; later this calendar was typed, indexed, and bound for use in the Division. The original folder for each accession remains in its proper place by accession number in the general files, with a cross reference to the Jefferson Collection; and the folder with the manuscript in the Jefferson Collection bears the accession number as a tracer to the information on its acquisition. When the calendar was completed and before it was indexed, each entry was numbered consecutively and this number was also stamped on the folder containing the manuscript. Thus it is possible to refer quickly from the calendar to the manuscripts or vice versa. To maintain this advantage without impairment, manuscripts acquired after the calendar was completed have been accessioned as usual but filed as a collection of "Additional Jefferson Manuscripts" in close proximity to the Jefferson Collection. The disadvantage of having two such collections could be obviated by bringing the calendar, as originally compiled on loose leaves, up to date and maintaining it as a continuing project. The two Jefferson collections could be merged without regard for entry numbers in the typed calendar and additions recorded in the loose-leaf calendar as a current reference tool.7 7. Like the Jefferson material, the Poe manuscripts have been assembled into one collection. Others, like the James Madison and James Monroe, may be filed in this manner as they become more extensive. Of wider significance as a guide to Jeffersoniana is a chronological card checklist recording the location of all known letters to and from Jefferson, with citations of printed texts. It has been compiled from various printed bibliographies, check-lists, calendars, and dealers' catalogues, from photographic copies of manuscripts and indexes generously provided by other libraries, and from data gathered during personal visits by members of the staff to other institutions. The task of verifying names and dates has been greatly facilitated by means of Jefferson's own "epistolary record," which he kept from 1779-1826. Thus the University of Virginia has the only near-complete guide to all extant Jefferson manuscripts. An analysis made of it by Dr. Julian P. Boyd of Princeton University, during a preliminary survey to plan a new edition of Jefferson's works, revealed that only twenty-nine and six-tenths per cent of the letters by Jefferson and a mere six and five-tenths per cent of those to him have been published. The Tracy W. McGregor Library includes manuscripts as well as rare books. Most of the manuscripts have been purchased since the McGregor Library was transferred to the University of Virginia, with emphasis upon significant Virginia and southern material, especially Jeffersoniana. McGregor acquisitions are entered in the Accessions Book in the same way as all others; a card is made and a folder with accession number, heading, and the note—"McGregor Manuscript in Vault." This folder is then placed in the general file by number and the manuscripts go to the vault where single items and groups, whatever the nature of the acquisition, are filed alphabetically by the writers of the manuscripts. A group of papers is, of course, filed chronologically within the group. Therefore, many dummy folders are required in the general file, as illustrated above; thus, too, the Jefferson Collection must contain dummy folders referring to manuscripts in the McGregor files in the vault. The Albemarle County Historical Society, organized in 1940, accepted the offer of the Alderman Library to preserve its manuscripts in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division. They are accessioned as all other manuscripts are; in addition, the Society has its own accession record book which is kept up to date by the archivist of the Society who thus far has been also the person in charge of manuscripts in the Library. The Society's manuscripts are filed in a separate vertical tray, alphabetical by name of collection or by writer of the manuscript if it is a single item. Maps belonging to the Alderman Library are preserved on the first floor, below the reading room of the Division and directly accessible by stairway. Unbound maps are placed in manila paper folders cut to size which are labeled with the name of the state, country, or region, a call-number, and the decade in which the date of the map falls. The system of call-numbers is an adaptation of the Dewey classification which has been used for some time by the Virginia State Library. Taking the history-geography classification 900., the digit 9 is dropped and the decimal point is moved one place to the right. Thus the Dewey number for Virginia, 975.5, becomes 755.0. The number for any country or subdivision can be readily found by consulting the history section of Dewey's Decimal Classification and Relativ Index. The maps are filed in all-steel map cases, but up to the present time only the Virginia maps have been arranged in detail chronologically. Dummy entries in the folders refer to bound folio maps too large for the cases and to smaller bound maps which are filed elsewhere. A main entry card catalogue of all Virginia maps to ca. 1875 has been prepared. Each card contains the date, name of cartographer, title of map, place and date of publication, and the number of the map in the Phillips and Swem bibliographies.8 8. P. L.

Maps Relating to Virginia in the Virginia State Library and Other Departments of the Commonwealth, with the 17th and 18th Century Atlas-Maps in the Library of Congress . . . , " Virginia State Library Bulletin, VII, Nos. 2-3, (Richmond, 1914). Maps in the McGregor Library are kept in the vault. They are separated into three groups—Virginia, North America, and others —and each group arranged chronologically. A main entry card has been made for each Virginia and North American map and filed in the general index guide to materials other than books in the Division. McGregor folio atlases are arranged chronologically in separate cases in the vault. They have been inventoried but not catalogued as yet. The newspaper collection of the Alderman Library consists of three groups—Virginia papers, all others published in the United States, and foreign. The Virginia papers constitute by far the largest proportion of the total.9 9. For a somewhat detailed comment on the preservation of Virginia newspapers see Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35 (University, Va., 1935), pages 3-5. Most of the newspaper collection is shelved on the first two stack floors below the locked stack adjoining the manuscript room; papers antedating 1821, those of the Civil War years, and a few others of special value are preserved in the locked stack. Within each of the three groups mentioned above, the files, scattered issues, and single numbers, as the case may be, are arranged alphabetically by name of city or town and under each city by key word of title. Where the same paper was published daily, semi-weekly, and weekly, each edition is filed as a unit in the order just listed. Lack of adequate funds for binding has necessitated the use of heavy cardboard and durable tape for shelving unbound papers flatfiled in bundles labeled at one corner so that they can be easily identified on the shelves. A card index to the collection (one card for each year of every title), which also serves as an inventory, is arranged alphabetically, using the same system by which the papers are filed. This index is located in the office adjoining the stacks on the first floor.10 10. Detailed information in print on the newspaper holdings of the Library is provided in L. J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935; A Bibliography . . . (New York, 1936); G. C. Smith, "A Checklist of Newspapers to 1821 . . . ," in Ninth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1938-39 (University, Va., 1939), pages 26-30. The more important acquisitions since these publications appeared are listed in the series of annual reports, op. cit. The McGregor Library contains a few rare newspapers. These are preserved in the vault and are recorded in the card index. In locked cases in the McGregor Room, adjacent to the Manuscript Room, are the rare books of that Library which consists chiefly of Americana and some volumes of English literature. They are arranged on the shelves by date of imprint and under each date alphabetically by author. They are separately catalogued but author and subject cards for each book are incorporated in the public catalogue of the Alderman Library. A main entry card catalogue of the McGregor Library is filed in the office of the Division; an index to the names of binders of rare books in this Library is also kept here. The rare book collection of the Alderman Library is catalogued, like all other books, according to the Library of Congress system of classification. Cards for these rare books are also included in the public catalogue. An asterisk preceding the call-number indicates that the book is rare and is located in the locked stack of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division. Since Virginiana are one of the special interests of the Alderman Library, a Virginia imprints catalogue, alphabetical by place of imprint and chronological under each place, of all such items in the Library, whether rare or not, is maintained in the office of the Division.11 11. The Library cooperated with the American Imprints Inventory of the Historical Records Survey, Work Projects Administration, in the compilation of Virginia imprints, but the work was not carried far enough before suspension for any comprehensive publication on Virginia. Only one local list was published: New Market, Virginia, Imprints, 1860-1876; a Checklist, edited by Lester J. Cappon and Ira V. Brown. University of Virginia Bibliographical Series, No. 5 (Alderman Library, Charlottesville, Va., 1942), x, 36 pages. Master's theses and doctoral dissertations written at the University of Virginia are filed in the locked stack in two series. Master's theses (M. A. and M. S.) received each year are arranged alphabetically by author and then numbered consecutively in a continuous series from year to year. Each volume is labeled with the letter "M" and a number assigned to it. The series of doctoral dissertations is arranged and labeled in the same way, with the letter "D." Separate author catalogues are maintained for master's theses and doctor's dissertations. Subject-title indexes are in preparation. The photographic laboratory, established in connection with the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division of the Alderman Library, is equipped to make photoprints, single and double frame microfilms, and projection slides. Photoprints serve two purposes; they fill gaps in our collection by reproducing materials located in other libraries, and they protect rare manuscripts by allowing research students to use a print rather than the actual document. They are filed as separate items or within the collections to which they refer, as though they were manuscripts. The microfilm library of the Manuscripts Division is steadily growing. From a collection of only a few rolls, it has expanded until some separate system of classification and filing became necessary. There are, at present, three types of microfilm rolls: those of the series ordered from the University Microfilm Company,12 12. University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan. of books printed in England before 1550, those of printed items assembled by the Library itself, and those of manuscript items. The University Microfilm Company furnishes mimeographed catalogue cards with the films. After checking the cards and the film roll, the roll is assigned a number, which is indicated on the cards. The cards are then sent to the Preparations Division and are treated as any other catalogue cards. The rolls of printed materials assembled by the University itself are analyzed in a similar manner. Literal transcripts of the titles appearing in the roll13 13. There may easily be more than one title, in as much as the roll is assembled in the photographic laboratory by splicing a number of printed items together in order to obtain a hundred-foot roll. are sent to the Preparations Division where a mimeographed card is made for them and they are catalogued in the regular manner. Instead of an LC number, however, all microfilm rolls of printed material, whether University Microfilms or those assembled by the Library, are given a "P" number, starting with P-1 and numbered consecutively in the order of their acquisition. The "P" number is indicated on the card which is filed in the general catalogue, and upon the film with a special ink. The film, each roll in a cardboard carton, labeled with the identical number, is then placed in consecutive order in a locked case close to the reading machines. Microfilm of rolls of manuscript materials is treated in a similar manner. Enough items are spliced together to make a roll of one hundred feet. Whenever possible, these rolls are made up of definitely related materials. For example, there are many rolls of Jefferson manuscripts, several of Poe letters, others of Civil War items. Each roll is then analyzed, much as though it were a regular manuscript collection. Main entry and subject cards, indicating the owner of the original manuscript, the date of the microfilm, as well as the subject of the microfilm, are made and filed in the manuscript card index. These rolls are given an "M" number consecutively as they are assembled. For example, the letters of Mrs. Henry Jacob Smith are on microfilm roll M-38 and are so indicated upon the card in the manuscript index. The roll itself is marked as above, placed in a cardboard container, and filed in the same locked case mentioned above. Photographic orders for students, departments of the University, research workers, and others, are placed through the Manuscripts Division. Many manuscripts and valuable documents have been made available for research by those who have graciously allowed us to photograph the items in their possession. The microfilm room is equipped with the following film reading machines: Argus microfilm reading machine (Science Service), Reading machine projector (Society for Visual Education), Recordak Model C library film reader (Recordak Corporation), Students microfilm reading machine (Spencer Lens Corporation). The program of the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts, expanding from a small nucleus administered under serious physical handicaps in the Virginia Room of the Rotunda, has coordinated activities outside the Library with those within. Field trips have been cumulative in their results, not only in manuscript and printed records collected but also in data gathered on the archives and manuscripts of a wide variety of institutions in Virginia. Personal contacts with these institutions have fostered cooperation in the preservation of research materials and in the interchange of information and good will for the advancement of scholarship. Obviously these functions have a direct relation to the program within the Library whereby additional material is acquired by correspondence, collections are made accessible for use, reference tools are compiled, and publications are issued.14 14. In addition to the present series of Annual Report[s] on Historical Collections, two others are published through the Library: the University of Virginia Bibliographical Series, some numbers of which are products of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, and the Publications of the Tracy W. McGregor Library. Thus the enrichment of the Library's resources and the services it affords have contributed to the promotion of research at the University of Virginia. Especially significant has been the influence of the McGregor Library toward this end. In conclusion, it is appropriate to point out that Dr. Dumas Malone, before he left the University of Virginia in 1929 to become co-editor of the Dictionary of American Biography, gave inspiration and support to the idea of establishing a Manuscripts Division. The planning and execution of this program has been chiefly the work of Sergeant John Cook Wyllie, Director of Rare Books and Manuscripts (on leave), Lieutenant Francis L. Berkeley, USNR, and Miss Louise Savage, successively Acting Directors, and Lieutenant George H. Reese, USNR. The scholarly advice and judgment of Professors Thomas P. Abernethy and Bernard Mayo of the History Department, in consultation with the Librarian, the Director, and the writer, have been most helpful in discussing matters of policy and determining the more important purchases. Valuable assistance in preparing the present report with the list of accessions and index was given by Miss Savage, Mrs. Patricia Holbert Menk who wrote most of the descriptions of collections, and Messrs. Harris H. Williams and Dabney Wellford. The sage counsel and friendly encouragement of Librarian Harry Clemons are especially cherished by all of us. Lester J.

      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES Each entry describes the papers of a single acquisition, all the manuscripts in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. The word "records" is added in the case of the papers of an organization, and "collection" for groups of manuscripts assembled by a collector from various sources. Birth and death dates of persons are given in parentheses following the name. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725 (1900)1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791 (1840-1860) 1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. The first ten issues of the Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . are referred to, after the first citation as Archivist Report. In 1941 the series was renamed, for various reasons, the Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library. In addition to the usual abbreviations, "MS" for manuscript, "ALS" for autograph letter signed, etc., the abbreviation "incl." has been used for "including." Titles of persons have been omitted except when the first name is unknown. The numbers given at the end of each entry are accession numbers, included for their convenience as a finding aid in the Library. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>
