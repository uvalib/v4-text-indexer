      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 9. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 10. For admission to the College, the Department of Law, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis, and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of units for entrance to the three departments mentioned above, see, for the College, page 8; for the Department of Law, page 10; for the Department of Engineering, page 12. CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are given below in tabulated form. Subject Topics Units English A Grammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B Composition and Rhetoric 1 English C Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 English D Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 Mathematics A1 Algebra to Quadratic Equations 1 Mathematics A2 Quadratics, Progressions, and the Binomial Formula Â½ or 1 Mathematics B Plane Geometry 1 Mathematics C Solid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D Plain Trigonometry Â½ History A Greek and Roman History 1 History B Medieval and Modern European History 1 History C English History 1 History D American History and Civil Government 1 Latin A Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Latin B Caesar's Gallic War, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Latin C Cicero's Orations (6); Grammar; Composition 1 Latin D Virgil's Ãneid, I-VI; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Greek B Xenophon's Anabasis, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek C Homer's Iliad, I-III; Grammar; Composition 1 German A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Science A Physical Geography 1 Science B Inorganic Chemistry 1 Science C Experimental Physics 1 Science D Botany Â½ Science E ZoÃ¶logy Â½ Science F Agriculture (special schools) 2 Drawing Mechanical and Projection Drawing 1 Shop-work Wood-work, Forging, and Machine-work 1 ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this State. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge (see page 13). All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1918 9-11 A.M. 11 A.M.-1 P.M. 3-5 P.M.

C and D Sat. 8 Latin A Latin C Latin D Sat. 14 Latin B German C English D For Admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination, fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 6, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Science in Education, two units in each of two modern languages (French, German, Spanish); if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, or Bachelor of Science in Medicine, two units in French and two units in German. Advanced standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1 or A2, Greek A3, English Literature A1 or A2, Mathematics A1 or A2. Such a candidate will be admitted to the corresponding B course, and upon his successful completion of the same will be entitled to count toward a baccalaureate degree the credit value of both the A and the B courses in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. Candidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professors in charge of the courses accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades, which should in no case fall below the standard of seventy-five ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. per cent. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the college, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer School or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university. A candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 6. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. A candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided he is more than twenty years old on the day of registration and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. For Admission to the Department of Graduate Studies the candidate must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. In order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for their successful prosecution. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiencies. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Law.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of eighteen years before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fifteen units, of which three must be in English and one in History. Notice is given that an additional requirement of one year of work in a standard college will become effective with the beginning of the session of 1919-20. An applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. Every applicant for admission as a special student shall make written application to the Dean of the University, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. For good cause shown, the requirement as to the time of filing such application may be waived. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. No credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to furnish evidence of the completion of a four-year course at a recognized public or private high-school, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such high-school course, and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion at an approved institution of collegiate rank of two years of work aggregating thirty session-hours. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. This college course must include a ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. year's work, as described below, in each of the following subjects: (a) Chemistry, (b) Physics, (c) Biology, (d) English, (e) French or German (unless this requirement is absolved by examination, as described below). (a) Chemistry.âFour session-hours in general inorganic chemistry, of which two must consist of laboratory work. (b) Physics.âFour session-hours, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by courses in advanced algebra, solid geometry and trigonometry. (c) Biology.âFour session-hours, of which two must consist of laboratory work. This requirement may be satisfied by a four-session-hour course in either general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by two courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany respectively. (d) English.âThe usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, in English composition and literature. (e) French or German.âA reading knowledge of one of these languages. This requirement may be absolved by demonstration on examination, written or oral, of the ability to read medical French or German. When the requirement is absolved by college work, the student must complete the three-session-hour course following the college course for beginners in the language. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine. In planning the two-year college work, students are advised to take English, mathematics, biology, and a modern language during the first year, and to take physics and chemistry during the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics, and it is desirable to avoid the lapse of a year between the general chemistry of the college and the organic and physiological chemistry of the first year of the medical curriculum. Students who have completed general chemistry and who have one more year of college work for entrance to the medical school, are advised to take some courses in chemistry (e. g., analytical, physical, or organic chemistry) during their last year in college. The number of students in the first-year class is limited to thirty-six. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. Those intending to enter the Department of Medicine are advised to ascertain at once by correspondence with the Dean of the Department of Medicine whether their high-school and college courses entitle them to admission to the first-year class. For this purpose there may be obtained from the Dean a blank form on which the necessary information may be entered in full. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9:00 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 12, 1918). Any applicant whose record, certified by the proper official of the college last attended, has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the first-year class, may at any time before the registration period have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee of the first year. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or other providential cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. For Admission to the Department of Engineering the candidate must offer fifteen units, which must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, C, D, and one unit of History. The remaining seven units are elective. High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives Physical Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work (valued at one unit each). Other electives which may be offered are History of English and American Literature (1 unit), History (4 units), Latin (4 units), Greek (3 units), German (4 units), French (4 units), Spanish (4 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves at Peabody Hall at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate who satisfies the requirements for admission set forth on pages 5-12 will be directed to the dean of the department which he proposes to enter, or, in the case of first-year students in the College, to one of several professors designated for this purpose by the Dean. After conference with the above the candidate will receive a card containing a list of the courses which he wishes to take. This card must be presented to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to take the course in question, sign the card, and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the course. The card must then be presented to the Bursar, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid. On payment of these fees the registration of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will be admitted to registration REGULATIONS. only provided he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of three dollars. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last weekday before the twenty-fifth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pages 18-19. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Commons, see page 18. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. A course in Physical Training is offered with credit value toward academic degrees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. EXPENSES. The University fee, tuition and laboratory fees, the contingent deposit, rent of rooms in the university buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit, but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for that term. Under no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the university is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees pro rata. A student's necessary expenses are as follows: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except Virginians in the College, the Department of Graduate Studies, and the Department of Engineering; II. Department Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Board and Lodging, the cost of which varies according to the degree of economy the student is inclined to practice. I. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. Under the first head are included (a) the university fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in the Academic Departments, $20 for Virginians in the Department of Engineering), and (b) the contingent deposit, $10; as well as (c) certain special fees which may or may not be incurred, namely: 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars; 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars; 3. The reÃ«xamination fee of five dollars. (a) The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Physical Training Staff; and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 13). It also covers all regular examination and dilpoma fees. (b) The contingent deposit is intended to cover any damage to university property for which the student is responsible, and any fines incurred by violating the rules of the Library. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of two dollars for the support of the chapel services and general religious work of the University, EXPENSES. unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this amount. It will be observed that this sum (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have subscribed to the chapel fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is entirely optional. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the faculty that the students thus unite with them in maintaining the religious work of the University. (c) 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars is required of any candidate admitted to a special entrance examination. 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars is required of any student who fails to register promptly at the beginning of the session or after the Christmas recess. 3. The reÃ«xamination fee of five dollars is required of any student admitted to reÃ«xamination in the college. II. DEPARTMENT FEES. Under this head are comprised the charges for instruction, which include the tuition fee and laboratory fees. As these differ in different departments, they are set forth below in tabular form, and for the sake of convenience the university charges above specified are grouped with them. Students from Virginia.âIn accordance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University remits to Virginia students in the Academic Departments the tuition fee (except in Analytical Chemistry) and all but $10 of the university fee; and to Virginia students in the Department of Engineering the tuition fee in those courses (except Analytical Chemistry), which are also offered in the College, and one-half the university fee. In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. At the beginning of the third term any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, Biblical History and Literature, Public Speaking, History, Economics, Political Science, Education, Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Geology, Biology, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy. Special courses CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministerial Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education at the University.

Courses in Analytical Chemistry: The courses in Analytical Chemistry, being professional courses, are not provided for by the regular department fees in the Academic Departments, nor are they included among the courses in which free tuition is given to Virginias and other privileged students. The fees for each course in Analytical Chemistry are: Tuition $40 Laboratory 10 Apparatus (contingent) 10 (for two courses, $15) $60 Students from other states than Virginia taking one or both courses in Analytical Chemistry in connection with other courses in the College or the Department of Graduate Studies pay a total tuition fee of $100. D. Department of Law: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Deposit 10 $150 Students taking an irregular course pay for tuition according to the relation which the amount of work taken bears to the regular course. For such course the tuition fee may be estimated approximately in dollars as three-tenths of the total number of lecture periods. E. Department of Medicine: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Deposit 10 $150 Students taking courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry are required to deposit, in addition to the charges above stated, $10 as a contingent laboratory fee.

Department of Engineering: Students from Virginia Students from Other States University Fee $20 $ 40 Tuition and Laboratory Fee 65 (Average) 105 (Average) Contingent Deposit 10 10 $95 $155 The tuition fee for each collegiate course is $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 for each course in Physics and $15 for each course in Chemistry. For courses in Analytical Chemistry, see above. Virginians are relieved of tuition in collegiate courses. The fee for each technical lecture course is $30; for each practice course in Drawing, $15; for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-work, or Field-work, $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials, but the student is held further responsible for breakage. III. BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Commons or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Registrar. The University Commons. This building, conveniently situated near the center of the University, provides an attractive dining hall, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Table board is now furnished at $18 per single calendar month, or, if taken for the entire session, at $17 per month. It is hoped that it will be possible to continue these rates. University Dormitories. Rules.âThe rules governing the rental and occupancy of rooms in the university dormitories are as follows: Students desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May 1. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Two students may occupy a room together, each paying half the rent. Rates.âAll rooms are rented unfurnished, but the University has arranged with a local dealer to place in each room the necessary articles, consisting of one three-piece enameled bed with comfortable springs, one thoroughly sanitary all-cotton EXPENSES. mattress, one good feather pillow, one solid oak six-drawer chiffonier with mirror, one student rocker with cane seat and back, one student straight chair and one student table with 24 Ã 36-inch top. This furniture will be placed in the room before the opening of the session, thereby having the room ready for occupancy immediately upon arrival. The student will pay the local dealer $15 per session as rent for the furniture. The rental for the necessary furniture for a room occupied by two students will be $20. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, etc., or be prepared to purchase them here. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat and electric light, except where otherwise specified. Janitor service is included in the rate given, except in the case of the Randall Building. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelors' Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. Randall Building. Single rooms, 10 Ã 14, 10 Ã 15, 10 Ã 16 (32) $35 Double rooms, 14 Ã 15, 15 Ã 15, 15 Ã 17 (9) 40 Double room with study, 9â² 6â³ Ã 11â² 6â³ (1) 50 East Range. Rooms in old gymnasium building (8) $60 Other rooms (26) 72 West Range. Rooms, no heat, but provided with grate (4) $60 Other rooms (20) 72 East and West Lawns. Rooms in Bachelors' Row (9) $70 Other rooms (27) 75 Dawson's Row. Rooms (56) $75 APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF ALL EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. By sharing a room with another student, and by practicing the strictest economy, a student's expenses may possibly be reduced below the low estimate. CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. A.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 30.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CIRCULAR OF INFORMATION. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. All inquiries concerning and all applications for scholarships and fellowships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. Applicants for scholarships and fellowships, if not already registered as students of the University, must comply with all the entrance requirements. The President may, after due warning to the holder, declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time, if in the judgment of the President and Faculty the holder fails to give satisfactory evidence of diligence in the performance of his duties. Unless otherwise stated, the tenure of each scholarship or fellowship is one year, and the holder may be a student in any department of the University. SCHOLARSHIPS.
