      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION Komachi at Sekidera belongs to the third category. It was probably written by Zeami, though some authorities hesitate to make the attribution. The play is considered to be the loftiest and most difficult of the entire N? repertory. In the past century only a few great actors at the close of their careers have ventured to perform it. It enjoys its high reputation because it celebrates, with the most exquisite simplicity, the bittersweet delight of being alive. Childhood, maturity, extreme old age, the pleasure and pain of life, are immediately communicated. The play conveys a timeless moment in the brief interval between birth and death. Its subject is poetry. Much of the great poetry in N? lies somewhat outside the main Japanese poetic traditions, but Komachi at Sekidera is at once a superb N? play and a splendid expression of the sources of Japanese poetry. The shite role is considered so difficult because there is little an actor can add to the text unless he is supremely gifted. During the first hour of the performance Komachi hardly stirs. The setting is wonderfully appropriate. The time is the festival of Tanabata, the seventh night of the seventh month: the one night of the year when the Cowherd star can cross the River of Heaven to join the Weaver-girl star. On earth all are celebrating the lovers' brief reunion. Even at Sekidera, a place of quiet renunciation, the priests and child acolytes are about to observe the festival. But while talking about poetry with the aged woman who lives in a hut nearby, the abbot of the temple discovers she is none other than Ono no Komachi. Komachi, a woman of great beauty and literary gifts, lived at the Heian court during the ninth century. She became a legend in later times, with many apocryphal stories surrounding the few known biographical facts. Five N? plays about Komachi are in the present repertory; Komachi and the Hundred Nights presents another aspect of the Komachi legend, and Sotoba Komachi (translated in Keene, Anthology of Japanese Literature) ranks nearly on a level with Komachi at Sekidera. The structure of the play is classic, and remarkable for its economy and simplicity. Nothing jars, nothing is wasted. The moment when Komachi admits her identity to the Abbot is particularly touching because so unaffected. Sekidera ("The Barrier Temple") still exists at ?tsu, a city east of Kyoto; its modern name is Ch?anji. Komachi at Sekidera is in the repertory of all schools of N?.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">KOMACHI AT SEKIDERA (SEKIDERA KOMACHI) The stage assistants bring forward a simple construction representing a hut with a thatched roof. It is covered with a cloth. The Old Woman is inside. As the music begins the Child, the Abbot, and two Priests enter and face each other onstage. The Abbot and the Priests carry rosaries. Three Priests So long awaited, autumn has come at last, So long awaited, the lovers' autumn meeting! Now let us begin the Festival of Stars. [1] The Abbot faces front. Abbot I am the chief priest of Sekidera in ?mi. Today, the seventh day of the Seventh month, we come to celebrate the Festival of Stars here in the temple garden. People say that the old woman who has built her hut at the foot of the mountain knows all the secrets of the art of poetry. So, on this festive day dedicated to poetry, I am going to take the young people to hear her stories. He turns to the Child. Three Priests Early autumn comes and brings a touch of chill. We feel it in the wind and in our thinning locks. [2] Soon, soon the Seventh Night will be on us. The Abbot faces front. Abbot We bring offerings for the festival today, The music of flutes and strings, Two Priests And many poems Abbot Composed in our native tongue. [3] He turns to the Child. Three Priests Our prayers for skill at poetry are decked With brightly colored streamers: Fluttering ribbons, each a token of prayer, Like silk threads woven into rich brocades On looms of autumn flowers And pampas grass pearly with dew. The winds in the pines The Abbot faces front, takes a few steps, then returns to his former position, indicating he has made a journey. Blend with the strings of the koto To make music for the offerings tonight, [4] Our offerings for this festive night. The Abbot and his companions are now at their destination. Abbot Here is the hut now. Let us call on the old woman. To the Child. But first, please sit down. All kneel. A stage assistant removes the cloth around the hut, revealing the Old Woman seated inside. Paper strips inscribed with poems hang from the crossbars of the hut frame. The Old Woman wears the uba mask. Old Woman Days go by without a single bowl of food; Whom can I ask for one? At night my tattered rags fail to cover me, But there is no way to patch the rents. Each passing rain Ages the crimson of the flowers; The willows are tricked by the wind, And their green gradually droops. [5] Man has no second chance at youth; He grows old. The aged song thrush Warbles again when spring has come, But time does not revert to the past. Oh, how I yearn for the days that are gone! What would I do to recapture the past! She weeps. The Abbot and the Child rise, and go to kneel before her. Abbot Old woman, we have come to speak with you. Old Woman Who are you? Abbot I am a priest from Sekidera. These young people are students of poetry. They have heard of your talent, and I have brought them here to question you about poetry and to learn something of your life. Old Woman This is an unexpected visit! The log buried in the earth has been so long forgotten you must not expect it will put forth new sprouts. [6] Just remember this: If you will make your heart the seed and your words the blossoms, [7] if you will steep yourself in the fragrance of the art, you will not fail to accomplish true poetry. But how praiseworthy that mere boys should cherish a love of poetry! Abbot May I ask you about a poem everyone knows, "The Harbor of Naniwa?" [8] Do you agree that it should be used as a first guide? Old Woman Indeed I do. Poetry goes back to the Age of the Gods, but the meters were then irregular and the meanings difficult to understand. "The Harbor of Naniwa," however, belongs to the Age of Man. It was composed for the joyous occasion of an emperor's enthronement, and has long been beloved for that reason. [9] Abbot The poem about Mount Asaka, which once soothed the heart of a prince, is also beautifully written. [10] Old Woman Truly, you understand the art, For those two poems are the parents of all poetry. Abbot They serve as models for beginners. Old Woman Noblemen and peasantry alike, Abbot City dwellers and country folk, Old Woman Even commoners like ourselves Abbot Take pleasure in composing poetry Old Woman Following the promptings of our hearts. Chorus Though the sands lapped by the waves Of the lake in Omi should run out, Though the sands of the shore should melt away, The Abbot and the Child return to kneel with the Priests. The words of poetry will never fail. [11] They are enduring as evergreen boughs of pine, Continuous as trailing branches of willow; For poetry, whose source and seed is found In the human heart, is everlasting. Though ages pass and all things vanish, As long as words of poetry remain, Poems will leave their marks behind, And the traces of poetry will never disappear. Abbot Thank you for your words of explanation. It is true that countless poems survive from the past, but they are rarely by women. Few women know as much as you about poetry. Tell meâthe poem "I know my lover Is coming tonightâ See how the spider Spins her web: That is a sure sign!" [12] Was that not by a woman? Old Woman Yes, that poem was written long ago by Princess Sotori, the consort of Emperor Ingyo. I tried, if only in form. to master her style. Abbot Ah! You have studied the style of Princess Sotori? I have heard that Ono no Komachi, who's so much talked of these days, wrote in that style. [13] "Wretched that I amâ A floating water weed, Broken from its rootsâ If a stream should beckon, I would follow it, I think." That poem is by Komachi. Old Woman Yes, once my husband, Oe no Koreaki, took up with another woman, and I grieved at the fickleness of the world. Then, Funya no Yasuhide [14] invited me to accompany him to Mikawa, where he was to be the governor. I wrote that poem in response to his urging and to his promises that life in the country would bring solace. Alas, memories of the past! So long forgotten, they rise up again Before me as I talk to you. Tears well up from my suffering heart. She weeps. Abbot Strange! This old woman says she wrote the poem "Wretched that I am." And she says she wrote in the Sotori style, just as Komachi did. She must be nearly a hundred years old, and if Komachi were still alive today. . . . And is there any reason why she couldn't be? It must be so! to the Old Woman. You are what is left of Ono no Komachi. Do not deny it. Old Woman Ah, I burn with shame to be called Komachi, I who wrote "With no outward sign Chorus It withersâ The flower in the human heart." [15] How ashamed I am to be seen! "Wretched that I amâ A floating water weed, Broken from its rootsâ If a stream should beckon, I would follow it, I think." How ashamed I am! She weeps. "Hide them though I may, The tears keep flowing, Too many for my sleeves to holdâ A rain of tears dissolving Everything except the past." [16] Now that my life has reached its end, Like a withered flower, Why should there still be tears? Old Woman "Longing for him, I fell asleep, Then he appeared before me . . ." [17] Chorus The joy I felt when I composed those lines Is gone forever, but still my life goes on, Attending the months and years as they come and go. The dews of spring depart, and autumn frosts appear, The leaves and grasses turn, and insect voices fade. Old Woman My life is over, and now I see Chorus It was like a rose of Sharon that knows Only a single day of glory. [18] "The living go on dying, The dead increase in number; Left in this world, ahâ How long must I go on Lamenting for the dead?" [19] And how long must I, who wrote that poem, Live on, like flowers fallen, like leaves scattered, With nothing left but lifeâdewlike, they always said. Oh, how I long for the past! My middle years were spent in yearning For the distant glory of my youth. Now even those days of wistful recollection Have become such ancient history I find myself wishing, if not for youth, At least for middle age. Long ago, wherever I spent a single night My room would be bright with tortoise shell, Golden flowers hung from the walls, And in the door were strings of crystal beads. [20] Brilliant as the Emperor's chair in grand procession The jewellike gowns I wore, a hundred colors. I lay on bright brocaded quilts Within a pillowed bridal chamber. Look at it now, my mud-daubed hut! Can this be my resplendent room? Old Woman The temple bell of Sekidera Chorus Tolls the vanity of all creationâ To ancient ears a needless lesson. A mountain wind blows down Osaka's slope To moan the certainty of death; Its message still eludes me. Yet, when blossoms scatter and leaves fall, Still in this hut I find my pleasure: Grinding ink, I dip my brush and write. My words are all dry, like seaweed on the shore. Touching, they once said, but lacking strength [21]â My poems lacked strength because they were a woman's. Now when I have grown decrepit My poems are weaker still. Their life is spent. How wretched it is to be old! She weeps. The Child turns to the Abbot. Child I'm afraid we'll be late for the Festival of Stars. Let's ask the old lady to come with us. The Abbot kneels before the Old Woman. Abbot Please join us on this Seventh Night, the Festival of Stars. Old Woman Alas! An old woman should not intrude on such an occasion. I cannot go. She takes down the paper poem cards. Abbot What harm could come of it? Please come with us. He goes to the hut and helps the Old Woman to stand. Chorus The Seventh Nightâ How many years since first I offered the gods Bamboo tied with colored streamers? How long has shriveled old Komachi lived? Assisted by the Abbot and leaning on a staff, the Old Woman leaves the hut. Has Ono no Komachi reached a hundred years? Or even more? I who used to watch the Festival of Stars, Familiar of the noblest lords and ladies, She kneels beside the shite-pillar. The Abbot goes back beside the others. Now stand in shameful hempen rags! A sight too painful for eyes to bear! The Abbot weeps. Still, tonight we hold the Festival of Stars, The Child stands and mimes serving wine to the Old Woman. Tonight we celebrate the Seventh Night With multitudes of offerings for the stars. Prayer streamers hang from bamboo, While the following lines are being sung the Child goes to the gazing-pillar, moves clockwise around the stage, then stands at the center preparatory to beginning his dance. Music plays and cups of wine go round. The young dancer-look how gracefully He twirls his sleeves, like snow Swirling in the moonlight. The Old Woman, still seated, watches the Child dance. We celebrate the Festival of Stars, Streamers flutter from the bamboos . . . Old Woman May it be celebrated through ages as many As the joints of the bamboo! The Old Woman, hardly aware of what she does, taps the rhythm with her fan. Chorus We pray for eternal prosperity; We dance the "Ten Thousand Years." [22] The Child completes his dance, then sits as before. Old Woman How gracefully that boy has danced! I remember how, long ago in the Palace, the Gosechi dancing girls swirled their sleeves five times at the Harvest Festival. They say that if a madman runs, even the sane will run after him. But tonight the proverb is reversed! Enticed by the boy's floating sleeves, see how a madwoman prances! She stands with the aid of her staff and begins her dance. One hundred yearsâ The dance of the butterfly Who dreamt he had spent A hundred years enfolded Within a flower petal. [23] Chorus How sad it isl It breaks my heart A flowering branch on a withered tree! Old Woman I have forgotten how to move my hands. Chorus Unsteady feet, uncertain wave of sleeves, Old Woman Billow after billow, floating wave on wave. Chorus My dancing sleeves rise up, But sleeves cannot wave back the past. She goes before the hut. Old Woman I miss those vanished days! She kneels and weeps. Chorus But as I dance the early autumn night, The short night, gives way to dawn. The temple bell of Sekidera tolls. Old Woman A chorus of morning birdsong heralds Chorus The coming dawn, the day's approaching light, The dawn's fresh light that reveals my shame! Where is the forest of Hazukashi? [24] She stands, propping herself on her staff. Chorus Where is the forest of Hazukashi? There is no forest here to hide my shame. Farewell, I take my leave. Now, leaning heavily on her stick, She slowly returns to her straw hut. She enters the hut, sits and weeps. The hundred-year-old woman you have spoken to Is all that remains of famed Komachi, Is all that is left of Ono no Komachi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1. The Tanabata Festival, of Chinese origin, is still celebrated in Japan on the seventh day of the seventh month. Bamboo branches are decorated with five-colored streamers and with slips on which poems have been written commemorating the lovers' meeting of the two stars. 2. From some lines by PoChu-i included in the Wakan Roei Sh?, no. 204: "Who could have arranged things so well? The sighing cool wind and my thinning locks at once announce autumn is here." A parallel is drawn between the coming of autumn in the world and the coming of autumn to the person, evidenced by the thinning locks. 3. Many poets wrote in Chinese, especially on formal occasions, but the Japanese preferred their own language for their intimate feelings. 4. The above three lines are based on a poem by the Consort Itsukinomiya in the Shuish?, no. 451. 5. Derived from an anonymous poem in Chinese found in a commentary to the historical work Hyakurensho. 6. Quoted, with slight modifications, from the preface to the Kokinsh?. 7. Also from the preface to the Kokinsh?. 8. This is the "Naniwazu" poem: "In Naniwa Harbor/ The flowers have come to the trees;/ They slept through the winter,/ But now it is the springâ/ See how the blossoms have opened!" The preface to the Kokinsh? characterizes this poem and the one on Asakayama, Mount Asaka, as the "father and mother of poetry." Both poems are given considerable attention in The Reed Cutter. 9.
