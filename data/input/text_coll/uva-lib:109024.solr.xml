ANNOUNCEMENTS. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional or life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. In addition to courses for high school teachers, the demand for courses for primary and grammar grade teachers is fully met. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 A. M. to 1:30 P. M., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 P. M. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopÃ¦dias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, and a brief prayer and song service. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used when held in the chapel is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. When the weather permits the service is held out of doors on the north steps of the Rotunda. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director. No fee will be charged for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On all clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. Plans are already decided upon and preparation begun for the most extensive celebration this year which has ever been held. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 14th and July 19th will be devoted to the study of problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication; improved methods of cooperation; the improvement of sanitary conditions; good roads; etc. Especial emphasis is to be placed on woman's work in the country, and the country preacher. Distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in these conferences. There has been no more helpful, interesting, and vital enterprise connected with the Summer School than this conference. It is of interest not only to the students attending the Summer School, but to county superintendents, progressive farmers, and citizens' improvement leagues. The proceedings of the Conference for last year were published and distributed and there was a wide-spread demand for copies. Many similar conferences have been organized as the result of this one. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates. At a meeting of the Conference Committee of the Southeastern Passenger Association, the individual lines announced that they would authorize fares for the University Summer School on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 for the round trip. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the applicant should write promptly to the Director of the Summer School. Reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following dates: June 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th. The Southern Railway Company, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, the Norfolk and Western Railway Company, and all railways within this territory will co-operate in the sale of these reduced rate tickets. Application has also been made to the Trans-Continental Passenger Association for similar rates, from the territory west of the Mississippi, and teachers coming from the western states should write to the Director of the Summer School for instructions. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. Announcement of dates will be made later by the Department of Public Instruction. Application has been made to have them correspond with the above. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 23rd to July 1st, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.00 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred and seventy-five single rooms and fifty double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 23rd. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Double rooms will be furnished with two single beds complete, unless a double bed is especially desired; two chiffoniers, one rocking chair, one morris chair and one single chair. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.75 a week. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee, to Mr. N. T. McManaway, University, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, see page 21. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Wednesday, June 25th, at 8:30 A. M. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday unless arranged for by individual instructors, except possibly on Saturday, July 5th, when classes will meet at the usual hours. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Tuesday, August 5th, Wednesday and Thursday, August 6th and 7th, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to five buildingsâCabell Hall, Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory, Rotunda and the Law Building. REGISTRATION.âTuesday, June 24th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 25th will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in the southeast rooms of the Rotunda, will be open continuously June 24th, 25th, and 26th from 8:30 a. m. until 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, July 2nd, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 30th and 31st and Aug. 1st should enter twenty days prior to July 30th. Promptly at 9:30 Tuesday morning, June 24th, all applicants for registration will assemble in Cabell Hall for instructions in regard to filling out their cards, the location of lecture rooms, and for consultation with members of the faculty in regard to the courses of study they desire to pursue, or any other matters upon which information is desired. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive a card with space for name and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be presented to the Registrar, after it has been filled out, for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive two cards filled out and signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, together with the fee for each course. The Bursar will sign and return one card to the student, who should present it to the instructors in charge of the courses prescribed on the card. The student, after presenting the card to the various instructors for enrollment in the classes, will retain the same as a receipt from the Bursar, and for future use. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit students to any course not mentioned on their registration cards, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, students should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of their boarding place or the number and location of their room in the University. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. A tuition fee of five dollars will be charged for admission to each course in the groups denominated on pages 19 and 20 as receiving University credit or credit on the Summer School Professional Certificate or credit on the Special High School Certificate. A single fee of ten dollars will be charged for the courses (not more than five) taken in one summer from the group counting towards the Professional Elementary CertificateâGrammar Gradesâ or the Professional Elementary Certificate Primary Gradesârespectively, to all students from other states than Virginia. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by special appropriation that Virginia teachers shall pay only six dollars for the courses (not more than five) from these groups. A single fee of six dollars will be charged for the courses (not more than six) taken from the group of elementary courses which prepare for the First Grade Certificate examination, to all students from other States than Virginia. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by special appropriation that Virginia teachers shall pay only three dollars for the courses (not more than six) selected from this group. Students not desiring credit will be charged at the same rate. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student When all of the certificates issued by the Director, which are required for any State certificate applied for, have been received, the Department of Public Instruction should be notified, and the appropriate state certificate will be issued. Notice of the completion of courses counted towards University credit should be made to the Registrar of the University of Virginia. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. (f) Courses which satisfy the conditions above stated will be credited toward the B. A. and B. S. degrees offered in the College of the University of Virginia as follows: 1. Courses in which not less than thirty (30) hours of lecture instruction are given will be credited as one session hour. 2. Courses in which not less than thirty hours of lecture instruction and not less than sixty (60) hours of laboratory instruction is given will be credited as two sessional hours. (g) No student wishing University credit will be permitted to take more than three courses in one session except by special permission of the Director upon the recommendation of the professors offering the courses he desires to take. The Summer School Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to the Summer School Professional Certificate have been passed by the State Board of Education: "The holder of a first grade certificate issued in accordance with the provisions of section 31 of the circular, of the Department of Public Instruction on certification of teachers, or the holder of a High School certificate who has had at least six months of actual teaching experience before entering upon the work prescribed for a Summer School Professional Certificate, shall be granted a Summer School Professional Certificate under the terms and conditions hereinafter stated. This certificate shall continue in force for seven years and may be renewed for a similar period from time to time as provided in section 35 of the circular, of the Department of Public Instruction Form Eâ No. 19. If necessary, the certificate which entitles a teacher to enter upon the course of study provided for a Summer School Professional Certificate may be revived or extended for one year from time to time, provided the holder completes successfully that portion of the professional work prescribed for the year during which the extension is applied for, provided that no certificate which has expired shall be continued for more than one year upon the basis of completing any one year of professional work. Courses leading to the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be offered only in a school conducted at a registered college or normal school, and an applicant for the same must make at least 75 per cent. on class standing and examination on the subjects required for the certificate. The work must be completed within a period of five years from the date of beginning if taken in summer terms of four weeks each or in four years if taken in summer terms of six weeks each, and shall cover at least three terms of four weeks each, or two terms of six weeks each, occupying a minimum of 300 recitation periods of at least forty minutes each, provided that courses of college grade shall occupy a minimum of 180 recitation periods of at least 60 minutes each. The Summer School Professional CertificateâPrimary Grade, must embrace the following: Principles of teaching, with special emphasis on how to study, hygiene, drawing, primary industrial work, music and games; primary methods in reading, language, arithmetic, nature study and geography; observation work and practice teaching. The Summer School Professional CertificateâGrammar Grade, must embrace the following: Principles of teaching, including how to study, hygiene, drawing, manual training or domestic economy or elementary agriculture and school gardening; methods of teaching language, reading, literature, arithmetic, civics, history, and geography; advanced observation work and practice teaching. The Summer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade, must embrace the following courses of college grade: Two required coursesâEnglish and education; four elective coursesâto be chosen from any of the following groups: agriculture, biology, field botany, chemistry, domestic economy, drawing, French, geography, German, history, hygiene and sanitation, Latin, library methods, manual training, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, and psychology." The University of Virginia Summer School is the only one in the state offering courses leading to the Summer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade. Full courses are also offered here for the Summer School Professional CertificatesâPrimary Grades and Grammar Grades. Special attention is called to the outlines found elsewhere in the catalogue for the work leading to the primary certificates, and to the carefully selected corps of instructors offering them. The management has endeavored to make the work leading to these certificates an especially strong feature of the Summer School in the belief that it will appeal to the very large number of primary and grammar grade teachers of the South who desire additional professional training for their work. "Requirements for Teachers of Higher Branches.âA person desiring to teach in a public high school shall hold a certificate showing that he has passed a successful examination on such subjects as he may be required to teach unless he is the holder of one of the certificates mentioned in sections 13-21 inclusive of the circular; Form E âNo. 19 of the Department of Public Instruction, provided, however, that a student of any university or college of approved standing may be issued the special certificate required under this section without further examination in any branch in which he holds a diploma or certificate from such university or college granted for the completion of at least two years of work of a college grade. The holder of a high school certificate, or a certificate based upon an equivalent amount of work, may be issued the special certificate required under this section upon the completion of work of college grade in summer schools mentioned in section 26 of the abovementioned circular and under the general regulations mentioned therein, provided the work shall occupy the minimum hours or recitation periods of 60 minutes each, as given in the following table, and the work shall cover three terms of four weeks each, or two terms of six weeks each, and shall be supplemented by parallel work during the months intervening between the summer sessions; the entire amount of work done shall occupy a minimum of 180 recitation periods of at least 60 minutes each: Agriculture, 90 hours. Botany, 60 hours. Chemistry, 150 hours, of which 60 hours must be laboratory work. Drawing, 90 hours. English, 120 hours, including 30 hours in English Grammar, 30 hours in Rhetoric and Composition, and 60 hours in English and American Literature. Domestic Science, 90 hours. French, 90 hours.

Music, 90 hours. Physics, 150 hours, of which 60 shall be laboratory work. Physical Geography, 60 hours. Zoology, 60 hours. Summer School Professional CertificateâHigh School Grade.â To secure a certificate to teach one or more of the above subjects an applicant must have had in the same school a course of 30 hours in educational psychology and the principles of teaching. A certificate based upon the work outlined above shall be called a Summer School Professional CertificateâHigh School Grade, and shall continue in force for seven years and may be renewed for a similar period as provided in section 35 of Form EâNo. 19." The University of Virginia Summer School is the only one offering the courses leading to the Summer School Professional CertificateâHigh School Grade as described above. It is important that those persons who desire to teach in high schools and who have not met the requirements of this regulation should begin at once the work leading to this certificate. Industrial First Grade Certificate.âThe holder of a first grade certificate, or the holder of a high school certificate who has had at least six months of actual teaching experience before entering upon the work prescribed for an Industrial First Grade Certificate, shall be granted an Industrial First Grade Certificate under the terms and conditions set forth above for the Summer School Professional Certificate. This certificate shall continue in force for seven years and may be renewed for a similar period from time to time as provided in section 35 of the circular of Department of Public Interest. The course must embrace the following: Arithmetic (primary and grammar grades), American history, civics (with special reference to community life), English composition (including spelling, penmanship, punctuation and grammar), geography (primary and grammar grades), hygiene, principles of teaching (with special emphasis on how to study), methods in teaching arithmetic, reading and language, agriculture and any three of the following: bench work, cobbling, cooking, poultry raising, sewing and household handicrafts, including glazing, mending tinware, whitewashing and chair mending. SUMMARY OF COURSES AND CREDITS FOR EACH.âThe term course used in this announcement refers to those courses outlined separately and preceded by arabic numerals under the various subjects.

The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated should be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily exercises will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth.

The following topics will be discussed: the particular branches of the subject which should be taught high school students; the apparatus and chemicals necessary and their cost; how to equip a laboratory and how to make the best use of facilities likely to be found in a high school. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that the pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changes, especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, 2 hours before 2 P. M. Professor Edgar. West Range Laboratory. 3.

It will be the aim of the courses in Latin and Greek to open to all teachers and students the advantages of University instruction in those subjects. Courses 1-4 are especially intended to illustrate the teaching of Latin in the secondary schools. Courses 5-7 are intended to open to teachers and summer students the more important fields of college Latin. The desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is specially commended to all who wish to reap the full cultural and scientific benefit of the college courses in Latin. Greece is the fountain head of European culture, and Rome its universalizer and transmitter to the modern world. The instruction will aim to exhibit these relations and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. Course 1 is preparatory. Thereafter the work is organized in all courses as follows: Latin languageâsystematic study of Latin grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition; Latin literatureâsystematic study of the Latin authors, as nearly as possible in culture-historical sequence; Roman lifeâsystematic study of Roman culture-history in English, in conjunction with the reading of the authors. 1.

SCHOOL MUSIC. Courses for Supervisors of Music.âThese courses are primarily intended for the training of supervisors of music and special teachers of music in the public schools. In order to complete the work and receive a supervisor's certificate, it is required to attend three summer sessions. Detailed information in regard to home study during the academic year may be had on application to Professor Drake. Courses for Grade Teachers.âThe probability is that the near future will witness a requirement made by school boards and state boards of education, demanding that the grade teacher shall qualify in music as she must qualify in every other subject in the elementary curriculum. Such a requirement is already in force in several states. This makes a special course of music for grade teachers an actual necessity. A teacher who takes the first-year and second-year courses and completes the work satisfactorily, will have received thorough training in sight reading, in ear training and dictation, will have taken an elementary course in melody, and will have received instruction in the methods of presenting public school music. It gives the teacher as much freedom in knowledge of methods and material in music as in the subjects of geography, spelling, arithmetic, and the like. Courses for First Year Students. 1. Sight ReadingâA. This is an elementary course. The requirements for the completion of this course include the ability to read at sight simple music, such as is taught in the first four grades of the public schools, using Latin syllables. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. 2. DictationâA. (Study of tone and rhythm). This course covers the first four grades of public school music. The subject matter of music is presented first to the sense of hearing. In this course the student gains power to think tones and to sense rhythms, and at the same time acquires a practical knowledge of scale relations and the application of the Latin syllables used in sight reading. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Miss Stark. Madison Hall. 3. MaterialâA. This course is devoted to the material for the kindergarten and the first four grades in music. It also includes the presentation of material, and the methods of teaching rote songs. This course provides intimate acquaintance with the best presentation of the subject of public school music in charts and books, taking up for detailed study each fundamental principle as it occurs. Some practice in reading and interpretation is included in this course. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Miss Stark. Madison Hall. 4. MethodsâA. This course is devoted to the pedagogy of music from the kindergarten to the fourth grade, inclusive. The work of each year is taken up in detail, and all the problems which confront the grade teacher and supervisor are thoroughly discussed. Plans and methods of schoolroom work, and general supervision are carefully presented. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 5. Rudiments of MusicâA. This course provides instruction in the elements of music. The following are taken up for study: clefs, signification and origin; names of pitches as established by the G-clef and F-clef; construction of major scale (without key-signature), note-values, and rhythm (different rhythms with the same meter), normal, harmonic, and melodic minor scales (without key-signatures); key-signatures; notation of chromatic scale with each key-signature; intervals; definitions of terms most frequently used in music. Thursdays and Fridays, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. Courses for Second Year Students. 6. Sight ReadingâB. This course requires the reading at sight of music taught in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades of the public schools, using Latin syllables. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. 7. MelodyâB. This course in constructive music is valuable as a basis of form analysis. Facility in melody writing is also a distinct aid in rapid sight reading. Topics included under the course are diatonic melodies, simple intervals, the chromatic inflection, simple modulations and rhythmic development. Written work is required daily. Thursdays and Fridays, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. 8. DictationâB. This course deals with the problems of tone and rhythm included in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades of public school music. The purpose of this course in ear training and dictation is to make the student familiar with scale relations, simple chromatic inflections, and the simpler rhythms. It thus becomes of direct value, both in sight reading and in listening to music. Special lessons are provided in showing how to prepare and present dictation lessons, both oral and written, in the classroom. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Miss Stark. Madison Hall. 9. MaterialâB. This course requires the study of charts and books employed in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grammar grades. The development of the subject and the interrelation of songs and studies are emphasized. Sight reading of words and music simultaneously, supplements the singing with the syllable names. The courses in Material A and B are given by experienced supervisors. The methods employed are those used in the schoolroom. These courses, therefore, become a laboratory demonstration of the material and methods used in teaching music in the public schools from the kindergarten to the high school. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Miss Stark. Madison Hall. 10. MethodsâB. This course includes methods for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grammar grades, and is open only to students who have completed Methods A. It involves a study of the pedagogy of the subject as required by the introduction of new principles and their combination with elementary principles. Detailed outlines for lesson preparation, and presentation are required. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. Courses for Third Year Students. 11. DictationâC. (Study of tone and rhythm). This course will open with a rapid review of elementary principles. It will then proceed to develop the ability to recognize and read any melody of moderate difficulty in both the major and minor keys. Additional training, including the recognition and writing of music in parts is also required. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. 12. High and Normal School MusicâC. This is an advanced course to which only third year, and still more advanced students, are admitted. Courses in theory, in musical appreciation, and in chorus singing are outlined and presented in detail. The many difficult problems which confront the music teacher in the high school and the normal school are carefully studied: such as the arrangement and distribution of voices, programs for the high school music recitations, supplementary music, formation of school orchestras and glee clubs, the relation of high school music to the grades and its place as a credit study in the curriculum, and the means of cultivating the musical taste and ideals of the school and community. A prominent feature of the work in this class is a practical course in conducting. Each pupil will be required to prepare and conduct choral selections under the supervision of the instructor. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 13. Practice TeachingâC. Practical use of the material of all grades, and application of methods of teaching, are required. The students of this course demonstrate their understanding of the principles of school music in lessons given to a class under the supervision of the instructor. The presentation of the material, its relation to what the pupil has already acquired, the text to be studied, and the principles to be illustrated by original blackboard work, form the basis of the lesson. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Mrs. Waterman. Madison Hall. 14. HarmonyâC. This is a practical course in music writing and analysis. The analysis of melodies, on scale and chord basis, and the art of writing for four voices form the subject of daily lessons, for which considerable written work is demanded. This course takes up the analysis and construction of music to the Secondary Seventh Chords. This course is indispensable to the proper reading and interpretation of part music. Particular attention is given to the leading of voices, sequences, cadences, and the simpler modulations. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Professor Drake. Madison Hall. 15. Chorus.âAll students working for a grade teacher's certificate, or a supervisor's certificate, will be required to take this course.
