Acting Assistant Professor of Philosophy ARTHUR AUGUST PEGAU, B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Acting Assistant Professor of Geology PAUL KENNETH EDWARDS, B.A., M.B.A. Acting Assistant Professor of Commerce HISTORICAL STATEMENT. While the original organization of the Academic Schools of the University by Jefferson contemplated instruction of graduate grade in each School, the first "post-graduate department" in the modern sense was instituted in 1859-60 by Basil L. Gildersleeve, then Professor of Greek in the institution. The degree of Master of Arts continued to be conferred upon graduates in all six Schools of the University. Professor Gildersleeve conducted graduate courses in the School of Greek; shortly after the Civil War a "post-graduate department" was announced for the School of Latin. Graduate courses were offered in individual Schools, but there was no general department organization for graduate study until 1904. In that year the Department of Graduate Studies was established as a regular co-ordinate division of the University, with definitely prescribed regulations corresponding to the requirements of the Association of American Universities, in which the University of Virginia was the first Southern university to hold membership. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy had, however, been offered by the University as far back as 1880. The present requirements for graduate degrees, with minor modifications, have been in force since 1904. THE GRADUATE HOUSE. The residence of the late Professor Raleigh C. Minor on West Lawn is now used by the Department of Graduate Studies as administrative headquarters. Besides the Dean's office, this building contains one large lecture-room for graduate classes and three seminar rooms on the second floor specially equipped for small groups of students and professors engaged in advanced graduate work. Each seminar room has a small library for the use of advanced graduate students in the courses conducted in that room. The building is therefore the administrative office of the Department and the workshop of its humanistic section. At present the class-rooms are used by certain C and D classes in the Schools of English, History, Philosophy, Economics, Biblical Literature, and Political Science. The central location of this house and its proximity to the General Library make it particularly adapted to departmental use. LIBRARY FACILITIES. The General Library contains over 100,000 volumes. Departmental libraries, notably those of the Scientific Schools, the Classical, the English, and the Heck Memorial Library of the Department of Education, have more than 30,000 volumes. Graduate students may, through the office of the General Library, get certain books needed in research from the Library of Congress and the Virginia State Library. Library facilities for graduate study, both in arts and sciences, are excellent. GRADUATE CLUBS. Several general meetings of the students and officials of the Graduate Department are held during the session for professional and social purposes. Addresses are delivered by members of the Faculty or by visiting scholars, followed by informal discussion. Besides these general conferences there are regular weekly or bi-weekly meetings of graduate students and professors for discussion of topics connected with graduate study. Papers are presented on the progress of certain investigations by the writers, some of which are published as monographs, or contributed to technical journals. These clubs are stimulating centers of research activity. The scientific society of Sigma Xi is an important organization for the advancement of technical knowledge. The University Committee on Research, while not specifically an organization of the Department of Graduate Studies, is a valuable auxiliary of the Department. This committee administers an annual appropriation for promoting research in the various Departments of the University, especially in the matter of the publication of the results of original investigation, and so aids the general cause of advanced scholarship. SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. Each Scientific School occupies a separate building with an extensive laboratory and a select departmental library. Statements in regard to laboratories and general scientific equipment in the Schools of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics may be found under the announcements of those Schools. More detailed information is contained in the General Catalogue. ORGANIZATION. The immediate direction of the Department of Graduate Studies is vested in the Dean and an Administrative Committee of six professors, appointed by the President, two of whom serve only during the Summer Quarter. The Faculty of the Graduate Department consists of those professors in the Academic Schools who offer graduate courses. Courses marked C are for graduates and advanced undergraduates; those marked D are for graduates only. The prerequisites for each course are indicated, varying from six to nine session-hours of college work. The various Schools, or departments, fall into three general divisions, or groups, as follows: Group IâLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. Group IIâSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group IIIâMathematical and Natural Sciences. REGISTRATION. Every graduate student, new or old, is required to register at the office of the Dean of the Department, Graduate House, West Lawn, who will advise him in regard to a program of studies. The first three days of the session are devoted to registration. Every applicant for admission to the Graduate Department as candidate for a degree must file with the Dean an official transcript of his college record. Admission to the Department does not necessarily imply acceptance for candidacy to a degree. All applications will be passed upon by the Committee on Rules and Courses of the Department of Graduate Studies early in the first term, and each applicant will be formally notified by the Dean of the tentative approval of his candidacy. The final approval of his candidacy will depend upon his record during the first term, or quarter, of his residence. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Leave of absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the Dean, and must in every case be obtained in advance. Voluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the Dean of the Graduate Department. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see the General Catalogue. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration, in the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree.

Only those courses marked C and D may be counted toward a graduate degree. Summer Session.âThe Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three quarters, the equivalent in time of the regular session. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee concerned. At least twelve session-hours of graduate work are required for the Master's degree. A candidate for the Master's degree in the Summer Quarter must register with the Dean of the Graduate Department and submit a program of studies in accordance with the regulations prescribed for admission to candidacy for that degree in the regular session. In addition to the preparation of a thesis, a final examination, written or oral, upon the program of study and acceptable to the Professor of the candidate's major subject in the regular session of the University, will be required. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâ a low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.
