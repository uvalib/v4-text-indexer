French Professor of Romanic Languages, Sweet Briar College, Virginia CHARLOTTE D. WRAY Primary Education Instructor, Richmond City Normal School WILLIE R. YOUNG, A. B. Y. W. C. A. Field Student Secretary Y. W. C. A. ANNOUNCEMENTS. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. LOCATION Charlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July 76.8. Summer rates are given by the railroads to this point. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. THE GENERAL LIBRARY The General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. REST AND STUDY ROOMS Madison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY Daily from 11:30 to 12:30 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, or some other interesting exercise. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES Experience has shown that on Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. When the weather permits, the service is held out of doors on the North Rotunda steps. Otherwise in Cabell Hall. EXCURSIONS Under the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturday will be reserved for these excursions. On Monday and Thursday nights, if clear, parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES The pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give five plays, Mabel Garrison, a Musical Recital, and the University Dramatic Club, two plays. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50, making the cost about the same as moving pictures. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES All students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e., the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates which have been granted by the Southern Passenger Association on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 cents for the round trip. Tickets will be on sale June 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, with privilege of extension of final limit to September 30. In case the agent has received no instructions to sell reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, purchase a straight fare ticket and take the agent's receipt. The matter can be adjusted in procuring return ticket. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 17th to June 25th, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. A committee of ladies from the Y. W. C. A. will assist in welcoming teachers attending for the first time. Teachers arriving at Charlottesville from points on the C. and O. should have their baggage checked to Union Station, Charlottesville. Baggage checks should be given to the committee. If handed to others, a receipt should be taken. Teachers arriving before 6 a. m. and later than 10:30 p. m. will be met, provided they notify Mr. F. M. Alexander. YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION CLUB Open to every woman in the Summer School, this club is organized for the purpose of promoting a pleasant social atmosphere, giving an opportunity for social service and religious development, and for the study of methods in club work and church work. The activities include "stunt parties," camp breakfast, Camp Fire Girls demonstrations, weekly meetings on religious and social questions and special lectures on rural life questions. A secretary devotes her entire time to the work and has charge of the club headquarters at Madison Hall. Her office hours are from 9 to 11 a. m. and from 2 to 3 p. m. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS The News is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. Four monthly issues, beginning with February, will be printed and circulated in addition to the twelve regular numbers. The subscription price for the whole sixteen issues is the moderate sum of twenty-five cents. Subscriptions should be sent to the Business Manager, Summer School News, University, Virginia. RURAL LIFE WEEK The time between July 9 and 12 will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and to rural sociology in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of country ministers and laymen, and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT Each year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. BOARD AND ROOMS Board and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a double room. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 18th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, conducted by Mr. S. I. Carter, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $4.00 a week, $16.50 a month or $23.00 for the session of forty-six days. A lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 69, or write to Mr. F. M. Alexander. About twenty-five young ladies or men may obtain employment as waiters in the dining room and receive their board free for their services. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS Tuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.00 for a four weeks' term and $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and these fees will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS A single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia, and any other person not a Virginia teacher. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permisson in writing from the Director. MEDICAL FEE A small medical fee of 40 cents will be charged each person who registers in the Summer School, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. W. E. Bray, the Summer School Physician, and application is pending for greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Summer School Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for the maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer School Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. TEACHERS' POSITIONS The University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the committee. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES Recitations will begin in all courses Wednesday, June 20, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays except on Saturday, June 30th, and July 17th, when classes will meet at the usual hours to make up for registration day and Fourth of July. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Tuesday, July 31st, Wednesday and Thursday, August 1st and 2nd, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks or thirty recitations over and above registration and examination days. REGISTRATION Tuesday, June 19th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 20th will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall will be open continuously June 19th, 20th and 21st from 8:30 a. m. to 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 27th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 18th, 19th and 20th, must enter twenty days prior to July 18th. Registration at Midway School will be on Monday, June 18th and classes will begin Tuesday, June 19th. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. IMPORTANT NOTE Every teacher who is applying for a Virginia State Teachers' Summer School Professional Certificate of any kind should bring with her and before registering have whatever certificate she holds and which she desires to use as a basis of entrance on such professional work, approved by a representative of the Department of Public Instruction who will be present for that purpose. NON-VIRGINIA TEACHERS The regulation in regard to teachers' certificates and the requirements for entrance to certain courses in the Summer School do not apply to teachers from other states than Virginia unless they desire to apply for a Virginia teachers' certificate. STUDENTS' MAIL In order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his boarding place or the number and location of his room in the University. As soon as located the local address should be filed at the postoffice. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT The instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instructions. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses numbered from 1 to 100 in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer School, but the summer school work is recognized by standard colleges every where, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the honor system and the honor pledge required. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only state certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. Teachers from other States will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. The Virginia certificates with which the courses of study at the University Summer School are imediately concerned are the following: The Summer School Professional CertificateâPrimary Grade. The Summer School Professional CertificateâGrammar Grade. The Summer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade. The Summer School Professional CertificateâFor High School Teachers. Courses will be offered to meet the requirements of the Department of Public Instruction for High School graduates who wish to obtain certificates. Full information in regard to these certificates is contained in Form Eâ19, issued by the Department of Public Instruction, Richmond. Any teacher not acquainted with them should write for a copy. Important Caution.âAll Virginia teachers who desire to enter the professional course must present at the time of registration either one of the following:â(1) A full First Grade Certificate (provisional certificates or those of any lower grade cannot be accepted) issued for satisfactory grades made on State Examination; or (2) A High School Certificate issued by the State Department of Public Instruction (High School diplomas cannot be accepted) and also a letter from the principal or division superintendent, under whose direction the applicant has taught, stating that the applicant has had at least five months of satisfactory teaching experience. These credentials must be brought by the student in order to avoid delay in registering. The school cannot be responsible for credits for work on this course unless the credentials are found correct when the student registers. A high school graduate who has not obtained a State High School Certificate should write for it to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Richmond, Virginia, and secure it before coming to the school. Second Grade High School Certificates cannot be accepted for entrance to the professional course. Training Class Certificates given for less than four years of combined high school and normal training work cannot be accepted for entrance to the professional course. Those who have started work on this course at some other summer school will please bring with them their reports for the work already completed. If the course was started at this school in a previous summer, it is not necessary to bring credentials, as our office records are all that is necessary. The first year of the Old Professional Courses, requiring twelve weeks for completion, will not be given after January 1, 1917. However, those who have completed a part of either of the Old Professional Courses, will be allowed to finish under the rules and regulations of the year 1915. Accordingly only the second year's work of the old course will be offered this year as follows: FOR GRAMMAR GRADES Second Year Course (Old Course). 1.

PREPARATION FOR STATE EXAMINATIONS FOR FIRST AND SECOND GRADE CERTIFICATES The State Examinations will be held at the Summer School July 18, 19 and 20, 1917. Heretofore these courses have been offered at the University, but last year a much better arrangement was made with Supt. Johnson and the Charlottesville School Board, whereby the classes were held in Midway School building. The advantages of this plan are: 1. The work is given in one building, the classes are divided into sections small enough for drill, the periods are forty-five minutes each, and the Topical Outlines furnished by the Department are strictly followed and thus a thorough review guaranteed. 2. A vacation school will be in daily session in the building affording an excellent opportunity for observation work in all the grades, and special demonstration work in primary grades will be given by Miss Harrie Bronson, of Lynchburg Schools. 3. The afternoons and evenings will be open for extra work in special subjects and for the general lectures and entertainments which are such attractive and valuable features of the University Summer School. 4. Excellent boarding accommodations at very reasonable rates may be obtained in the vicinity of Midway School building, thus relieving the congestion at the University and reducing somewhat the cost of living. All teachers desiring to secure accommodations in Charlottesville should apply to Dr. J. G. Johnson, Charlottesville, Va. 5. Those registering for this course will be entitled to all the privileges of the Summer School without additional cost. The Registration fee for Virginia teachers is $1.00 for the term of four weeks. The Third Grade Certificate is no longer issued by the State Board of Education. The following extracts from Form EâNo. 19 of the Department of Public Instruction give the requirements for these certificates: (Sec. 31) "First Grade Certificate.âTo obtain a First Grade Certificate the applicant must be at least nineteen years old, must have had nine months successful experience in teaching, must make an average of 85 per cent. on the following subjects: Spelling, writing, reading, arithmetic, grammar (including composition), geography, history of the United States, history of Virginia, civil government (including the government of Virginia), drawing, theory and practice of teaching, physiology and hygiene, physical geography, elementary agriculture, and English history, and must not fall below 70 per cent. on any subject.

These courses give thorough training in sight reading, in ear training and dictation and in the methods of presenting public school music. This gives the teacher as much freedom in knowledge of methods and materials in music as in the subjects of geography, spelling, arithmetic, and the like. Courses for First Year Students. Material and Sight Singingâ1A.âThe satisfactory completion of this course requires (1) the ability to read at sight with Italian syllables, and with musical expression, the music taught in the first four years of the public schools, and (2) a knowledge of the material for these grades. Study of Tone and Rhythmâ1B.âThe activities prescribed in this course embody the careful development and mastery of all tonal, metric and rhythmic problems of the first four years of the public schools, through the medium of musical dictation. This work is based on the aurul recognition of the scale and scale successions up and down in varying order, followed by the written expression of the same. Ear training and eye training are then combined so that power may be gained to think tones and to sense meter and rhythms and at the same time acquire a practical knowledge of scale relations and the application of the Italian syllabus used in sight reading. Methods and Rote Songsâ1C.âThis course is devoted to the discussion and presentation of correct teaching principles of music for the first four years in public schools. The methods employed are those used in the school room. Students are required to formulate detailed outlines embodying the preparation and presentation of lessons for the classroom. Rote singing is the foundation upon which there must be laid the whole structure of school music. In this course, emphasis is placed on the importance of selecting material specially adapted for rote singing, upon the method of presentation, and upon the artistic interpretation of the thought and spirit of the song. Rudiments of Music and Melody Writingâ1D.âThe work in Rudiments of Music includes the study of the constructive elements of music with individual oral and written tests on the same. This includes (1) the notation and terminology of pitch, duration and volume; (2) pitch names; (3) the structure of the major scale; application to all keys; (4) key signature; (5) elementary melody. Music History and Current Musical Eventsâ1E.âStudents taking the course will be required to pass an examination covering the most important facts relating to the great classical and romantic composers and their music; also a working knowledge of current musical events together with the names of the most eminent living composers, their works, and the names of the principal music performers of the day, instrumentalists as well as vocalists. Courses for Second Year Students. Material and Sight Singingâ2A.âA certificate of credit for this requires the ability to read at sight with Italian syllables or words music of the degree of difficulty taught in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years of the public schools. A knowledge of all material suitable for grades five to eight inclusive is required. This course is open only to students who have completed the corresponding work prescribed in 1A. Study of Tone and Rhythmâ2B.âEntrance to this course requires the completion of the corresponding work prescribed in Course 1B. Consideration is given to the principles of the tonal and rhythmic problems of the fifth, sixth, and seventh years of the public schools through the medium of musical dictation. The work is both oral and written. Practice is given also in the recognition and written expression of music in two parts. The important phase of the aural recognition of modulation in all nearly related keys. Methods and Practice Teachingâ2C.âThis course is open only to students who have completed the corresponding work prescribed in Course 1C. The methods of the first four years are reviewed and the work of each year above the fourth is taken up in detail. Instruction is given for the proper training of the grade teacher and the course is designed to help the Supervisor of Music with the many problems of the school room, and to show her how to secure the hearty co-operation of the teachers, the superintendent and the community. Each student will be required to prepare and submit lesson plans in music for grades assigned, and to conduct lessons under the immediate supervision of the instructor. Melody Writing and Elementary Harmonyâ2D.âA practical course in original melody writing in public schools. It is presupposed that the student has acquired some proficiency in thinking tones and rhythmsâi. e., singing mentally and in visualizing and singing original melodies of four or eight measures. This course includes (1) the structure of the minor scale in all its forms, (2) elementary harmony; intervals and triads, (3) melody writing. Written work daily is required. High and Normal School MusicâF.âAll phases of a well-organized course of music in the high and normal school are discussed. These include classification of voices; organization of choruses with proper seating of singers to secure an artistic blending of voice-parts; glee clubs; the orchestra, its organization with regard to kinds and numbers of instruments necessary under varying conditions, and music suitable for orchestral work; elective courses in music appreciation and elementary harmony; conducting with reference to the special needs of a music supervisor. Chorus.âRequired of all music students. Particular attention is paid to the tone quality, blending of voices, phrasing, enunciation, and interpretation. Music suitable for high and normal school chorus is studied and performed at the public concerts given by the Department of Music. 15. Chorus.âAll students working for a grade teacher's certificate, or a supervisor's certificate, will be required to take this course. The time is devoted to chorus singing and to instruction in the technical and interpretative elements of choral music.
