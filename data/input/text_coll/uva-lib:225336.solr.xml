      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “I watched him through the doubtful fray, That changed as March's moody day, Till, like a stream that bursts its bank, Fierce Rupert thundered on our flank, 'Twas then, 'mid tumult, smoke, and strife, Where each man fought for death and life, 'Twas then I fired my petronel, And Mortham, steed and rider, fell.” Rokeby. Hastily springing to my feet, I had already donned my clothes, and was buckling on my Milan corslet, when old Martin entered my chamber, fully equipped as a supernumerary subaltern of my regiment. It was one of those customs of the day, which has, since the time of which I write, fallen completely into disuse, that every corps, independent of its regular stands of national and regimental colours, was distinguished by a smaller standard, bearing the coat-armorial of its commanding officer. This usage—which had probably originated during the civil wars, wherein each regiment was, for the most part, raised by its colonel from among his own territorial and feudatory dependants—I was particular to maintain in my own instance the more scrupulously, as being a stranger in a foreign land, and of course conscious that, unless asserted by myself, my personal dignity would not be much regarded by others. It was partly with a view to this, as well as to secure to myself a bold and trusty follower in the field, that I had solicited for the foster-brother of my father an appointment which certainly would appear more suitable for a far younger man. But no one, who had seen Martin Lydford on that morning, would have deemed it possible that nearly two-thirds of a century had passed over the head of the erect and powerful veteran, who unfolded, with a smile of daring exultation, the tattered and time-honoured banner of my ancient house. He wore a heavy antique helmet, with breast and back-pieces of bright steel; immense jack-boots, and high buff gauntlets reaching nearly to his elbows. A long broadsword of English manufacture— which, by-the-way, had done good service in its time on many a stricken field—with a poniard of formidable dimensions, completed his personal equipment. But in addition to these he carried, slung transversely across his shoulders, my petronel, a choice piece of Spanish workmanship, with an exceedingly small bore, and an indented, or, as it is now termed, a rifled[1] [1] The rifle, though a weapon of great rarity, was in use at this period; as is evident from the piece with which the regent Murray was shot, nearly a century earlier than the date of this narrative. It is preserved in the gallery of the Duke of Hamilton, and has a brass barrel slightly but distinctly rifled. barrel. It was not the fashion for officers to carry so cumbersome a weapon, but I was, at the same time, unwilling to lose a friend that had in several instances served my turn, and perhaps saved my life. The old man's eyes were full of tears as he unfurled the colours, which had not floated for many a day in action; but a sunny smile played on his lips. “Thank God, and thee, my master, that I have lived once more to see the argent bugles on their field of vert displayed amid the merry trumpets!” he said. “Now could I die in peace, that I have seen my lord again the leader of a host worthy his name and country.” “I would not wish that they should wave in trustier hands than yours, old Lydford,” was my reply. “But did you get the charger of St. Agrève last night? or what am I to ride this morning?” “I got him not, sir; his chestnut steed is lame, and he has none for his own service, save the black. Colonel le Chaumont's, too, and the count's chargers, are all worn out with duty. Bayard is overdone with last night's skirmish—a murrain on those rascal grooms of the commander! they let the good horse stand till he was wellnigh perished after a hot gallop. There is naught for it, sir, but you must ride Majestic.” “I could not ride a better; and, indeed, 'twas but a foolish fancy that made me hesitate. But reach yon flask of Auvergnât, and that old cheese from the Swiss pastures. We have scant time, indeed, but we are too old soldiers, Lydford, to ride forth without our breakfast. Old man, I pledge you—Good fortune to the argent bugles!” Our light repast was finished almost as soon as begun; and I was opening the door to go forth, when the veteran, looking steadfastly in my face, suddenly exclaimed,— “Surely you go not forth in such gay habits! You cannot but be marked. That scarlet cassock and rich armour, with the white scarf and plumes, are fearfully conspicuous. Best don the old buff coat you wore at Marston; it stood you then in stead, I well remember.” “A truce to your fears, good fellow,” I replied; “conspicuous or not, thus I go forth to-day. What! want you that the French cavaliers should say, we men of England are more chary of our lives than of our honour? Fy on you, man! I thought I had in you a better counsellor.” I descended the staircase, followed by my true retainer; in another instant I was in the saddle. The troops were already mustered; and, though the skies were still all dark and cheerless, I well knew that it could scarcely lack three hours of daybreak. The word was given—the trumpets sounded— and we marched steadily, but briskly, to our position. We had reached the heights of St. Mandé before the slightest streaks of dawning day were to be seen on the eastern horizon, but not before our indefatigable leader had commenced his preparations. As I rode up the ridge of the hill, one of the videttes fell back to me with the intelligence that the summit was already occupied by men and horses! For a moment I fancied that the enemy had been beforehand with us; and, on the instant, wheeled my leading troops into line for a charge. Having done this, I rode forward myself, and was agreeably surprised to find that the group which had created the alarm consisted of a score or two of artillerymen, with three light field-pieces. The captain in command handed me a note from Condé, containing further directions than I had received on the preceding night, and a promise that he would be on the spot in person soon after the commencement of the action. I had scarcely completed the arrangements necessary for the maintenance of my position, if attacked, and for displaying my little force so as to give it an appearance of the greatest possible numerical force, when the day began to break; and, almost simultaneously with the first dappling of the east, I heard the sullen tramp of the infantry under De Châtillon, as they advanced upon the post of Charenton. In a few minutes a single musket-shot rang from the enclosures below; and immediately afterward the rattling fire of the skirmishers, as those of our army attacked and drove in the pickets of the Frondeurs. Gallantly was the struggle maintained by both parties; nor did the enemy's outposts retire upon the main body till they were literally crushed back by the solid columns of our advances. Then came the deep hoarse roar and the wide glare of cannon after cannon—the long rolling volleys of the musketeers—the deafening clang of the tocsins, pealing the alarm from many a village steeple— VOL. II.—B and the shouts of a furious contest. Nearly at the same moment, the great glorious sun peered up above the distant hills, and bathed the whole country in broad light. To our left, and immediately before us, lay a long stretch of meadow-land, partially broken by coppices and small enclosures, with the blue Seine rolling as calmly through its rich landscape as though human strife had never approached its quiet borders. To the right lay the orchards and enclosures of Charenton, the narrow streets protected by powerful barricades, the avenues enfiladed by heavy cannon, and the whole position skilfully fortified, and manned by an immense garrison, under as bold a leader as ever buckled steel blade to buff belt. Below us lay the road, leading through Vincennes and Picpus to the metropolis, at the distance of some five miles, by which we expected ere long to see the Parisian forces advancing to support their comrades. An hour passed, and nothing was to be made out of the fortunes of the day, though it was evident that the strife was desperate, and nearly balanced. It was in vain that I directed my glass, with the utmost anxiety, to the immediate scene of action; for the morning was damp, and somewhat misty—the frost seeming to be on the point of yielding—so far misty, at least, as to cause the smoke to hang in heavy wreaths upon the low grounds, and to obscure the conflict with a dense veil; which was never moved entirely aside, although it was at times sufficiently agitated to enable us to discover the dark masses of men who were engaged, unseen and undistinguished within its folds, in the desperate game of war. The battle had raged incessantly for the space of nearly two hours, ere the commander-in-chief rode up with a gallant staff. He was in high spirits, having just learned from an aid-de-camp that the first barricade had been gallantly carried, though not without severe loss—the enemy fighting to the last, and succeeding in the removal of their artillery to the next line of defence. The prince highly commended my dispositions; but, having brought up with him a brigade of veteran infantry, directed me to lead two regiments of cavalry—one being that under my own peculiar command—somewhat lower down the hill, and to mask their position entirely from the high-road—which, as I have before said, ran below us, across the open meadows, lying between our position and the Seine—by a small plantation of young timber, that grew about midway of the slope. I saw the object at once; and a masterly disposition it was. From the extreme left of the wood, a hollow sandy lane ran transversely down to the main road, between two high straggling fences, which, though leafless, were thick enough to cover our movements. By this lane a column of troops, to almost any extent, might be made to debouch upon the flank of whatever force should move along the road, with scarcely a possibility of their being discovered till within five hundred paces of the enemy; and I, of course, perceived that a well-executed charge would cut off any succour that might otherwise be thrown into the beleaguered village. I had scarcely executed this manœuvre to my own satisfaction, and resumed my place beside the prince, ere a vidette galloped in from the direction of Picpus, with intelligence that the Parisians had marched out of the city thirty thousand strong—the heads of their columns having actually reached Vincennes before their rear had left the Place Royale; that the generals had announced their intention of giving battle; and that the coadjutor, De Retz, was with the army in person, mounted on a war-horse, with pistols in his holsters, and impetuously demanding an immediate advance. In the mean time, the action to our right became even hotter than before. Another horseman dashed up to the general from Charenton—a second barricade had been carried, but Châtillon had lost above one-third of his men, and required instant reinforcement, and a fresh supply of ammunition. While he was yet speaking, a third rider came in, spurring his jaded horse furiously onward from the opposite direction,—De Chateaufort was advancing with sixteen or eighteen hundred men —arquebusiers and pikemen—having crossed the river nearer to Paris, and hoping to fall upon the flank and rear of Châtillon, and to cut him off from the main army. It was a desperate crisis, but Condé was superior to it. I saw his eye flash, and his lip curl, as he issued his complicated orders with the most perfect coolness. “De Grammont, my good friend, lead down your gallant infantry, at once, to the support of Châtillon! Champfort, spur thou to Meilleraye; spur for thy life, and bid him advance with the reserve! Thou, Mornington, down with thee to thy men! get them, at once, into close column in yon hollow way—I leave the rest to your own good judgment; but drive De Chateaufort into the Seine! Away, sir! I can see the heads of his advance even now! Away!” And down the slope I went, driving the spurs into the conspicuous white charger, and riding straight across the enclosures to my command. B 2 In ten minutes, we were moving in a direction nearly parallel to the line of De Chateaufort's march; but still edging so much towards it that we were certain of commanding his flank and rear, unless he should, by some unforeseen circumstance, detect our ambuscade. I will confess that, as I rode down, the thought occurred to me, at least a dozen times, that this De Chateaufort might well be the persecutor of my beloved Isabel; and the thought fired my heart, and nerved my arm! But little time was given me for thought or speculation. When we had arrived within a hundred paces of the debouchure of the lane, I halted my men; and, dismounting, stole forward on foot myself to reconnoitre. On came the enemy—a powerful brigade of pikemen in the van, led by a mounted officer; then a brief interval—two field-pieces—a regiment of musketeers— and then another corps of pikemen bringing up the rear. They were marching gallantly forward, with their drums beating, and their colours displayed, evidently quite unprepared for the reception they were about to meet. They had no flanking-parties—no advanced guard; and were hurrying on, looking neither to the right nor to the left, towards Charenton, whence the din of conflict— which had slackened for a while, from the want of ammunition, as I concluded—came louder than ever, satisfying me that our reserve was already in action, and that our affairs were going on successfully. I had barely time to get back to my men, and to explain my plan to the officers, ere I saw the van of the pikemen defiling past the mouth of the lane; but so completely were we favoured by the ground, and by the carelessness of the enemy, that we were still undiscovered. “We will charge,” I said to De Charmi, who commanded the second regiment, “as we are, in column, full upon the flank of the musketeers; cut our way through, or over them; and having broken their column, wheel into line to the right and left, and charge at once on both divisions of the pike-men. No shouting, men--trumpets, be silent till we clear the lane; then shout, and sound, till the welkin rings!” As I finished my command, the field-pieces passed the lane, and the front files of the musketeers began to show themselves. We charged, silently and steadily, till we were on the open meadow; then kettledrum, and trumpet, and the united voices of a thousand men, whose souls were on their tongues, burst forth at once. The enemy was surprised, it is true, but he strove nobly to retrieve his error. The musketeers wheeled promptly into line, and gave us one close volley; but their column of march had been too open, so that their line was necessarily shallow, and their front was unguarded by pikemen. A score of our saddles were emptied, and twice as many horses went over; but ere they could reload we rode them down. So far we had done well; but the hardest part was yet to come. We wheeled both regiments into line in opposite directions; De Charmi's front facing the flank of the vanguard of pikemen, and mine the flank of the reserve. We charged at once, and I was again victorious; we dispersed—then cut them down—we drove them to the devil in an instant—but again with heavy loss. Then, as ill-luck would have it, my men, who had behaved steadily enough up to this moment, maddened at the sight of blood, became for the time unmanageable, and pursued the fugitives clear off the ground, making a fearful and almost unresisted slaughter. In the mean while, De Charmi had been checked by a brilliant manœuvre of Chateaufort himself, whom I had not yet seen, as he had been from the commencement of the action on the extreme right of the vanguard. Finding at once that his musketry and rear-guard were annihilated, he had contrived, with admirable skill, to form a new front to his vanguard, which consisted of nearly a thousand fresh men, where his flank had been, by simply facing every man half to the left-about on his own ground; so that, when De Charmi charged, instead of coming upon a naked flank, he was received by a steady phalanx of bristling pikes, and by a discharge of two field-pieces, which made fearful havoc with his men. Such was the state of affairs, when I was enabled to look round; my own troops in partial disorder, and De Charmi halted, and cutting up the pikemen, to the best of his power, with the petronels of his troopers. His fire was imperfectly returned by an occasional volley from the few arquebusiers who had escaped our first charge, and taken refuge among the pikes. Urging my subalterns to hurry to their duty, and to recall the men with all possible speed, I joined De Charmi with two troops. While galloping forward, at the head of my men, I distinctly heard a cry among the enemy's ranks. “Mark him!—mark the red cassock and white horse!” And at once half a dozen pieces were discharged, and with a pretty good aim, two of the bullets rattling against my breastplate; but —thanks to the good Italian armourer—glancing off like hailstones from a castle-wall. At the next moment, I observed my friend, the querist of the preceding night, mounted on a tall bay horse within the pikemen, who were now formed in a hollow square—and instantly recognised him, in his martial attire, for the servant who had waylaid me on my march to Bar le Duc. He was reloading a long Spanish-barrelled musket, as I doubted not, for my own private benefit; and not being particularly anxious that he should have another chance of trying his skill on me, or that my men should receive another point blank discharge of the field-guns, which were nearly reloaded, I gave the word for a simultaneous charge on their front and flank; myself executing a lateral movement, which enabled me to take them at a disadvantage. This was in our favour; and, more than this, that the enemy were already disheartened by the defeat of their comrades, and by the certainty that they should receive no further aid, while they could see a regiment of infantry already moving down to our support. We dashed upon them gallantly; and, before we were within ten paces of them, I could see they would not stand our charge: they wavered—broke off—and received the shock of our swords and chargers on their backs—it was a massacre! Just as the pikemen turned, I caught sight of De Chateaufort; and—though splendidly equipped in a frock of orange-tawny velvet, with brass inlaid armour and the blue scarf of the Fronde—I knew him, at half a glance, for the THIRD BROTHER. He saw me, too; and, as if by common consent, we spurred our horses forward to end our controversy by the sole true arbiter—the mortal sword. But, as I struck the spurs into his flank, my charger bounded nearly erect from the ground, plunged forward, and fell over and over in the death agony. Instinctively, I cleared my feet of the stirrups; but was still thrown so heavily upon my head, that for a second or two I was stunned. As I went down, however, I saw to whom I owed my fall. It was the self-same murderous slave who again drew the trigger; but again my good-luck baffled him. As I rose to my feet, sorely bruised and shaken, I saw old Lydford—who had been at my elbow throughout the whole day—deliberately levelling my petronel, which he had unslung, at the servant, whom he believed to be the slayer of his lord; and who, having joined De Chateaufort, was galloping off the ground with him, as hard as their steeds could carry them. “Not him!” I shouted—“not him, Martin. Down with the other!” But it was too late; the piece flashed; and, ere the sound of the report reached my ear, I saw the scoundrel reel in his stirrups, and, in a few more bounds of his horse, fall heavily to the earth! De Chateaufort himself, though hard chased by some of my troopers, reached the Seine, took water gallantly, and, swimming well across, gained the other side, and made good his escape. Mounting a fresh horse, I rode about the field, collecting my men, and putting an end to the slaughter; the rout of the enemy being too complete to allow even a possibility of their rallying. I drew my rein over the body of the servant, who had twice so nearly cut short my career. Though desperately hurt, he was yet alive and sensible; but, having no time to devote even to that which was next my heart, I directed two or three of my troopers to carry him carefully to my quarters; and then led back my regiments, sorely diminished in numbers, but exulting in their victory, to the commander-in-chief. Condé himself rode out to meet me. “'Fore God,” he cried, “you have done masterly and well! Louis de Bourbon thanks you, sir! Ay— and, by Heaven, the cardinal shall hear of this! The King of France shall thank you. Charenton is ours; De Châtillon has won it bravely; and Chanleu as bravely lost it—dying like a noble gentleman on the last barricade, which he held to the last, and refusing to survive his glory—though, Heaven knows, that is deathless. Yes, sir,” he continued, “Charenton is ours; for which—before these gentlemen I say it—for which I hold myself mainly indebted to your intelligence and valour. But for you, Chanleu must have been relieved; and had it been so, we could not have won an inch of Charenton; and now all Paris cannot rob us of it!” VOL. II.—C</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. K. Hen. He dies, and makes no sign; O God, forgive him! War. So bad a death argues a monstrous life. K. Hen. Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all. Close up his eyes, and draw the curtains close; And let us all to meditation. King Henry VI. It was barely noon when the brief action of the day was concluded, and although no person in the royal army entertained the slightest fear that Charenton could be retaken by any force the Parisians could bring against it, now that it was once fairly occupied by our veterans, and strengthened by much of our own artillery in addition to all that of the Frondeurs, which, with their colours, ammunition, stores, and a considerable number of prisoners, had fallen into our hands, still it was not judged prudent to withdraw our reserve entirely from the heights of St. Mandé; as it was scarcely credible that the enemy would abandon a place of so much importance without a single struggle for its recovery. Indeed, we had further reasons for expecting the immediate advance of the parliamentarian generals than what arose from a mere calculation of the chances; for so nearly had they advanced towards our lines, that we could hear the hoarse rolling of their drums, and the rattling and groaning of their wagons and artillery, as they were dragged slowly over the roads, already broken up by the operations of the blockade; while ever and anon the heads of a column would appear above the summit of the opposite heights. These parties of observation, for it seems they were no more, did not, however, attempt to maintain themselves in the position, which we could not but suppose it was their desire to occupy; continually pressing forward with a considerable show of alacrity, till they had come within point-blank cannon-range, they as continually fell back with precipitation, and in some disorder, whenever the fire, with which our artillerists from time to time saluted them, became in the slightest degree galling. This trivial and unsatisfactory warfare was continued till it was nearly dusk; unsatisfactory, I call it, since, although it cost the enemy some lives, and us some ammunition, of which we were already apprehensive of falling short, it did not tend in the least to alter the relative position, strength, or ultimate superiority of either army. So aware was our noble commander of the useless waste and evil effects of this distant cannonade, that he had almost determined on seizing the opposite brow, with such a body of horse and foot as might be expected to deter the enemy from any further demonstrations in that quarter, unless, indeed, he were desirous of hazarding a general action, which, for more reasons than one, appeared improbable. I had already received orders to put myself at the head of St. Agrêve's regiment, which, not having been engaged in the affair of the morning, was fresh, and eager for service; to assume the command of a strong column of musketeers, which were already moving to the front; and to advance promptly, and secure at all hazards the contested summit. I had not, however, as yet completed my arrangements, when messengers arrived with the intelligence that the Parisians were in full retreat—the generals having come to the deliberate conclusion, in a council of war assembled at Picpus during the continuance of the storm, that although it would be easy to relieve Charenton, and even to drive Condé from his position, such a proceeding must nevertheless cause the loss of many a bold citizen, and draw tears from many a fair widow! This notable decision, being quite in accordance with the feelings of the burgher guard, who constituted the corps d'armee, was received with acclamations so boisterous, that, reaching our ears, they were deemed to be the symptoms of an advance en masse. The preparations which we were making for their reception was, in consequence of this report, shortly changed into preparations for withdrawing our forces, all to a single regiment, which was encamped upon the ground, more for the purpose of guarding against any possibility of a surprise, than of being actually called upon to sustain an attack. The wintry twilight was closing rapidly over the scene of our operations, as I rode homewards in the rear of my regiment, which was in itself the rear-guard of our little army. Ere long the moon rose broad and cloudless; and her soft light, contrasted with the red glare of the watch-fires which were burning on every side, was reflected in the pure waters of the wide river at our feet. It was a landscape of exceeding sweetness and repose. The troops, fatigued with their duty of the day, were little disposed for merriment or riot; and were, for the most part, outstretched—beneath such temporary shelters as they had found or erected— in the deep slumbers of forgetfulness. The only sounds that arose from the broad valley were the occasional challenge of a patrol, mingled with the murmurings of the river, the shrill neigh of a war-horse, C 2 and, at rare intervals, a shriek, or burst of laughter from the post of Charenton. The only living things engaged in active motion were our retiring squadrons; nor did many hours elapse before they too were safely housed for the night, in their old quarters around St. Germains, and all was still as death. It must not be supposed that I was, during this time, forgetful of the wounded prisoner whom I had ordered to be carried from the field to my own lodging; and from whom I could not but hope to gain some tidings concerning Isabel. So burning, indeed, was my anxiety to question the man ere he should die, that the slow pace of the troops became wholly insupportable to me; and, when we had marched so far on our route as to render a surprise nearly impossible, I left St. Agrêve, with a brief injunction to be prudent, and with directions where he might find me, should needs be. I gave the spurs to the miserable jade I had backed after my own good steed had been killed under me, and galloped, at the best pace I could extract from him, to my own abode. I saw at once, by the horses standing about the doorway, and by the unusual concourse of attendants, that the object of my solicitude had been brought in, and had moreover excited some attention among the soldiery. Indeed, I afterward learned that the indignation of the troopers had been so great, on their discovering that he had brought private malice to aid his murderous intentions, that they would have shown him yet more decided marks of their disgust—had they not been sternly checked by their officers—than the groans and execrations with which they greeted his arrival. As I was ascending the stairs I met De Charmi. He grasped my hand, and whispered to me hastily that the ruffian I had sent in was recognised instantly by Sergeant le Vasseur as the servant who had left the inn-yard near Villotte on the arrival of our troops; and was probably the same fellow who had murdered our vidette in the woods of Saudrupt. “Ha!” I cried, as if unconscious of the fact— “ha! it may well be so. That indeed would account for his kind intentions towards myself this very day. But does he live, sir, and is he sensible? I fain would question him.” “He is alive, although the leeches give no hopes of his recovery; and we believe him to be sensible, although he has not spoken since his removal. I doubt you will make nothing of him.” “We will try, sir--we will try,” I answered, and passed onward; but perceiving that he was accompanying me, and being somewhat anxious that our interview should be without witnesses, I gave him some trifling orders to execute relative to the disposition of the cavalry; and requesting that I might see him as early as possible on the morrow, wished him a good repose, and left him. I was, however, doomed to yet another interruption ere I reached the chamber, as I met the surgeon-general with his staff; who, hearing that one of his subalterns had been called to my quarters, concluded that I was myself in want of advice, and had ridden up to tender me his own assistance. “Good—good!” he cried, when he saw it was me; “I heard of you to-day, and feared you had over-exerted yourself; but you are well, hey! well?” and before I could reply, he went off again in his rambling way—“A pestilent rogue you have up there, Monsieur de Mornington; a pestilent rogue! I can't conceive, for my part, why you did not let the scoundrel bleed to death where he had fallen; unless, indeed, you want to keep him for the gallows, for which, I confess, he would make a pretty tassel. But it is too late, sir; he will never live for it; the more's the pity! My boys have stopped the hemorrhage; but all his viscera are cut to pieces, and his stomach ruptured, by that bullet. It must be an uncommon piece that sent that bullet, by-the-way! They tell me it is yours. But you will hold me here all night, an I look not the sharper”—Heaven is my witness, I had not spoken a syllable—“and I have half a score of wounded to look after. Châtillon has got it—sharply, but not desperately—and De Meilleraye—and Villeroy, I fear, past hope. Adieu! adieu!” and he left me for a moment; but had not gone down five steps, ere he called after me—“That fellow cannot live five hours; and as you cannot hang him, mon cher, it would be as good just to let him die at once, for he is suffering the torments of the damned! Adieu! once more, adieu!” When I got into my apartment, there were no persons in it but the wounded man—who had been hastily laid on my own couch by the bearers—and old Lydford; who, well aware that I was solicitous about the fellow—although I conclude that, like the worthy surgeon, he was somewhat in the dark as to my motives—was bathing his head from time to time, and moistening his parched lips. For these kind offices he was rewarded by a brief and bitter curse; which was, indeed, the only sign the scoundrel gave of life or consciousness. His eyes were closed; his teeth firmly set; and the black dews of death were already clogging the pores of his swarthy brow. A fearful convulsion would ever and anon shake his whole frame, and his broad chest would rise and fall with a horrible spasmodic action, that was scarcely less terrible to look upon than it must have been agonizing to endure. He was, indeed, the same fellow who had dogged me from the very first, and was, I felt but little doubt, the same horseman who had attended the carriage of Isabel's tormentor, and who, on the attack of the second brother, had fled, only for the purpose of bringing up the other attendants, who had so nearly intercepted my escape. So fearful were his agonies, that I could hardly bring myself to torment the dying wretch with questions; but the stake for which I played was of a value paramount to every other consideration. I felt that this was perhaps the only opportunity I might ever have of learning the place of Isabel's concealment; and in that feeling I addressed him without compunction or delay. “My friend,” I said, in a low and placid voice— “my friend, I grieve to say to you that your career on earth is wellnigh ended. We soldiers have but a brief space to make our settlement; yet have we all much cause to wish for time. Would you not see a priest?” He had not perceived my entrance till I spoke; and, unclosing his eyes instantly, he gazed upon me with a mingled expression of disappointment, wonder, hatred, and, perhaps, a touch of fear, such as I never have seen before or since on any mortal features. “Can the dead speak?” he gasped “Dead!— fool, fool, that I am! I have again missed him. I shall go down to hell!—to HELL! with all the sin of murder on my head, and none of its advantage! A priest?” said you—“a priest?—ha! ha! ha!—a priest!” And he laughed in bitter and fierce derision, till the unnatural mirth was checked by a spasm that threatened to put an end to his existence. “Think better of it,” I replied calmly, and smothering my anxiety—“think better of it; we have all much cause for prayer and for repentance; and you, I doubt not, have no less than others,—the hatred—the causeless and most unrelenting hatred you have displayed towards myself is somewhat—” “Causeless!” he almost screamed—“causeless! You lie! Was it not cause enough that I should hate you, when you slew them both—both the brave boys I nurtured from their childhood?” “A rare nurture, truly,” I replied, some of my accustomed irony breaking out—“a rare nurture, truly—and a fair tutor you would seem! Nevertheless, I slew them not—by their own hands they fell.” He glared up into my face with a wild expression of mingled malice and contempt—“And you, poor dupe! you carried off their Lindabrides, as though she was no bona roba, but a demoiselle of honour. Ha! ha! ha! and you wedded her— they tell me—wedded her! What fools are these same cavaliers—ha! ha!” “Peace, with thy vile and lying ribaldry!” I exclaimed in a deep stern tone—“Peace! or, dying as thou art, will I cram the falsehood in thy teeth—wretch—sinner—miscreant! Speak!—tell me of Isabel de Coucy—tell me of my bride; or, by the heaven, which thou shalt never see—by the eternal hell, on whose dread verge thou art tottering even now—I swear that we have means to wring the truth from thee, and we will use them!” “Use them!” he replied, bitterly but resolutely, as though he were in the fullest possession of all his mental and corporal powers—“Use them! and see if they can profit thee. Use them, I say, and free me from this agony—so will I thank thee —use them!” “Nay,” returned I; “hastily I spoke, and therefore wrongly. Not for the universe would I apply the question to my deadliest foe, were he in all his manhood and his health; how should I then to one like thee? But listen—to yourself can I now offer nothing—but have you none whom you yet love? whom I can aid, whom I can further, or enrich?— Say but one word, one little word, and it shall be a source to them of measureless content!” “Plague me not, sir fool—plague me not! ten thousand curses on your head—ten thousand curses on mine own! for had my hand been steady, as its wont, you should not have been here to add gall to torments—heavy enough, the fiend knows, already!” “Oh!” I cried, almost wildly, for anxiety was fast conquering my assumed calmness—“oh, die not thus! I—I whom you deem your foe, and justly—I would not see you perish soul and body thus. Oh, I beseech you, if there be aught of man about you—if you ever loved, or were beloved by woman—by all your hopes of heaven, which even you may gain by prompt repentance—by all your fears of an eternity of wo!—tell me, I do beseech you! You are not—cannot be—all heartless —all villain—none are so! There must be in your heart some vein of human kindness. Oh! for the love of the Eternal, die not thus—harming VOL. II.—D so long as breath and body hold together, one who has never wronged you—do not so needless, so thankless, and so black a crime, as to sever those whom God has joined together.” “What!” he said, looking into my eyes with a malignant leer—“what, the cold Englishman can feel! I shall not die then unavenged!” He closed his eyes for a moment, his lips moved quickly, but sent forth no sound. When he again looked up, the bitter expression left his brow, his muscles were smoothed and tranquil; there was a languor visible in all his countenance, such as I have ever noticed on those who die of gun-shot wounds. He even smiled pleasantly as he met my eye. “I am in the wrong,” he said—“I am in the wrong; but ere I die—I—I will yet be righted! You have wedded her, you say—have wedded her, and love her?” “More than my own soul!” “Ay! it is ever thus. So loved I myself—once —in my boyish days—before I was—no matter! And you will pardon me, if I will tell you of your love—will pardon and will thank me?” “Will bless you—despite all your wrongs—will bless you!” “Ay! it is good so to die—better to go hence blessed than banned. Well! it shall be so; hark thee, now!—closer yet—hark, in thine ear!” Totally unsuspicious, and deceived by the alteration of the fellow's manner, I leaned over the bed; and, in compliance with his request, bowed my ear down, almost to meet his lips. I felt his left hand pass around my neck, but in my eagerness to catch his words, for I believed his breath was failing, I did not regard it. In an instant he had grasped my collar; and drawing from his bosom a short stiletto, he sprang like a hurt wild-cat at my throat. “She is in hell!” he screamed—“in HELL—where you and I will meet her!” and with all his might he struck. Well was it for me that I wore a coat of Milan plate; for the weapon, aimed surely at the collar-bone, and driven home with the force of vengeance and despair, alighted on the very rim of the breastplate; pierced it, stout as it was, like paper; rent the strong buff coat I wore beneath my cassock, and inflicted, even then, a trifling wound. Had I been less strongly fenced, that blow had been my death! As it was, I staggered under its force--he thought that I was sped. Once more the wild and sneering laugh burst from his lips, but it was soon fearfully drowned in the death-rattle--one spasm, more violent than any that had preceded it—one long shiver—he stretched out his limbs— he was dead!—dead, with his glaring eyes fixed in disappointment on my face—for he perceived that he had failed—and with the sneering smile still curling his pale lip. He was dead; and—as I then surmised, with dread almost akin to terror— with him all chance had perished of learning the fate of Isabel de Coucy!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. You, Lord Archbishop,— Whose see is by a civil peace maintained; Whose beard the silver hand of peace has touched; Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutored; Whose white investments figure innocence, The dove and very blessed spirit of peace;— Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself, Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace, Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war? King Henry IV. I was yet gazing, with a strange complication of feelings, upon the countenance of the dead man, when a summons to attend the Prince de Condé disturbed the tenor of my meditations. There is always something terribly fascinating in the features of the dead—something which rivets, even while it disgusts, the eye. The utter absence of thought, of action, of animation! the void! the nothingness! the eternity!—I never looked upon a corpse, even though it were the corpse of a stranger, without being sensible of intense interest— D 2 what then must I have felt in contemplating all that remained of one who had left no means untried to work my evil! In truth, I know not how I felt. No man can be indifferent to the removal of a deadly foe—and such assuredly had he been who lay outstretched before me, as pale and rigid as though his cheek had never flushed with the crimson hue of fury; for how brave soever one may be —how careless soever, at least to all external show, of the enmities of men—it is nevertheless no pleasant reflection to know that there exists anywhere, within the limits of the universal world, a being who, were his power equal to his malice, would hunt him to destruction. There was then a something of stern gratification in my heart, but there was mingled with it a strain of disappointment, almost of sorrow. I had, absurdly enough, calculated on gaining some information concerning Isabel from the lifeless clay at my feet; and now that he was gone for ever—gone to his everlasting home—a link was severed—a thread that had, at least in the imagination, connected me to my lost love, was broken. I could have wellnigh wished that he might live, even though a renewal of his life would have been but a renewal of his machinations against my own happiness. I was fast falling into gloom and despondency when the messenger entered, and, by compelling me to act at once, dispelled the melancholy train of thought which had all but taken possession of my soul. Casting a dark watch-cloak over my armour, and replacing my heavy morion by a cap of martin's fur, I walked forth quietly and unattended into the moonlit village. I reached the prince's quarters just as that indefatigable leader was dismounting from the third horse he had wearied out that day. “Ha! Monsieur de Mornington,” he exclaimed, on seeing me—“on foot and unattended!—How falls this so?—methought you were too keen a horseman ever to walk three paces!” “I am, so please your highness,” I returned; “but in default of those four feet of the quadruped, I am compelled to bear myself—less swiftly, but perhaps not less surely—on mine own. Of my two horses, one—the gift, too, of his majesty—was shot beneath me in this morning's skirmish; while the other has been so shrewdly tried of late, that I must needs be chary of his strength, or I may want him when to want were fatal!” “What, was the white charger killed?—he bore you nobly, and you backed him bravely!—But this must not be, sir; we must not have an officer so useful to us as yourself deprived of wherewithal to serve. A poor prince's charger is but a profitless exchange for a great monarch's gift; but if you will receive him, as a slight tribute to your valour, black Rocroi shall be yours—and Condé will feel honoured by your acceptance! He will befit you too, for he affects the front ranks in a charge! Lead Rocroi straightway to the quarters of monsieur,” he continued, turning to the groom who held his stirrup—“and you, fair sir, enter with me—I would have some words with you!” Expressing my gratitude in a few strong phrases, I followed him into the chamber in which we had been assembled on the preceding evening. “You have supped, Monsieur de Mornington?” he cried, as he threw himself into a huge oaken settle by the hearth—“you have supped, or no?—What, have you eaten nothing since the morning? Tête Dieu! but we will order this forthwith. I snatched a mouthful as I left the field—and in truth but a mouthful—for I was called away to attend a meeting of the council at St. Germains. So ho! there, gentlemen, without!--Bring here some food and wine—quick! quick! and lights—why tarry you?” In a few moments supper was served, and, in truth, we did ample justice to the huge joint which smoked before us in all the rude magnificence of camp cookery. During our hearty meal the prince conversed gayly and without reserve, but on topics of small import, arising for the most part out of the occurrences of the past day; but, when the servants had withdrawn, he filled a large goblet of wine, and, motioning me with his hand to follow his example, spoke with strong emphasis, though slowly, and without any manifestation of much feeling. “It was not for such idle talk as this, Monsieur de Mornington,” he said, “that I have requested your company. I wish to know, sir, if there be aught in which I can advantage you—my influence is at this moment high, both with my royal cousin and the cardinal, and well I think that nothing I am like to ask will be denied me. To you I owe a most deep debt of gratitude—nor is it my wont to let my gratitude grow mouldy by long keeping. Speak out, I pray you, sir, and fully. Is your rank equal to your wishes?—or is there aught else in which a prince's word may serve you?” My reply was of course a disclaimer of all merit which could entitle me to reward, or more than ordinary consideration; and, while expressing my satisfaction at having been so fortunate as to gain so valuable a reward as the approbation of De Condé, I positively refused to advance any request, or, indeed, to receive any remuneration for that which was but the execution of my duty. “This shall not serve your turn,” he exclaimed, fervently—“'fore God, it shall not; nor do I hold it altogether generous in you, Monsieur de Mornington, to deny me that which would be doubtless far more gratifying to me than to yourself. If you will not that I hold you, for the hereafter, proud and thankless—promise, sir, that whenever you stand in need of aught that Louis de Bourbon can procure or execute for you--promise me that you will apply to me forthwith.” “Most gratefully do I undertake the obligation: and believe me, prince, if I be proud, it is that any deed of mine should be deemed worth the gain of—” “My friendship!—Sir, you have it! Would you were not too cold to prove it on the instant!” “To show your highness,” I replied, “that I am neither cold, nor proud, nor thankless, I will tax your grace's friendship even now”—and without further delay I plunged into the narrative of all that had befallen me—all that had raised me for an instant to the summit of felicity, and plunged me thence to the abyss of misery. I did not conceal a thought, a word, an action—my hopes, my fears, my doubts, my agonies, were all laid before him,— “and now,” I concluded—“now that I have bared my very heart to your highness's inspection, may I hope for your advice—for your assistance?” He had listened with deep attention throughout, the varying expressions passing over his noble features like the shadows of autumnal clouds flitting across some sunny landscape: two or three times in the course of my narration he set his teeth, clutched the hilt of his sword, and muttered the word “villains” with fierce energy; but as I finished my tale of sorrow, he started to his feet, paced the floor rapidly, taking short turns, and stamping so heavily that the decaying timbers creaked beneath his stride. “Wild work!” he said, at length—“wild work! and most atrocious villany! Fear not, however, sir—or rather doubt not—for fear, if I mistake not, is no inmate of your bosom—doubt not but I will see you righted. It is nevertheless a delicate, and perchance a dangerous experiment. Mazarin is ever, though he may employ them, jealous of foreigners, and thrifty of the states' possessions. This demoiselle, on her own showing, is a ward of government if free; and you have erred in wedding her—erred in the strict eyes of the law, I mean--not so in honour or humanity. One thing is clear—nothing can be done till she be rescued from these dogs: that you must effect yourself, and in that will I aid you to the uttermost. It is well that this De Chateaufort is with the Frondeurs, for so will he gain naught but bitterness and wrath from Mazarin. Him you must not lose sight of De Meilleraye said something of a lady too!— Tête Dieu! it well may be that she is even now in Paris! It is indeed a tangled knot this to unravel; but if we may not find the clew, we can at the worst but sever it with the sword!—Hold! hold! I have it! A herald will be sent to-morrow with letters to the generals,—to the Parliament, the provosts, and the echevins of Paris. You shall go with him—I will see to it forthwith. You must learn where they have concealed her, for without that we can do nothing; that once discovered, trust me to bring about the rest. Be silent, only, and be prudent in counsel, as you are bold and ready in execution, and you must succeed!—Good-night, sir--speak not of this to any man, nor seem to know that you have aught of duty for to-morrow —I will see to it, and you shall so receive your orders, that no man shall question their propriety.” With a spirit somewhat lightened, though by no means free from anxiety or care, I left the prince's quarters, and hurried, with quick steps and a throbbing heart, to my own apartments. It was evident that I might fully count upon his good offices, whenever they could be brought to bear; but it was no less evident that I must depend principally on my own sagacity and my own exertions. This was, however, all that I had ever looked for, and in gaining this I had gained every thing! I plainly fore-saw, that if I could by any means discover the place of Isabel's confinement, the prince would contrive some method for placing me in a situation that would enable me to effect her release; and further, that if I should recover her from her open enemies, he would make the remainder of our course easy and direct. A weight, which had hung like a millstone about my heartstrings, was lifted up, as it were, by this discovery. Used as I had been from my childhood upward to every species of stratagem—ready and expert in ferreting out and profiting by every kind of information, I entertained little doubt of being able ere long to learn as much as would suffice for all my objects—as would be a pretext for the use of open force in her rescue! If I should fail in all else, I was determined to obtain possession of the person of De Chateaufort, and either to tear the secret from his heart, or to keep him as a hostage, in close confinement, till the old duke, his father, should be willing to buy his release by the unconditional surrender of my bride! VOL. II.—E Full of these wild fantasies, or such as these, I threw myself upon the couch; but, contrary to my wont, I lay for many hours disturbed and sleepless. It was to no purpose that I tried every change of posture, that I used every expedient I had ever known or heard of, to compose my mind and “steep my senses in forgetfulness.” Hour after hour the chimes of a distant bell smote on my ear; hour after hour the challenges of the sentinels, and the heavy trampling of the patrols going their rounds, found me awake and listening to the varied cadences. The gray light of early morning was already stealing through my uncurtained lattice, when I sunk into a deep but perturbed slumber; from which, however, I was almost instantly, as it appeared to me, aroused by the voice of Lydford. “Up! up, sir!—up! it is high noon,” he cried; “there waits a herald with his company beneath the windows, eager to set forth to Paris. A troop of your own regiment has been ordered out by the commander, and Bayard is even now saddling for your service.” It occupied but a brief space to array myself—but this time in garb of peace. Without rapier and dagger no gentleman goes forth, nor were my holsters ungarnished by their accustomed pistols; but, excepting these, I descended the staircase as if preparing but for a morning's ride. Lydford, according to previous orders, did on his liveries of forest green; and, with the small round target on his shoulder, which affixed on English serving-men the term of swash-bucklers—an appellation which has already shared the fate of all things sublunary, and been forgotten—the national broadsword on his hip, a badge on his right arm, and a cap of black velvet upon his time-blanched locks, followed to guard his master, whether from secret assassination or from open violence. When I reached the door, I found the herald—to escort whose person I had, ostensibly at least, been ordered out—in his gay coat-of-arms and quartered tabard, awaiting, somewhat impatiently, my appearance. Behind him sat two pursuivants, in doublets of rich purple taffeta, thickly adorned with fleurs-de-lis of solid gold; each with a trumpet of the same precious metal in his hand, to which had been appended banners of spotless white, free from blazonry or fringe of any kind whatever; and at a little distance from these, a gallant troop of horse, fully equipped as if for action, were drawn up—motionless as statues on their managed chargers; the cornet at their head bearing a plain white flag of truce, and their captain, like myself, unarmed. Waving my hand to the king-at-arms, with a few brief words of apology, I vaulted into my saddle, and we rode at a brisk pace towards the metropolis. It is a lovely ride up the rich valley of the Seine from St. Germains through Ruel to Paris; and as we rode along, for the most part at a light hand-gallop, we were not long in getting over the twelve miles of distance which, strange as it may seem, were all that separated the head-quarters of the court from those of the parliament. We met with no interruption, although at one moment I almost anticipated that our sacred and heraldic character would scarcely prove efficient as a protection. For when we had arrived within two leagues perhaps of the barriers, a large detachment of cavalry came wheeling down the road; and it did not require a second glance to discover, in the partisan officer who led them, my mortal foe De Chateaufort. I fully expected, as our two parties met, to hear him give the word to charge; and even passed the word along my scanty lines that the men should look to their petronels, ere I rode forward to address the commander in my official quality; which I did with a degree of reluctance that must almost have been obvious to my old antagonist. I spoke, however, shortly, and with an air of cool hauteur, which was intended—and which, I doubt not, was so taken—to express that my courtesies were directed, not to the man, but to the officer. He smiled somewhat sneeringly as I spoke, but answered civilly enough, and furnished me with the necessary passwords; apologizing for his inability to attend me through the outposts in consequence of his duties elsewhere. His official reply concluded, he pointed with his left hand to the white ensign which was streaming above our heads, and, with a glare of hatred lighting up all his features, tapped the hilt of his sword. “The time will come!” he said; “fear nothing; but it will!” “Would God it were arrived even now!” I answered. “But, as you say, the time shall come, and that right speedily, when my peculiar character shall be no protection to your villany!” I doffed my plumed bonnet, and rode coolly forward—the files of the enemy opening, as we advanced, to give us passage; and I could hear the muttered comments of the soldiers as they recognised E 2 us for the men who had cut them up so fatally on the preceding day. Scarcely had they passed over the brow of the hill behind us, ere I called old Martin to my stirrup. “Ride back,” I whispered, “to the coppice on the summit of yon eminence—I marked it as we rode by—it commands a wide prospect over the neighbouring country—conceal your horse among the underwood, and watch the motions of yonder cavalry as you would watch a wild-cat on the spring. Tarry there till we return, and take good heed you be not taken.” The old man nodded assent, and galloped back on the instant; but hardly was he out of sight, before we came upon another party of horsemen! They were a dozen servants, in the blue and tawny liveries of my enemy, well-armed, and leading with them several baggage-horses equipped as for a journey. It was not without some apprehension that I saw them following the route of the cavalry; for I could scarcely hope that Lydford would have gained the covert, before their arrival on the spot. Nothing, however, could be done; the event was in the hands of Him to whom alone the past and the future are as one. We continued to ride sharply forward, and, in less than an hour, stood before the gates of Paris. Our trumpets flourished loud and shrill, but in the well-known cadences of a friendly summons: the sentinel on guard received our message, and proceeded to make his report to the officer of the watch; but the gates were not unbarred! We were detained thus at least three hours; during the whole of which we could hear the sounds of a loud and tumultuous concourse in the streets, thronging, as it would seem, towards the Hotel de Ville, wherein the leaders of the Frondeurs held their sittings. At the end of the time I have above mentioned, it was signified to us briefly that we could not be received—“as heralds were but the means of communication between belligerents, and as our admission would be tantamount to a confession that the Parliament were at war with the king!” “Saint diable!” muttered the cornet at my elbow—“had yon grumbler been in the fire of the lines at Charenton, he would not deem such an acknowledgment a matter of much import!” “You are right, sir,” I replied; “but I can read his eminence the coadjutor's handiwork in that reply: believe me, somewhat more is meant than these same words betoken!—But our duty is at an end, monseigneur, is it not?” I continued, turning to the herald; and receiving his assent, gave orders to my men to march—being further informed by the guards upon the half-moon which had been recently erected in front of the gates, that if we should be found within the lines after another hour, we should be dealt upon as spies, according to the laws of war. I feared that, as far as my own projects were concerned, my mission would this time result in nothing; but I clearly saw that the refusal to admit the herald was a mere manœuvre of the wily De Retz, who, scandalously in defiance of his sacred character, was at this period the sole fomenter of a war with which all other parties had been long ago disgusted. Nothing, however, remained but to hurry homeward as fast as possible, leaving all future negotiations to the will of our superiors. When we had ridden some three miles towards St. Germains, we again met the same regiment of cavalry; but, to my surprise, De Chateaufort and a single troop of regulars, besides the party of servants with baggage-horses, whom I had noticed in the rear, were absent. This time we passed each other in silence, and, as it seemed to me, with some of that good feeling which ever arises between enemies from the knowledge of each other's strength and valour. As soon as we were clear of their rear I gave the word to increase the speed of our motion, and we advanced at the gallop till we had attained and risen over the brow of the hill which I had indicated to old Lydford. Barely had we shown ourselves above the ridge ere he crept out of the brushwood, leading his horse by the bridle-rein. I dropped into the rear, to converse with him freely, giving orders to my subaltern to advance steadily, with a promise that I would overtake him ere he should have gone a mile. “Now, Lydford,” I cried, “'twas he! Didst mark him?—Didst hear aught of their words—or mark which route they took?” “I did, I did—but hist! till yonder loiterers have passed! This have I learned from the whispers of those scoundrel servants in the rear, when they thoughtnone heard their villain conversation:—The dwelling of De Chateaufort lies somewhere east of Bar le Duc, upon the river Blaise; they set forth thence some two weeks since, and brought a lady in their train.” “Ha! By St. George, but this is news well worth the gaining! Didst gather from their words if she be yet in Paris?” “They brought her not to Paris,” he replied; “they sent her, ere they reached the barriers, to some place in or nigh the Spanish Netherlands, I reckon, by their words—but where I learned not, for they spoke low, and I am far from perfect, as you know, in their accursed gibberish!” “Good! good!” I cried, clapping my hands in ecstasy; “you have preserved me once again, old man; you are my better angel! But whither,” I continued—“whither rode De Chateaufort? We met the soldiers, as it seemed, returning, and he is not among them!” “They hold themselves, I doubt not, proper men, and marvellous crafty,” was the old forester's reply; “but they must have more wiles than e'er a fox in the West Riding, an they can cheat old Martin! See you that tall ash-tree in the centre of the coppice?—from its summit I saw their motions as clearly as I see the features of your face! The march of the cavalry was but a blind. I watched them as they filed along that sandy lane, by the white cottage yonder, and by the vineyards. All the rustics whom they met they carried forward with them, till they were all concealed in that dark mass of woodland. There I lost them; but ere an hour had flown, I saw a party with led horses cross an avenue or alley in the forest, riding in the direction of Epinay. Once having caught the clew, I kept casting my eye forward to whatever breaks I might discover in the woodlands, and I saw the same party cross four different carrèfours, and at last emerge into the open country—there, far away to the north-west, they forded a large stream in a valley lying beyond that ridge of hillocks, still marching steadily in one direction. Scarcely had I lost sight of them, before I heard the sound of trumpets, and beheld the rest of the cavalry come out of their hiding-place; which they had kept, I doubt not, till such time as would give their comrades a fair start. You might have noticed, sir, that they rode in looser order, and by subdivisions of troops, the number of intervals in their line of march being the same as when we met them first— past question, to conceal the alteration of their numbers; the officer, too, who led them, had exchanged casque and scarf with that De Chateaufort.” “By heavens, he had!” I shouted, as the recollection flashed like a ray of inspiration on my mind; “but we will mar their plottings! Hark! —you know already how great is my stake in this matter!—It is a mighty risk that I would ask of you; and certain death if you should be discovered! Nevertheless, your stratagems are such, your wiliness so great, I should not fear for you in even greater perils! Speak—will you aid me in this matter?” “Will I—will I aid you?—obey—you should have said—obey you to the very death!” “Loosen your badge, then, from your arm, and throw the buckler far into that thick underwood. Here, take my pistols; they are better, far better than your own. Is that my petronel that hangs across your shoulders? Right, right! I am glad of it! And now change horses with me. This is the gift of Condé; but he will pardon me the use I make of it. You must be mounted well, or my scheme goes for naught! Take my purse, too: would it were better furnished. And now attend my words with all your senses! De Chateaufort hath set out, beyond all question, upon some secret mission—secret and dangerous! Secret— for it is evident that he hath wasted much time and pains in order to conceal its mere direction! Dangerous—for we know the man! You must pursue him. Hang upon his traces as our own north country blood-hounds cling to the scent left by the wounded deer! You must discover the point for which he journeys; and, if it be possible, the very place wherein that lady of whom you heard them speak is now confined! My own conviction is, that he journeys on a mission to Turenne; and that my wife—remember that, my wife, old man—is captive in some fortress or some convent nigh to the frontiers of the Pays Bas! But tarry not for over-close information. The moment you have learned his destination, return to me, with all the diligence of man and horse, here to St. Germains; and, above all things, be secret, and be careful of your proper safety! Heaven knows, if thou wert sped I might long lack a friend like thee! Farewell! farewell!” I turned hastily from him to conceal the emotion which I could not repress, on parting thus from one who had followed me with the fidelity of a dog, who had loved me with a love surpassing that of woman! Ere I had ridden ten paces he called after me. “Tarry a moment, Master Harry,” he said; “over-haste at starting brings but a blown horse to the winning-post. He that would ride far and fast must ever ride warily! These fellows I must follow by the slot,[2] [2] A faculty not very dissimilar to that possessed by our own Indians is repeatedly mentioned as belonging to the Scottish and Northumbrian borderers, who, engaged in constant feuds and forays, were wont like them to follow the trail, or slot, as they called it, of their enemies for scores of miles across morass and moorland. To such perfection was this almost instinctive science carried, that an acute borderer would at once pronounce the names of every freebooter in a party of many horsemen, by an inspection of the hoof-tracks on the soil they had ridden over. I trow, as I was wont to hunt the Scottish thieves upon our VOL. II.—F northern borders in my boyhood; and I must be certain of their track at starting!” I looked back, before I turned my horse's head, and observed the old forester poring intently over the hoof-marks left on the soft surface, wherever the frost had yielded to the mildness of the air. “Here are many tracks, easy enough to follow, and right good to know again, an I could but tell which were his! Here, now, is one—it must have been made by the horse of an officer, for it is the print of a thoroughbred, and it is somewhat away from the line of march.” “Hath it a bar-shoe?” I cried, well remembering the Andalusian jennet which my foeman had invariably ridden, or employed in mounting others for desperate service; and which, though not perfectly certain of the fact, I fancied he had bestridden in the morning when we met—“hath it a bar-shoe before?” “On the near foot!” was the prompt reply. “'Tis a sweet track to follow: I would it might be his. I hunted out a duller mark than this, ere I was sixteen, from Hexham upon Tyne far into Eskdale—and brought back the booty!” “Be easy, then, old man! That is the track of Chateaufort himself! I have good cause to know it!” “Then, before three days have passed, you shall know more of it!” he cried, cheerily, as he sprang upon the horse he had heretofore held by the rein —“ere three days are past you shall know all of it; or call me no true man, but an old knave and braggart!” He waved his hand, and, spurring his horse smartly, galloped forward on the route taken by the cavalry three hours before; and, before I had rejoined my company, was concealed from my observation by the dense woodlands. On reaching head-quarters, I found that although my embassy had produced little advantage to myself, the court were not wholly dissatisfied with its result as concerned themselves. Their object was to bring on a negotiation; and this, they doubted not, would be accomplished: nor were they, indeed, far wrong; for on the ensuing morning an embassy arrived from the parliament, composed of the leading lawyers of the day—men of learning, equalled only by their perfect integrity and fervent patriotism. Among these were the President de Mêsme, De Nesmond, and Coignieux, with the Advocate-general Talon—than whom, I well believe, no truer men or better counsellors ever conducted the policy of a great nation. These men had embarked, heart and soul, in the rebellion of the Fronde, with the sole view of curbing the inordinate power of the monarch, of repressing the insolence of a hated minister, and of establishing constitutional liberty on the most righteous and permanent foundation! They had learned, however, during the contest, that their partisans, their generals, and, above all, the principal mover of the whole sedition, the Archbishop coadjutor of Paris, cared not a dénier for the liberty of the people, for the common weal, or, in short, for any of the principles which they affected to avow; but that, having merely handled these as weapons to cut out their own paths of personal ambition, they were on the point of embroiling the country in a war with Spain, and of entailing on it the immediate horrors of a foreign conquest, and, perhaps, the lasting misery of a foreign sway, rather than submit to the destruction of their own schemes for individual advancement. The negotiations which followed, and which lasted for several days in succession, were conducted solely by Condé and the Duke of Orleans, —the deputies refusing to treat, personally, with Mazarin; against whom they, as leaders of the parliament, had not long before issued an arrêt. These princes, being well aware of the miserable state of the metropolis—perceiving that the grand rebellion was already splitting itself into factions, and thence arguing that it was about to be dissolved at once, insisted upon hard conditions. Too hard, the deputies insisted, to be endured! They were one day dismissed; and were already mounting their horses to depart, when I heard Orléans whisper to the prince—they had walked out together to do honour to the deputies,— “My good cousin, if these folks protract the business to the spring time, they will unite with the archduke; and then, believe me, it will be our turn to humble ourselves! Let not pass this present occasion, or, trust me, you will rue it. Let us have peace at once. All good men, of all parties, must desire it!” The deputies were recalled; articles prepared; and they at length set forth for Paris, confidently promising to return on the succeeding morning to sign them, and to conclude a permanent peace. On that same evening, as I was returning to my quarters, somewhat downcast in spirit, and judging, by the length of time elapsed, that some evil had befallen Martin Lydford, I found the sentry, who had been just relieved, with a man who had ridden up to the lines inquiring for me; and whom, being ignorant of the pass-word, they had sent in with a guard. F 2 It was not, indeed, easy to recognise the person of my old gray-headed vassal in the figure who stood before me; but it was, nevertheless, he! He had cut short his long gray locks, and tinged them, as well as his eyebrows and mustache, with some dark mixture which he had procured at the first town he had passed on his route. He had got rid of his trim livery of forest-green and his velvet bonnet, wearing a coarse leathern doublet and slouched Flemish hat; nay, he had contrived to disfigure the very horse he rode, by platting his long mane, tying up his tail into a short thick club, and actually colouring him with patches of some white trash or other, which, unless on an unusually close inspection, gave him the appearance of a piebald! Procuring his release on the instant, I led him to my chamber; and found that, if not wholly successful, he had, nevertheless, performed his duty with his wonted activity and circumspection. He had dogged De Chateaufort and his party for two days, at a prudent distance; and found, as I had anticipated, that they continued to journey in a north-easterly direction, and nearly in the direction of Turenne's head-quarters. Tired, however, of this slow progress, he had disguised himself and his horse, and had actually mingled with the inferiors of the party, as they sat at their evening potations around the fire of a village hostelry. Here he had learned that their destination was, indeed, the camp of Turenne; and that from thence they were to proceed to Valenciennes; but wherefore, he had not been able to ascertain. On the following morning, he had attempted to join their line of march; but, having by some means excited their suspicions, they had attempted to detain him, whereupon he had taken to the woods; and, in the running fight which followed, shot down three of his pursuers; and, finally, made good his escape! This was the amount of his intelligence; but this was something. Furthermore, he positively asserted, that, though they had become distrustful of him, it evidently was as of a spy to some of the freebooting bands which were ever on the rove about the frontiers, and not as of an emissary from the camp! Immediately, on receiving this intelligence, I hurried to the presence of Condé, and informed him of all that had occurred; adding my own surmises, that Chateaufort had been sent with orders to persuade Turenne to march on Paris without delay; and that his intended progress to Valenciennes must, of necessity, relate to Isabel! “Ha!” he cried, as I concluded my narration; “must I ever be in your debt, Monsieur de Mornington? but never heed it! the time will come when I may well repay them. I will not conceal it from you that these news are of vast import. We have to-night advices that the generals have withdrawn with some ten thousand men from Paris, and have taken a most strong position over against Charenton, on the point between the Seine and Marne— a position from which, Heaven knows, we have not men enough to drive them—with a declared intention of maintaining themselves there until the archduke and Turenne—upon whose movements, though as yet unavowed, they seem to reckon—shall join them with succour. Chateaufort has doubtless gone, as you conjecture, to hurry him even now; and if this junction be effected, not the royal cause only, but France herself is lost; and this, too, through the base ambition of a priest!—a minister of peace! Out! out upon him! I must straight to Mazarin! To-morrow, sir, you shall hear more from me; and it shall go hard with Louis de Bourbon, if, out of this, he work not something that shall profit Henri de Mornington!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. K. John. Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.— Oh, let me have no subject enemies, When adverse foreigners affright my towns, With dreadful pomp of stout invasion! Bast. The spirit of the times shall teach me speed. King John. On the succeeding morning—while I was yet lingering over my solitary breakfast, and playing with old Hector, whom I had, in every interval of leisure, been training with the greatest assiduity to recognise and take note of the recovered glove of Isabel, in the hope that his sagacity might at some time aid me in the recovery of the precious owner —the trampling of horses without called me to the window. Not a little to my surprise, it was caused by the party of the deputies, who had already returned from Paris. They must have set off before it was well daylight, for the sun was not yet two hours high, and they had accomplished the full distance of twenty miles at a pace unusually rapid for men of peace and civilians, as was apparent from their soiled habiliments, and from the foam and sweat with which their panting steeds were liberally besmeared. If I was surprised at their arrival, much more was I astonished at receiving a message from one of the royal chamberlains, that my presence was required by his Eminence of Mazarin immediately after the conference with the deputies; and further, that I should do well to hold myself in instant readiness for a journey of distance and duration. Dressing myself at once, with as much attention to decoration as my war-worn and weather-beaten wardrobe would allow. I hurried to St. Germains; was immediately admitted by the Swiss guards on duty; and ushered through a succession of vast halls—imperfectly furnished, and evidently taxed to the uttermost for the accommodation of the various personages of the court—into the anteroom of the council-chamber; in which, as I could easily hear without indeed wishing to do so, an eager and excited debate was in progress on the question of peace. They at length—as I conjectured by the rustling of their feet as they arose, and by the sound of their steps approaching the door—concluded the business, when I caught the words of the President de Mêsme, pronounced clearly and as if in continuation of what he had before been saying. He must have been close to the folding-doors when speaking; for I, who was standing at the farther end of the antechamber in whispered conversation with an officer of the Swiss guards, heard every syllable, as accurately as though it had been addressed to myself. “Since, then,” he said, “such is the position of affairs, we must personally be sacrificed that the state may be preserved! We must sign to this peace! For, after the restrictions laid upon us by the Parliament last night, there is no other measure left us: perchance we shall ourselves be recalled to-morrow! We will therefore hazard all! If we are discovered, they will exclude us from the gates of Paris; or, admitting us, will question our powers—will deal on us as traitors. It is for you, therefore, to give to us conditions which may justify our conduct! It is your interest to do so! If they be reasonable, we can sustain our policy against the base and factious! if they be not—it is no matter! Be they what they may, I will sign all and any thing; and I will say to the first president, such is my opinion—such the sole expedient for the safety of the realm! If he agree with us, we shall have peace! If not—still we shall have weakened the faction; and the evil will be on ourselves, and on ourselves alone!” These noble sentiments called forth a proper answer. The subdued hum of applause and approbation reached my ears, and then the clear, high voice of Condé— “We thank you, Mr. President—we thank you for his majesty; and, which is of less importance, for ourselves also! You may add to your noble declaration to the first president thus much from Louis de Bourbon—that the conditions shall be such as one good and brave man may proffer, and another may receive, in confidence and honour!—Else will they not bear the seal and signature of Condé. Gentlemen, adieu—we hope that to-morrow we shall see you here, or at Ruel, with full powers to conclude!” The doors were immediately thrown open—the guards stood to their arms, and saluted as the princes entered—the deputies passed onward, Condé remaining on the threshold of the council-chamber, and bowing deeply, his right hand laid upon his heart, as the presidents made their salutations as if to the monarch in person. His quick eye glanced round the apartment, as if in search of some one, and caught mine—he nodded familiarly. “Ha! ever at your post, sir—come with me. His eminence awaits you!” Then, in a lower voice, as I approached his elbow, he continued—“Falter not in his presence—he is well inclined towards you even now, though he may affect hauteur—falter not, therefore; speak boldly and frankly as is your wont! Crafty himself, and subtle beyond even Italian wiliness, he yet can prize and honour frankness! But naught of yourself or of HER—naught —as you value both or either!” He led me through the council-chamber to another anteroom, in which there were a couple of monks, occupied in writing at a central table covered with documents and books, and a delicate pale boy, with a timid look and bashful demeanour, widely different from the usual forwardness of court pages. “Here I must leave you!” he said; “and you— Remember!” I gave my name to the page, and was introduced at the next moment to the presence of the fearful man who wielded by dark intrigues the destinies of kingdoms, and warped the will of princes at his pleasure. It was a small but pleasant apartment—the walls being hung with crimson velvet, and decorated with the finest pictures by the choicest masters— my unpractised eye at once fell on a score of VOL. I.—G which even I could recognise the authors. The rich gorgeousness and flowing groups of Rubens —the stately forms and rich tinting of Vandyck— the heavenly female shapes, and most natural flesh-hues of Titian—the exquisite madonnas of Raphael and Carlo Dolci, were mingled with battle and hunting pieces, alive in all the truth and spirit of Wouvermans; with drinking-bouts and Flemish boors by Teniers and Ostadt; and last, not least, with the black shadows and the brilliant lights of Rembrandt. These pictures—dearer to the cardinal than his life, or even his power—in the hurry of the court's departure from Paris, he had caused to be removed with the nicest care; and his first task, on reaching St. Germains, was to see them tastefully disposed upon the walls of this his new apartment. My attention was not directed to these for a second's space, nor even to the monkeys—another of the minister's strange, yet ruling fancies—of which at least a dozen, from the huge baboon of Pondicherry to the smallest and most delicate species from Brazil, or the southern provinces, were gibbering and quarrelling, or playing with each other about the floor and tables, clambering over the backs of the chairs, soiling the rich furniture, and offering hideous foils to the noble works of statuary and painting with which every nook and angle of the chamber was filled. The cardinal himself, a fair slight man, of courteous address, and almost hypocritic affability, with a set of smiling and inexpressive though chiselled lineaments, of which a bright eye was the sole redeeming feature, sat in a chair of crimson damask, contemplating, with an air of satisfaction, his darling pictures, and sipping at times some of the fragrant chocolate—at that period a newly discovered luxury—which stood at his side, in a beautiful equipage of antique silver; or at times caressing with his hand, and pampering with dainties from the salver, a tiny ring-tailed lemur, of the rarest kind, which was perched on the elbow of his chair, and which, if too long neglected, would slap his arm with its diminutive hand, and look up into his face with a strange mixture of malice and affection. Monsieur le Tellier, the friend and trusted confidant of the minister, was writing at a cabinet of tortoise-shell, rich with buhl and marquetry, his back towards me as I entered, nor did he move his head or alter his position in the least degree while I remained there. “Monsieur de Mornington, I believe?” asked the minister, with his simpering smile of condescension. “At the service of your Eminence!” I replied, with a profound obeisance. “So we are told, sir—so we are told! ever at our service! His highness of Condé gave us last night some information of your obtaining, which would have been most valuable—mark me, sir— would have been—had we not been quite aware of the destination of this emissary two days before.” This, by way of parenthesis, I knew to be utterly false, no idea having been entertained of the matter till I had spoken of it to the prince; but I was careful not to shock the minister's vanity, and answered only by an assenting bow. “This, however,” he continued, “is no detraction from your merit, as you, of course, were ignorant of our information; moreover, your tidings were confirmatory of what we before knew, as they have been since confirmed by the presidents of the Parliament! Also, we are informed that you distinguished yourself at Charenton; and we are, of our own knowledge, aware of your good conduct in the secret expedition to which you were in the first place appointed! Answer me not,” he continued, seeing me about to speak—“I know well what you would say—these things are but of little moment; and so indeed they are, considered of themselves—but we are rather fain to hold them earnests of what you shall do hereafter! Now, Monsieur Mornington—that is, I fancy, your title —we are disposed to further you in your profession! You will doubtless marvel at our favours, but you will remember, that though lavished, perhaps too freely, upon one whom men might call roturier and adventurer—” “'Fore God! your Eminence,” I broke in, with show of real indignation,—“'fore God, you may call me aught it lists you, but did a man with a beard, and without the tonsure, so presume to style me, I would thrust my rapier through his body, were he my own father's son!” I was, perhaps, imprudent in not restraining this outbreak of my naturally reckless temper, but this time it served my turn; showing me at how large a value the cardinal must hold my services, that he should brook so sharp a retort from one so far beneath him. His brow contracted, and his pale cheek was flushed for a moment, but a smile chased away both flush and frown, as he replied, not unkindly— “You are warm, young sir—warm and hasty! but we like you not altogether the worse for that. We will resume our subject. Monsieur Turenne has, you perceive, consented to march and join the Frondeurs; and the archduke has already, as we G 2 are strenuously advised, advanced wellnigh to Rheims. This may be troublesome! Now, sir— you can be silent, and are not over-scrupulous?” “Silent as the grave—in your Eminence's service; and how should a poor soldier, like myself, be scrupulous of executing aught, which a learned and holy churchman may deem it right to order.” “Well, sir,” he continued, “we will be brief. This Turenne is one of those wrong-headed idiots who stickle for conscience—as though soldiers had aught to do with conscience! Were he a man of sense, himself would I convince; and that, too, with most cogent reasons. But he is of invincible obstinacy—which he deems, perhaps, invincible integrity—and which all wise men must hold egregious folly!” Seeing that he paused as if for a reply, I answered, fully perceiving his drift— “And in that case—if I be not overbold, to thrust my poor opinions on your Eminence—it were perhaps well to convince his soldiery.” “Right!” he exclaimed, with another smile of approbation—“right! to convince his soldiery! That is the very matter about which I would employ you. Clearly you are a youth of some discretion. To convince the soldiery! Well, sir; once more: his highness of Condé has recommended you most strongly to our notice for this very duty. It is somewhat perilous; and might, to men of squeamishness—but, bah! you are not one of these! In short, it is our will that you should go at once to the maréchal with a flag, the bearer of certain proposals from the court to the general—he has not as yet declared himself, you know—certain proposals, which we well know will effect nothing; the bearer, also, of certain letters to D'Erlach, chief of the Swiss troops, and to the Comte D'Harcourt, which may avail much; also of certain arguments to the soldiery— which, we are confident, will succeed! This done, and the troops gained over, you will send us advices, remaining yourself as second in command under the Comte D'Harcourt, who may be induced, we imagine—you comprehend us!—may be induced to assume the office of general-in-chief of Turenne's army, and, as such, to act against the archduke and him of Lorraine, on the frontiers of the Pays Bas.” With another profound inclination, I expressed my sense of the honour to which I was destined, my willingness to accept it, and my determination to effect it if mortal skill could do so. “Not so quick, monsieur!” he cried; “not so quick! You will understand, that though there be honour, and profit, and so forth in the duty, there is also not a little of peril! You will go under a false name—for I shall give it out that you are despatched elsewhere!—you will also be a spy, and, as such, answerable to the laws of war. Ma foi! Turenne would scruple little about sending a hundred such as you to the gallows on a mere suspicion! Furthermore, touching Turenne himself”—and he hesitated a little, as if willing that I should again help him out; but, not much relishing the course which the matter seemed to be taking, I remained silent; and he was obliged, however reluctantly, to speak out—“touching Turenne himself—he must be secured!—secured, and, if possible, sent in to us, at St. Germains or at Paris, where we hope to be ere then.” “Not by me!” I replied, resolutely, but at the same time deferentially—“not by me, your Eminence, though you would make me king of France for the same deed! So far as regaining the affections of the soldiery to his most sacred majesty, that shall I do right willingly; for it seems to me that Turenne hath somewhat swerved from the nice path of honour in turning them aside. In that, therefore, shall I serve your Eminence, by all means and at every hazard! But as to debasing myself so far as to bribe the soldiery, in order to consign their leader to bonds, perchance to death —that, please the Almighty, I shall never do! I am, your Eminence, neither a minister of police nor a hireling spy, but a major-general in the service of the most Christian king, and a very proud, although a very poor, gentleman of England. With deep and fervent thanks must I decline your Eminence's offers; but—otherwise than in the open field and with the sword of honest warfare—never will I act against the person of Turenne!” “You say well—well and nobly!” replied a sweet calm female voice from behind me, ere the cardinal could express the anger which I shrewdly suspect he felt. I started, and to my astonishment beheld the commanding form and beautiful pale features of Anne of Austria, the regent of the realm during the minority of Louis, thereafter styled Le Grand. “You say right well, sir,” she continued, as I sunk upon my knee before her, “and we doubt his Eminence thinks with us, howsoever he may have tried your honour and your principles, before intrusting you with an arduous and a delicate duty. We had learned from the Prince de Condé,” she said, turning to the cardinal, “that you, sir, were in conference with Monsieur Mornington; and we were on our way hither to express our satisfaction, that you should employ him on this duty; and, further, to give him our thanks, and those of our royal son, for his distinguished conduct heretofore. We were unwilling, however, to interrupt your converse; and, pausing in the corridor, heard through the tapestry your latter words. Well knowing that your Eminence would be no less loath than ourselves to harm a man so noble, and to whom France owes so much, as Maréchal Turenne—although he now unhappily have turned against us—we doubt not but you spoke darkly to prove the integrity of this true gentleman! This we should have ourselves considered needless; but we rejoice that you thought otherwise, since it has procured for us the pleasure of knowing that the sentiments of our officer are no less pure and noble than he has proved his hand to be strong and his heart fearless! Go on,” she continued, again turning to me—“go on, sir, as you have begun. Hold honour in your eye, and interest beneath your feet. Hedge not aside from the straight narrow path, though it be for never so little. Do this; and Anne of Austria tells you that fame, and wealth, and honour will follow, though you seek them not! That you will be one, whom men will delight to honour—women to love —and monarchs to retain as the brightest ornament they hold about their thrones!” A majestic smile played upon her bright intellectual features, and, though long past the flower and flush of womanhood, I thought, at the moment, that I had witnessed nothing more femininely—I had wellnigh said divinely—noble! Reverentially I bowed my lips to the hand she extended to me, and whispered as I touched it— “Such were the lessons my mother taught me in my boyhood.” “Forget them not, young sir; oh! forget them not,” she said, in a voice of considerable emotion; “and ever bless the mother who lessoned your tender years so truly and so well.” “Her grace,” said the cardinal—adapting himself, I fancy, rather to the tone of the queen's sentiments, than obeying any generous impulses of his own—“her grace has but forestalled me; nevertheless, what she has said so well, it needs not that I should mar by repetition. My language shall be deeds! Monsieur de Tellier will send the letters, of which I spoke, this evening to your quarters, with such credentials as may be needful, and with full instructions. You will start at midnight! The other necessaries have been already provided, closely stowed in the demi-piques of your escort, who will be themselves unconscious of what they carry. We doubt not but you will be successful in your present mission; and we trust that, in the further duties which present success will lay upon you, you may so comport yourself as to confirm our auspices, and to merit future recompense, and the proud gratitude of kings!” I understood myself at once to be dismissed; and, with a fresh expression of gratitude, retreating from the chamber, I hurried homeward with a lighter heart, and a fuller confidence that I should ere long clasp my lovely one to my heart, than I had felt in many a day. I could perceive the handiwork of the prince in the whole business; and, in a brief interview which I sought with him ere my departure, I hinted as much with thanks. “None of that, sir!” he said—“none of that! We had need of a good officer to perform an arduous duty, and I honestly recommended you. I know you are not a man to suffer private affections to interfere with public duty. Nevertheless, I think you are not likely to forget that it is a part of the latter to secure this De Chateaufort, if possible. He is, it seems, traitor as well as villain, having accepted a commission under my cousin of Orléans. If you succeed in gaining over the troops, send back your old esquire with the tidings. Check the archduke, if possible, and be sure you crush Lorraine. You will want cavalry; and the moment I can learn that you have thriven in your first object, I will detach two regiments at least to join you. We shall have no more fighting here this season, if you can overreach Turenne—turning his troops to account against the Spaniard; and though you be too few to cope with the archduke, he scarcely will dare march into the country with so powerful an army in his rear. D'Harcourt is, in good sooth, long since gained over. D'Erlach is likewise true—not to Turenne, but to the court. So much for promises! Money will do the rest, and money you will take with you. D'Harcourt will be the nominal commander; but, I will so order it you shall be nearly independent. These letters from me will gain you his good-will and good opinion. Adieu, sir; be fortunate, and—I need not say it—brave!” VOL. II.—H</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “We do believe thee—and beshrew my soul, But I do love the favour and the form Of this most fair occasion, by the which We will untread the steps of damned flight; And, like a bated and retired flood, Leaving our rankness and irregular course, Stoop low within those bounds we had o'erlooked, And calmly run on in obedience, Even to our ocean, to our great King John.” King John. The moon was shining coldly, and the stars twinkling in the firmament, when we got to horse. In profound silence and in secrecy we mounted; no trumpet was blown, no leave taken. The troop of picked men, which had been detailed as my escort, had marched some hours before; men and officers ignorant alike of the real purpose for which they were employed, and of their ultimate destination. Nothing remained but that I should join them at St. Denis with my own personal attendants, and press forward as fast as possible towards Landrecy; near which place, according to our last advices, Turenne was encamped with the army, which it was my object to seduce from its allegiance. At one hour after midnight I therefore sallied forth, mounted my brave Bayard, and, accompanied by my constant friend rather than follower, bearing a white flag, furled for the present closely to its staff, and leading my second charger, laden with such baggage as was indispensable to an officer of standing, rode slowly through the lines, avoiding, as much as possible, both patrol and sentry, and travelling by the roughest and most secret roads. Gradually, as we advanced beyond the farthest outposts, we quickened our pace, and, reaching the Seine at about a mile's distance above the bridge of Besons, were ferried across it by a trusty servitor of the prince, who had been stationed there to wait our arrival. The horses were too well trained to give us any annoyance, swimming peaceably across the wide river by the side of the skiff which bore their masters; but, to my utter astonishment, when we had performed about two-thirds of the distance from bank to bank, I discovered a large dark object following in the wake of the boat. For a moment I mistook it for a human being; and was on the point of whispering to Lydford that we were dogged already, when the moon, shining brightly out from a passing cloud, which had, a moment before, veiled her glories, revealed to me the real nature of the intrusion. It was old Hector; who, discovering, by that strange instinct which in some points would seem to be even superior to reason, that he was forsaken by his master, had crawled along behind our horses—prudently keeping out of sight, however—till such time as we had proceeded too far on our journey to permit of our returning, even had the matter been of greater import than the presence or absence of the best hound that ever opened on a scent. I cannot say that his pertinacity did not give me some anxiety; as the expedition on which I was employed was not likely to be much advanced by my fourfooted companion. I could not, however, find it in my heart to speak harshly to the faithful brute, as he crawled to my feet on landing, and looked up into my face as though perfectly conscious that he had transgressed, and deprecating the punishment which he probably considered due. A single cheery word, and he leaped almost to my face with a sharp shrill bark, widely different from the deep musical baying which was his wonted tone. After a few minutes' consideration as I rode along, I did not so much regret that he had followed me; for as—whatever might be the ostensible and incidental motives of the expedition—my real object was the discovery and rescue of Isabel, I could not but feel that the old hound's sagacity might, not improbably, be turned materially to profit. At a mile's distance from Genevilliers the highway passes through a little wood, in the thickest part of which there is a meeting of four roads, diverging, as nearly as possible, towards the cardinal points of the compass. Here it was that my escort had been desired to meet me, as at a point from whence we could proceed in almost any given direction, and the adoption of which could furnish no clew to the discovery of our subsequent movements; and here I found them,—the horses picketed to the trees, the petronels neatly stacked, the men wrapped in their heavy watch-cloaks, sitting or lying around a small watchfire which they had kindled in a grassy nook by the wayside, and a sentinel walking to and fro with his arquebus shouldered and the match ready lighted. I was greatly rejoiced to see by these dispositions that I had steady and intelligent men to deal with; for, having purposely omitted to bring with me any officers of higher rank than corporals and lance-speisades, or sergeants, as it is now the mode to call them, lest I should have been compelled to be more H 2 confidential than I deemed expedient, I scarcely looked for any thing beyond courage and obedience in my escort. The sentry challenged as I approached, and alert was the word; for ere I had time to answer him a dozen men were on foot, and as many pieces were thrown forward, with an air of activity that promised well in case of future need. I was not, however, by any means anxious to put their skill as marksmen to the test; but, giving them the countersign, and commending their celerity, ordered them to get under arms and to mount as speedily as possible. The men had not, it seemed, expected that I should assume the command in person, and although they were evidently a little puzzled, they were no less evidently pleased; for I had, by some means or other, I know not how, become exceedingly popular with the soldiery; and the consequence of the surprise was an unusual degree of alacrity, not only at the first, but during the whole of our march, which was not only well conducted, but extraordinarily rapid and successful. The horses had all been carefully draughted for the purpose, and were in admirable wind and condition. I doubt, indeed, whether, for their limited number, a more perfectly well-appointed troop could have been brought into action at that day in any part of Europe. The men carried nothing but their arms and the gold, of which they were entirely unconscious, secured in the hollow pommels of their demi-piques—half a dozen baggage-horses being loaded somewhat ostentatiously, in order to divert suspicion from other quarters, with a few spare stand of arms, a small quantity of ammunition, and an abundant supply of clothing and provisions. During the three succeeding days we travelled onward at a uniform and easy pace, avoiding the larger towns—as the districts through which we passed, though not occupied by large forces of regulars, were known to be disinclined to the royal cause—and, for the most part, halting for refreshment, and even bivouacking for the night, in unfrequented places—forest glades, or solitary commons, far from any human habitation. On the fourth morning, when in the neighbourhood of St. Quentin, we found frequent evidences of the recent passage of an army, in deserted hamlets, cottages, and, in one or two instances, even defensible chateaux reduced to ashes, cattle and horses lying dead by the wayside, and, more than all, by the state of the roads themselves, rutted and rendered almost impassable by the motion, as I instantly perceived, of heavy ordnance. From a peasant, whom I contrived to capture notwithstanding his violent exertions to effect an escape, I learned that the archduke had crossed the country on the preceding week in the direction of Rheims; near which place the man conjectured he must at this time be posted, unless he had already advanced upon the capital. The Spanish soldiery, he said, had committed the most out-rageous cruelties on the unoffending peasantry wherever they passed; and I judged, from his manner, that the effect of this had been to bring the party of the Fronde into some disrepute in these districts. I learned, moreover, that a party, about equal to my own in numbers, though far superior in bravery and show—which I concluded to be that of De Chateaufort—had passed by the same route two days before. Finding that I could gain no further information from the man, who was both terrified and stupid, I dismissed him with a small present, and an assurance that the object of my mission was to take instant order with the Spaniards, and to protect the country effectually from foreign invaders and from domestic enemies. The same evening we fell in with the outposts of Turenne's army, which had marched nearly twenty miles from Landrecy in the direction of the capital, and was now encamped for the night near the little village of Landernat. As my good fortune would have it, the picket to which I sent my trumpet consisted of a party of Switzers attached to the division of D'Erlach, who was captain of the watch for the night, and to whom I was accordingly passed in with my men, after a short examination by the subaltern in command. This gave me an opportunity of delivering a secret despatch to him, even before my introduction to the marechal; and, although he hastily thrust it unread into the bosom of his doublet, I saw plainly that he understood and was prepared to act upon its contents. No words, however, passed between us, nor indeed was there at that moment any opportunity; for my men being placed under strict surveillance, and the baggage-horses having been rigorously examined, I was at once conducted to the pavilion of Turenne. It was already dark when I reached his quarters, but the encampment was brilliantly illuminated, and the men seemed to be in a restless and uneasy mood. There was no gaming, no carousing, and—though a forced march had been made that day—no sleeping. The Switzers, I observed especially, were conversing together earnestly in small knots of ten or twelve, with knit brows and stern murmuring voices; while the yet more numerous troops of Weimar seemed to be brooding sulkily over some real or imaginary wrong. I had not much time wherein to observe all this; for D'Erlach, clearly to save appearances, hurried me swiftly and almost rudely forward; openly avowing his opinion, that I was no flag, but an accursed spy! A council of war was in session when we reached the general's tent, as I could easily hear through the canvass-walls; for D'Erlach, though he cautioned the two sentinels who accompanied me to look well to the prisoner, placed me as if inadvertently within earshot, while he entered to announce my arrival. “March—march!” The words were uttered in an impatient tone, which I at once conceived to be that of Turenne. “It is easy enough, methinks, to urge me thus; but why, in the name of God, why do they withhold the means? Bouillon knows well enough my situation; knows that I have not wherewithal to pay these fellows at the rate of two sous Parisis: and he continues urging me as though naught but the will were wanting! I tell you, sir, that I have neither money, food, nor clothing for my men; and the knaves crying `Gelt! gelt!' in their high Dutch, whenever I go the rounds, or show my face to my own regiments! You must back, sir, at once, and tell them so.” “Under your favour, no,” was the reply; and the voice was that of Chateaufort. “My orders are most special on that head from Monsieur D'Elbœuf and the Prince de Conti. I must to Valenciennes to the Duke of Lorraine. I am the bearer to him, likewise, of a most pressing requisition—” “To march, doubtless!” Turenne interrupted him shortly. “Also, I have some private matters of my own which call me thither,” continued the other, as if unconscious of the maréchal's brusquerie! “To the foul fiend with your own matters!” cried Turenne again, almost fiercely; “what reck I of them! Ha! D'Erlach—what, is it you, man? speak! Aught from thy Switzers? How act the men of Weimar?” I did not catch the words of D'Erlach, for he spoke low; but I easily conjectured their import from the answer. “A messenger from Mazarin! A spy!—ha!— like enough—like enough—admit him notwithstanding. And you, Monsieur de Chateaufort, you may withdraw; best that this spy, if so he be, of Mazarin, know not of your arrival!” I was immediately ushered into the tent, wherein were assembled nearly a dozen officers of rank; among whom I instantly recognised the Comte D'Harcourt, by the quick glances interchanged between him and my conductor. Turenne was the plainest, but at the same time the noblest, looking man of the group; for though by no means handsome, he was admirably well-proportioned; and there was an air of native worth and inflexible integrity in his features, that to my eye was a thousand times more attractive than lineaments, which might have afforded a model to the chisel of Praxiteles. He was evidently suspicious of my object; but he nevertheless treated me with all due courtesy. He read the letters of Mazarin and Condé with a supercilious smile; and handing them to the other members of the council, observed, quietly, that they were too direct to merit credence from such a minister. “Nor,” he continued, “do they in truth require an answer; though I shall furnish you with such at daybreak, when you will quit our camp at once. It may be, sir, that you have no such motives as we must impute to all the agents of the cardinal; if so, you will pardon us, or rather you will know how to impute our conduct to the rules of war! You must consider yourself, sir, as under arrest. My friend D'Erlach will accommodate you in his quarters; and will save me the regret, and you the inconvenience, we should feel, were I compelled to place you under ward! You will be ready to depart at daybreak!” “You are correct in all things, maréchal,” I answered; “nor am I so young a soldier as to question your prerogative to act as you propose; though with regard to his eminence the cardinal—” “He, sir, is your employer, and we are his opponents; and therefore further words—I pray you pardon my abruptness—further words can answer no good end. I wish you pleasant dreams!” He bowed haughtily as he spoke; and though I could have wished for a longer space, seeing that it was hopeless, I obeyed his signal and withdrew! D'Erlach took me by the arm, as we left the pavilion, and conducted me in perfect silence to his quarters! “Send Winkelbach to me forthwith,” he said to the sentinel on guard, as we entered the rude tent which formed his temporary residence; “we will speak more anon,” he continued, looking intelligently towards me. Then, as his stout Swiss lieutenant entered, clad in half-armour, with a spontoon in his hand, as an officer on duty—“Winkelbach,” he said, “we would be VOL. II.—I private: set me two trusty men—just out of ear-shot—on the watch, and let them challenge loudly whosoever may approach—loudly! You comprehend me? And whisper to the Comte D'Harcourt, as he retires for the night, that I would speak with him. And till he come, sir, we can confer together. I have found time to look through that epistle, and have found in it good store of promises—promises only. Now, I will not deny that our men mislike this service; that they might be wrought to action, I well believe; but of this be certain, without the gold they will not stir a foot's length in the matter. Now, sir, we must come to the point sooner or later; if you have brought the gold, we can and will effect this thing, short as is now the time; if not, your plans are naught!” “Colonel D'Erlach,” was my reply—“such is, I believe, your rank—I have the means. Let me but have your written pledge to action, and I will discover them. I bear also—with the power to produce and use them, if the army can be won— a promise of a maréchal's bâton for the Comte D'Harcourt, and a major-general's commission for Colonel D'Erlach!” “You are too prudent, sir—too prudent altogether; but here comes D'Harcourt.” The conversation was retailed to the new comer; and, after a brief consultation, each gave me his signature to papers committing them completely with Turenne, if they should strive to play me false, and I delivered the commissions, duly signed by the hand of Louis himself, which had been concealed in the barrels of my pistols. D'Harcourt was apprized of the situation of the gold, and went out himself to superintend its present distribution. In about an hour's space he returned. “All works,” he cried, with a smile of exultation, “as we would wish it! The officers have, to a man, come in to the conspiracy; the privates are half-gained already. I have promised to them present payment of all claims due to them by Turenne, and a future bounty of one livre Parisis per man, if they shall assume the royal colours at the dawn. A present largesse I have distributed throughout the ranks in wine and eau de vie; and that, an I am not deceived, will close the matter. For you—go forth at daybreak as though to quit the lines. 'Tis like, when they shall see the royal standard hoisted, you will be straight arrested; resist the officers who shall attempt to seize you, and we will be near you!” “Hold!” I interrupted him—“hold, sir. I fear you have done rashly in giving the men liquor. St. George!—I fear it shrewdly. We shall have wild doings, an we look not the sharper. Having gone thus far, it will not do to sleep on it; trust me, a counsel, once known to so many, can by no means continue unsuspected; the news must reach Turenne, and we shall be seized privately and in detail. Hark to that distant tumult: 'fore God! they are at it even now!” As I spoke I seized my weapons, grasped the pistols, which I had re-loaded after delivering the papers they had contained, and brought the hilt of my rapier forward, to be ready to my hand in time of need. “Hark ye!” I cried, “messires; there may be treachery in this! Now, mark me—alive will I not be taken, to die the death of a dog upon the gibbet; and, further, I never miss my aim! Now should I see the slightest sign—I say not of treason, but of doubt or wavering—I will not threaten; but—you see that I have arms!—Nay, gentlemen, reply not. In times of strict emergency men may not dally to cull forth holyday-phrases. Take up your weapons; go with me to the men; at once I will address them—and leave the rest to fortune!” “Not so quick, gentlemen—not so quick,” a stern voice broke in upon us from the entry of the tent, and De Chateaufort strode in with his sword drawn in his hand, and followed by six or seven gentlemen, whom I knew for personal friends of the maréchal. To these, in lack of other trusty agents, he had assigned the duty of arresting us. “Monsieur de Mornington,” he continued, with an exulting sneer, “you are a spy—a villain!—flags protect not such! Gentlemen, close up! D'Erlach and D'Harcourt—your swords! Resistance is in vain! The charge is treason!” “Villain in your teeth!” I shouted. “Liar and slave!—thrice have you 'scaped me—but, by God and by St. George, you cross me not again!” And I lunged with my drawn rapier full at his breast. It was well for him that he wore beneath his doublet a segrette of twisted mail; for, despite a weak and ill-directed parry, my thrust took full effect; and so great was its violence, that, although unwounded, he fell headlong to the earth, as one thunder-stricken—I thought him slain. Three or four blows were made at me by his comrades, but I eluded them by a swift spring to the side; and, striking the canvass wall of the tent with the point of my sword, I split it from the ceiling to the earth, rushed through the opening, and shouted at top of my powerful voice—“France! France for the king and Mazarin!” I 2 In a moment I heard the cry repeated by the lips of Lydford; and then from the whole of my little troop—cheerily it rang and high—“France! France for Mazarin!” While the echoes were yet lingering in the air, D'Erlach stood beside me; and D'Harcourt, following slowly, held in check the pursuers with his single blade! They were both true! The former raised his bugle to his mouth, and wound a long, sharp blast. “Unterwald!” he shouted, “Unterwald and Uri for the king and Mazarin!” The effect was like the application of a linstock to the ordnance, that was before but a dark and silent tube, useless, and void of terror! With a wild yell, the Switzers rushed to their arms— torches were waved aloft—the brandished partisans flashed in the ruddy glare—the discordant horns of the wild mountaineers blended their notes with the tumult! Muskets were discharged, startling the echoes of many a midnight hill; and ever and anon the war-cry pealed—“France! France and Switzerland for Mazarin!” Our success was perfect; of twelve thousand who were encamped around us, there were not as many hundreds faithful to the Fronde, or even wavering in their allegiance. The blow had been stricken while the metal was at the hottest to receive its impression; and the result was a total and bloodless victory! For a moment, indeed, I feared that the fierce passions of the men, stimulated almost to phrensy by the added excitement of liquor, would have defied control. There was a rush to the quarters of Turenne, accompanied by oaths and execrations, blended with the wildest threats of vengeance! Torches had been hurled to and fro, and half a dozen tents were already in a light blaze; but the officers opposed themselves undauntedly to the torrent—striking at the mutineers with the shafts of their halberts, and menacing them with the broad blades. D'Erlach, well seconded by his huge lieutenant, hurried through the ranks, exhorting— threatening—and screaming at the soldiers in his Teutonic jargon. D'Harcourt brought up his steadier and more phlegmatic men of Weimar, and, throwing them between the Switzers and the burning tents, extinguished the flames briefly and effectually. Still I saw, at a glance, that D'Erlach had but partially succeeded, and I ran forward, forgetful for the moment of De Chateaufort—dead or alive I scarce knew whether—to lend him my assistance. At the very moment when we had brought the fellows to reason, and convinced them that there were no enemies on whom to waste their ardour, a distant shout arose from the pavilion of the maréchal, followed by a dozen pistol-shots, and the quick clash of steel! “D'Erlach,” I shouted, “cut down, or shoot the dog who quits the ranks—I go to save Turenne!” And I darted rapidly forward, followed by old Lydford, and a dozen of my troopers, who had resumed their arms on the first outbreaking of the mutiny, and had since done good service in seconding their officers. Not a man of the Switzers moved; their wonted discipline was restored; and the violence, into which their passions had so suddenly been stimulated, subsided, almost as rapidly as it had commenced, into their usual grave and self-restrained demeanour. It was but a moment ere I reached the tent of the maréchal, yet was I scarce in time; another second, and the career of the great captain had been ended in a base broil, and the fair escutcheon of my fathers had received a blot, that not the blood of ten pitched battles conquered could have erased. Turenne, with the gentlemen who had fled to him after their vain attempt at our arrest, had stood to his arms, and fought with the resolution of a man who well knew that he must die or conquer. Several of their assailants lay dead, or in the agony of death, beneath their feet, while hitherto their skill or fortune had preserved them from injury. It was not possible, however, that such could be the case much longer. A dozen Alsatian arquebusiers were in the very act of blowing their matches for the purpose of giving them a volley—which must have proved fatal—when I rushed before them with my little party, and beat up their levelled pieces. One, bolder than the rest, drew his trigger, but it was in vain—for with the whole force of my arm I struck him in the face with my steel-plated gauntlet; the blood gushed from eyes, ears, and mouth; he fell stunned and senseless to the earth; and the bullet whizzed harmlessly over the head of the gallant gentleman for whom it was intended. Another of the mutineers I seized by the collar, and whirling him forcibly around, flung him into the hands of a couple of my troopers, bidding them be answerable for him with their lives, as I destined him for the gibbet on the morrow, as a mutineer and an assassin. “Finish your work, sir!” said Turenne, when he recognised me, speaking as calmly as though he were issuing orders to his own followers—“finish your noble work! it is begun bravely; and murder will well execute what treason has so admirably planned.” “I regret, though I cannot remove, your misconceptions of me,” I replied, compelling myself to be cool and unmoved, though I felt the hot blood rushing in torrents to my brow; “but I should vainly consume the time, which is most needful, were I to argue with you now! Suffice it—not for the wealth of a universe, not for a monarch's title, would I see one hair untimely severed from your head. Get you to horse, sir, if you would not peril that life to no purpose which I dare prophesy will, ere long, be needed by your country! Get you to horse, you and your friends, and not a sword shall be raised to let or hinder you! You have done all that man may do; you cannot retrieve matters, although, by the sacrifice of yourself and of these brave gentlemen, you can convert a check into a ruin that will be irreparable. I, whom you deem your enemy, I do beseech you, on my knee, to mount and ride—it lists not whither! Quick! quick, my lord! Up to this moment I have been successful. Heaven only knows what fate the next may bring to me or you!” “I will to horse,” he said, after a short pause— “I will; ay, and I will be grateful, if not just—and deem your conduct less atrocious than it seems to-night.” He turned towards his comrades in defeat—“Come, gentlemen,” he said, “this officer of Mazarin is in the right, and we must profit by his interference—for which, I trow, his saintly employer will return him but scant thanks!—To horse! to horse!” I had given Lydford his directions as we hurried to the spot, and he had obeyed them with his wonted alacrity. As Turenne spoke, some six or seven chargers were led forward. Myself—I held his stirrup as he mounted, and, with my hand upon his rein, led him along the ranks he had so lately deemed his own, till he had passed the outposts of the camp! “God speed you, sir, and send you— if it may be so—reason to doubt the justice of that ill opinion you may well have formed of Harry Mornington!” I spoke with an air of earnest yet proud humility, uncovering my head in respect to the character and talents of him I addressed, and was but little astonished at his reply. “By Heaven! it were base in me to hold it, had I formed such an opinion as you mention. Henceforth I will think of you as of one—” “Think of me not at all,” I interrupted him— “think of me not all, unless you can think of me nobly! Ride now, my lord, ride for your life!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. What, 'scaped again—again to work me wo?— Now, by my father's soul! you deadly plotter Will give his scheming brains no holyday, Nor halt—nor swerve—in his unholy purpose, Till the one arbiter—the mortal sword— Shall end his mischiefs and his life together. The Ulysses. On the morning which succeeded the revolt of the Switzers, and the consequent flight of Turenne, I despatched, according to promise, old Martin to the minister and prince, with advices of the happy result of my mission, accompanied by most pressing requisitions for cavalry, an arm of which we were entirely destitute, while, for the species of warfare in which we were about to engage, it was as entirely indispensable. I doubted not that the mutiny of the army would already be widely spread throughout the country, and that, in consequence, there would be but little fear of interruption or peril to my messenger; I therefore took a bold step, and furnished him, on my own responsibility, with powers to press whatever horses might be necessary for his rapid progress into service as a royal courier. In acting thus, however, I was instigated mainly by my knowledge of the extreme discretion of my agent, and by my anxiety to receive the succour which was so highly important to all my future views. After preparing the papers, and seeing my messenger depart on his journey, I passed to the quarters of the Comte d'Harcourt; who had, by virtue of the commissions brought by myself, assumed the chief command after the flight of Turenne and his staff. On entering the pavilion, in which, on the preceding night, I had found myself in so different a presence, I heard a loud and earnest conversation between the commander-in-chief and D'Erlach, who was, besides myself, the only general officer with the army, and of consequence third in command. The latter immediately addressed me— “I am right glad to see you, General Mornington—right glad to see you! We were debating, even now, on the propriety of our first movements; and, I regret to say, there is a difference of opinion already between the commander and myself. I flatter myself, however, that we shall be able to VOL. II.—K convince him of the inexpediency of laying siege to Cambrai!” “Of laying siege to Cambrai!” I exclaimed, in unfeigned consternation; “surely, Monsieur le Comte, surely such cannot be your intention!” “Such is my determination, notwithstanding!” he replied, with a strong emphasis, and somewhat of a sneer; “may I inquire in what respect it seems not good to your wisdom?” “For fifty reasons!—Good!” I exclaimed; “it will be ruin, utter, irretrievable ruin! Here we are —here at Landernât—with some twelve thousand infantry, but not three troops of cavalry to cover our retreat, if such be needful!” “Retreat!” he replied, quickly—“who speaks of retreat?” “It will be well if we have not to do it, much more speak of it,” I replied, coolly; “but I pray you let not my words offend you. Look here, monsiegneur,” I continued, pointing to a map which lay before me on the table; “here, at Rheims, scarce thirty leagues distant from Cambrai, lies the archduke, twenty thousand strong—all Spanish veterans; and here, at Valenciennes, the Duke of Lorraine, with a force not much inferior to our own. The archduke, when he shall hear of our success, dare not advance on Paris unsupported, leaving us on his rear—he must fall back! If he effect a junction with Lorraine, believe me, we are lost; if we sit down before Cambrai, he must effect a junction! Now, on the other hand, if we advance at once on him of Lorraine, I pledge my life, we can—if not defeat—at least drive him across the frontier. The country hates the Spaniard; Lorraine disposed of, the peasantry will rise en masse; we may recruit ten thousand men; and then, if we be fortunate, the archduke may find his march to Rheims far easier than his retreat shall be! Thus shall you gain yourself great glory, and deliver the king and country from a most fatal scourge!” “All this is vastly good, sir,” he answered, stubbornly—“vastly good; but I am advised that we can hardly cope with Lorraine in the field—once within the walls of Cambrai, we can hold it till we receive such reinforcements—” “Reinforcements!” I interrupted him; “whence look you, in the name of Heaven, for reinforcements? Condé and Orleans are hard set, even now, to cope with Elbœuf and the generals; they cannot send a man, barring, perchance, a corps of cavalry, which will be here before we can open our trenches, much less take such a town as Cambrai!” “Nevertheless, such is my pleasure! we shall besiege Cambrai. I have not the command of twice six thousand men to learn the art of war of any Englishman.” “Pray God you may not have to look to an Englishman to save you from destruction!” I answered, coolly, and turning on my heel left the tent. It was, in truth, too much to be endured. There was a field of glory open to us, such as we could hardly have failed to reap gloriously; there was wellnigh a certainty of my discovering the prison-house, and compelling the release of my lost bride; yet all was marred by the invincible obstinacy of the old dotard who commanded us. Still was there nothing to be done; I had but fifty men at my own bidding; and although D'Erlach and his Switzers—a stout and veteran band of some four thousand musketeers and pikemen—would have joined me had it come to an open rupture, I dared not venture to supersede my commanding officer, without more evident proofs of cowardice or incapacity. Nor, indeed, had I been disposed to do so, could I by any means have succeeded, as the troops of Weimar were more numerous, and entirely devoted to D'Harcourt—who, though slow in judgment, and not capable of extended views, was a soldier in the field, and a popular leader with his soldiery. I therefore determined to remain with the army, though assuming no command, save of my own immediate followers, until the arrival of the regiments from St. Germains. The three following days were consumed in moving the army from its position at Landrecy to the neighbourhood of Cambrai; and it was in the course of these that I discovered, greatly to my annoyance, that De Chateaufort was not, as I had imagined, slain by my hand, but had actually effected his escape while I was rescuing Turenne, and fled alone in the direction of Maubeuge or Valenciennes. On the fourth day the men were set to work at opening trenches; on the sixth, the first parallel was completed, and on the morning of the seventh our batteries began to play upon the town, but at a distance which rendered it evident to me that weeks must elapse before the works of the enemy could be carried, even if the town should not in the mean time be relieved by the archduke. As I had fully resolved that I would take no steps whatever in measures so desperately foolish as those in which we were now engaged, I absented myself almost entirely from head-quarters, merely reporting myself at stated periods, and occupying my time in patrolling, and in reconnoitring the country in the direction of Rheims, from which I was K 2 hourly in expectation of the arrival of the Spaniards. Nor was I disappointed; for on the evening of the tenth day from the seduction of Turenne's forces—during which little or no progress had been made in breaching the walls of Cambrai —being myself scouting with twenty men as far as the village of Le Cateau, an intelligent soldier, whom I had sent out several days before to ride in the direction of Lâon, and strive to gain some information of the archduke's movements, came up with the intelligence that he had seen the vanguard of the Spaniards in full march on the preceding day, within six miles of Vervins; and that they could not be farther from us at that present time than nine or ten leagues distance. With all the speed of man and horse I hurried to the lines before Cambrai, conveying the intelligence of an event which, if foreseen, might easily have been averted, but which I now feared would be wellnigh fatal. It was, however, with a feeling almost of rapture that I perceived, on approaching our encampment, that the three regiments of cavalry which Condé promised me had already arrived! With such celerity had Lydford executed his commission—having performed the distance of nearly sixty leagues, by means of relays, in two days and a single night. On opening the letters which he handed to me from the prince—I did so previous to my interview with D'Harcourt—I found yet further cause for gratification, inasmuch as I was thereby appointed to an independent command of a division, to be constituted of my own cavalry, D'Erlach's Swiss infantry, and a brigade of field artillery. I at once rode to the quarters of the general-in-chief, displayed my commissions, and required him to give directions to the troops designated to place themselves at my disposal. He did so, although reluctantly—and I readily perceived that I had gained a deadly enemy; but for this I cared little. “May I inquire, sir,” he said, as he surrendered the documents to my charge—“may I inquire how you propose to employ these troops at present?” “It is my intention, my lord, to withdraw them, as speedily as may be, from the trenches.” “By Heaven,” he cried, “you dare not!—to what end?—you dare not do it!” “You little know the man to whom you speak,” I answered, still with perfect courtesy, “that you should suppose there to exist the thing he dares not!—but pass for that! I shall withdraw them from the trenches to cover you, if possible, from the archduke, who is advancing at this moment, and who sleeps to-night some leagues on this side Vervins!” “It is impossible!” he replied, stubbornly, and stamping his foot violently on the ground. “It may be so, but it nevertheless is true! and I go to repel or check his van, if it be possible! I have already so contrived that he shall intercept a letter written to the Duke of Lorraine—to the end that it should fall into his hands—as though he had joined our faction, and were on the march to join us. This, and a demonstration on our part, may cause the Spaniard to avoid an action, and to hurry towards Ypres or St. Venant; and if he do so, I trust your lordship will co-operate with me in crushing Lorraine at once, before he shall discover his mistake.” “I do not believe it, sir; I shall not draw off my men, nor raise the siege, till I shall see the archduke's van.” “Then will you never raise it!” And I left the tent hastily—well aware, however, that he would be compelled, ere long, to come fully into my plans. Taking D'Erlach into my counsel, I immediately drew off my own division, and occupied a strong position with my infantry and guns to the north of the road from Landrecy to Cambrai, by which, I was well aware, that the archduke must advance. I kept my cavalry well on my right flank, so as to preserve a communication with the Weimarian soldiery under D'Harcourt, as being pretty confident that I should be able to cover his flank, and so enable him to take ground in the rear of my position, as though for the purpose of communicating with Lorraine, concerning whom, I felt sure that the Spaniards were in doubt. All the livelong night I never left my saddle; but, till the gray dawn was at hand, I heard nothing to justify my apprehension! Just after the second cock-crow I heard a distant rumbling sound—it was the groaning of the artillery-cart; a few moments later the shrill notes of a distant trumpet reached my ear; and, ere long, the clash of armour, the trampling of horses, and all the varied confusion of a march. On the first alarm, I got my men, who were sleeping on their arms, into line; drawing them up on the ground which, as I knew, afforded us the only hope of safety. In the mean time I sent out scouts to reconnoitre the enemy, and others to warn D'Harcourt of the close vicinity of the Spanish army; and to entreat him to draw off his troops from the trenches as steadily as might be, and to fall steadily into my rear, as a reserve. The former soon returned, with intelligence that the archduke was advancing in three columns, parallel to the high-road of Andernât; that he had been apparently ignorant of our precise situation, and had halted, on discovering that my position completely commanded his line of march. D'Harcourt had sat down before Cambrai on the north-eastern side; the road, which was deep and hollow, though the country was for the most part level, actually intersecting his lines, so that the advance of the Spaniards, if unchecked, must have entirely cut him off on the south-east. The heavy batteries of the town, which, by-the-way, had been admirably well served, were on the north-west, and a deep and unfordable stream on the south. My little army was drawn out on a succession of gentle heights—the only elevations of land for several miles' distance—sloping evenly, though somewhat steeply, down to the causeway, at every point save one, where the hills were rugged and abrupt, covered with a thick growth of thorny shrubs, and having a branch of the same stream which I have mentioned above wheeling close beneath their cliffs. This was the end, or cape, of the eminences towards the east, and consequently nearest to the Spaniard, and would have been in itself a sufficient covering to my left wing; but I had strengthened it yet further by a slight field-work, masked by the coppice, and mounting a few light guns; while my principal batteries were on my front, so disposed as to sweep the whole road and meadows beyond them, quite down to the river-bank. In about an hour it had become so light that I could see the archduke's van, chiefly composed of his celebrated black Walloons. The artillery and pikemen had not yet come up; and they had halted to await them, under the protection of the orchards and enclosures of a nameless hamlet on the line of the high-road. I did not, it is true, feel much apprehension on my own score, for I knew my position to be such, that it could hardly be carried by any superiority of force. The country on my left flank and rear was broken and swampy, and, indeed, almost impassable for guns; so that it was difficult, if not impossible, to turn me. My only fear at this time arose from the obstinacy of D'Harcourt, who had as yet shown no symptoms of evacuating his trenches. So strong, however, was my conviction of the utter madness of fighting a pitched battle against the archduke, under the walls of a hostile garrison, and within some ten leagues of another army, that I believe I should have stood by inactive, and suffered him to be crushed without moving from my heights, had he persisted in his folly. As it became fully daylight, I had, however, the satisfaction of seeing the old count ride out with his staff, and with a score or two of light horsemen, to make a reconnoissance in front; while a slight battery was in progress of erection, mounted with six heavy battering cannon, so placed that it must enfilade the road, and, with the aid of my cross-fire, render it perfectly defensible. At the same time, though his batteries were still playing against the town, I could see by the bustle in the lines that he was preparing to abandon them. As he reached the front of my disposition, I galloped down to join him, and, without adverting in the least to any disagreement which might have occurred previously, rode forward with him in person. “You were right, sir, and I was wrong,” he growled out sulkily as we met; “we must abandon the siege; but we can hold these dogs of Spain at disadvantage till I may extricate my men and guns.” “Spike your battering-guns, my lord, if it be needful. The Spaniard thinks of nothing but securing his retreat to his own frontiers; and as we shall offer him no opposition, I hold it certain that he will avoid us on our show of preparation. The moment he shall have passed Cambrai in the direction of the north, we will, if it so please you, fall upon Lorraine by forced marches, and cut him off by surprise. He is weakly posted near Valenciennes, and that, too, with scarcely eight thousand men. He conquered, and the archduke fled, the cities must at once surrender; and we shall need no heavier guns than our field ordnance.” “Well! sir, well! we shall see. Ha! the archduke is moving!” And so indeed he was. A heavy column was filing down into the meadows, shunning the road with the evident intention of avoiding our cross-fire, and forming to assail our front. In doing this, however, they had overlooked the batteries on my flank, or widely miscalculated their range. I saw at a glance that they would be raked by their fire, if they advanced a single quarter of a mile farther. “Now is our time!” I cried; “if you, Monsieur D'Harcourt, will fall back to the intrenchments, and, evacuating them with all speed, occupy the ground on my right flank and rear, I will draw down a regiment of cavalry by yon ravine, and charge these Walloon dogs, when disordered by an unexpected fire!” He answered not, but rode away hastily, and I VOL. II.—L saw by his countenance that he would profit by my suggestion. I galloped back to my own lines. “D'Erlach,” I cried, “send six more field-pieces to the left flank redoubt, and quickly! These Spaniards march so slowly they will reach it time enough an they use diligence!” Before the words were well uttered the artillerymen were in motion. “De Charmi, wheel your regiment down by the deep ravine; mask it, if possible, behind yon coppice, and when you see an opening, charge on the flank of those black swine. But beware, sir, of involving your men, or of losing your retreat; one brisk charge and no more! Away! My signal shall be a single trumpet from the redoubt. Then charge; do them what hurt you may, but take no prisoners; spike their guns and fall back at once!” He nodded intelligence with a bright eye, and rode away briskly to execute my orders. I galloped onward to the bastion, and getting a regiment of arquebusiers under arms, awaited the result. Before I gave the word to my artillerymen to fire, I swept the country with my glass, and lingered for a moment to gaze on D'Harcourt's movements. He had taken my advice. His troops were filing off leisurely, and without interruption from the town. Three regiments had already gained the upland. I gave the word; and some eighteen guns belched forth their volumes of white smoke, with a roar that carried dismay to the hearts of the Spaniards. They had been heavily loaded with small bullets, and the havoc they produced was fearful. So rapid was the service of my men, that the guns raked them four times in less than fifteen minutes! “Let the smoke lift, that we may see them— hold your next fire!” and with an eager eye I scanned the enemy. They were cut to atoms; but still pressing onward, though in much disorder. They were within a hundred paces of De Charmi, whom they had not discovered. “Now, trumpet!” and a single blast rose shrilly and almost painfully upon the ear; it was answered, and, with a shout, De Charmi wheeled into line upon the trot, charged, and cut his way like a thunderbolt right through the Walloon column! “Brave, brave De Charmi!” I shouted, as though he could hear my orders at a mile's distance; “back! back! wheel to the left, and give it them again!” Even as I spoke, the manœuvre was performed. So completely had he cut his way through them, that his regiment was actually between the pike-men and the enemy's position. But, wheeling promptly, ere they had recovered from the confusion of his first charge, he rushed upon their left flank, as he had before fallen on their right, and again cut his way through them, and without material loss. As he retreated on a hand-gallop, the battery gave them a fresh salute, and when the smoke cleared off, we saw them straggling back, as best they might, to their main body,—their colours lost, their cannon spiked, broken, overturned, and the earth cumbered far and wide with the dead and dying. That day the archduke made no farther movement. At night he lighted his fires and planted his pickets along the front of the hamlet, before alluded to; but, ere his fires had burned low, or the moon had sunk the breadth of her own disk below the horizon, I caught the sound of a suppressed bustle —a guarded motion—in his lines. Without the slightest tumult I got my own men under arms, and sent an express to D'Harcourt to give him notice of the alarm; yet, though I listened with my whole soul, I caught no repetition of the sounds. The morning broke clearly—and the lines were deserted; while, from the commanding height on which I stood, I could see the baffled army winding away through the causeway of Ypres, which it had gained by a well-executed countermarch during the hours of darkness. It was with feelings the most agreeable that I witnessed the rapid departure of the enemy, who, it was evident, was still in apprehension of our pressing on his rear, and interfering with his retreat. All day long we held our position, sending forth scouts in every direction to ascertain that the flight of the Spaniard was as complete as real; and at a late hour of the night they returned to a man, bearing the glad tidings that not a straggler was to be seen throughout the country, save those who yet lay in front of our position, cold, stiff, and lifeless,—all their wars ended for ever,—all their hostility cut short by the omnipotent hand of death. Fortunate was it for me, and for the prosecution of the plans which I had devised, that, in the bustle of his removal from the trenches, the count had been compelled to spike the greater part of his battering train, thereby rendering it impracticable to renew the interrupted siege. Fortunate it was, I say, inasmuch as I am wellnigh convinced that the obstinacy of the commander-in-chief would have prompted him again to sit down before Cambrai, notwithstanding the danger of a second surprise, had it been possible to do so. Being satisfied, L 2 however, that he could not by any earthly means accomplish this, I chose rather to await his orders, which I was certain must tend to an advance against the duke, than to suggest any movements myself; which, I was no less certain, he would disapprove, however excellent, or likely to be crowned with success. Accordingly, on the day following the archduke's flight, I was summoned to a council of war, the result of which was a determination to fall upon the army of Lorraine, by a succession of forced marches; a determination started in this instance by the count, and, of course, warmly seconded by myself and Major-general D'Erlach. It would be useless, and moreover tedious, to enter into details of the manner in which this movement was executed; suffice it, that in somewhat less than a week we found ourselves in the presence of eight thousand men, under the command of Lorraine, encamped along the eastern side of a rich valley, at about four miles' distance from the town of Valenciennes. Resisting my arguments in favour of a sudden and impetuous onslaught of all our forces, which, our coming up at this time being wholly unexpected, could hardly have failed of success, D'Harcourt proceeded at once to fortify his encampment on the heights forming the western boundary of the same valley. This he did skilfully enough; but I saw with pain that it was his intention to resort to the old-fashioned style of protracting operations, and moving, as it were, foot by foot—a style of warfare which was even then becoming obsolete, as it has since been utterly forgotten, except in the presence of a superior force. I fully believe that at this time the dearest wish of the commander was to see me fall in some of the skirmishes which were daily taking place on the outposts, and in which, as leader of the cavalry, I was necessarily much exposed. In one of these fierce little struggles I was, indeed, so nearly entrapped by my old foe De Chateaufort, that nothing but my good fortune and his folly saved me. I had charged down upon a small party of horse, convoying some forage or provisions, had taken the latter, and, pursuing the former with rather too much of impetuosity, was driving them directly into an ambuscade of infantry, which had been designed to cut me off. Nothing, indeed, could have rescued me from destruction, but the inveterate and over-active malice of De Chateaufort, who, at the full distance of a hundred paces, and before the body of my men were in point-blank shot of arquebuse, rose from his cover, and, firing at me with deliberate aim, disclosed the position of his ambush; thus enabling me to bring off my troopers without receiving the smallest injury, beyond a dint in my cuirass from the bullet, which was nearly spent when it struck me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. “Of this be sure: not all that mortal hate By open violence or craftiest fraud Can execute, with devilish will intent To sever those whom God hath linked together, Shall ever part the true, and strong of heart, Knit by the adamant of mortal love!” The Helen. After the second attempt on my life, devised and frustrated as I have related it above, the two armies remained inactive for several days. During this time I more than once observed a movement, which I had at first some difficulty in comprehending, in front of Lorraine's position. On his extreme left lay a large tract of forest land, running back for many miles, so dense of underwood, and so swampy of soil, as to be an admirable cover to his flank. In advance of his lines the continuous woods broke off into clumps of straggling trees, with here and there a marshy spot, or open glade of velvet turf. In one of these glades or grassy meadows—for they were large enough to merit that title—I had discovered some days before a large building of gray stone, surrounded by a courtyard, wall, and fosse; I had supposed it the chateau of some proprietor, deserted by the owner, and perhaps occupied as a depôt or hospital by the enemy. To this building I observed that a small party of horsemen were in the constant habit of resorting early in the morning, or late in the evening, while the shadows lay long and heavy on the forest, and the gray light of the gloaming was insufficient to penetrate its deep recesses. Gradually, for want of better occupation, I began to watch the recurrence of these visits, to wonder what they could portend, and finally to determine on the discovery of their object. This, with the aid of a powerful glass, and an advanced place of observation, I soon accomplished. The leader of the party was De Chateaufort. A ray of hope shot into my bosom. The building was evidently of monastic form; the thin smoke curling from its chimneys, and the unshuttered casements, proved, to a closer inspection, that it was not deserted; although I could not account for the absence of the matin or vesper chimes, which I was certain had not reached my ears. Was it possible that this then was the prison-house of Isabel, and that I had been for a week's space within a cannon-shot of her abode and knew it not? “But I will know it!” I muttered to myself, “and that, too, right speedily. Lydford—what ho! saddle me Bayard, and detail a score of troopers—I go to reconnoitre on the outposts; and hark ye! let them carry their petronels; last time we were wellnigh expended for the want of them.” Evening was already closing rapidly around when I put my foot in the stirrup, yet it wanted a full hour of the time when he should pay his next accustomed visit. Cautiously I wheeled my men around the verge of the camp, and, gaining the cover of some fields of tall yellow mustard, through which ran a deep sandy lane, rode towards the building on a smart trot, secure that my motions could not be discovered from the camp of the enemy, and little fearful of interruption from their foragers, whom we had so often and so invariably beaten that they hardly dared show themselves against us, except in the proportion of three to one. As I rode along the lane, I suddenly observed that the hound Hector had accompanied the horses, and was trotting lazily along by my stirrup. I almost hailed the trivial accident as an omen! “How comes it, Martin Lydford,” I cried, “that you unchained the dog? We may have fighting, and I would not for my life the faithful brute were injured.” “Injured!” he replied, with a smile, “he will be a right stout and a cunning soldier who shall hurt old Hector! But, in truth, the beast was so uneasy as I was saddling Bayard, and whined so piteously as I led him out caparisoned, that I could not resist his dumb language. So I deemed it slight wrong to loose his collar; but if you think otherwise, I can return with him even now.” “It matters not—it matters not, good Martin,” I replied; “and see, here is the convent; a most defensible tenement, by St. George! We will on, and reconnoitre it more closely.” Twice I rode around the walls, without discovering any human being. Some casements of the main building were open, but even these were strongly secured by bars of crossed iron; while in the outer walls—which were not, however, above seven or eight feet in height—there was no opening save a single massive gateway in the front, bolted and barred with jealous care, and a small postern leading into a walled orchard and thence into the forest on the rear. At both these gates I thundered for a time in vain; but was at last answered by the croaking voice of an aged female, the porteress of the Carmelite nunnery, for such I speedily learned was the establishment. She dared not, she said, and would not, draw a bolt, while armies were contending in their peaceful fields; the superior could not be seen; they had no novices within the walls; and when I spoke of prisoners, she uttered an exclamation of disgust, and I could obtain no further answer. By forcing my horse alongside the wall, and standing erect on the saddle, I was enabled to overlook the court; but I gained nothing by the survey, and was compelled to abandon my search for the present almost in despair. I was, however, determined that, as I might not again find so apt a chance, I would reconnoitre the forest up to the enemy's flank; for it struck me that by occupying the court and orchard of the nunnery with a body of musketeers, and, if needs were, with a few falconets and culverins, and by passing a column of attack through the woodlands, the position of the duke might be turned. As I cantered round for the last time to the rear of the building, I thought—in passing a large turret, which projected at an angle of the building nearly to the outer wall—I thought I heard a whisper; but, though I raised my eyes quick as the lightning, I could only see a lattice pulled hastily together, and hear a smothered cry and a slight bustle within. My suspicions at once returned in VOL. II.—M all their force. I felt a conviction, amounting almost to a certainty, that Isabel was within those gloomy walls; still I could do nothing. I resolved, however, that for the moment I would proceed according to my previous intention, and, if possible, occupy the nunnery on the morrow, as if for some military end, thus hoping to gain evidence which might enable me to act promptly and with decision. With this intent I galloped forward for a space; till, finding that the woodlands continued open up to the very lines of the enemy, I determined on withdrawing for the moment, that I might strike securely on the morrow. It was now almost dark, and, without perceiving it, I had come within the range of the enemy's pickets. If I had been in leading of a sufficient force, I might at once have beat up the duke's head-quarters; but now there was nothing for it but to decamp immediately, and with every precaution against alarm. All, however, would not do. As we passed the last outpost, at a hundred paces distant, a charger snorted and neighed; the sentry challenged, fired his arquebuse, and ran in. With the speed of light the alarm spread; but my resolution was taken on the moment—to charge, and capture or kill, the whole of the picket which had discovere us, and to retreat before assistance could arrive. This I did, not wantonly—for I have ever deemed it a grievous sin to shed one drop of blood, even in the fiercest strife, that is not absolutely necessary to victory— but to prevent, if possible, the number and the nature of our force from being ascertained. It was done in an instant. We cut down two or three, captured the rest, before they could untether and mount their horses—for they were cavalry— and, compelling them to accompany us at the gallop, were soon beyond the reach of pursuit or discovery; though, for an hour after I had reached my own quarters, I could perceive, by the rolling of the drums, the wild sounds of the bugles, and the occasional shots of the sentinels at whatever object their fears might construe into an enemy, that the encampment of the duke was fully on the alert. It was unlucky, most unlucky, that we had been discovered. For, although our numbers and the direction of our attack were still unknown, the enemy could not be ignorant that we had been within their very lines, and that we had penetrated them under covert of the forest, which I now shrewdly feared they would occupy with the early daylight. In this, however, I resolved to be beforehand with them; and having communicated to D'Harcourt that I had discovered a pass by which I was confident of turning the enemy's left flank, I received immediate orders to march at daybreak with my whole division, for that purpose, with a promise that he would himself second me by a reconnoissance en masse, and, if opportunity should offer, by a direct attack on the front of the duke's position. Having made all the arrangements which were deemed necessary, I returned, somewhat fatigued, and exceedingly anxious and excited, to my tent. Scarcely had I entered it, when I saw, by the faint light of the lamp suspended from the tent-poles, that the old hound—whose manner I had observed during the whole evening to be peculiar, although I had neither felt the inclination nor had the leisure to seek for the cause—was bearing something in his mouth with unwonted care. As I threw myself on the pallet-bed, which was my only resting-place, he stalked up to me with that singular demeanour by which a sagacious dog will often indicate his consciousness of bearing an important trust, reared himself on his hinder-legs, and placing his forefeet on my knee, dropped into my lap a glove. It was of chamois leather wrought with arabesques of silver—it was the glove of Isabel! My first idea was that he had found the same which had been given me by Le Vasseur, and which I had since preserved with the most jealous care. I sprang from the couch, snatched up the small valise which served me at once for garde robe and escritoire, unlocked its most secret compartment, and there lay the other. They were then a pair—the dog must have received his charge during that very night. My heart throbbed so fiercely, that I could hear its beating. I seized the newly-gained token of her presence; the mouth was secured by a silken thread; it contained something bulky—a note—a brief but all-sufficient note!— “Harry”—it ran thus—“once more, my own, own Harry! “The time hath come!—the time—when you may, when you must rescue me! I have learned his more than fiendish wickedness. I have learned, from his own lips, that he has broken the condition on which alone I hold my voluntary oath to be binding. He has again compassed your assassination. Thanks be to the Almighty, that he succeeded not in his fell purpose! “Therefore—I am here! here, in the nunnery of the Carmelites, scarce three miles distant from your station—a guarded prisoner! Thrice have I seen M 2 you at a distance, when you, perhaps, thought not of Isabel; but no, no, I believe it not—'tis the mere waywardness of love and sorrow—I believe it not, that you ever have forgotten, ever will forget! “I know not whether I may find means to convey this to your hands; but I trust that He, who hath thus far preserved, will now deliver. When you receive this—be it at the banquet of your monarch, or at the altar of your God—leave either, and leave all, for THE TIME is come! Concealment is at an end. Their names are known to you— why should I longer affect secrecy. From one that never hath deceived or failed me, I have it, that the old duke—my savage kinsman—hath gone to his account. De Chateaufort is now Penthiêvre. Base, treacherous, malignant, desperately wicked as he is, he yet lacks the craft that ever winged the arrows of his father's hate, unerringly, and to the mark! I say it once again—the time is come, when you may strike and win! And oh—oh, my beloved!—make no long tarrying; to-day is our own, but who knows what may be the burden of to-morrow. “Ever, ever, “Isabel.” My mind had devoured the contents before my eye had perused a tenth part of the letter. God of my fathers, what were then my sensations! my gratitude to thee—my hopes—my maddening anxiety! “Be it at the banquet of your monarch, or the altar of your God—leave either, and leave ALL!” I repeated the stirring words aloud. I sprang to my feet, buckled my rapier to my side, inspected my good weapons, with a deep and joyous satisfaction. I rushed out into the nightly camp. It was already long past midnight—so long a time had I passed in consultation with the general. It lacked scarce an hour of the time appointed for the movement of the troops. They were already stirring. I hurried to the quarters of D'Erlach; commanded him to hasten his arrangements. I passed among the men with a word of encouragement—a word of heart-stirring praise—to each and all. My very being was set upon the cast, and, win or die, it should be played for nobly! Not a torch was kindled, not a trumpet blown; the orderlies of the arquebusiers alone bore darkened lanterns, whence to distribute fire for the matchlocks when the time should arrive. Silently, steadily, but cheerily withal, did the men meet and muster. The very horses seemed to trample with less sound than usual on the bruised and broken turf, as if they too were conscious that there was need of caution! For the last time before I mounted I returned to my quarters. I steeped my burning brow in the pure element. I threw aside my doublet, and bathed my strong arms shoulder-deep, till they were wellnigh numbed with cold; for I felt that, contrary to my wont, my nerves were shaken, and I was resolved that nothing should be left to chance which might be secured by care. I renewed the flints in the newly-invented locks of my best pistols; I passed my poniard, ay, and my rapier, once and again across the hissing whetstone; I bound a strong spiked collar on the neck of the stanch bloodhound, and, in the ardour of my feelings, I apostrophized the noble brute. I conversed with him as though he were a rational and thoughtful being; I told him that he should follow me to the field—that he should fight in the strife of men for his master's bride!—and, by the heaven that is above me! I believe he marked and understood my words. His full bright eye read my features as I spoke; and, as I ended, he feathered his long stern, stooped his nose to the ground, as though he were tracking the game, and then, throwing his head aloft, uttered a deep full-mouthed bay, longer and louder than I had heard him give when hard upon the haunches of the wounded stag. “Silence! Ha! silence!” I cried, “forward, old hound, but silence!” And not again, though he led our advance running straight and hard towards the nunnery, did he so much as whine throughout that night. I despatched an officer to D'Harcourt as I left the camp, requesting him to allow me a full hour's space wherein to reach my ground; and then, with all the noise and demonstration possible, to charge in column on the centre of Lorraine. I waited not his reply. For his own fame and honour I doubted not he would advance, and my own duty admitted no delay.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. “I have thee by the throat!—and by His life— Who made the beautiful and blessed world, In which thou art a black and plague-like spot— Thou sinnest not again! Mercy! for thee? Mercy to murtherers is a deeper murther— Murther to justice!—homage paid to hell!” Old M.S. In an hour's rapid but silent marching, we gained the outskirts of the forest. The moon was setting, but her light, faint and uncertain as she waded through the fleeting clouds, came and went in fitful gleams over the dense woodlands and the grassy glades. There was no sound or stir, all seemed peaceful and at rest. It was my object fully to occupy the woods in the rear of the nunnery, before giving any alarm, in order to cut off the possibility of flight to, or succour from, the army of Lorraine. This done, I had resolved to invest the building on every side, and to obtain admission peaceably, if possible, but if not, by any means. With this view I halted two regiments of Switzers, armed with their heavy halberts, but without firearms in front, and wheeling around the right side of the building with all my cavalry, arquebusiers, and pikemen, entered the skirts of the wood beyond the low walls of the orchard and gardens, which I have before mentioned. Just at the angle of the building on this side, I posted Lydford with four troops of cuirassiers their petronels ready and their matches lighted, charging them to let no one enter or pass out of the building. Scarcely had I turned the corner, when I heard the heavy tread of disciplined men; and in the uncertain light beheld a long line of infantry filing into the enclosures of the convent from the rear. Five minutes sooner, and I should have cut them off, but it was now too late. Two regiments, at the least, had entered the gardens, and even now occupied the building itself, while several columns were marching steadily from the left flank of the duke's army through the woods, so as to form a line of communication between this important position and his main army. There was but one course left: to isolate the convent and its defenders, and, occupying the forest, to drive back the Frondeurs, and to maintain the position against all odds, until I could reduce the convent. In a solid mass of horse and foot I charged, reserving the fire of my muskeeters till I could see the features of each file-leader of the enemy. Then, platoon after platoon, we gave it to them in the most tremendous running volley I ever heard. We swept them before us like a torrent—back— back to the thick woodlands, a full half mile in the rear of the gardens. There they rallied for a moment under cover of the trees, fighting well, and keeping up a hot fire en voltigeur; but by a charge of pikes, I forced them through this thicker growth of coppice—in which I immediately set my foragers to construct a rude breastwork of felled trees— and, bringing up half a dozen field-guns, was at once master of a position which I was well aware the duke could not carry without concentrating all his powers against it; while I was well aware, by the heavy cannonading from the front, that he could not do this. Having secured the position with a strong reserve, I directed D'Erlach to press steadily on, driving in the enemy's advance till he should reach the skirts of the wood covering the duke's left flank, and thence to cannonade him with as many of the light falconets as he could force through the woodland—this I had already found far more practicable than I expected, as the soil was sound, and the taillis, except at intervals, very young and scattered in its growth—but not to advance a yard till I should join him. I was now confident of success. Retreat for the occupants of the nunnery was impossible. In front I had stationed a party as large as that which held it, with flank parties on either side; and in the rear, between the defenders and their comrades, was a force of full five thousand veterans under an excellent and trusty leader. My first step was to clear the gardens and orchards. In this I succeeded, after a short but desperate conflict, under a cross-fire from the walls of the main building; the enemy, at last, throwing down their arms and surrendering at discretion. Knowing that escape in this direction was hopeless, and anticipating a desperate effort on the part of De Chateaufort—who, I doubted not, was in the convent—to cut his way through my Switzers, I had already drawn off all my men save a small picket, which I left as a post of observation, and was hurrying to the front, when a rapid fire of musketry, mingled with loud shouts, announced to me that my expectations were realized. I clapped spurs to my horse, dashed forward over wall and fosse at a rate which quickly threw out my infantry, summoned the cavalry I had left at the angle to follow me all save Lydford, whom I ordered to the picket Vol. IL—N in the rear; and reached the scene of action in time to see the sallying party handsomely beaten back within the walls. With the reinforcement I had brought up, we were strong enough to storm the building; but I was unwilling to resort to so desperate a measure, well knowing the horrors that will ensue where females are the inmates of a place taken by an assault of fierce and lawless soldiery. Something, however, was to be done, and that right speedily; for it was necessary that I should move forward, to act on the flank of Lorraine. In this emergency, I fastened a white neckcloth to the staff of a soldier's pike, and, advancing to the portal, sounded a parley, and summoned the garrison; assuring them of their hopeless situation, reminding them of the fate denounced by the laws of war against the defenders of an untenable position, and offering honourable terms to all. The answer was the shot of a musket, loaded with three bullets; one of which grazed my right cheek, cutting it to the bone, a second glancing innocuous from my head-piece, and the third entering the brain of my war-horse—the prince's gift. I fell heavily to the ground, with, and partly under, the slaughtered beast; and, as I fell, I heard the infuriate yell of my Swiss soldiery, as they hurled themselves at once against the gate and walls. I rose to my feet in an instant, and dashed forward sword in hand; but, ere I could make myself heard or understood, the strong gate was shattered to atoms by the axes and halberds of my men. A desperate fight succeeded, blade to blade and hand to hand; but their superior energy, and the fury excited by what they believed to be the murder of their general, gave a vast superiority to my Switzers. Foot by foot they forced their way in, and every step was planted on the body of fallen friend or foeman. The courtyard was crowded almost to suffocation, but the pressure was fast diminished by the unsparing sword. Not a shot was fired after the first rush; for my men had no firearms, and the Frondeurs were prevented by the throng from using them. The main building had fortunately remained unoccupied, and at its doors, as fast as I gained them, I set strong watches of men, on whose fidelity and firmness I could depend, for the protection of the helpless females within. While the hellish strife was going on—which I was well aware could only end in the destruction of every life of the defenders, who by their own madness had drawn their fate upon themselves—I caught a glimpse of a kerchief, waved from a window at the farther end of the quadrangle. I heard a wild and well-remembered shriek. Madly, desperately I pushed forward, dealing around me blind and sweeping blows, and cutting my path through friends and foes alike; but, ere I reached the place, I saw a lower casement violently thrown open from within, and the fiend De Chateaufort leaped out, bearing HER in his arms! He made for the postern-gate, reached it, and, passing forth, locked it deliberately behind him; thus cutting off every chance of safety from his miserable followers, who had, I conclude, been prevented from availing themselves before of this escape, by the idea that the building was no less closely invested in the rear than it was in front. A moment—a single moment—after him I gained the spot; with a desperate leap I darted at the wall, not, perhaps, exceeding eight feet in height; I caught the cope-stone with my hands, and, by main force of my arms, drew myself to the summit, threw myself over without marking the depth of the plunge, and, fortunately alighting on my feet, came off unhurt. He had mounted a horse —whether his own or a chance charger I knew not—and, bearing her in his arms, was spurring desperately, and taking wild leaps over the enclosures. With a speed scarcely inferior to his own, although on foot, I followed him—we neared the spot where I had posted my picket. “Lydford!” I shouted, in a voice of supernatural power—“Lydford! ho! rescue!” A loud whoop answered me—a jovial hunting halloo—and the full-mouthed bay of a hound. De Chateaufort cleared the last stone wall, and for a moment I lost sight of him. Again I heard the deep cry of the hound; it had changed into a sharp and savage treble—the peculiar note of the creature as he views his game. I leaped the fence, and, at some twenty paces distant, I beheld the progress of a fearful struggle. The charger, bearing away my deadliest foe and most beloved bride, was at his speed; but, as he toiled along, the bloodhound dashed full at his head, seized him by the gullet, and bore him to the earth. At the same instant Lydford snatched Isabel from the villain's hold, and was, in the same point of time, himself hurled to the earth—as it seemed lifeless—by a tremendous sword-cut which De Chateaufort dealt him as he fell. As the latter recovered his feet, the terrified girl was borne off in the arms of one of my subalterns, who, with a dozen followers, had come up in time for the rescue, and I—I was upon him! “Quick, quick!” I shouted—“quick, Le Vasseur, N 2 to horse! All of you, to horse! Protect the lady with your lives; she is my wife. Away! Make a wide circuit to the left; avoid both friend and foe; rest not an instant, till she be in safety at my quarters. And thou, Lydford,” I continued, as I saw him too rise, stunned, perhaps, but unwounded, “after them. Away! I am enough to reckon with this miscreant!” Our blades had already crossed, and in silence we aimed desperately at each other's life. For a few moments I was almost unconscious how I was engaged. My mind was flying with my recovered angel; my eyes were fixed on her departing form. A smart wound in the sword—arm admonished me of my folly. “Have at you now!” I shouted; “there! there! there!” and at each word I lunged with my whole strength and activity at his face, for, all beside, he was sheathed in steel. Steadily and well he parried the thrusts; his teeth hard set, his eye glaring on mine with deadly and terrible, because cool, malignity. In the third lunge my foot slipped. I could not recover myself. I felt the point of his weapon enter my buff-coat on the left side—for, madly enough, I had come out into action without my corslet, forgotten in the wild tumult of my feelings —instinctively I writhed my body sideways, I know not how, from the cold blade, which passed right out behind, grazing my ribs with a slight wound in its passage. I clutched his hilt in my left hand, and, dropping my own sword, dealt him a heavy blow in the face with my gauntlet, at the same moment tripping him with my foot from behind. He fell headlong, as if shot; and in an instant my gripe was in his throat—my knee upon his chest. “Dog!” I whispered hoarsely from excitement, “what have you to say that I should spare your life?” “This!” he replied; and, suiting the action to the word, levelled and snapped a concealed pistol almost in my face. But I was too quick for him; I struck it aside, and it was discharged harmlessly. In a second's space my poniard was in my hand; I reared it high, high in the air, grasped his throat yet more tightly—my soul was on fire—the impetus was given, and the blow must have been fatal,—when my arm was arrested from behind!— It was D'Harcourt himself! “Pshaw!” he muttered, contemptuously, “tarry you for such a dog as this? Put up your dagger; for shame! What! strike a fallen foe!” “I do not need your teaching, sir,” I answered, as I rose; “but let him reserve his worthless life for the axe or cord, to which it is a forfeit! And look to it, Monsieur le Comte D'Harcourt, that you hold him securely. The Prince of Condé's orders are most positive, regarding this same traitor. But why do I see you here? How goes the battle in the front?” “Bravely, sir, bravely,” he replied; “but in consequence of the protracted struggle here, I galloped down in person to see if aught of ill had befallen your command.” “I might not leave this garrison behind me,” I answered; “but now, if you will to the front, I will advance on the left flank, which is even now hard bestead with our cannonade, and my life on the issue.” “Well, sir; away! But how is this? you bleed —are you much wounded?” “Not so much but that I can do my duty. Will it please you resume the leading of the centre?” We parted, and—but it needs not to relate the fortunes of that day—my fight was won already; and, though I still led on for name and honour, my heart was absent from the field. It is enough we conquered; and although Lorraine, with consummate skill, drew off his shattered army to Maubeuge, where he was taken some weeks later, we remained the masters of the field, with all the stores, artillery, and baggage of the enemy, and all the honours of the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. “I saw her upon nearer view, A spirit, yet a woman too! Her household motions light and free, And steps of virgin liberty; A countenance in which did meet Sweet records, promises as sweet; A creature not too bright or good For human nature's daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.” Edgeworth. I SAID that we conquered, and so in truth we did; but, so desperate was the resistance of the enemy, so strong his disposition to rally on every vantage-ground, and so evident his unwillingness to be dispossessed of the position from which he had been forced only at the sword's point, that not until a very late hour in the evening was I permitted to sheath my weapon and turn my horse's head homeward. Indeed, I observed more than once, after I had joined D'Harcourt's division, subsequently to the retreat of the duke, a strange pertinacity in his manner of directing me to lead the cavalry against remote points, and a heartless unwillingness to suffer me to return to the camp, although I felt assured that he must have gathered something of the causes which existed, independent of two or three undressed scratches, to render me anxious and eager to hear the sounds of the recall. At about six in the afternoon, his trumpet sounded to collect the infantry, some of whom had pressed too hotly forward in pursuit: but my toils were not ended; and it was not till nearly eight of the clock that I assumed the responsibility of drawing off my two regiments of cavalry, leaving Lorraine in full and direct retreat upon Maubeuge. This I should have done, had I attended to the promptings of my hot blood, some hours before, and had I not been conscious of having already, in several points, stretched my military powers to the utmost, in order to render them subservient to my own purposes. I was, moreover, aware that I had in D'Harcourt a jealous and observant enemy; one who would not hesitate to do me the last disservice with Mazarin or Condé, should he find a fitting chance; and who had already, as I well believed, sought for such an opportunity in hinting at the necessity of my leaving the field, as a consequence of the trivial wounds I had received in the commencement of the action. It was therefore with a constancy of purpose, which I confess myself to have estimated at the time as scarcely inferior to Roman self-denial, that I checked every rising murmur, every expression of dissatisfaction, at the needlessly protracted requisition for my services. So well, indeed, did I succeed in assuming the guise of frank and fearless alacrity, that I had a speedy opportunity of gaining a slight confirmation of my suspicions from the evident chagrin of the commander at my self-possession and activity; nay, I am almost convinced that he hoped to force me by his unreasonable commands into open mutiny! Nor was he, indeed, without cause both to fear and hate me. He knew that it was in my power, and probably doubted not that it was in my purpose, to expose his obstinacy and false measures, while in the trenches at Cambrai. He further knew that his escape from the archduke then, and his brilliant victory now, were owing—the first entirely, and the latter in a high degree—to my advice and action. I was determined, therefore, that, cost me what it might to keep down my almost choking passions, I would not now mar my bright hopes in the very moment of fruition; that I would not, by a childish eagerness to snatch the prize too soon, suffer it again to be dashed untasted from my lip: and, although I say it of myself, I do feel that it was no slight victory of principle over impulse in a man situated as I then was, to plod along in the dull and hard routine of duty. It was not only love—burning, passionate love —that urged me at every instant to defy the hoary dotard, and to gallop back on the spur to our encampment, but doubt and agonizing anxiety. Probable it was—indeed most probable—that Isabel had reached the camp in safety; no force, that I had heard of, lay in the direction I had indicated—the men whom I had ordered to protect her person with their lives were bold and often-tried adherents. Still, what lover ever paused to reckon probabilities? It was enough that she might have again been carried off, that the villain Chateaufort, whose power and malignity, so long as he should draw the breath of life, I had learned almost to fear, that he who had so often stricken at the root of my heart's happiness, might have again effected his own escape and my utter ruin. Never, in the whole course of my life, before or since, have I endured a tenth part of the torments which I felt that day. While the period of my happiness was seen but in a dim perspective, I could philosophize, I could be tame and patient, as the old and feeble-minded, who dignify their want of energy to do or to resist by the high name of patience. But now, now, with the cup actually courting my grasp, to be unable to secure it—to feel that a thousand thirsty enemies might be even now winning it from my uncertain hold; to think that I might well return home full of ardent hope and joyous expectation; to find the home desolate— the hope but a dream—the expectation frustrated, and for ever! To endure all this, as I endured it, manfully and without repining, is indeed a task which none could hope to execute, but those who have by long self-discipline rendered their passions the ministers, the slaves, the weapons of their intellect. I felt that by delay I might—by precipitation I must lose her; and for once, if my calculations were sound, they were also fortunate. It was, as I have said, wellnigh eight of the clock when, drawing off my regiments, I mounted a fresh horse, the third I had tired out since the dawn, and galloped at a furious rate across the now lonely battle-field. It is a mournful, ay, and a self-debasing sight, a recent battle-field. The cold and senseless dead— charger, and he who reined him—outstretched side VOL. II.—O by side, in the long sleep that knows no earthly waking! The miserable wounded wretches, groaning and struggling in their great agony! The very instruments of music, and the standards, that lent their paltry aid to make this havoc wear a glorious seeming, broken and voiceless, torn and gory! The very weapons, mute ministers of all this carnage, still reeking with that red witness, though no longer wielded by the strong hand, at the bidding of the high heart! If a man can look unmoved on such a sight, assisted by the consciousness that he himself has edged the blade of the immortal Azrael,—that his intellect has been perverted, his hand turned aside from its legitimate purposes of benevolence and mutual good, to the destruction, the temporal, ay, and perchance the eternal destruction of his fellow-sinners—if he can look upon this sight, can grapple with this thought, and doing so feel nothing, or feel proud, he is no man! Oh, conquerors! conquerors! ye have been called the scourges of a God; but it is at the instigation of a DEVIL! As I rode fiercely across the weltering field, such were my self-accusing reveries, I felt the sin of murder on my soul. For what had I or mine of accusation against these, that I should wield the blade of extermination, weaponing, as it were, the will of others against men innocent to me! I felt as though some deep and sudden desolation would be hurled upon my head for the deed. I fancied, in the feeble wailings that loaded the slaughter-tainted air, the muttering of the vengeful thunder! “Never, never again,” I cried aloud, in the vehemence of my over-excited spirit—“never again, O Sword! shalt thou leap from thy scabbard, save to do battle for the feeble, and to strike against the tyrant! Never shalt thou blaze in the van of battle, unless it be on English ground, and in the cause of England! Thy fight is fought; thy prize is won! Grant it—oh grant it, Thou whom I have on this day so grievously offended—grant it, Eternal Ruler and Creator, that not in HER I may be punished for this foul commission!” “Stand, ho! Stand, or I shoot!” I was interrupted in my wild soliloquy by the fierce challenge of a sleepy sentinel, and the rattle of his heavy arquebuse, as he levelled it upon the rest. “A friend, ho! A friend and officer. The word is Victory. Good-night!” And, without checking or swerving from my gallop, I dashed past the astounded soldier without heeding the salute with which he atoned for the abruptness of his challenge. But the incident brought down my spirit from its soarings, to that which was immediately before me, without shrinking from or shunning the thoughts that had suggested themselves. I soon was able to appease them by the reflection that, if the victims were innocent of individual wrong, they were not so in lending themselves as tools and instruments of havoc to the guilty great, to the ambitious and needy adventurer—that rebellion against a lawful ruler, and without a lawful cause, is sin—that I, whatever might be the morbid self-accusations of the moment, had been striving in the cause which I deemed honest; and was, if guilty, guilty of misapprehension only, not of stubbornness or wilful wrong. The scene, too, harmonized with my change of feeling; it was now bright and pleasant. The month was that sweetest of the year, young April; and as the winter had been of unusual severity and gloom, so had the opening of the spring been early and most genial. The woods were bursting into the tender verdure peculiar to the season; the herbage was already deep and richly fragrant. The country through which I rode was undulating, and of exceeding beauty; and over all a brilliant moon was pouring that flood of sweet and tranquil lustre which, so much lovelier than the glare of the pervading daylight, softens every asperity of nature, and, making its very shadows soft and hazy, acts as a gauzy veil to the features of a faded beauty, concealing all that is unlovely, and charming the eye in proportion as it excites the fancy. No painter's glance or poet's heart could have selected a more lovely or romantic spot than that which chance had selected for our rude encampment. It was a long and gentle hill, subsiding greenly and softly into a wide stretch of fertile meadow-land, through which a broad rivulet lingered, as though its nymph were enamoured of some neighbouring faun or sylvan, and were therefore loath to quit his beautiful abodes. A shadowy wood on either hand, and frequent clumps of forest-trees—still bare and leafless, or at the most in early bud, but interspersed with the fresh foliage of the willow and the hazel—spotting the hill-side, gave a park-like air to the untrimmed scenery. Along the summit of the hill, and through the imperfect screen of the woodland, hundreds of white tents were glimmering in the moonlight; while here and there the rays flashed back in keen reflection from the armour of some passing sentinel, or were contrasted by the ruddy glow of some terrestrial fire. The sounds, too, which floated on the night-air, were blended and harmonized into sweetness by the effect of distance; the hum of conversation, O 2 the merry laugh, the quaint song of the campaigner—hoarse, doubtless, and indelicate upon a nearer hearing—came pleasantly on the ear, and were mingled with the hooting of the owls, crying to each other, like answered sentinels, from their wind-rocked fortresses; and with the remoter barking of the household dog. It is the peculiarity of such a scene and time to soften and subdue the soul, to win it from the storm and strife of humanity, to attune it to holier thoughts, to render it pensive, affectionate, and melancholy; and, if its effects upon my spirit were not precisely these, they were not, at least, widely or incongruously different. From bitter anxiety concerning the future, and jealous doubtings of my own purity of deed and purpose, I fell into a confiding and a peaceful mood of hope! I slackened my pace; not that I was less eager to join my loved one, but that the rush of the horse, the current of air created by his speed, the very sounds of his swift motion, were painful and uncongenial. Still, I did not, as may be well believed, linger or hesitate upon the road; and, as I began to ascend the first pitch of the hill, I struck into a light canter, that brought me speedily to one of the entrances in the breastwork nearest to my pavilion, and guarded by the faithful Switzers of D'Erlach. I did not pause to enter into converse with the officer of the night, beyond the exchange of military watch-words, but rode at once in the direction of my quarters, while again I became anxious almost to suffocation. I felt as though every vein in my body was filled to bursting, as though every pore were alive, and tingling with fierce excitement. Again I drove the spurs into my horse's flank, and dashed forward, flinging the cut turf far behind me; and startling the carousers round many a watch-fire as I careered along, resolved on gaining an instant solution to my hopes or terrors. I reached my tent; with mere anxiety I trembled to a degree which to describe would be absurd and useless. All was silent and dark; not so much as a groom was there to receive my horse, or a sentinel pacing his nightly rounds. I sprang from the saddle, secured the reins of my charger to the stem of a young oak-tree, which grew before the entrance of my pavilion, and, with a staggering and uncertain gait, as of one under the influence of wine, I reeled into my dwelling-place. It was a plain campaigner's tent, merely affording a shelter from the inclemency of winter, and almost wholly unprovided with the comforts even of a soldier's life. It was, however, divided into two compartments; the outer of which I had allotted to my faithful adherent, while retaining the inner chamber, if it may so be called, for my own purposes. As I rushed through the opening which served for a door, the first object that caught my eye was the form of Lydford, leaning in an erect position against the tent-pole, but buried in the deepest slumber. The ghastly light of a lantern, kindled, as it would seem, in order to furnish a light for the match of the heavy arquebuse which he still grasped, as though he were a sentinel on duty, flickered over his snowy hair, bronzed features, and glittering armour; while the regular and heavy breathings of the veteran showed that his present sleep was but an involuntary tribute rendered by the spirit to over-wearied and exhausted nature. Somewhat reassured by this sight—for it was evident that the old man had posted himself there to secure the privacy or safety of some inmate, until my return, although his strength had been inferior to the task—somewhat reassured in spirit, and relieved from my wild doubts, I stole into the interior of the tent. Before me was a picture that would have tasked and been superior to the powers of the mightiest master that ever limned the human form divine. Through a wide aperture in the canvass roof the calm soft moonlight streamed down gloriously, filling the small apartment with a sweet and mellow radiance; but it was upon my pallet-bed that the broadest pensile of light was flung, and upon the calm angelic features of her who lay there, forgetful of all her sufferings, of all her sorrows. She was dressed, as I had seen her on that morning, in a plain robe of spotless white, the close corsage splendidly setting forth the symmetry of her person, and the long train falling carelessly over the edge of the couch. There was, however, one guardian, one vigilant and faithful guardian, watching over the safety of her whom he had so much contributed to rescue— the bloodhound Hector. Erect upon his haunches, he sat beside the bed, his head reaching far above the level of the pillow on which Isabel reposed, and his bright eyes glancing in the moonlight like coals of fire, as he rolled them to and fro in search of foeman or intruder. It was indeed a lovely group. Her beautifully chiselled features; the snowy lids closed, and the long lashes pencilling her pallid but transparent cheek; the profusion of sunny hair—freed from the restraint of the novicial head-dress which they had compelled her to assume, and which now lay beneath my feet—glancing like threads of gold among its own dark shadows; her bosom rising and falling in the deep security of innocence; and, above all, that still and almost terrible expression, that absence of all intellectual expression, that likeness to a longer and a colder sleep, which has often pressed so chillingly on my heart, while gazing on the slumbering countenance of one I love. Her left hand fell easily across her lap, and the right was cast around the muscular and shaggy neck of the dark hound, as though she had sunk into repose while in the act of caressing her canine preserver. There has always been to me a reluctance, almost a fear, to awaken any person, even a child, from placid and sweet-seeming slumber. Like taking mortal life, it is the destroying of that which, with all his glorious intellect, all his sublime endurance, all his godlike intellect, man never can restore! It is the breaking of a dam, behind whose happy barriers the wild mill-stream of human thoughts and actions is suffered for a while to linger in unvexed and motionless tranquillity! It is the calling forth of the spirit from total absence of volition, from the insensibility of wo, or, perhaps, from the abysses of imagined happiness, to care, and toil, and sorrow, to the blending of all that is most sweet and most bitter, most low and most sublime, most vicious or degraded, and most high and holy, to that blending which men call life! We know not, we never shall know, what bright hopes we may have severed, what pleasing visions we may have interrupted; visions a thousand times fairer than reality! We know not whether we may have cut short the converse of the sainted mother, come from the land of the departed to pour strange teachings into the ears of that sleeping child, whom she no longer meets, save thus in the still midnight! We know not whether aught that we can offer can equal, nay, compare with, the imaginary luxuries of that state, which a single touch of ours, a word, a kiss, a breath more deeply drawn than common, will scatter to the winds of heaven! Always, from my childhood upward, have I felt thus; always have I loved, yet feared, to gaze upon the calm unruffled sleeper—always have I shunned to sever those mysterious chains. And never, perhaps, were these sensations more vivid in my breast than now, as I stood watching, no longer in anxiety or bitterness, but in hope and rapture, till the time would come when she, who was my world, should raise her curtained lids and know me. Nor was it on myself alone that this strange influence was manifest; the very dog, the dumb irrational dog, ever wont to greet my coming by his joyous yelpings and his high bounds into the air, now sat as quietly by the couch-side as though he knew that his slightest motion must arouse the lovely creature over whose rest he, and he only, had watched in self-denying faithfulness. Only by a slight motion of his feathery tail, and by a bland and smiling expression of his up-turned eye, did he now indicate his joy at my approach; and as I stood gazing on the lineaments of my long-lost bride, he also turned his head, as though he too felt pleasure in the sight. Long I stood motionless, and holding in my very breath, lest it should arouse her, though at the same time I would have given worlds, had I possessed them, that she might be awakened. But longer might I have stood watching, had not a single motion of the sleeper decided me. I saw a bright beaming smile steal gradually over those fair features, animating them as does the first ray of sunlight the face of nature, meaningless before and dull. Her lips parted, and in accents of the most silvery music, she murmured forth my name. I could contain myself no longer. Respectfully, purely as I would bend before the shrine of my patron saint, I bowed over the low pallet; lightly I touched her lips with mine—lightly as the dew falls upon the flower; yet she sprang from her trance as though the sovereign thunder had rolled above us! “Harry!” she cried, recognising me at a glance; “beloved Harry, is it—is it indeed you?” “My own, own angel!” I clasped her to my heart; her arms were about my neck; our bosoms beat together; our lips were mingled in one first long delicious kiss. If ever the rapture of a moment may repay the misery of months or years, it is of a moment such as this. Side by side we sat for hours, my arm encompassing her fairy waist, her head, with all its unbound tresses, leaning upon my iron shoulder. We had no note of time—no care for persons. We were united—united, as we trusted, never again to part! And what—oh what did it reck us of the strife of monarchs or the fate of empires! Our monarch was the bright imbodyment of old Praxiteles, the Grecian Eros of unmingled beauty; our empire—with all its mine of treasures, all its unfathomed depths—our empire was the heart— the human heart. But as there is nothing permanent here—nothing enduring, nothing that hath not its appointed end— so was our dream of love brought to its conclusion VOL. II.—P —suddenly and rudely snapped asunder. There was a clatter of armed footsteps in the vestibule —a dash of weapons, and the jarring tone of angry voices. I heard old Lydford's mingling fiercely with the tumult. “Fear nothing, sweetest one,” I cried; “I will return to you upon the instant. For my sake, fear nothing, Isabel.” “Let me then follow: for without you I fear all and every thing; but with you nothing!” But the brawl grew louder, and I caught the dull sound of a blow! “It cannot be, beloved. I must forth, and alone! but in ten seconds' space I will return. Bless you—adieu!” I snatched my sheathed rapier from the table, and, placing it under my arm, rushed forth. The faithful hound gazed wistfully after me with a short surly growl, but never offered to move from the feet of Isabel, to whom he had attached himself, as if knowing that his master valued her at a rate a thousand times higher than the universe, with all that it contained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. “My life, my honour, and my cause I tender free to Scotland's laws. Are these so weak, as must require The aid of your misguided ire? Or, if I suffer causeless wrong, Is then my selfish rage so strong, My sense of public weal so low, That, for mean vengeance on a foe, Those cords of love I should unbind, Which knit my country and my kind?” Lady of the Lake. Scarcely had I passed into the outer tent— even then unsuspicious of aught beyond some trivial disturbance of the men, elevated, perhaps, by their late victory, beyond the sobriety of discipline—ere I was overpowered by a sudden rush of many soldiers; and, although not disarmed or mastered, was borne violently backward into the apartment I had just quitted. On finding myself standing in the centre of the tent, opposed to at least a score of men, whom I recognised at once as the sergeants of the provost-marshal, my first sensation was of sheer astonishment—the second prompted me to snatch my pistols from the table, on which they lay in readiness to my hand, and to raise my bugle to my lips. In that moment of confusion and surprise, my eye turned instinctively to Isabel. She stood, as I had left her, with hands clasped and pallid features; but her eye was bright and calm, nor was there aught of weak or womanish terror in the expression of her noble countenance. “No nearer—on your lives, no nearer, villains!” I whispered, sternly and audibly through my set teeth. “What means this insolent intrusion?” I covered the leader of the band with my levelled pistol, as I spoke, apprehending any thing of lawless mutiny rather than my deliberate and legal arrest. “We regret, fair sir—believe me, we regret, while we must execute, our duty,” replied the young officer who led the party. “I have a warrant here from the commander, to secure the person of Major-general Harry Mornington, on charges of neglect of duty, of murder, and of the abduction of a royal ward! You must give up your sword and follow us—peaceably, if you will; but follow us you must! We would be courteous in pursuance of our duty, as far as is consistent with our own security and your safe-keeping.” “And at whose say—what villain's say—am I, a general of division, thus felon-like arrested? or at whose lawless warrant?” I exclaimed, fiercely, and without withdrawing my aim from the person of the speaker. “Go, learn your duty better, sir provost, or sir hangman! For me, you take me not alive, save by the sign-manual of my true superior. An I but blow one call upon this bugle, ye are all dead men—one call to the Swiss troops of D'Erlach! Look to it, sir; withdraw your scoundrel sergeants, and that, too, on the instant, or, by the ashes of my fathers, you shall die the death!” “That you may have the power,” replied the other, calmly, “to resist us, to your own safety and to our destruction, I will not gainsay. How far such a proceeding will be to the honour of your name, it is for you to balance. We have already weighed the chances; and it likes us better to fall in the performance of our duty than to die like dogs for breach of it. I do beseech you, sir, put us not to the need of offering violence to an officer of your distinction, and in the presence of so fair a lady! If there be aught of pleasure our courtesy may yield you, command us.” P 2 Almost for the first time in my life I was undecided. The man who stood before me was, indeed, innocent of aught, save the performance of his duties—his distasteful duties—to his superiors; and would it, as he said, be a deed fitting the name of Mornington, to slay an honest servitor for the fault of the bad master? Would it be wise or seemly to provoke a deadly brawl, in which mortal weapons would be wielded by resolved and skilful hands, and that, too, in the very presence of my recovered bride? And yet, how might I quit her with the certainty of meeting her again? While I was yet revolving these wild questions in my brain, she threw herself between me and the provost of the guard, flung her white arms around me, and, turning the fatal weapon from its level,— “For my sake, Harry, for my sake,” she cried, “do no such madness. Is it that you fear—is it that you are conscious of your guilt, that you would shun the proof? For shame! for shame! Go forth, my noble husband, trusting in the strength of your own pure nobility, of your own spotless innocence! Strike but one blow against the officers of justice—strike but one blow—and you are lost for ever—condemned beyond redemption! Guiltless though you be—spotless of sin or shame —yet, if you do resist the mandate of the law, you shall be judged as guilty. Go forth, and challenge the bold man who has spoken treason on your name—challenge him, not to the arbitry of blood, but to the proof of judgment—go forth, and tremble not! Go forth, and let the guilty shudder!” “It is for you,” I cried, moved almost to tears by her enthusiastic speech—“it is for you alone that I would strive—” “For me!” she interrupted me—“for me! and wherefore? Think you that I would not deem it better to follow you, a man proved innocent, but guiltlessly condemned—to follow you to the dungeon, to the scaffold, to the grave!—than to sit beside you on earth's proudest throne, if shielded from the power of law by lawless violence?” “Isabel,” I answered—“Isabel, you have prevailed!” and turning to the officer, who had waited with patient sympathy, and with somewhat of disgust against his employers working in his features, I addressed him:—“On one condition, sir, and on one only, will I follow you. This lady is my wife, my lawful wife. She—by the villany of one who was my prisoner some hours since, and who is now, an I misjudge it not, my foul accuser —she has been torn from me, and immured, these months past, in a convent-jail! Her will I not leave unprotected, and liable to his new outrages, though you, and I, and France herself should perish! Let one of your men summon hither D'Erlach, that to his trust I may commit her, and, be it to my death, I follow you without inquiry or resistance. I pledge to you a word unbroken—a name immaculate!” “It is enough, sir. You, Croquart, summon hither instantly the leader of the Switzers; and the rest of you withdraw, but wait without. Your honour, sir, that, rescue or no rescue, you escape not?” “My honour.” Slowly and wearily did the moments creep along. The excitement, which had nerved the lovely girl to such almost unnatural courage, had, with the cause that called it forth, departed. She had sunk down upon the couch, sobbing like one whose heart was already broken; and I, I gazed upon her in mute, icy, speechless despair! The revulsion from the summit of hope and joy to the depths of misery had been too sudden, not to be felt overpoweringly by a spirit which, though self-disciplined, was yet so excitable, and fraught with passions sensitive and violent, as my own. I thought the messenger would never have returned; yet was it but a scant half-hour before the veteran D'Erlach stood before me. He gazed about him as he entered in evident surprise, which, as I spoke, gave way to fiercer feelings. “To you, sir,” I said, “as to one whom I deem honest and honourable, whether as a friend or foe, I have a request to offer. I am arrested, by the warrant of the Comte D'Harcourt, arrested as a traitor, murderer, and—” “Ten thousand devils! that shall never be,” cried the choleric old Bernois; “never! while there be a Switzer in the camp can wield a halberd!” “Ay, but it shall,” I interrupted him, coolly enough, though not, in truth, unmoved by this sudden and unexpected sympathy—“ay, but it shall, and must! Guiltless I am, and guiltless will I be proved, before my peers! But here is the pinch of this matter. This lady—my most unhappy bride— hath for her unworthy cousin that dog De Chateaufort!—would God I had but stricken one good blow, this morning, when I held him by the lying throat!—For love of her estates, hath he persecuted her as man nor devil ever persecuted woman! For love of her estates, hath he torn her from the arms of me, her lawful husband, and immured her in a dungeon! For love of her estates, thrice hath he sought my life by the assassin's weapon; and now would seek it, murderously as before, by the perverted sword of justice! 'Twas but this day I rescued her. Now, D'Erlach, for her—for her—I shame not to confess it—I am a COWARD! But swear to me that thou wilt shield her to the death! Swear to me by your own and country's honour—by the God of your fathers, and your hopes of life hereafter—swear that you will place her, as soon as may be, under the protection of the great Condé,—swear this, and—I fear nothing!” “That shall I do,” he answered—“that shall I do, by God!” “Isabel,” I cried, in tones which I struggled hard to render calm—“Isabel, I commit you to the charge of this true gentleman,—to the protection of Him who only can protect. Farewell! D'Erlach, to you I give my sword; keep it, as you would keep your honour, bright and untarnished. Farewell, and remember!” The provost-marshal passed his arm through my own, his men fell into close array before us and in our rear, and we proceeded swiftly through the moonlight camp towards the pavilion of the maréchal. “This is a painful duty, sir,” said D'Harcourt, as I was brought before him, with an affectation of candour and sympathy, although a sneer of self-satisfied resentment played over his saturnine features. “The prisoner whom you sent in this morning hath brought such charges against you— such clear charges—that, by my soul, it is my duty to hold you in security to answer them!” “At your will, sir!” I answered. “To you shall I make no defence, knowing you my enemy! Thus much, however: this prisoner, whose word you dare—ay, dare, sir—dare I said—and when my arms shall be unfettered by the verdict of my peers, you shall right strictly answer for this daring!— this prisoner is an attainted traitor!—this prisoner is, by the laws of war, amenable to instant penalty, as the defender of a position grossly untenable; and further as the attempted murderer of a herald! Five hundred eyes beheld me fall, this very day of Jesus, beneath his shot, a flag of truce in my hands, and a friendly summons on my lips! Look to it, count, how you shall answer for your present actions to the prince, hereafter!” “Best think of your own defence, sir,” was his reply; “for, by my soul, I deem it will go hardly with you else!” “You dare not,” I answered, “hold me to trial here: the charges are not such as fall within the jurisdiction of a court-martial; and if they were, you have no peers of mine, whereof to call one! I claim to be sent into Paris, with the dawn, to make befitting answer to mine equals; and, it may be, to call you to a heavy reckoning!” “In this respect, sir, I shall pleasure you,” he again sneeringly replied; “retaining the lady—” He was interrupted by the sudden entrance of an officer, pale and terrified, with his sword drawn, and garments much disordered. “My lord, there is a movement in the camp— the Switzers have rushed to their weapons, and are in fierce rebellion; the cavalry, too, with all their officers, are getting under arms—we fear violence!” “Fear, sir!” shouted D'Harcourt—“fear is no word for men—much less for officers!—if the Swiss dogs rebel, we will right shortly send them howling to their kennels! Beat the alarm!—sound trumpets!—let the troops of Weimar get into their array! Look to the prisoner, provost-marshal!” The trumpets sounded to arms, and were answered, throughout every quarter of the camp, by the heavy tramp of disciplined men, the clash of weapons, and the shouts of officers and orderlies. But over all, and through all, rang the hoarse roar of the Switzers, “Unterwald and Uri!” and ever and anon the bugles of the cavalry, pealing in their wild symphonies, were mingled with the cheery shout of, “France—Mornington for France and Condé!” Before the troops of Weimar could be assembled—and half of them were averse to action—the Switzers, in spite of D'Erlach, had seized the magazines, imprisoned the officers, and turned the ordnance from the breastworks upon the quarters of the maréchal. In ten minutes' space the same officer rushed in, accompanied by a dozen others, all dismayed, and evidently hopeless of resistance. “How now, sirs! are the men of Weimar ready? Let them advance, and, if it needs be, fire; justice shall hold her own!” “They are not ready, sir; nor will they stir a foot, much less discharge an arquebuse, in this same matter. Your own body-guard are alone faithful!” “Then let them fire on the mutineers!” “'Twere madness, sir, rank madness! They number scarce five hundred, and the mutineers as many thousands!” “Do you dispute my will, sir? Before God! an you do not my bidding, you shall first share the punishment of mutiny! Away, sir, to your duty!” But it was in vain; for the next instant the red glare of a thousand torches gleamed through the canvass walls; and the hoarse cries of the mutineers came close and terrible. I saw it was the VOL. II.—Q moment to interpose—I stepped a pace forward, and with a steady eye addressed my enemy:— “The time is come,” I said, “when I might triumph, were I what you have dared to name me! But I at least will fill the duties of a soldier and a man! Let me go forth, and speak with these unruly men; and, by mine honour, the mutiny shall cease!” “So deal not I with traitors—sooner will I die!” “Death! Death!” shouted the mutineers without—“Death! or De Mornington!” and the remnant of D'Harcourt's guard was actually driven into the presence of its commander—disarmed, and utterly defeated. “Slay me this ringleader!” shouted the count, maddened by obstinacy, and rendered desperate by his defeat—“Up with him to the tent-poles; let his followers see the meed they have brought on their general!” The terrified guards of the provost in vain remonstrated—the field-officers protested—and at length positively refused obedience. In the next moment the canvass of the pavilion was rent into a thousand pieces; the tent-poles broken; the cords severed by the sword and halberd! We stood— prisoner and judge—accuser and accused—in the centre of a circle of twice two thousand men, desperate and successful mutineers! D'Harcourt unsheathed his rapier—had one blow been stricken every officer must have perished. With a light spring I vaulted on the table, which fortunately had not been overset in the confusion. “Hear me,” I cried, in high, clear notes; “hear me, ye cavaliers of France, and ye free Switzers! You have mistaken, not yourselves, but me— me, whom you would thus rescue! Think you so basely of me, then, my fellow-soldiers—think you so basely of the man who has already led you— led you—I will say the words—to glory,—as that he could shrink from justice! There is no safety to the innocent, but in the law; and in the law put I my trust! But I speak not to men of reason—nor plead I to my equals! Soldiers! I do command you—`ground your arms!'—Down with those rebel pikes! Now, let me see the slave that dares to disobey me!” From the moment in which I first spoke to them there had been a dead silence—a breathless pause. I was listened to with the deepest attention: and now, though from the farthest crowd there did arise a cry of—“Save him, despite himself!—Rescue for Mornington!”—the pikes of the front ranks were lowered, and the butts of a thousand arquebuses rang heavily, as they were grounded at my bidding. “Now, men and soldiers,” I continued, “since, as men and soldiers I may now address ye, will I speak to your senses; now will I plead for you with my friend the Maréchal D'Harcourt, that ye may be restored, without disgrace or punishment, to your old standing in his favour—pledging myself and my own honour, that ye offend not in the like again! For myself, at my own pleasure go I to Paris, under honourable ward, to clear my good name from the calumnies of a false traitor; and here, before you all, I take the time to thank our common leader, the noble Cômte D'Harcourt, that he hath given me this prompt occasion to prove my innocence! I doubt not, he will grant the escort of a troop of mine own cavalry, to assure mine and my lady's safety; and that, with the same party, he will pledge his stainless word to send in my accuser! I speak not this for my own satisfaction—for, by St. George, I doubt not, nor fear any thing—but to show you—men misguided as ye are, and maddened—the terms on which we stand—I and the Cômte D'Harcourt!” The popular mind was touched—the proverbial fickleness of mobs was proved once more! The very men who, but a few short moments before, were brandishing their thirsty weapons—thirsty for the blood of their commander—now answered my rude eloquence, if eloquence it were, with a full-mouthed and hearty shout! “Live! live! our noble leaders—live, Mornington and D'Harcourt!” The tumult was already at an end; and, making a virtue of necessity, my obstinate old enemy, who was nevertheless, despite his rankling hatred, more moved by my forbearance than he would have been willing to admit, offered me his hand, as I descended from my elevated station, with some show at least of cordiality; pledging himself, in the most unreserved manner, to all which I had promised in his behalf; thanking me for my noble conduct; and expressing himself fully confident that my trial must result in full and honourable acquittal! Nothing further remained to be done: the mutineers dispersed peaceably to their several quarters; the heavy ordnance was restored to its proper situation; the officers were released from their temporary restraint; the night sentinels hurried to their posts; and all around seemed eager, by their alacrity and prompt obedience, to efface the remembrance of their late misconduct. As far as I was myself concerned, nothing could have fallen out better; for, although I expected much future inconvenience and annoyance, I could not anticipate much of peril, from charges so absurdly Q 2 unfounded as those on which I stood arraigned. For the rest, I was assured, by my knowledge of D'Harcourt's fears and policy, if not of his probity, that his faith would be strictly preserved; that I should be sent, in company with Isabel, to Paris, where all disputes and doubts would be brought to a speedy and just solution; and that my enemy would be under the same restraint with myself and so prevented from any further machinations against my life, my happiness, or my honour. For that night I was kept, indeed, under honourable arrest in the quarters of the commander. I was allowed to see my old servant, whom I had fixed upon as one of my own escort, and, through him, to communicate with Isabel; and, although by no means free from care for the future, contrary I believe to the common course of things, I slept calmly and soundly till the morning's dawn. With the break of day I was informed that the detachment, consisting of an entire regiment of D'Harcourt's German cavalry, was in readiness. I was permitted to select the officers, and even privates, of my own guard of honour; and, having pledged my sacred word for myself and escort, that I would not attempt either to escape or to communicate with Isabel—for whom a horse-litter had been provided—received my sword from the hands of D'Harcourt himself, with a compliment of far more neatness than sincerity; and mounting my good Bayard, rode forth as a prisoner from the lines in which I had so lately commanded, accompanied by my wife—nominally as a hostage for my safe-conduct—and by the captive of my own sword, and an attainted traitor to boot, as my accuser! So much for popularity and power—so much for the stability of mortal things!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. “I therefore bring the tribute of my praise To your severity, and commend the justice That will not, for the many services That any man hath done the commonwealth, Wink at his least of ills.” The Fatal Dowry. Although we spent many days on the road to Paris, nothing beyond the wonted changes of the vernal weather, from rain to sunshine, or from calm to storm, befell our party. We plodded onward in dull and monotonous silence. Night after night we halted at some petty town, or solitary hamlet, where guards were set and countersigns exchanged with as much regularity as would have become the purlieus of a beleaguered camp; and, morning after morning, we resumed our wearisome march. Through storm or shine, through the chill dews of the evening and the already oppressive heats of noon—on! on! still onward! No martial music, cheering the hearts of man and beast alike—no fluttering of banners—no song or shout rising from the ranks, and relieving the tedium of the day—no merriment round the nightly fire! For a stern disciplinarian, a martinet in camp and on parade, though perhaps no first-rate leader in a stricken field, was the old German who commanded the detachment. To me, indeed, he acted with all the courtesy that could be looked for in my doubtful situation; towards Isabel—whom, but for a moment, as she mounted or dismounted from the Spanish jennet, which she preferred to the confinement of a litter, I never saw, or spoke with, from the time of our departure till we reached the gates of Paris—he bore himself with the deferential yet distant politeness that was perhaps the most proper line of conduct he could have then adopted;—but to De Chateaufort—or De Penthiêvre, as he should now be called—he was, as I have subsequently learned, short and abrupt in his demeanour, to the very verge of insult; keeping him constantly beneath his own eye, causing two files of troopers to ride with ready arquebuse and lighted match beside his bridle-rein, and constantly reminding him that the slightest attempt at evasion or escape would be followed by a close and certain volley. Me, on the contrary, he permitted, having at the first accepted my parole of honour, to ride in whatever part of the column it listed me, with the sole restriction that I should seek no communication with my wife; who, attended by Lydford, and by a peasant maiden lately pressed into her service, rode somewhat apart from our line of march, escorted by De Charmi and the troop of my own cavalry, for which I had stipulated with the maréchal on the night of my arrest. So painful, however, was the restraint, so torturing the suspense, and, above all, so exquisitely miserable the sensation of constant vicinity to the idol of my heart, accompanied by total exclusion from her sweet society, that no shipwrecked mariner, upon his lonely isle of ocean, ever looked forth more anxiously to spy some gliding sail upon the far horizon, than did I to see the gate even of my dungeon—for such, I was too well assured, would be my next abode. While we were yet distant many leagues from the metropolis, we learned that the court and the Frondeurs were engaged in constant and friendly negotiation; and that there was scarcely a doubt to be entertained but that we should find Mazarin reinstated in the Palais Royal, on our return, in all the plenitude of his power and greatness. And so indeed we did. It was on a calm and lovely evening in the earlier part of May that we arrived at St. Denys: the sun was fast sinking below the horizon; and, as we entered the suburbs of the little borough, the report of the evening-gun announced that the watch was set, and the gates of Paris closed till the morning's light. Here then were we compelled to wait another weary night; and that, too, under more of restraint than I had heretofore experienced. A sentinel was actually posted within the chamber in which I slept, and all communication, even with Lydford or De Charmi, thus effectually prevented. For this, however, I cared the less, that I had already furnished both of these trusty friends with full instructions as to their proceedings in my behalf on reaching the metropolis; and had even provided the former with letters to the Prince of Condé, possessing him of the features of my arrest and accusation, and eagerly claiming his unforgotten promise of friendship and protection. At a very early hour of the ensuing morning I learned that a courier had been despatched to Mazarin on the previous night, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour; and that he had returned with despatches to the colonel of the regiment to whose custody I had been delivered; and with directions, the purport of which was explained to me ere long, in a way far more summary at least, if less intelligible, than words. My sword was taken from me; I was even ironed, heavily and disgracefully ironed— submitting to all indignities with a patience caused only by a desire to conciliate—and seated in a carriage between two tall and gloomy-looking Germans armed to the teeth. It was in vain that I inquired what would be my destination; that I passionately entreated that I might be permitted to have an interview with my wife, if but for a moment, and in the presence of twenty witnesses: it was in vain! the door of the carriage was secured, the blinds drawn closely, and we were whirled along at the utmost speed of six strong Flanders mares; while the clang of hoofs and the jingling of spurs and scabbards announced that we were accompanied by a powerful escort. After driving at a rapid pace for the better part of an hour, we stopped suddenly; and I could hear, although indistinctly, that some military formalities were taking place between the leader of our escort and an officer on duty. In a few moments we were again in motion; and I could readily perceive, by the hollow sound of the horses' feet and the deep rumbling of the wheels, that we were in the act of crossing a drawbridge—probably one of the barriers of the city; another moment passed, and the rattle of the wheels over the rough pavement announced the truth of my conjecture. For half an hour more we proceeded at a slower and more cautious rate; we again stopped; we crossed another drawbridge, passed beneath an archway so deep and gloomy that I was sensible of an increase of darkness even in the dim twilight of the closed carriage! the door was opened! the truth—the fearful truth flashed on my mind—I was a prisoner in the horrible Bastile. Around me were the truculent officials of that dark prison-house; above me its gigantic towers, bristling with culverin and cannon; and beneath my feet, beneath the massive pavements of the court in which I stood, were the dark subterraneous vaults, to which perhaps, even now, letters de cachet had consigned me, never again to look upon the light of day. I gazed around me anxiously, but my eye fell not upon a single face of sympathy or friendship. There was no insult, no rudeness, but no commiseration! There was a business-like air in the proceedings of the military jailers, a calm, every-day insensibility in their demeanour, which was perhaps more fearful, because less exciting, than would have been the most violent outrage, the most vile indignity. There was, however, no room for appeal or for resistance: to have complained or reasoned would have been undignified; to have contended with such things as those about me, alike unsoldierlike, unmanly, and degrading. VOL. II.—R “Lead on!” I said, folding my arms upon my breast; “lead on! to the scaffold, if you will—I am prepared!” “Not yet, sir—not that yet!” was the ruffian-like reply; “though, for aught I see, 'tis like enough to follow! But come, sir, we will show you your abiding-place; 'tis stronger, I assure you, if less lightsome, than the Palais Royal!” and he would have laid his hand on my shoulder. “Back, dog!” I cried, my fierce passion mastering my better judgment; “the like of you I touch not, save with the riding-rod or with the sword!” “Somewhat too ready with the latter, methinks,”—the warder sneered again—“for the safety of your neighbours, or, for that matter, of yourself! and, after all, there is not so much difference between a murderer and him who turns the key on him—Sacristie!” “Beware!” I cried, now moved beyond all bounds of temper; “beware, low fellow!—my imprisonment can be but of short duration, and you shall answer to the Prince de Condé right shrewdly for this outrage on his officer.” “To the prince?—outrage?” The man absolutely laughed aloud. “Ventre St. Gris! 'tis at the prince's order you stand thus committed; and, for the shortness of your durance, methinks your shrift is like to prove yet shorter, and your life most short of all! Here,” he continued, “Bernhard and Jeanneton, here, lead this gallant to the cell of old Balue! I had designed him for a turret lodging, but he waxes malapert, and by my faith shall pay it with his person! Away with him!” Perceiving at once the folly of suffering myself to be annoyed by the insolence of a fellow like this, and the impolicy of irritating one who had evidently the power of rendering my condition even more insupportable than it was at present, I bridled my indignant passion, and, without another word, quietly followed the steps of the chief warder. Through many a winding passage—so dank and low-browed in their squat and shapeless arches that they resembled excavations from the rock, rather than vaults of masonry—down many a flight of steps—faintly and fearfully lighted by here and there a lurid lantern—far from the blessed light of day, we dived into the haunts of misery and guilt. At length we reached, as it would seem, the lowest pit. The floor was, indeed, a living rock, as were a portion of the walls; while from them hung many a long stalactite, formed by the incessant moisture, that fell with a dull plashing sound—the only one which broke these fearful solitudes—upon the natural pavement. A low door of iron was before us—the key grated in the wards, the heavy leaves revolved, and I was thrust into my cheerless habitation. It was a long, low hall—as I viewed it dimly by the light of the jailer's torch—supported by a dozen massy pillars, bearing rings of iron riveted or morticed firmly into their sides. But the object on which my eye fell most suddenly was the horrible invention from which the cell had derived its name—the horrible invention of him who, like the framer of the classic bull, was doomed to be the first victim of his own ingenious cruelty—the iron cage of Balue! There it stood—dark and rusty, but still perfect, although centuries had passed over it—a fearful monument of human misery and superhuman malice. “St. George!” I cried, involuntarily recoiling, bold and young as I then was, at the idea of confinement in such a spot—“St. George! but ye will not leave me here!” “Ay, will we, by St. Denys!” he replied. “The durance of monsieur will be so brief that it will scarce be tedious. Good repose to you, sir; and next time, an you will take my advice, you will have learned that civil words cost nothing. Good repose!” With a hoarse laugh he left me. And lucky was it for him, and I doubt not for myself, that he so left me; for I was wrought to desperation, and, although unarmed, such was my power and activity at the period of which I write, that the struggle would have been severe between us, although it must in the end have terminated in favour of the odds. As it was, the key was turned upon me, and I knew myself a prisoner, at the very point of time in which I hurled myself against the door. With another sneering laugh the ruffians withdrew. I listened to the sound of their retiring footsteps till they were lost in distance, with no certainty that I should ever hear again the step of living man. Hundreds had vanished from the face of earth during the sovereignty of Richelieu, never to be heard of more—the secret dagger—the cord —the bowl—or, surer and more terrible than all, the wasting agonizing famine had consumed them! Why should it not me likewise? For a while these fantasies crowded thick and incessant on my brain; but by a mighty effort I repulsed them. I had heard of men who had been driven frantic by their own imaginings, who had even lost the knowledge of their own immortal essence, who had grown enamoured of their prison-houses, careless of themselves, debased, and brutified; and I resolved at once that so should it never be with me! I arranged my thoughts, I called up all my constitutional R 2 courage to my aid, all my habitual coolness and decision; nor did they desert me at my need. After a few hours I felt satisfied—satisfied even in the cheerless gloom of that miserable dungeon—that, whatever might be the hatred of my enemies, there could exist no sufficient causes for my destruction. Mazarin, with all his deception, all his craft, and all his grasping ambition, was never wantonly or unnecessarily cruel; neither could there exist any reasons to render my death or removal desirable to the court. Offence I might have given—suspicion might be aroused against me; yet I had done too much to benefit, while I possessed too little power to injure. I was at once an object of too great importance to be cast aside or annihilated for any interest of trivial moment; and of too little public weight to make the danger and trouble of my destruction inferior in consideration to its necessity. Condé, I was assured, would not forsake me in my need. Anne of Austria, too, as far as men may judge of princes, was well inclined towards me; and Mazarin himself had stronger motives for assisting than for attacking me. Thus mused I amid the thick and, as it were, palpable darkness of my living tomb; and ere six hours had passed away, the correctness of my opinions was proved. A footstep was heard approaching—it drew near—was stationary at the entry of my cell. A turning-box in the door revolved; it contained a lighted lamp, food, water, and a change of raiment. And I, anxious and broken-spirited as I had cause to be, ate, drank, composed my spirits, and arranged my dress. I wandered to and fro the sounding vault; I read the scrawled legends of human misery that were graven—a dark registry—upon the walls. I took no note of hours, but in the wasting of my lamp; it waned, expired, and I was once again in utter darkness. Coolly and fearlessly I rolled myself in the voluminous cloak which I had fortunately retained upon my person; and, extending my body on the rugged pavement, slept no less soundly than I had often done on the fragrant turf and beneath the pure canopy of heaven. If the fetters were about my limbs, my soul was chainless; and there was a buoyant confidence in my spirit that rendered me, not merely equal, but superior to this last affliction! I know not how long I had lain thus, buried in slumber and insensible to all my hardships, when I was aroused suddenly by a light glaring into my eyes. I sprang to my feet, prepared on the instant to do battle for my life; but the man who stood over me had none of the murderous intentions which I had been prompt to suspect. He was one of the warders of the Bastile, but, by his dress alike and his demeanour, of higher rank than those who had treated me with such indignity on the preceding day. “This must be amended,” he muttered to himself, before he addressed me—“this must be amended, sir. Will it please you rise and follow me to a more beseeming chamber—prison though it be?” “As you will,” I replied; “but to the prisoner it matters little whether his state be one degree more tolerable or no. Nevertheless, I thank you for your courtesy.” But, although I carried it off thus lightly, my heart did indeed leap cheerily, as I left those damp and desolate apartments, and climbed the long, long staircases that led to the genial realms of that day which never might penetrate those subterranean caverns. The blessed sunlight streamed upon my soul with a consolation, a happiness, and a power; the very courtyard, which had yesterday appeared so dark and dungeon-like—such is the force of contrast—looked blithe and beautiful! The air, which I had fancied, even then, to partake of the gloom and chillness of a jail, murmured freshly, and with a voice of music about my temples. The sunshine, the air, and above all the comparative liberty, were ministers of Hope! In a few moments I was again immured in a small chamber, in an upper turret, light in itself and neatly furnished, though the casements, in addition to their being some two hundred feet above the level of the yard they overlooked, were crossed and recrossed by heavy bars of iron. Here, too, was I furnished with plain but wholesome food, and with a cup of wine, not perhaps of the first growth, but passable enough. Linen and all the necessaries or luxuries of the toilet were provided, nor were books denied to me. But still, although I compelled myself to use them—although I divided my prison-day into allotted portions of time wherein to trim my beard and hair; to take such exercise as the limits of my cell afforded; to read; to eat my solitary meals— although I tasked my spirit to all this, with a view to banishing the tedium and monotony, and to defeating that careless and despairing languor which has eaten into many a noble spirit when pining in hopeless solitude—still, as sun after sun rose and set, and I received no tidings, underwent no change of condition, my heart did in truth begin to sink—despondency was fast creeping over me—my eye was growing dim, and my cheek hollow—the cankering iron was making inroads into my soul. On the tenth day of my captivity, for the first time I omitted the wonted distribution of my time—my hair remained untrimmed, my garb unchanged, my food untasted. I was sitting by the narrow window, watching till the great sun should sink beneath the wilderness of walls that bounded my horizon, and drawing half-credited omens from the flood of lurid and bloodlike light which he poured through the smoke and haze of the metropolis upon the gray towers of the prisonfortress. “I bring you tidings, sir,” cried a voice from behind, of one who had entered my cell unobserved— “good tidings, an you be innocent. The Parliament is even now in session, and to-morrow you shall be judged!” “Ha! this is, indeed, in all events good tidings; for, trust me, I would sooner fall by axe and block in the free sunshine, than die thus, like a murrained sheep, in the closed atmosphere of earth's most brilliant palace!” My informant was the warder, who had alone demeaned himself towards me courteously; but, beyond this, he was unable or unwilling, perhaps both, to give me any information; but even this had raised me from the abyss of mental gloom to hope and to anticipated joy. The moments flew briefly, though morning found me not, as heretofore, a sleeper. With the dawn I arose, arranged my long hair with more than my accustomed care, curled my mustache, and dressed myself with as much of splendour as my scanty wardrobe would permit; nor did I hesitate to fling the rich scarf of white and gold, which marked the royal party, with the swordless scabbard attached to it, across my shoulders. I felt that to be innocent was not enough, if I should seem despondent; and desperately I assumed an air of confidence and joy which in good truth I felt not. Nay, more than this, when my morning meal was set before me, although I loathed the very sight of food, I did violence to my feelings—I broke bread and ate, I quaffed a goblet of the thin wine of Gascoigny which had been set before me, and I arose strengthened, if not refreshed. Another hour passed, and I was summoned! “I go,” I cried exultingly—“I go as to my bridal-feast, rejoicing!” and I learned afterward that this brief sentence was not without its influence. I reached the courtyard, and there was drawn out a guard, an escort of the royal Switzers, in their rich uniforms of white and purple, with morion and halbered, plume and scarf, glancing and fluttering in the cloudless morning. The governor of the Bastile himself stepped forward, and offering me his ceremonious greeting, delivered me to the custody of the fiscal, who stood ready to receive me with the captain of the guard. The soldiers formed around us in serried files; the word was given to march, and in silence I was conducted from those sad precincts. At the outer gate stood a carriage, into which, with the civil officers, I was at once desired to enter. We drove slowly forward, and in half an hour reached the gateway of the Hotel de Ville. The ponderous vehicle stopped short; the guard closed up, forming a lane from the carriage to the doors of the building—a lane of serried steel; and still at every step the Switzers fell in behind me, offering no chance or possibility of escape, had I been so mad as to attempt it. Thus was I conducted into the great hall of justice: the presidents were already in session, with their chief, the upright and noble-minded Molè, at their head. From such men as these I had but little cause for apprehension, even though I perceived that the celebrated Talon, as advocate-general, was about to exert his unrivalled powers in favour of the prosecution. The vast apartment was crowded —the space below the bar with advocates and counsellors; and the long galleries, extending from the ceiling to the floor, with anxious and wondering spectators: on either hand the bar, at which were placed two scribes, or secretaries, with their writing materials, to enter the proceedings, hung a huge crimson curtain, behind whose folds I could readily judge, by their sudden and unnatural waving, that some persons, most probably the witnesses, were concealed, until the time should arrive when they were destined to appear. Slowly I cast my eyes around the gathered concourse, but I found not one familiar face; hundreds were there whom I had seen in casual encounters, whose names I could have remembered, without perhaps much effort, but not a single one of those whom I had called my friends. My heart for a moment sunk within me; but I manned it—I manned it with the reflection, that on my own bearing, on my own calmness, on my own wielding of the intellectual sword, the victory of that day would probably depend. The huzzars—so are the inferior officers of justice denominated in France—the huzzars led me to a seat immediately below the bar; and, after a few moments' consultation, Talon arose, and whispered VOL. II.—S to a crier, who stood below, waiting the orders of the court; and the immediate result was a proclamation, in loud and sonorous tones— “Hear, all men, hear!—and first, hear, Harry Mornington—styled major-general, in the service of the most Christian king—hear thou!—Thou standest here charged with these heinous misdemeanours, crimes, and felonies:—Neglect of duty towards your king—Murder done and completed on the persons of François de Chateaufort and Charles de Chateaufort the younger, of Jacques Menard their body servant, Jean Dumas their ecuyer, and Amelie Menard, fille—The forcible bearing off and subsequent seduction of Isabel de Chateaufort, commonly known as Isabel de Coucy, and wrongfully styled Isabel de Mornington,—by which thou hast persuaded or compelled the said Isabel to live with thee, as a wife with her husband, no legal marriage existing, to the great injury of her family and the deep dishonour of her name—And lastly, with having, by the aid of some priest unknown, unlawfully and feloniously wedded the same Isabel de Chateaufort, the permission of her next of kin, or the signature of his gracious majesty, not having been appended to such contract, which is therefore void, invalid, and illegal! “How sayest thou, Harry Mornington—standest thou here prepared to submit thee to the mercy of the court, or dost thou rather claim thy trial?” “The charges,” I replied, “which I have this day heard advanced against me, are foul, malignant, and false-hearted lies! and so—by the blessing and the aid of the Eternal—so shall I prove them! Of your laws, your customs, or your justice, I know nothing; but, well aware that it is not for the prisoner to impugn the will of his judges, I do claim full inquiry and free justice— pleading, in the first instance, that I am, in this matter, guiltless, upon my honour!” Again there was a pause—again a whispered consultation—and again the herald's voice broke the silence which brooded so deeply over that concourse. “Prisoner, wilt thou be tried according to the laws of this most great and ancient realm; swearing upon the blessed crucifix, and by thy hopes of the salvation that cometh thence—swearing to speak the truth before this court, and in the presence of your God?” “I swear!” was my brief and almost stern reply. After another pause, in which a third discussion seemed to be agitating the court, I was asked whether I would first be tried on the first arrêt— for breach of duty! “It recks me little how I be tried, or when, so it be shortly. But if it be deemed justice to bring a prisoner from his dungeon to the judgment-hall ignorant of the matter charged against him, ignorant of his accusers, without the opportunity of summoning a single witness, and there to pit the keenest wits of your best lawyers against a single soldier—may the court pardon my abruptness—I term such justice mere judicial murder!” Without seeming even to have heard the words of my bold appeal, the court again signified their intentions to the crier, and again I was questioned:— “Harry de Mornington, standest thou before the court innocent or guilty of the alleged breach of duty towards your king?” “Before God, not guilty! And may one plea suffice, to all the charges I have but one—before my God, not guilty!” “The court gives license to the advocate-general to proceed!” Talon then stepped forward, and, in a few words, declared, that the breach of duty having been investigated by military judges already, and their decision having proved favourable to the prisoner, he was directed to withdraw the charge! The court consulted again for a moment or two, and proclamation was made, that “The court are of opinion, and therefore solemnly pronounce that the prisoner is NOT GUILTY of the alleged breach of military duty!” “Gentlemen of the court,” continued Talon, “and you, monsieur the president, to you shall I right shortly prove the murder of the noble youths named at length in the proclamation of the court, no less than of their body-servants; the former of whom fell by the shot of a concealed assassin—the latter in gallantly attempting to arrest the prisoner after the commission of the deed! Painful as it may be to my own feelings thus to be called on to accuse a gentleman whose gallantry in the field, and whose devotion to his king, are heretofore undoubted, I must remind you, gentlemen of the court, that guilt comes not at once, or suddenly; it may lie dormant in the breast of men of virtuous seeming—dormant for years—but when it doth break forth, openly, boldly, manifestly, as it hath done in this instance, which we shall prove hereafter, no character, however high, no virtue, however evident and noble, may avail to set aside the proof! Gentlemen, I shall delay the court no further; the prisoner hath confessed that he is unprovided with a single witness S 2 —we of the prosecution are not so unfortunate; although one of our most important was cut off— as it is well supposed, by the hand of him who stands before you—on the fatal field of Charenton. Enough, however, we do still possess to establish, beyond a doubt, the guilt of this brave, but, I regret to use the words, most guilty gentleman! Will the court cause the following papers to be read—duly recorded and attested, as it will not fail to notice, by the president of the courts judicial at Bar le Duc?” The assent of the court was instantly granted; and the crier recited, or read aloud, a long and sufficiently well-connected string of evidence, professing to be the affidavit of Eugene Lacretelle, body-servant to the Duke de Penthiêvre, since slain at the battle of Charenton! The purport was this—that on the morning of the twelfth of January, he, the witness, was engaged in escorting—together with Jacques Menard, mentioned in the indictment, as also with Charles de Chateaufort the younger—a carriage, occupied by François de Chateaufort, Isabel de Chateaufort, and Amelie Menard, the attendant of the lady. That he was so engaged by order of monsieur, the then Duke de Penthiêvre; and that he had been accompanied, until just before the catastrophe, by Achille de Chateaufort, the present duke; that the object of their mission was to conduct Isabel de Chateaufort, suspected of indiscretion, to a nunnery near St. Mihiel. That they had reached the high-road from Vitry to Bar le Duc about a quarter of an hour; had taken a relay of horses, and left their escort in the rear. That he himself, with Jacques Menard, who drove as postillion, and Charles de Chateaufort the younger, were now the only persons left in attendance on the carriage, but that, being on a public and frequented road, they still apprehended nothing of peril. That upon entering a dense tract of woodlands—the witness being then some twenty paces in the rear—a shot was fired from the covert, which took deadly effect on the postillion, Jacques Menard; a second, which brought down the horse of Charles de Chateaufort; and then a third, which, as subsequently ascertained, slew Amelie Menard; that the witness immediately drew rein, and galloped back, with a view to bringing up the relay to the rescue; but not before he saw a person, whom he has since ascertained to be one Harry Mornington, major-general and chef d'escadron in the royal service, rush out and strike down the aforesaid Charles de Chateaufort by a thrust of his rapier; that, before the witness lost sight of the group, François de Chateaufort had leaped out of the carriage, and was fighting hand to hand with the murderer; that, having succeeded in overtaking the escort, the witness brought them up by the forest-roads, and nearly intercepted the prisoner; who got off, however, after a desperate resistance, in which he slew Jean Dumas by a pistol-shot, bearing with him the said Isabel de Chateaufort; and making good his retreat, by swimming the Marne, then in wintry flood. Thus closed this precious document; which, regularly signed in the presence of witnesses, and with the attested autograph of the deceased, was brought forward as the strongest evidence against me. It will be readily believed, that I exerted my whole intellect to discover the slightest defect or discrepancy in its details; that I weighed every syllable, as though my life depended on the construction of each word. It was not long ere I was satisfied! Suddenly, as I raised my eyes, I caught the glance of Talon fixed on me as though he would have read my soul—but, as our looks encountered, the phrase which had arrested my attention seemed to flash upon him likewise—for an instant's space he clearly was embarrassed; though, when he perceived that I had discovered his confusion, he turned aside, as if to examine some other documents relating to the cause. When the written affidavits had been thoroughly recited, the crier summoned Achille de Chateaufort, Duke de Penthiêvre; and, with a front of unabashed audacity, my old antagonist stepped forward. He delivered his evidence firmly, and in a well-set speech; answering all questions readily; and bearing the cross-examination—by which some of the younger advocates attempted, from pure love, as it seemed, of mischief and chicanery, to disconcert him— with an air of lofty and unmoved integrity! The sum of that which he stated was in all respects corroborative of the testimony that had been previously introduced, with the additional sanction derived from the oath of an eye-witness. He swore that he entertained no malice against me, the prisoner, further than the natural desire of bringing the murderer of his brother, and the seducer of his cousin, to the sword of justice; and that he had no views in this proceeding, save the public good. Observing, further, that had not his feelings on the latter point been peculiarly strong and vivid, he should hardly have been willing, even to avenge the slaughter of his beloved kinsmen, to render the misfortunes of his house a subject of common parlance, and of ribald calumny. His statement went to prove that Isabel de Chateaufort, his cousin, and the natural daughter of his maternal aunt—being a girl of light character, it had been judged expedient—by his father, her sole guardian—that she should be consigned to a nunnery, wherein her name and her dishonour might be alike forgotten. That, on the morning alluded to before, he had, as stated in the affidavit of Eugene Lacretelle, escorted his elder brothers through the forest to the causeway of Bar le Duc; the two latter, with the servants above specified, continuing to accompany their frail kinswoman after he had left them, as had been before resolved. That barely a quarter of an hour had elapsed from the time of his leaving them, ere Eugene Lacretelle returned at a hard gallop, with the intelligence that the carriage had been waylaid, and his younger brother murdered by an unknown assassin. That immediately he rushed to the rescue with all his followers, and arrived in time to witness the death of François by the hands of the prisoner, and nearly captured him on the spot; although, by the goodness of his horse, and by his desperate fighting, he had finally succeeded in bearing off the guilty girl, whose indiscretion had been the cause of so much misery. That he had himself subsequently rescued his cousin from her foul seducer, and had been prevented only by the civil conflicts from bringing on this prosecution at an earlier date—and that he had now only been enabled to do so by the courtesy and high honour of the Comte D'Harcourt, who had moreover saved his life from the same weapon which had drunk the life-blood of his brethren. “And wherefore,” I asked him, the moment he had concluded his statement—“and wherefore was it deemed necessary to procure the written evidence of an eye-witness, who, though subsequently slain, was then in good health, and easy to be produced in court at any moment?” “Men's lives, as the prisoner well knows,” De Chateaufort sneeringly replied, “are easily cut short; and it was deemed advisable to have some legal documents, whereby to establish the guilt of Monsieur Mornington, should he succeed—as he has too surely done—in removing the obnoxious witness!” “Ha, sir,” I replied; “and in addition to his other merits, this most egregious witness was a prophet?—is it not so?” A bright smile shot across the countenance of Molè; and he addressed me cheeringly in the spirit of his speech, though the tone was severe, and the words harsh. “How mean you, prisoner—a prophet?—dare you to make sport of this matter—or to contemn the court?” “With all humility, monsieur the president, and with all due acknowledgment of mine own ignorance, I would advance in my defence—and pray the noble court now sitting to observe that this Eugene Lacretelle must indeed have been a very prophet! Here, in this paper,—dated and regularly signed on the twenty-ninth day of January past—the very gallant and most upright gentleman who, for the public good, has sworn to some score or two of gross and slavish lies against the life of a man who never injured him or his—against the honour of his own persecuted cousin—this very gallant gentleman, this honest, patriotic prosecutor, is styled the present Duke of Penthiêvre, and his yet baser sire the then duke! Now—may it please the president to look somewhat the more closely into this matter—he will find that the said worthy sire of this worthy son was in full life some three weeks later than the date of this same document, and some two weeks later than the death of the pretended signer. So much for the statement of Eugene Lacretelle! Ha! sir, doth not this pinch you the more closely?” A low hum of approbation ran through the court, and, though it was checked on the instant from the judgment-seat, a corresponding movement took place—a shuddering movement, as of intense excitement—among the assembled lawyers. “The prisoner is correct, monsieur the advocate,” uttered the deep voice of the stately president; “there hath been foul play, and most foul perjury in this! Hast thou, sir, aught to advance, why we dismiss not this complaint?” Talon arose, but slowly, and evidently disconcerted; still, however, he endeavoured to maintain his ground—the document he allowed to be a forgery, though it had escaped his own notice, and he smiled strangely as he spoke—but yet the evidence of Penthiêvre himself—whose character alone would vouch for his having been deceived, not a deceiver in this matter—was unimpeached, and must be disproved. “And it shall be so!” I cried; “an the court will grant me a delay, to summon witnesses.” “There may be no delay,” was the president's reply; “but call your witnesses—it may be they are even now in court.” “Isabel de Mornington!” “Isabel de Mornington!” repeated the clear voice of the crier—“Isabel de Mornington, witness in the prisoner's behalf, stand forth!” Slowly the crimson curtain was drawn aside, and there—supported on the right and the left by the great Condé, and, stranger yet, by the Benedictine prior who had united us in that tie which VOL. II.—T the malignant slave before me had so feloniously laboured to dissever—there stood my lost, my virgin bride!—Pale she was—pale as the snow-drift of December. Agitation was in her manner, at times almost overpowering—shame and sorrow seemed to sweep across her mind, in one wild deluge, obliterating every sense beside—yet was there no doubt, no terror, no dismay in her calm blue eye. That eye was turned towards me with an expression of the most unutterable tenderness; a crimson flash passed like a meteor across her speaking features, and was again swallowed up in that fixed paleness. I almost feared that her presence of mind was leaving her; but I should have better known the strength of that heroic spirit. “Here!” she replied, to the summons of the crier, in those soft low tones which speak so keenly to the heart—“here stand I—Isabel de Mornington, born Isabel de Coucy—to witness in behalf of my most noble and most slandered lord, to hurl back upon the head of yon base calumniator the shame and the imputed guilt which he has striven to heap upon one whose whole life has been, through him and his, a long, long series of suffering and sorrow. Hear me, oh hear me, if you be men, and let my words prevail—they are the words of truth.” I looked to Penthiêvre: he had turned away his head—he could not brook the calm intelligence, the mute upbraiding of that most eloquent eye! As she ceased from speaking, a thrill ran through the breast of every man in that wide concourse—a deep breath was drawn by all, so simultaneously as to seem almost a sigh—and, with a smile of benevolent approbation flashing across his noble features, the president encouraged her to proceed. “Doubt nothing, lady,” he said—“doubt nothing of the calm dispassionate attendance of the court; and, above all, fear nothing. Say on, boldly and thoroughly, whatever you may know of this dark-seeming business; we are prepared to hear you, not indeed with favour, but with impartial judgment.” “The president will do well to remember,” exclaimed Talon, “that the witness claims to be wife of the prisoner, and may not, therefore, testify!” “Not upon oath!” returned Molè—“not upon oath! The court cannot forget—but pour renseignement![3] [3] French law. Codes Napoleon and Justinian. Madame de Mornington will now proceed.” “I have been,” she said, “for years an orphan, under the hard and cruel ward of the late duke, the sire of my now accuser. That the wretch,” and her lip writhed with indignation—“that the wretch before you has dared to blacken my good name, I marvel not—nor is it in aught marvellous. When for the space of years—long wasting years —they have succeeded, sire and son, in blasting the good name of my mother, in proclaiming me the child of infamy!—when a brother has murdered his own sister, by the weapon of her outraged feelings!—when, for the gain of a few sordid acres, he hath registered an oath—a perjured oath— against his own immortal soul—what marvel if the son of that same brother should seek to blight name, fame, and honour in that sister's child? But now the time hath come—the purposes of the Eternal have been fulfilled—and He hath put forth, in this matter, his terrible right hand—his workings are as evident in the witness I shall lay before you, as is the sun in heaven at noonday. That wretch, who even now is cowering and cringing beneath my words—that wretch hath sworn that, on the morning of the guilty deed which he hath charged upon the head of one whom he knows innocent, I was committed to the care of those most wretched brethren. It is false! false—as the great and holy One can witness—false as the imputation he hath dared to cast upon my woman-fame! In the dead of night—the dead of midnight, was my lonely chamber forced by the elder brother, François de Chateaufort, and by the wretched victim of his villanies, Amelie de Menard. 'Twas to no nunnery they would have borne me in that carriage, but to eternal infamy and sin. Married already to another, François de Chateaufort would have compelled me to his wedding-couch—me, the daughter of his father's sister—me, whom they have dared to stigmatize as frail and indiscreet—me, who would sooner have wedded the abhorred death! It was night, as I have said before—black night—when I was hurried into that carriage, bound and speechless! Till the dawn of day we journeyed, and, by the sounds about us, I do well believe we were escorted—as for once he hath said truly—by Achille de Chateaufort. Day broke, and we were in the forest. A shot was fired from the covert—but not, as he well knows, by this true gentleman—a shot was fired, and it did slay Jacques Menard; another, and, missing narrowly the head of François de Chateaufort, it did cut off the miserable Amelie in the very flush and rankness of her crimes!—I saw it, by the truth of Him who cannot lie—I saw the brother, Charles de Chateaufort the younger, rush from the coppice, with the weapons in his hand, and aiming desperately at the life of his own T 2 mother's son!—I saw Eugene de Lacretelle fly; and I saw François de Chateaufort leap forth, rapier in hand, to meet him! More I saw not; for the wounded girl, who had fallen upon me when she received the bullet, entwined me in her arms, dragged me into the bottom of the vehicle, and held me there until the overpowering strength of agony was conquered by the hand of death. But, even thus, I heard the shivering clash of weapons, wielded by kindred hands, for not another human being stood beside them. Anon I caught the tramp of a horse; nearer it came, and nearer. I heard a voice beseeching them `to hold their hands, if it were but for a moment!' but still the clash of steel came fast and frequent—an instant, and I heard a grapple, a fierce death-struggle, and a voice—a yelling voice—cry, `Brother, we shall meet in HELL!' My terrible companion was, at the last, stone dead. I broke from her embrace, I staggered from the carriage, and I saw that miserable guilty pair, lifeless, and cold as the frosty soil on which they lay, pierced and gored by the bloody blades that still were clutched in those fratricidal hands! Beside them stood a stranger, sorrowfully gazing at the kindred dead; he leaned upon his naked sword—but it was bloodless—bright and untarnished as his honour and my truth—that stranger was Harry Mornington! More I know not, for, with horror and disgust, I swooned. More I know not, till we were weltering in the icy waters of the Marne—my only refuge from the unrelenting hate of that all-perjured enemy, who has this day added wilful and deliberate perjury to his long list of crimes!” “It is enough,” cried Molè, starting from his seat; and with one voice the court, the advocates, ay, and the anxious and excited spectators, with one voice cried, “It is enough!” “But were it not enough,” said Condé, stepping forth, “I too can testify that, some six weeks now past, the prisoner at the bar related to me, word for word, and syllable for syllable, the evidence of that wronged lady; and, further yet, this Benedictine friar holds the confession on his death-bed— the confession prompted by late penitence—of the last Duke de Penthiêvre; for he who hath this day insulted your ears with his atrocious lies is no duke, but an attained traitor!” “Stand forth, the Benedictine!” And, throwing off his cowl, the noble priest stood forward. As De Chateaufort's eye fell on him, distracted as he was before, and guilt-stricken, he shrunk back trembling, as though in a palsy fit— “It is a spirit,” he cried, “an avenging spirit!” “No spirit,” answered the monk, in his deep voice of music—“no spirit, but most surely an avenger. I am the father Gualtier, superior of the convent of St. Benedict aux Layes; and I, as such, and knowing of her origin—knowing her to be the persecuted daughter of a murdered mother —I, in the chapel of my convent, and in the presence of two, the eldest of our brotherhood, united her to this true gentleman.” “Dared you,” cried Talon—“dared you so to unite an heiress, and a minor, without the written warrant of her next of kin?” “I did not,” to my ungovernable astonishment, was the reply; “for I held, as so in duty bound, the warrant of her next of kin.” “Display it to the court.” And, by my honour, he drew forth a strip of parchment, with a seal and signatures attached, and tendered it to the advocate without delay or hesitation. “I, Gualtier de Coucy,”—it was published by the crier—“I, Gualtier de Coucy, in the presence of two witnesses, do grant my full and free permission to my own and only daughter, Isabel de Coucy, by my true wife, born Isabel de Chateaufort, deceased, to wed with Harry Mornington, a cavalier of England, and a major-general of the most Christian king. “Given on this twelfth day of January, 1649, in this convent of St. Benedict aux Layes. Signed, “Gualtier de Coucy. “Witnessed by brothers Jerome le Noir and Ignatius Fayolle, of the same Benedictine convent.” “He hath been dead for years! Where got you this false signature?” cried Talon. “He is alive to-day,” sternly replied the monk; “and at his own hands I received it.” “Produce the man!” “He stands before you. I—I am Gualtier de Coucy! I, when the wrongful decree was issued by this very court that severed me from my truly wedded wife—I, when that injured angel was slaughtered—as her daughter hath well worded it —slaughtered by the sword of her own outraged affections—I buried my devouring anguish within the peaceful walls of St. Benedict aux Layes; and, all praise be to the One Eternal, I have so saved my child!” “My father, merciful God—my father!” with a piercing cry, that penetrated the soul of every hearer with a cold and steel-like keenness, she flung herself upon the breast of the noble Benedictine, and he, from those unfathomable eyes, smiled down in fond paternal love upon his beautiful and innocent child. There was a tumult in the court, a rush of many feet, a clamour of many tongues. Men, stern iron warriors, melted into tears, ay, and the grande barbe himself, the President Molè, was seen to pass his hand across his eyes, and his voice came thick and husky, as he ordered the crier to make silence, and the huzzars in attendance to remove the lady, and to attend her in all honour—“for it is fitting that the court look further into this matter.” After a time order was restored, but it was evident already that the cause was lost and won. “You have called the decree of this high court,” the president continued, “wrongful. I myself, though at the time among the youngest advocates, do well remember the passing of the decree which set aside that marriage as incestuous, as between parties of forbidden consanguinity. That decree hath to this day been unimpeached. Wherefore call you it wrongful? and wherefore, well knowing that your consent was null and void—for that a natural child hath in the law no father—wherefore did you proceed without permission of the next of kin, the girl's maternal uncle?” “Will it please you cause these papers to be read?” “I, Guillaume de Penthiêvre, feeling my life's end approaching, grievously repenting of my former sins, and of the persecution of my most guiltless niece and her wronged mother, for which I well believe I have been bitterly rewarded in the dark crimes and darker punishments of my first-born sons, whom I now see before me, slaughtered by their kindred hands!—I, unsolicited of any, and being in full sense and soundness both of mind and body, do hereby confess and swear that my own evidence, as offered against Gualtier de Coucy and Isabel de Chateaufort, was false and perjured! The witnesses produced—suborned! and the documents forged— one and all!—a tissue of deceit and treachery. May the great God who hath indeed punished the sins of the father upon the children pity, and oh, may he pardon “Guillaume de Penthievre.” “In addition to this confession of that wretched guilty one, I hold, an it so please the court, the true and the forged papers!” continued the monk; “when they shall be compared, I doubt not the decree will be rescinded.” The papers were handed to the members of the court. A deep investigation followed; but ere an hour had elapsed, Talon rose to withdraw all charges. “Not so,” interrupted Molè—“not so. The court hath heard the evidence. The court must now decide. How say ye, gentlemen, is the prisoner, Major-general Mornington, guilty or innocent of the things alleged against him?” “Innocent, innocent, upon our honours!” A burst of approbation rang through the vast hall; again and again it pealed—three rounds of full-mouthed cheering! I was surrounded by a crowd of smiling faces, grasped by a hundred friendly hands; but again the court spoke in the person of its president. “It is the full opinion of this court, and their deliberate sentence, that the decree bearing date from May the tenth, 1632, shall be rescinded—evidence being fully adduced to prove that such decree was then obtained by perjury and falsehood; that Isabel de Chateaufort, deceased, be styled, in title of her husband, Isabel de Coucy; and that the daughter of her body, Isabel de Mornington, be in all respects deemed her rightful heiress, and her child legitimate!” At this instant Condé grasped me by the arm, and hurried me through the crowd; I looked in vain about me for Isabel, or for the Benedictine. “To court, to court,” whispered the prince; “our horses wait!” “But Isabel?” I cried. “Is there already—cared for by Anne of Austria. Away, we are awaited!” At the foot of the steps we found the prince's horses, with a group of gentlemen and pages, and among them—the best horse and the most faithful servant—stood Bayard and old Martin Lydford. “Bless you,” he whispered, as he held my stirrup—“bless you, my glorious master!” Merrily clattered the pavements, as we dashed along; but my brain whirled round and round, and my intellect, which had never been confused or shaken by the pressure of calamity, reeled in the fulness of my joy. We reached the gates of the Palais Royal, threw our reins to the royal pages, and, leaning on the arm of the best and bravest noble of the age, I—a mere adventurer of fortune—entered the presence-chamber of him who was to be thereafter the mightiest king in Christendom. VOL. II.—U</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. “Ang. We are sent To give thee, from our royal master, thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, not pay thee. Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater honour, He bade me, from him, hail thee Thane of Cawdor: In which addition, hail, most worthy thane! For it is thine.” Macbeth. The superb staircases of the Palais Royal were thronged with guards and pensioners, pages and gentlemen in waiting, all in their gala-dresses; in the open space on the first landing was stationed the noble instrumental band of the royal household, making the long corridors and vaulted roofs to ring alternately with sweet or martial symphonies. The youthful monarch—or, to speak more properly, the queen-regent, and her powerful minister, triumphant in his brief success—was holding his first court since their return from St. Germains. It was accordingly a day of universal mirth and gayety. All parties were received with equal affability; and the dukes of Elbœuf and Beaufort, and the prime mover of the Fronde himself, the factious coadjutor, might be seen conversing amicably, and exchanging jeux des mots, with Grammont and De Meilleraye, or making their appropriate homage to the king, not against, but for whom they had so lately drawn the sword, to put down, in the parlance of the day, his ill-advisers. Many a kind look was cast towards me, many a friendly pressure interchanged, as I threaded the galleries, rich with their antique sculptures and priceless works of art: but my brain reeled, a mist seemed to have curtained my eyes, I saw things as in a dream, darkly—the features of the men who spoke to me, familiar as they were, appeared to flit to and fro, and to run together like the phantasms of some horrid vision—nay, my own words sounded strange and meaningless; though I was afterward informed that the confusion existed in my own ideas, rather than in the language to which they gave birth. My noble conductor was, however, more quick-sighted than the rest; for, as we paused upon the threshold of the audience-chamber, to exchange salutations with my tried friend De Charmi—who, splendidly appointed, and in command of a choice detachment, occupied that important post as guard of honour—he shook me by the shoulder, and whispered gayly,— “Awake yourself, mon cher! awake yourself, or they will deem that I have brought with me a night-owl from the terrible Bastile, rather than that brave falcon which soared so high a flight to stoop upon the vulture of Lorraine! Awake yourself, for the love of God!—here will you see some well-known faces, whether of friend or foe! But never heed; they are, I wot, too closely packed to stay long unfermented! Tête Dieu! but we shall have a brighter blaze ere long—ay, and a more destructive —than this game of war, at which our worthy citizens have played so long, only to weary of it in the end! Answer not now! but rouse thyself—we are in the presence!” As he uttered the last words we entered the audience chamber. Nobly it was fitted, doubtless, and becomingly of the brave and great whom it contained; but my thoughts were too much occupied with the living inmates to descend to details how magnificent soever. On an elevated dais, beneath a royal canopy, stood the boy-king, attired as a monarch should be seen; and already skilled to assume the high and proud, yet at the same time courteous, bearing that best beseemed his rank. On his right-hand stood Anne of Austria—fair and majestic, a fit mother for a king; and on his left the supple and accommodating, yet politic and wily, Mazarin, now at the very summit of his glory. It were long to enumerate the mighty men and lovely women who thronged, in stately yet animated groups, those wide apartments. Maréchals of France, with scarf and bâton of command— priests in cowl and scapulary—officers blazing in embroidery and gold—and ladies with flashing gems, and trains of a thousand dies; which, gorgeous as they were, no human eye could e'er have paused to note, while fascinated by the forms, the features, and the grace of those bright wearers, who will be the boast of centuries, for all that is most lovely, most intellectual, most witty, and most wicked of their sex. Grammont was there, and Longueville the talented, and Montbazon, the belle des belles! Coligni, worthy descendant of the murdered admiral, and the wild, accomplished Count de Grammont; Meilleraye, who won his staff so gloriously upon the breaches of Hedin, and who deserved to lose it for his mad impetuosity in the civil tumults of the Fronde. Mingled with these were men founding their claims more justly on their benefits conferred upon mankind, than on the slaughters of their sword—Balzac, who was the first to lend the polish U 2 and the roundness of the Italian period to the rougher and more epigrammatic tongue of France. The wise young Bossuet was there—a miracle already for the talents which will assuredly gain him a name in later ages; when the most boasted of us, peers of the sword, shall be forgotten—engaged in a warm and close flirtation with the beautiful Mademoiselle Desvieux, who, in after-days, nobly sacrificed her own happiness, freeing her lover from the claims she held on him, lest a wife should be a clog upon his soaring yet pure ambition. Calprenede and Corneille too were there, although the latter had not then attained to that admiration of men which he has reached in my latter days; while the former, with many others, who are already almost numbered with the forgotten, were in the very high-day of their glory. Others were there, in numbers that would wellnigh have baffled the eye of the enumerator—valiant, and beautiful, and wise—but, as Condé hurried me forward, I scarcely marked the features even of those whom I knew, and whom I now have barely mentioned. One face, however, I did behold—one form! It was that of Charles the Second!—Charles, the fugitive of England!—clad in the deepest sables for his murdered sire, who, scarce two months before, had expiated on the block his follies rather than his faults—yet, with difficulty composing his dark and saturnine visage to the gravity of decorum, or his conduct to the due restraint of a court which never at least violated the laws of decency, however it might in private scoff at strict morality. When first he caught my eye, he was lolling negligently over the back of a crimson sofa in the antechamber, with his arm in remarkable proximity to the waist of a very beautiful girl—no other than Louise de Querouaille—better known afterward, when his acknowledged mistress, by her English title, as Duchess of Portsmouth. Not far from these young lovers stood Wilmot Earl of Rochester; his light hair and blooming complexion strangely contrasting with the dark elf-locks and swarthy skin of his comrade, rather than his king. As I gazed on them a sigh rose to my lips; for I thought of red Marston, and of the deluges of English gore already poured forth like water on the desolated valleys of my native land—desolated that such a thing as this should be their ruler. Even in the instant during which I paused, another figure glided by—well known in happier days, and in more familiar, if not brighter, courts; it was the widow of THE KING—the still fair and ever-virtuous Henrietta! Called forth from the seclusion of her sorrows—to pay the necessary homage to her sister queen, and sole protectress—she looked as one travelling to that portal through which there is no returning, rather than as a sharer in the gay festivity of kings. Yet were her weeds less deep, her mourning robes less ostentatious in their sadness, than the garb of her profligate and heartless child; for her sadness was that deep, incessant burning of the soul which finds no vent even in tears or groans, much less in the vain usage of sable trains, or veils of widow-lawn. As she glided onward, followed by a single lady, her eye just glanced on the group I have described, and fell mournfully to the ground; it rose again, flashing, as it were, with glorious indignation. She raised her hand aloft, and paused while I might have reckoned ten—her lips moved, and though no sound came from them that could have been heard three paces distant, I caught the words, “Peace, peace! where art thou?—where but in the grave?” She collected herself, as if conscious that by noticing she should only render more public the scandal, and moved onward; but ere she had crossed the threshold, I heard the light laugh of the abandoned girl, and the yet more shameless satellite. “Odds-fish!” cried Charles; “does our lady mother think that men must weep for ever?—'Fore God, Wilmot, we will strike the Roundhead dogs the keener, that we can laugh betimes! What say you, Beautiful?—a thousand tears would be bought cheaply by a single smile of yours! A man should never sorrow while he may drink and love! But come, this etiquette wears tediously—let us away. Where tarries Fitzharding, and where Astley? We'll to my lodging in the fauxbourg; and so, hey for lansquenet or ombre, and a glass of old auxerre!” and, with another burst of laughter, that must have pierced like daggers to the heart of the retreating mother, the exile, with his minion and his paramour, swept onward, amid the ill-disguised contempt, and bitter, if secret, sneers of the French noblesse; with whom, if virtue herself were dead, so much at least of honour was paid to her ashes that they preserved her semblance in their own demeanour, and bowed to her reality in others. “Bad enough, in good truth,” whispered Condé; “yet wear not thou, for other men's failings, such a guise of virtuous indignation! I laugh at such things, while I loathe them—” “But you,” I interrupted him—“you never bled for them! You never lost broad lands, or name, or country! You never saw your father slain on his own hearth-stone—your mother wasting away piecemeal, and dying of a broken heart!—This have you never done for them—or you, like me, would CURSE—” “Not I, by all that's beautiful!” he interrupted me in turn; “not, at least, with a queen waiting to beg my acceptance of my own spear-won bride, as old Homer would have worded it! Come, man, you must amend your manners, or we will have you back to the Bastile!” The prince's words did at length arouse me; for, strange as it may seem, in the whirl of my singularly mixed sensations, I had forgotten time, place, every thing! My feelings had been so long dammed up and frozen, as it were, and so suddenly let loose, that they discharged themselves by the first channel; reckless as the waters of some over-charged and bursting lake—reckless whether they rolled down their natural channel, or rushed with devastation and dismay over the cultivated champaign. The scales now fell at once from the eyes of my spirit: I did, indeed, behold my own Isabel, smiling as when first I saw, to love her; smiling like an April morning, as then, through tears— but, not as then, through tears of joy! Natural, however, as it would have been to rush to her side, neglectful of all else, I knew too well that such a proceeding would undo all that, with so much of toil, of bloodshed, and of sorrow, had been at length accomplished. “I bring to your highness's footstool,” said Condé, as I dropped on my knee before the majestic Anne— “I bring to your highness's footstool a truant soldier, who hath succeeded in delivering his body, but hath forgotten to deliver his wits, from the iron cage of old Balue, in your most loyal fortress the Bastile!” “Of Monsieur Mornington's sufferings,” she answered, a brilliant smile of condescension lighting up her fair, but usually inanimate, features, as she spoke, “no less than of his exploits, in our own behalf, we are aware. We have regretted, and would have interposed to prevent them, had even-handed justice permitted us to do so, or could the honour of our officer have been appeased, under such shameful charges, save by an open examination, and as open an acquittal. This, Louis,” she continued, turning to the princely boy—“this is a servant who hath approved himself brave, faithful, honourable, and heart-upright, under circumstances such as try the heart. Cherish him, boy, cherish him! for, served by men like this, you shall be served indeed!” “It needs not your introduction, lady mother mine,” replied the youth, with no inapt assumption of dignity, “to make a king, young though he be as I, acquainted with an officer so faithful and distinguished as the saviour of our army at Cambrai, and the conqueror of our foes at Valenciennes. We trust, ere long, to be of age ourself to hear the whistle of a bullet, and we trust that then we shall find Monsieur de Mornington near to our person, as he now is near to our judgment. Our excellent cardinal here will speak with you further. Till then, sir, accept a youthful monarch's thanks.” “Having heard the high and, I will add, not unmerited praises,” continued Mazarin, after a brief pause, “which it has pleased their majesties to shower on you, it would befit me ill were I, their humble minister, now to gainsay them. Nor do I, in truth, feel so inclined. Well you have done in some respects—excellent well! But ask your heart, sir, ask your own heart, if you have well done in all! On your first mission, secrecy were your orders, and despatch. I will not say that you did violate them; but, if you fell not, you tottered on the verge! We rejoice that you have escaped; we rejoice that it is our province to reward, and not to PUNISH!” and he spoke with a snarling energy, that showed how fierce would be the enmity of that mild-seeming easy man, if once it should be fairly roused. “I say not this, sir, to wound your feelings, much less to do you aught of disgrace—far from it; but that hereafter you may remember this:—That if to postpone a monarch's business to your own be treason, merely to mingle them is felony! But on this will we dwell no further. It is her highness's bidding, and my own great pleasure, that I extend this bâton—conditionally promised to the Comte D'Harcourt—to a better soldier, and a more worthy man, in Major-general Mornington; and with it the rank of maréchal of France!” “With thanks,” I answered—“with thanks, the more profound that I confess the honour most unmerited, I submit myself wholly to your and to her highness's pleasure. Would I could here close my speech; but, praying you to pardon my seeming boldness and discourtesy, I am compelled to add, that the promise I made to Monsieur D'Harcourt, on your Eminence's bidding, was conditional —but the condition has been fulfilled. The army of Turenne is yours. Further, unworthy as I am, and humble, I am yet too proud to rise upon a brave man's ruin—even though he be my enemy —or to rob a soldier of a soldier's meed!” “Do you cast back our bounty?” cried the cardinal, VOL. II.—X his pale cheek flushing, as it seemed, with anger; “but this, methinks, is—” “Most like the man who spoke it!” interrupted Anne, before he could commit himself against me, “and most worthy of the noblest! From me, sir,” she continued, receiving from the hand of Mazarin the truncheon of command, who, by yielding at once what he felt to be a trifle, secured the greater power for a greater crisis—“from me, sir, receive the honour, of which none can be more deserving; and rest, in your nobleness of soul, assured, D'Harcourt shall be no loser. Further than this, that you may not lack the means to support your standing, it has pleased his majesty to grant you letters-patent, securing to you the lands, the appanages, and the title made vacant by the death of the late, and the forfeiture of the present, Duke de Penthiêvre; who, in mitigation of the penalties of his treason, will sail right shortly for our colonies of Acadie. And now, maréchal, I remember me, when last we spoke together, I bade you hold right onward in the narrow path; so should you be one whom men would delight to honour, kings to hold near them, as the brightest decoration of their thrones, and—last not least—women to LOVE! I deemed not then, indeed, that my prophecy would be so soon fulfilled; but here is one who, even HERE, will not, methinks, be backward to confess its truth. All else that I have given to you is nothing—is the dust beneath your feet—compared with this inestimable prize—the whole and holy love of a pure and virtuous woman!” She concluded her address; which, had it been fraught with all the eloquence of a greater than Demosthenes, could not so have thrilled to my heart as now—for, as she concluded, she placed in mine the hand of Isabel. “She is your own,” cried the noble Condé; “and I will only add, that if she be but served as devotedly as she hath been won gallantly, she well may look for happiness!” I gazed into her eyes—dovelike and radiant through their tears—I saw the flush of warm carnation that overspread brow, neck, and bosom—I felt the agitation that shook her slight and lovely frame; I felt it in the tremour of her small white hand—and I forbore, by word or look, to add one throb to her confusion. But, as I held that hand aloft—“If giving happiness,” I cried, my heart filled almost to suffocation, and my eyes suffused— “if giving happiness to man be a deed acceptable in the sight of God, then shall your majesty's declining years be as serene and peaceful as their noontide has been bright and glorious! And for this youthful king—to whom my life, and more than life, are mortgaged, to be held or lavished at his bidding—for this youthful king—brilliant as is the morning of his promise—even I can wish no greater bliss than he has now bestowed on me: for if re-nown, acquired in arms; power, granted by the best and purest; true faith in friendship; success and constancy in love—if these be not the happiness of heaven, they come at least so near to it that earth has naught which may compare with them!” THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Classical Works Published by Harper &amp; Brothers. XENOPHON (Anabasis, translated by Edward Spelman, Esq., and Cyropædia, by the Hon. Maurice A. Cooper). In 2 vols. 18mo. Portrait. “Spelman's Anabasis is one of the most accurate and elegant translation that any language has produced.” —Gibbon. “A very faithful and useful version”— Clarke's Bibliographical Miscellany. THE ORATIONS OF DEMOSTHENES. Translated by Thomas Leland, D.D. In 2 vols. 18mo. With a Portrait. “In the translation of Demosthenes Leland unites the man of taste with the man of learning, and shows himself to have possessed, not only a competent knowledge of the Greek language, but that clearness in his own conceptions, and that animation in his feelings, which enabled him to catch the real meaning, and to preserve the gennine spirit, of the most perfect orator Athens ever produced.” —Parr. SALLUST. Translated by William Rose, M.A. With Improvements and Notes. In 1 vol. 18mo. Portrait. The translation of Sallust by Dr. Rose has been recommended in the Bibliographical Miscellany, as “a very faithful, accurate, and excellent version.” The acknowledgments of the Editor are justly due to the liberality of Sir Henry Steaurt, Bart., by whom he has been permitted to avail himself of his eregant Translation of the Roman Historian, with many learned notes; a selection from which has served to enrich the present edition. CÆSAR. Translated by William Duncan. In 2 vols. 18mo. With a Portrait. The above translation of Cæsar's Commentaries is taken from the celebrated edition of the late Dr. Clarke, printed for J. Tonson in 1712. All possible care has been taken to render it exact, and to preserve the distinctness and perspicuity of expression for which the original is so justly famous. VIRGIL. The Eclogues translated by Wrangham, the Georgics by Sotheby, and the Æneid by Dryden. In 2 vols. 18mo. With a Portrait. “Virgil is no less admired as a virtuous, ingenious, and judicious author, than as an incomparable poet and excellent philosopher. His works, which are replete with richness of sentiment, elegance of expression, and a happy intermixture of useful and entertaining precepts and descriptions, will be read and esteemed as long as solid judgment and classical taste remain among mankind.” —Melmoth. “Dryden's version of the Æneid is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language.” —Pope. The translation of the Eclogues has been revised and corrected by Archdeacon Wrangham, who has also supplied many valuable notes, chiefly collected from Martyn, Penn, &amp;c. The Georgics are reprinted from the last edition of Mr. Sotheby's excellent translation, of which the Editor of the Bibliographical Miscellany speaks in terms of high commendation. CICERO. The Orations translated by Duncan, the Of-fices by Cockman, and the Cato and Lælius by Melmoth. In 3 vols. 18mo. With a Portrait. “Duncan's Cicero is well known as an elegant translation of more than ordinary merit.” —Monthly Review. ÆSCHYLUS. Translated by the Rev. R. Potter, M.A. In 1 vol. 18mo. “The translator has happilly preserved that dignity of style, that hold and descriptive imagery, for which the author is peculiarly distinguished.” —Critical Review. SOPHOCLES. Translated by Thomas Francklin, D.D. 18mo. With a Portrait. This translation is remarkably close and concise, and the language is easy and natural, and suited to the sentiments. In a word, the English poel seems to have preserved that elegance and simplicity, for which the Grecian is so deservedly admired.” —Monthly Review. EURIPIDES. Translated by the Rev. R. Potter, M.A. In 3 vols. 18mo. Portrait. “A correct translation, always faithful, sometimes elevated.” —Bibliographical Miscellany. HORACE AND PHÆ DRUS. In 2 vols. 18mo. In which are introduced Translations of different parts of Horace by Dryden, Pope, Swift, Porson, Bentley, Milton, Cowper, Cowley, Johnson, Chatterton, Addison, Lord Byron, Croly, Barry Cornwall, Ralph Bernal, A. Wrangham, C. A. Wheel-wright, H. Hall Joy, Sir J. C. Hobhouse, R. Montgomery, J. Merivale, Rev. J. Mitford, Leigh Hunt, &amp;c. &amp;c. With a Portrait of Horace LIVES OF THE APOSTLES AND EARLY MARTYRS OF THE CHURCH. By the author of “The Trial of Skill.” 18mo. The style is beautifully simple, and the narrative is interspersed with comments and reflections remarkable for their devout spirit, and for the clearness with which they elucidate whatever might appear to the mind either contradictory or unintelligible. It is impossible for any child to read these affecting histories without becoming interested; and the interest is so directed and improved as to implant and foster the purest principles of religion and morality. The most esteemed religious publications throughout the Union have joined in cord, at expressions of praise to this work. THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON; or, Adventures of a Father and Mother and Four Sons on a Desert Island. The Progress of the Story forming a clear Illustration of the first Principles of Natural History, and many Branches of Science which most immediately apply to the Business of Life. In 2 vols. 18mo. With Engravings. The purpose of this pleasing story is to con vey instruction in the arts and Natural History, and, at the same time, to inculeate by example principles which tend to the promotion of social happiness. Every one has heard of Robinson Crusoe, and the unrivalled and long-continued popularity of that admirable narrative, proves that the tastes and feelings to which it addresses itself are among the strongest and most universal which belong to human nature. The adventures of the Swiss family are somewhat similar in character, and, of course, in interest; and they illustrate, in the most forcible and pleasing manner, the efficacy of piety, industry, ingenuity, and good-temper, in smoothing difficulties and procuring enjoyments under the most adverse circumstances. The story abounds with instruction and entertainment, and well deserves the high encomium that has been passed upon it, of being one of the best children's books ever written. THE ORNAMENTS DISCOVERED. By Mrs. Hughs. 18mo. Engravings. The reputation of Mrs. Hughs (of Philadelphia) as an agreeable and instructive writer is already firmly established. She has done much for youth, and the present volume will add to the obligations they owe her. It is written with plainness, yet elegance; and the story, while it inculcates useful lessons in morality and religion, will be found exceedingly interesting. SUNDAY EVENINGS, or, an easy Introduction to the Reading of the Bible. [Designed for Sunday Reading and Sunday-School Libraries.] 3 vols. 18mo. With Engravings. The title of this excellent title work sufficiently explains its object. As an introduction to the knowledge of Scripture History, and an incentive to the study of the Sacred Volume, it is calculated to produce the most happy effects upon the minds of children; and the simplicity of the language preserves to the story all those charms which are inherent in the narrative, but are sometimes lost to very youthful readers by their want of a perfect understanding of the words they read. Besides a developed and connected view, in easy language, of the Scripture story itself, the author has endeavoured to intersperse in the narrative such notices of the countries spoken of, together with such refer-ences to the New Testament and practical remarks, as would tend to make the book either more interesting, more intellectually improving, or more valuable in a moral and religious light, and it cannot fail of obtaining the approbation of all judicious and pious parents, and of proving, by the blessing of God, an assistance to the Christian mother, in giving to her children an early knowledge and love of his Sacred Word. THE SON OF A GENIUS. A Tale, for the Use of Youth. By Mrs. Hofland. 18mo. Engravings. This admirable story has been too long familiar to the public—at least to that portion of it which has advanced beyond the period of child-hood—to require either enlogy or description. It has for many years maintained its place among the best and most esteemed juvenile works in the English language; and its popularity is easily accounted for by the touching interest of the incidents, and the purity of the principles it inculcates both of wisdom and religion. The publishers were induced to reprint it, partly by the advice and solicitations of their friends, and their own knowledge of its merits, and partly by the consideration that it has long been out of pring, and that it was very difficult to procure a copy. NATURAL HISTORY; or, Uncle Philip's Conversations with the Children about Tools and Trades among the Inferior Animals. 18mo. With numerous Engravings. This work has deservedly received the highest encomiums, not only for the extent, utility, and interesting nature of the information it conveys, but also for the skill with which the ideas and language are adapted to the tastes as well as the capacities of youthful readers. But these are not its only or its greatest merits: its highest claims to praise are the tone of sincere and carnest piety which pervades the conversations, and the excellence of the precepts drawn from the wonders they disclose. INDIAN TRAITS; BEING SKETCHES OF THE MANNERS, CUSTOMS, AND CHARACTER OF THE NORTH AMERICAN NATIVES. By B. B. Thatcher, Esq. In 2 vols. 18mo. With numerous Engravings. The appearance, character, and habits of the North American Indians have long been a favourite and fertile theme for writers as well as readers, and accurate descriptions of them are equally instructive and agreeable. These form the subject of the present volumes, and they are admitted to contain much correct and interesting information. A larger work, by the same author, entitled “Indian Biography,” treats of the history of those remarkable members of the human family: the work now under consideration makes no pretensions to that character, but is entirely descriptive; and it is entitled to high praise, not only as being the first attempt to render the subject attractive to general readers, but also for the ability with which the object is accomplished. TALES FROM AMERICAN HISTORY. By the Author of “American Popular Lessons.” In 3 vols. 18mo. With Engravings. The writer of these Tales has had in view two chief purposes,—the one to convey to the juvenile reader a general idea of the incidents connected with the discovery and subsequent history of the American continent; the other to excite an interest in the subject which shall create a desire for more minute and extensive information. These purposes have been effected with much success, and the volumes will be found instructive and entertaining. In the majority of instances, the Tales have been selected with reference to the illustration of some moral principle: and the frequent opportunities afforded for the introduction of reflections leading to the cultivation of piety and religion have been ably and zealously improved. As a school-book, this collection of Historical Tales is calculated to be eminenlty serviceable: and there can be no doubt that their introduction into seminaries will be attended with both pleasure and advantage to the scholars. EVIDENCES OF CHRISTIANITY; or, Uncle Philip's Conversations with the Children about the Truth of the Christian Religion. 18mo. With Engravings. In this excellent little work a very difficult task has been undertaken, and successfully accomplished; that of making both attractive and intelligible to the minds of the young, the great and striking evidences by which the truth of our divine religion is established. The manner in which the subject is treated is both novel and ingenious; and so much of narrative is mingled with the argument as to make it not only impressive, but highly interesting. THE YOUNG CRUSOE; or, the Shipwrecked Boy. Containing an Account of his Shipwreck, and Residence for Several Months alone upon an Uninhabited Island. By Mrs. Hofland. 18mo. Engravings. Mrs. Hofland, the admirable author of the “Son of a Genius,” and other excellent juvenile productions, is also the writer of this pleasing story. In its plan and objects it is somewhat similar to the Swiss Family Robinson; and, like it, will be read with delight by every little boy or girl who can sympathize in the misfortunes, or rejoice in the comforts and enjoyments of another. The style, the incidents, and the pervading spirit are all in the highest degree excellent,—as, indeed, are all the writings of this accomplished and amiable author. The culture of the youthful mind requires talents of a peculiar character; and, when accomplished with ability, reflects the highest credit upon the successful teacher. None have been more successful than Mrs. Hofland; and her name alone is a sufficient warrant for the merits of any book to which it is appended. PERILS OF THE SEA; being Authentic Narratives of Remarkable and Affecting Disasters upon the Deep. With Illustrations of the Power and Goodness of God in wonderful Preservations. 18mo. Engv'gs. This collection of remarkable disasters and preservations has been compiled with great care from authentic sources. In making the selection attention has been paid to the combination of interest, with illustrations of piety and fortitude in suffering, and of the power and goodness of Providence in rescuing from destruction when, to all appearance, there were no means or prospect of deliverance. The collection embraces narratives of the loss of the Kent, the Empress, the Lady Hobart, the Essex, the Halsewell East Indiaman, the steampacket Rothsay Castle, of five Wesloyan missionaries. &amp;c. &amp;c. THE AMERICAN FOREST; or, Uncle Philip's Conversations with the Children about the Trees of America. 8mo. With Engravings. To make the rising generation acquainted with one great class of natural productions, with which the North American Confinent is richly and abundantly supplied, and to excite a desire for more particular information, are the objects of this volume. It is believed that all the indigenous trees which have been ascertained to grow within this portion of the globe are mentioned in it, and the various uses to which the wood or any other portion of the tree is known to be capable of application, are described with as much minuteness as was compatible with the necessary brevity. Considered merely as a catalogue, the work is valuable, and affords a large amount of useful information. SKETCHES OF THE LIVES OF DISTINGUISHED FEMALES. Written for Girls, with a view to their Mental and Moral Improvement. By an American Lady. 18mo. With a Portrait, &amp;c. As example acts more forcibly upon female youth than on the other sex, it is peculiarly important that the biography which is placed in the hands of young females should be either carefully selected, so as to give them no examples but those that are unexceptionable, or else that it should be accompanied by such remarks as will enable them to discriminate between the excellences to be imitated and the eccentricities to be avoided. With such views these sketches have been prepared. They will be found peculiarly instructive, and are written in a style which cannot fail to interest. The volume is embellished with a portrait of Mrs. Judson, &amp;c. and embraces biographical sketches of several of the most distinguished females of our own country. CAROLINE WESTERLEY; or, the Young Traveller from Ohio. 18mo. With Engravings. This work will prove instructive as well as attractive to young persons. In its pages genius, nature, morality, and religion have been brought into happy combination. It is replete with sound and rational piety, judicious remark, and right feeling. THE CLERGYMAN'S ORPHAN, and Other Tales. By a Clergyman. For the Use of Youth. 18mo. Engravings. The author of the “Clergyman's Orphan” informs us that with most of the characters whose romantic history is here recorded he was personally acquainted; and vouches that it is substantially a narrative of facts. The object of the work is to strengthen in the minds of young persons the conviction of a special superintending Providence. UNCLE PHILIP'S CONVERSATIONS with the Children about Virginia. 18mo. With Engravings The volume with this title is the first of a series in which it is intended to provide especially for youthful readers, an accurate, though necessarily brief history of the several states which compose the union. The details are as copious as the limits of the work permit, and great care and skill have been exercised to render them attractive by the aid of personal anecdote and striking incident. UNCLE PHILIP'S CONVERSATIONS with the Children about New-York. 18mo. With Plates. LUTHER AND THE LUTHERAN REFORMATION. By John Scott, A.M. In 2 vols. 18mo. With Portraits. THE LIFE OF ARCHBISHOP CRANMER. By Charles Webb Le Bas, A.M. In 2 vols. 18mo. Portrait. THE LIFE OF WICLIF. By Charles Webb Le Bas, A.M. 18mo. With a Portrait. THE CONSISTENCY OF THE WHOLE SCHEME OF REVELATION, with Itself, and with Human Reason. By Philip Nicholas Shuttleworth, D.D. 18mo. HISTORY OF THE REFORMED RELIGION IN FRANCE. By Rev. Edward Smedley. In 3 vols. 18mo. With Engravings. PRESENT STATE OF CHRISTIANITY, and of the Missionary establishments for its Propagation in all Parts of the World. Edited by Frederic Shoberl. 12mo. RELIGIOUS DISCOURSES. By Sir Walter Scott, Bart. 18mo. SERMONS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. By Rev. John Wesley, A.M. Containing a Number of Sermons never before published in this Country. In 3 vols. 8vo. SCENES IN OUR PARISH. 12mo. NARRATIVE OF A VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEAS, in 1829-1831. By Abby Jane Morrell, who accompanied her husband, Capt. Benjamin Morrell, Jun., of the Schooner Antarctic. 12mo. Portrait. The scenes and adventures of which Mrs. Morrell was a witness were highly interesting in their nature, and it is believed that an account of them, divested of nautical technicallties and descriptions purely maritime, will be read with pleasure, especially by readers of her own sex and country. EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, derived from the literal Fulfilment of Prophecy. By the Rev. Alexander Keith. 12mo. Of the estimation in which this volume is held in England, evidence is afforded by the following remark:—“Few more satisfactory works in confirmation of the inspiration of Scripture have appeared within our own time than that of Mr. Keith.” The writer whose testimony is thus given is the Rev. Dr. Shuttleworth, Warden of New College, Oxford. The work is so justly appreciated in Edinburgh that it has passed through six editions; and parts of it have been published in tracts in English, French, and German. DOMESTIC DUTIES; or, Instructions to Young Married Ladies, on the Management of their Households, and the Regulation of their Conduct in the various Relations and Duties of Married Life. By Mrs. W. Parkes. With Improvements adapted to the American Reader. 12mo. “The volume before us is a perfect vade mecum for the young married lady, who may resort to it on all occasions of economy and etiquette... There is nothing omitted with which it behooves a lady to be acquainted.” —Monthly Magazine. A CONCORDANCE TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT. By John Brown, of Haddington. 32mo. The smallest form in which this concordance has ever been printed. It is perfect, however, and the type is so clear that it can be easily read. THE LIFE OF ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States of America. By Wm. Cobbett, M.P. 18mo. With a Portrait. The Life of an American President, written by an English Member of Parliament, has something attractive in its very announcement; and the interest in the present case is much increased by the well-known character of the author, who is the famous Radical member for Oldham, and editor, or rather writer, of the `Gridiren Register.' To all who know any thing of William Cobbett and his strong, nervous, and somewhat coarse style of writing and thinking, this little volume requires no recommendation. MRS. JAMESON'S VISITS AND SKETCHES AT HOME AND ABROAD. With Tales and Miscellanies, and a new and improved edition of “The Diary of an Ennuyée.” In 2 vols. 12mo. In these delightful volumes, the richly-stored and highly cultivated mind of Mrs. Jameson, has invested the scenes and objects of which she writes, themselves of a most striking and attractive character, with a new and peculiar interest. Wherever she has been, she has found something to charm herself, and of which it is pleasant to hear. All that is rare in art, within the scope of her observations is shown vividly and beautifully; character and manners are illustrated by striking and well-told incidents; scenery of every class, the rich, the grand, the peaceful and the gay, is described with the most graphic and varied skill; and more than all, the great and good of human kind, among whom she freely mingled on her way, are brought before us, both in mind and person, with a clearness and distinguishing effect that almost persuade us to believe we have obtained them by a personal acquaintance. Genius and education are in every page; and the reader feels, that the mind with which he is communing is one of the highest order. SIR EDWARD SEAWARD'S NARRATIVE OF HIS SHIPWRECK, and consequent Discovery of certain Islands in the Carribbean Sea: with a Detail of many Extraordinary and highly Interesting Events in his Life. Edited by Miss Jane Porter. In 3 vols. 12mo. “We have finished the perusal of this most agreeable work, and almost regret that the pleasure of a first perusal has gone by; though it is one of those books which will bear reading again and again.” —Commercial Advertiser.
