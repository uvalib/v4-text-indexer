      <field name="fulltext">ROTUNDA AND ANNEX BEFORE THE FIRE View From Carr's Hill</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACTORY. My Mother, the late Mrs. J. Enders Robinson, and I were, during her life, such close comrades, and shared so fully every thought and interest, that, when I was a student at the University of Virginia, at the time of the Great Fire in 1895, I was eager for her to know at once all that I had seen and heard on the day of that disaster; and to that end I began writing her a letter that Sunday night,—the night of the fire, when my mind was vividly inflamed by the happenings of the day. The letter was twenty-eight pages long, when completed Tuesday morning,—and fortunately she kept it. In consequence of a serious accident, I was absent from the University for six years (1896-1902); but was back in college at the time of the tenth anniversary of the fire in 1905. The Editors of the University of Virginia Magazine then requested me to contribute a short sketch of that fortunate catastrophe, which, in October issue of that year, was characterized as the second epoch in the history of the University,—the founding being reckoned as the first, and the Installation of Dr. Alderman as the third. In that sketch,—of which this edition is in substance a copy,—as also in this reprint, all narrative and descriptive matter relative to the fire itself is taken verbatim from the letter referred to; while the account of the movement of the fire apparatus and fire trains, the resumption of lectures, the books saved, the insurance, and, in fact, everything else, is based upon the official records. In spite of assistance from every direction, it has been the source of much regret that I was unable to secure copies of the following photographs showing the activities of Prof. Echols and his bag of dynamite,— (a) View from East, showing connecting roof between Rotunda and Annex, at the moment of the explosion,—and showing the dèbris flying. (b) Same view, a moment later,—showing only two scantlings left between Rotunda and Annex; (c) Same, still later,—showing everything enveloped in dust and smoke, the wind drifting from the Rotunda towards the Lawn. It is pleasing to be able to make acknowledgment to Dr. Philip Alexander Bruce for his kindly interest, helpful criticism, and unstinted assistance and suggestions of value and guidance,—and especially for the generous introduction; to Mr. David I. Bushnell, Jr., of the U. S. Bureau of Ethnology, for his ever-ready co-operation and general assistance,— and especially in connection with the preparation and the reproduction of the fire pictures: to Prof. Echols, Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, Retired, and Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Bursar, for the location and identification of sites and things, the location or status of which has materially changed since the date of the fire: and to the following officials and persons for generous assistance, suggestion and co-operation in locating and securing the copies of the fire pictures,— Mrs. Sally Nelson Bardin; Miss Estelle Burthe; Mr. Russell Bradford, Secretary of the Colonnade Club; Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Bursar; Mr. B. P. Chamberlayne, Secretary of the Y. M. C. A.; Miss Bettie Cocke; Mr. James H. Corbitt, Suffolk, Va.; Mr. Lewis D. Crenshaw, Alumni Secretary; Prof. R. Heath Dabney; Miss M. L. Dinwiddie, Assistant Librarian; Miss Sallie Doswell; Judge R. T. W. Duke, Jr., Charlottesville, Va., Prof. W. H. Echols; Judge John W.

Old, of Norfolk, Va.: to Mr. Frank Reade Robertson, Editor in Chief of Corks and Curls, '21 for the frontispiece; and to Mr. Emmet Bruffey for the splendid picture of "Uncle Henry". MORGAN POITIAUX ROBINSON. April 26, 1921. No. 113 S. 3rd St., Richmond, Va.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. In the Dark Ages, when the only chimney was a hole in the roof, and the only carpet a spread of green rushes on the floor, the visitor who was most hospitably welcomed to the torch-lit castle-hall, was the minstrel with his harp, or the half-inspired reciter of the heroic songs and glowing epics of the people. The Beowulf and Sagas were declaimed from decade to decade in the shadows of the fireside, long before they were committed even to writing. And it was in those bookless times also that many a medicant, with no property but his staff and his wallet, but with a past full of stirring adventure, related in the shifting shadows, to the listening family, eagerly leaning forward, the story of his perilous wanderings in foreign lands, or recounted his share in some famous siege or battle of his own day. No modern writer has caught the dramatic spirit, the racy flavor, of these personal narratives of the primitive ages with such absolute verisimilitude as Defoe. Who can read his description of the Great London Plague except with the conviction that it is the record of an eyewitness, who saw every phase of that appalling event as it passed from stage to stage of its progress. There is a fidelity, a freshness, a minuteness of observation, in that description which would seem to be impossible in a writer who was drawing simply upon his imagination,—only an eyewitness, one would say, could have seen all these things; and only an eyewitness could have retained such living memories of them. There is much of this rare spirit in Mr. Robinson's story of the Great Fire at the University of Virginia. It is the spirit of the eyewitness, who has also the ability to record his impressions with all the vividness of reality. Every incident of that remarkable scene is preserved just as it occurred; but, while each one is presented separately, they form, as a whole, a picture which can never be forgotten. It is as though the details of a battle, or a Derby race, had been seized by the mind of an observer with absolute precision and perfection just at the moment of the highest tension, or the most appalling energy, and at once crystallized in a permanent form, like a picture by Meissonier or Rosa Bonheur. The burning of the Rotunda is the most dramatic episode in the history of the University. It will never cease to make a moving appeal, not only because it was so frightful in itself, but also because it called forth, as at the sound of a trumpet, the noblest emotions and the highest powers of the Visitors, Faculty, alumni and students alike. Nowhere is there to be found such a graphic description of those scenes as in the pages of the present monograph,—a contemporary document which still palpitates with the energy, the devotion, the exalted spirit of that wonderful hour,—an hour apparently, for the moment, fatal to the fortunes of the University, but, in reality, destined to be the seed of a rebirth so far-reaching in its influences that not even yet, although nearly a generation has passed, are we able to calculate its beneficent aftermath with even approximate accuracy.

      <field name="fulltext">THE LAWN AND ROTUNDA. At time of the fire</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Burning of the Rotunda. BEING A SKETCH OF THE PARTIAL DESTRUCTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA (1895). Now that the Whirl-i-gig of Time has once more brought 'round to us the Month of May, and, with its closing days, the Centennial Celebration of the University, it has seemed not inappropriate that we should have an illustrated re-print of The Burning of the Rotunda; which, in the October, 1905, issue of the University of Virginia Magazine, described the event as "that fortunate catastrophe which, by reason of the renewed energy and vigor which it has instilled into our alumni and all lovers of higher education in this state, may with some justice be characterized as the second epoch in the history of the University,—the founding being reckoned as the first and the Installation of Dr. Alderman as the third." I trust that the reader will be mindful that the character of this sketch being necessarily reminiscential, it is, of course, at the same time more or less egotistic. It was Sunday morning, October 27th, 1895, a bright, cool, clear, autumn day. The early bells had rung at 8 and 8:30 o'clock, as was their wont in the days of the Old Rotunda. Foshee, a student, returning from a late breakfast at Hatcher's (now Mrs. Pilkington's), noticed some thin curls of smoke issuing from the ventilator in the cornice of the north end of the Annex, (See View from Carr's Hill) which building,—an ordinary three-story red brick structure built just before the War between the States,—extended from the Rotunda to the stone abutments now (1921) to be seen just opposite Madison Hall. Foshee, joined by Sloan and Penton, other students, whom Foshee had called, started in quest of Uncle Henry to sound an alarm by ringing the bell (then over the apex of the front portico of the Rotunda). Uncle Henry, close at hand as usual, soon had the old bell clanging and so the alarm of fire was sounded, while these three students, joined by others along the route who had been attracted by the cry of "Fire!," ran to the engine house, then in the rear of West Range. A party of students, of whom the writer was one, was seated in No. 33 West Range, just opposite the fire-engine house, talking over prospective "goats," etc., for Eli had had a "soiree" the night before and Delta Psi and T. N. E. had "goated" on the same night. It was just a quarter after ten o'clock (the then usual time for the bell to ring for Chapel), when the bell rang,—for Chapel, as we all thought. One of our party, looking at his watch, remarked, "Gee! I didn't know it was so late!" Another said, "Well, boys, I must go over and write some letters," and so our little party was about to disperse when suddenly we heard the shouting of those hurrying to get the engine and hose-reels, mingled with the chopping of an axe (cutting open the engine-house door) and the cry of "Fire!" We never remembered which route each one took out of that room,—door or window,—but soon we were all strung out along the ropes, hauling the engine and reels down the alleyway towards Elsom's (now the Physiological Laboratory), then out to West Range and on between Elsom's and the Chapel, across the greensward to the edge of the "Pond,"— a small lake then between the Chapel, the stone abutments and the road. Under the direction of Prof. Raleigh C. Minor, who had been pulling one of the reels, a line of hose was run off in a jiffy, but the engine, having no suction pipe, could not be used and so the hose was attached to a plug, the same one now (1921) located about half way between Madison Hall, and the stone abutments, and was then run up the high narrow stairs leading to the rear door of the stage in the Public Hall,—a large hall occupying the entire main floor of the Annex and having a two-story pitch. Upon entering the Public Hall, it was found that the fire, which had originated from an unknown cause (probably defective wiring), had gotten well under way in one of the rooms of the Engineering Department in the northwest corner of an upper floor of the Annex, and had already burned through the upper left-hand corner of Balze's copy of the "School of Athens," which handsome painting, about 30x15 feet, and valued at some $5,000, covered the entire rear wall of the stage. A number of students attempted to cut the painting from its fastenings, but, believing that the fire could be kept under control, Dr. Kent and others in authority, prevailed upon them to desist. Prof. Echols and others were on a ladder against the painting trying to reach the fire with the meagre stream of some four or five feet, which was all that the plug would yield, for the reduced pressure was caused by carrying the nozzle so far above the water-mains, which were badly choked with rust, though at the time it was thought that the reduced pressure resulted from the repairs then in progress on the water-pipes leading from the reservoir to the city. (Later, during the progress of the fire, the supply of Charlottesville was cut off in an attempt to increase the pressure at the University). In a few minutes, the beam holding the lights and reflectors above the curtin pole came down to the stage with a crash, followed by a great shower of sparks and heavy burning brands. Of course, those on the ladder against the painting had to beat a retreat and turn their attention to other points of vantage. At the time of the fire, it was rumored that when this beam came to the floor, Prof. Humphreys, with characteristic exactness, calmly remarked to those on the stage about him, "Gentlemen, I think that we shall have to take up another line of defense." While these things were transpiring in the Public Hall, the students and others were busily engaged carrying to points of safety the books of the Law Library, then in the Annex, and the instruments from the Physical and Mechanical Laboratories, also at that time in the Annex, and, as one might expect, these instruments, when removed, were in a woefully dilapidated condition. Prof. Echols, realizing that there was a more ample field for his abilities elsewhere, passed on through the Public Hall to the portico between the Rotunda and the Annex, where stood four columns supporting the roof connecting the Annex to the Rotunda, and through which the fire could eat its way into the Rotunda. (See Rotunda and Annex from the East.) Mr. J. A. Bishop, then Conservator of the Peace at the University, who was working with Prof. Echols, had brought one hundred pounds of dynamite, with fuses, caps, etc., from his shop, and with these they proceeded to blow down the four columns and so weaken the roof. While they were engaged in this work, some of the spectators, thinking that these gentlemen did not realize their danger, began to call to them, then some threw rocks at them to attract their attention without any thought of what would happen if a stick of dynamite should be hit, and it was rumored at that time that one of the spectators even got a pistol and fired at them, trying to kill them in order that they might not be roasted to death in the fire. The real intent of the pistol shots was to break down the plaster from the under side of the roof to let in air so it would burn from the bottom. This done, they passed on up through the Library to the dome, with a view to blowing out the now weakened roof with dynamite in order to keep the fire confined to the Annex and so save the books in the Library, which was about the same level as the second gallery of the present Library,—the main floor of the present Library being then used for academic lecture rooms, and these two elliptically shaped lecture rooms with the two present basement rooms constituted the then Academic Department of the University of Virginia. It was while doing this work that Prof. Echols lost his watch and fifty-eight dollars. After reaching the dome, Prof. Echols and Mr. Bishop realized that their supply of dynamite was too small for the desired purposes and also that, as the fire was rapidly gaining headway, it would be necessary to provide an exit other than the stairs which they had just ascended through the Library. That being the case, they decided to descend and get more dynamite and at the same time provide the other exit. Once on the ground, Prof. Echols grabbed the first man that he came to (who happened to be the present Dr. Gordon HENRY MARTIN. Janitor and bellringer, 1847-1915; b. July 4, 1826, d. October 5, 1915,— Alumni Bulletin, October, 1915, p. 597. Wilson of Baltimore, Md.), and told him to go down town as fast as he could and get some more dynamite. Wilson used his head and immediately impressed the first vehicle in sight,—a buggy, which some one, who had driven in from the county to attend services at the University Chapel, had hitched to a tree near by. Things were different in Charlottesville twenty-five years ago from what they are today: there were fewer stores and each store carried a more general stock,— more like the general supply store which one finds in a mining town. Wilson drove to the storekeeper's home and carried him to the store, where he got two fifty pound boxes of dynamite, on which he sat in the buggy, all the while urging the horse towards the University at top speed, until he bounded over the C. &amp; O. tracks at 14th Street,—for there was no bridge then,—only a grade crossing,—but after that bounding over the tracks with the dynamite and realizing that he had not been blown to atoms, he then urged the horse to bottom speed. While Wilson had been off after the dynamite, Prof. Echols and his associates had made free use of the axes, which Uncle Henry had gotten from the old bellrope room (to the east of the front entrance to the present basement of the Rotunda) to cut down the door to the secret passageway leading up through the walls of the Rotunda to the dome (which passage, now closed up had its entrance to the west of the front entrance of the present basement of the Rotunda), and it was this secret passageway which was to be used as an exit in case they were cut off by the fire from the passage down through the Library proper. Finally Wilson's walking horse came along and Prof. Echols, after some very emphatic disapproval of such slow speed, proceeded, with absolute unconcern, to open the boxes of dynamite (which, fortunately, was of the 50-pound test variety), with one of his axes. As soon as the first box was opened, it was dumped into a big two-bushel meal bag, which came from no one could tell where,—it just came, as did everything else that was needed that day. With the bag of dynamite on his shoulders, Prof. Echols, accompanied by Mr. Bishop, now passed up through the secret passageway to the dome, their object being to make a final effort to blow out the connecting roof, and how well their work was done is proven by photographs* * Note—It has been impossible to secure usable copies of these photographs, since the burning of Holsinger's Studio. If any reader knows the whereabouts of any of these, please notify Morgan P. Robinson, Virginia State Library. Richmond, Va. of the scene which show but two scantlings left standing. In the Library proper, all was chaos and confusion;—the jingle of the glass which was being broken from the bookcases, the yells and shouts of those working to save the books. the orders of those who were directing the work of rescue, to which was added almost every minute the explosion of a dynamite cartridge used for blowing down some obstruction, or getting rid of some portion of the building which might facilitate the spread of the flames to the Lawns,—for at first there was a sharp wind blowing from the Annex to the Rotunda, though this, like a similar change of wind which saved Richmond, (Va.,) from total destruction when it was evacuated in '65, suddenly changed during the progress of the fire and with nearly the violence of a gale took exactly the opposite direction,—from the Lawn. Of course all of us have heard of the noble heroism of the women of our Southland, but those of us who were fortunate enough to be around here that day saw more than one living example of it. They kicked the glass doors out of the book-cases,—in many instances breaking it out with their bare hands,—and worked side by side with the men long after the fire was in the Library. The boys would get down on their knees and hold out their arms, while the women piled the books as high as they could reach on the outstretched arms; or again, the men would fill the women's silken (for it was Sunday) skirts with books and in each case the one carrying the books would take them to the window opposite the only door to the Library (the window just above the front entrance THE "POND" Annex (north front) in background PUBLIC HALL Finals held here from July, 1853 to June, 1895. "School of Athens" over stage in background. to the Library of today) and dump them down to the portico of the Rotunda, while others on the portico would carry them down to the Lawn and away from further danger. At first the men had tried to drive the women away, telling them that they would save all the books, etc., but they would not go, but worked everywhere that the men worked,—even in the bucket-lines. Some one suggested that the bell be rung until help should arrive from Charlottesville, for we could hardly expect the people of the city to know that the University was on fire, just because the bell had rung as it was accustomed to do a dozen times every day. Uncle Henry had been called off to more imperative duties and a student, hearing the suggestion, went to the belfry, or rather to the room in which the bell-rope hung (just to the east of the front entrance to the present basement of the Rotunda) and was there met by the sight of four women hanging on the bell-rope and there they stayed until practically all of Charlottesville was on the University Grounds. Then, when the bucket-lines were formed, they took their places along with the men and handled the buckets of water down the lines. Those few of the professors and their wives who were not actually fighting the fire or rescuing books were busily engaged preparing food for the now famished workers, and it is safe to say that of the thousands who were on the grounds that day, few there were, who were not in some way lending a hand directly or indirectly in fighting the fire,—professors, their wives and families, students, townpeople and all. The work of salvage in the Library proper progressed rapidly and soon all the pictures, all the smaller book-cases and 11,694 of the 56,733 books were carried to places of safety out on the Lawn, but there still remained the more serious propositions, if the rescue work was to be a complete success. While this work was at its height, a student (whose name the writer much regrets that he was never able to ascertain) rushed into the Library and, by reason of the intense excitement under which he was laboring, gathered sufficient strength to pick up the marble bust of Mr. Minor (the same one that is today to be seen in Minor Hall), carried it down stairs and out on the Lawn to Dr. Kent's house,—the present Administration Building. Elated by his success, he then returned, picked up the pedestal and carried it to the same place of safety. So great had been the success of all their undertakings that the students were now ready to undertake almost anything. Over yonder, surrounded by its iron railing with its top spikes curving outward, in the same relative position in which it stands today, was the splendid marble statue of Jefferson by Galt. Remember that in those days it stood on the main floor of the Library, which is now the same level as the window immediately over the present front entrance to the Library. Someone, in what some might have termed a rash moment, suggested that the statue should be next taken out, as it was on the side of the house next to the fire and so in more imminent danger. No sooner had the suggestion been made than somebody produced a rope from somewhere. (As I have said, nobody knew where things came from that day, nor how they happened.) Fortunately there was a man in the crowd who knew the value of ropes and knots at a time like that. That man was Dr. Howard H. Bailey, of Washington, D. C., who received his M. D. Degree in June, '97. The boys stood in chairs and lifted the iron railing over the head of the statue and threw it on the floor. Taking the ropes with him, Bailey went up into the then first gallery (about the level of the present top gallery) and dropped a noose over the head of the statue; this he pulled taut, passed it around one of the pillars in the gallery and then threw the loose end to the crowd on the floor below. Then with a second rope he did exactly the same thing, except that he did not pass it around a pillar. The first rope was eased out by the crowd on the floor and, as a back-stay rope, held the statue from falling over on its face, while the second rope, as a fore-and-aft stay, enabled the students to pull the statue down into a horizontal position. As soon as it was in a horizontal position, one of the Library tables was run under the statue,—the pedestal at that time being about the height of the tables (the present pedestal is a new one, as the old one was burned); but, instantly, the great weight of the marble crushed the table to the floor, and this too, with no injury to the statue except a minor item, which is today testified to by the chipped off hem of the cloak on the right-hand side,—a matter too trifling for more than mere mention when compared with the saving of the statue. Once on the floor, the statue was turned over on its back and with the ropes the boys began to haul it across the Library to the door (just inside the window above the present main entrance to the Library). This door was the only entrance and exit to the Library, so it was necessarily crowded with those hurrying out the books, pictures, etc., as the flames were now well in the room, though the ladies, as well as the boys, laughed at the flames and kept on with their work of saving the books, having dipped their handkerchiefs in water and tied them over mouth and nose, while they groped around through the smoke looking for the books and pictures. The statue had gotten just half in, half out of the Library door and was jammed, as it was a bit long to make an easy turn out to the narrow platform at the head of the staircase, which led down around the curving wall to the present main floor of the Library. It was an awful scene. The smoke was so thick and dense that one could not see twenty feet from him; the jingle of glass which was being knocked and kicked out of the bookcases; dozens of men and boys all shouting different things; the crashing of beams accompanying the frequent explosions of dynamite cartridges; the roar of the flames which were now well in the room and cast a dull, red, fiendish glow over everything through the smoke; the crackling of burning timbers; all these things tended to make a veritable hell, when suddenly there was a fearful explosion as though the Heavens had been rent asunder. The next moment all was silent; we were in total darkness; the whole earth seemed to tremble; the Rotunda rocked; the voices hushed; the crashing and the crackling of the beams was checked; but only for a moment; "Great God!" one thought "we are lost". This silence lasted for, and these things happened in less than a moment, for in the next, while the Rotunda still rocked, the most awful yells were heard; every pane of glass, not already broken had been shattered by the force of the explosion, and with a terrific crash the whole plaster ceiling of the dome of the Rotunda came down to the floor. Everyone rushed for the single door, there to find the statue half in, half out of the Library; there was a jam, but the cooler heads quickly dispersed it. The statue was gotten out on the staircase and step by step it was carried down the western stairs, feet foremost. As the base of the statue was eased over each step, it would gather momentum and gaining speed would tear off the top edge of the next step, while under the combined weight of the statue and twenty to thirty of the students, the whole staircase would tremble. Safely down the stairs, it was slid along the floor and out on the portico of the Rotunda, where mattresses, taken from near-by rooms of the students, were laid on the marble steps, and the statue was eased down to the Lawn out of the reach of danger, there to be covered with a blanket until a canvas could be procured for the purpose. It is conservatively estimated that it took from ten to fifteen minutes to remove the statue from the Library. Certain it is that it took a gang of workmen with rollers, jacks and blocks, ropes, etc., half a day to remove it from the Lawn to the Museum where it was temporarily kept. The cause of the explosion was the fifty pounds of dynamite which Prof. Echols had carried to the roof in the meal bag, and it is said that the report was heard fifteen miles in the direction of the wind. It was a forlorn hope and had to either blow everything loose and possibly save the Library, or else it could only furnish food for the flames by reducing the timbers to kindling; but Fortune was against us and it did the latter. Every pane of glass remaining in the south and west sides of the Museum at this time was broken by the force of the explosion, and it was a mere miracle that the rash daring RUINS OF ANNEX View from North-west: Rotunda to right THE HOUR-STRIKER. This is now in the Bursar's strong room,—the tag carrying the following inscription,— "This is the original hammer which struck the hour of classes for generations of students from the time of Jefferson until the fire of 1895. Presented by Will B. Tuttle, who recovered it just before the dome of the Rotunda fell in. June 11, 1912." deed of Prof. Echols and Mr. Bishop was not then and there rewarded with death. The Rotunda was now well on fire and it became necessary to keep the fire from communicating to the houses of Prof. Buckmaster (now Prof. Lewis') and Prof. Tuttle (now Prof. Faulkner's), for the heat was becoming intense, but fortunately it was just about this time that the wind changed and freshened very decidedly from the south, carrying sparks and brands, it is said, as many as six miles to the north of the University, and causing many small fires, among which was Dr. Lambert's residence, and the stable of Dr. Chancellor, both of which were soon extinguished. The rooms on both sides of the Lawn were thrown open and every blanket was taken from the beds, was hung over the wooden eves of the two lawn residences above mentioned, and kept wet in order to prevent them from taking fire from the heat. Next a bucket-brigade was formed leading up through each of these houses to the roof. From the rooms on either side of the Lawn, the bucket-brigades were supplied with pitchers, basins, buckets and, in fact, every domestic article that would hold water, the water being drawn from the spigots in the neighboring residences of the professors and the hydrants in the rear of the Lawns. Colonel Venable had been working along with "his boys" all through the scene in the Library and when the statue was out, he finally prevailed upon the boys to stop diving under his arms into the flaming Library to rescue something more, so taking one more look around for chance stragglers he cut a notch in a stick and placed it across the double doors and went down the western stairs, while some of the students, bent upon getting out one more armful of books, went up the eastern stairs to carry out their bent. Hardly had they arrived upon the platform at the head of the steps and in front of the door, when the doors flew open, drawn in by the draft, the stick having in this short while burned. It was a magnificent sight in that gigantic roaring furnace, as the fresh air rushed in and cleared away the smoke; here the base of the marble statue, there the pillars in the gallery; here the old iron railing from the statue, there some dusty books left to their fate on the shelves in the gallery; here a broken book-case on the floor and there a perfect volcano of flame pouring into the Rotunda from the Annex, and in a moment a cloud of smoke shutting off everything from view. But the boys had not fooled the Colonel, for that good man, used to the ways of men, had watched us, and fearful for our safety, was once more at the door of the Library, but this time firmly giving us to understand that we must leave the Library; and so we reluctantly went down the long curving stairs for the last time, while the Colonel, the last one to leave the Library, followed closely after us. While the ladies and students were working in the bucket-lines, Prof. Echols, Mr. Bishop, and Finch were busy with dynamite blowing up the Old Chapel (Prof. Wilson's present lecture room), and the Y. M. C. A. Reading Room (the present Bursar's office), with a view to keeping the fire from communicating to East and West Lawn, respectively. It was while engaged in this work that Prof. Echols fell through the roof of the Reading Room and broke his left hand, and a Staunton fireman, named Smith, was also injured at the same time. The fire had steadily enveloped the Rotunda, in spite of all the efforts that could be brought to bear to check it, and it was then that the fire got into the works of the clock and that ancient timepiece stopped running at five minutes to twelve o'clock, as is shown by photograps of the scene. The fire was now in possession of everything,—Annex and Rotunda,—and was threatening the Lawns, so there was naught to do with the meagre fire-fighting facilities at hand but to keep the flames under control and let them burn themselves out. At one o'clock the Rotunda succumbed and when the great dome caved in, there were tears in the eyes of the hundreds of spectators, and the writer knows that the men at the end of the bucket-line on Dr. Buckmaster's house all had a hard cry. A few minutes later, the bell on the front portico, came crashing down through the burning timbers, clanging out a last death note, as it struck each obstruction in its path,— THE LIBRARY. Note Statue of Jefferson to left. Until Fayerwether Gymnasium opened in September, 1893, Final Balls danced here.—the orchestra starting "Home, Sweet Home," when Sun appeared over Monticello Mountain. the last note that old bell ever rang, for it was badly melted by the heat and what was left was broken up and carried off as souvenirs. By half-past two o'clock it was considered that the fire was under control, so at three o'clock the Faculty met in the Chemistry lecture room to devise ways and means for carrying on the work of the University without interruption, and at this meeting all the members of the Faculty were present, except Prof. Stone (detained) and Prof. Echols (injured); and Rector Randolph and Mr. Armistead Gordon of the Board of Visitors, were also present. The following is the schedule of how the different classes met in that time of emergency:—* * Note—See Faculty Minute Book, October 27, 1895, p. 101. MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY. Hour "Jeff."

The night of the fire, the Lawn was littered with books, instruments from the different laboratories, book-cases, desks, benches, and what-not, while near the steps of the Rotunda, its recent home, lay the statue of Jefferson, enshrouded in a large canvas and guarded by special watchmen. When the moon came out, as though to take a last look at the pride of Jefferson's latter days, it was a ghastly and a heart-rending sight to see the blackened walls and hollow windows, and the tall, white pillars, with their marble capitals all smoked up, standing as silent sentinels, on the old portico, where had stood so many of the men of note of this country, beneath the shadow of the dome of the Old Rotunda, it was certainly a sad, sad sight. All night long the University mechanics, who had worked so hard all day on the fire, kept saw and hammer and plane going in order that the lecture rooms might be ready for the morning lectures, and it was through the labors of Noreck (he was not known as "president" Noreck in those days) and his assistants that it was possible for the work to go on as usual. When we stop to think of it, one is inclined to think that there must be some mistake about it, but it is, nevertheless, true. Although the whole of the Academic Department, the whole of the Law Department and the whole of the Engineering Department, together with the University Library, were in total and absolute ruin, yet it is a fact that the next morning at 9 o'clock,—sadly enough, there was no bell to ring that morning,—every class in the University met just as it had met the week before. The only difference was that we sat in new seats in new lecture rooms and everyone wore a fatigued, worn-out, weary and sorrowful expression as though he had lost his most valued friend,—and some there were in the Faculty, who had. One might call this living up to University of Virginia records with a vengeance, and it certainly was. About the only change in the routine of college life here at the University was that the T. I. L. K. A. Society postponed its fall initiation from All Hallo'een night for two weeks, "out of respect for the memory of the Rotunda"; and be it said to the infinite credit of the student body that the University probably never saw the time when lectures were better attended than they were that day after the fire,—the boys seemed to take a manly pride in showing that they were equal to the occasion. The monetary loss incurred by the fire was approximately $175,000, while the insurance amounted to $25,000, distributed as follows: Rotunda $ 8,000 Library and pictures 8,000 Annex 3,500 Scientific apparatus 3,500 School of Athens 1,000 Old Chapel 500 Y. M. C. A. Reading Room 500 Total $25,000 The following is a list of those who received injuries while fighting the fire: Prof. Echols, hand broken and minor cuts and bruises caused by falling through the roof of the Reading Room; E. DeJarnette, cut and bruised and leg broken (?) by breaking of rope being used to pull down roof of Old Chapel; Eugene Davis, prostrated by heat; Mr. Hall, of Washington State, ankle broken; Chas. A. Haberlee, bruised, cut and back sprained by falling through the roof of the Old Chapel; A boy, named Murray, a leg broken by running to get out of the way of a charge of dynamite; J. J. Smith, a Staunton fireman, bruised and cut by falling through the roof of the Old Chapel; Frank Hunt, prostrated by heat; Lloyd Williams, seriously prostrated by heat, and unconscious THE FIRE Note that clock stopped at five minutes to twelve o'clock. and raving for several days after the fire, though he soon recovered. In every city in the state, crowds thronged the telegraph offices, eager to hear the latest news from the scene of disaster. When the news reached Richmond, it spread like wildfire and was soon the only topic of conversation on the streets. Men gathered in little knots on the corners and, turning back the leaves of memory to the days when life on the old arcades had instilled into them that peculiar love of alma mater, so characteristics of the alumni of the University of Virginia, discussed the latest details of news from the telegraph offices. Some of the ministers alluded to the disaster that night: the whole city, the whole state, and the entire South each seemed to think that it had sustained a personal loss. And so it then seemed, but not so, for come to-day and see the New Rotunda like a phœnix risen from the ashes of the old. When it had become evident that the fire was beyond the control of the local fire-fighting facilities, a law student, named Aubrey N. Bowers, of Henrico Co., suggested to Col. Venable that telegrams, asking assistance, be sent to neighboring cities. The Colonel approved this suggestion and the local chief telegraphed to the Chiefs of Richmond, Lynchburg and Staunton, requesting that help be sent. These messages were given to Bowers to take to the telegraph office at the Junction, as Anderson's was not yet open, though it opened later and remained open all day. As it was a state institution, Bowers wrote a message while at the Junction, appraising Governor O'Ferrall of the state of affairs, asked that some of the Richmond fire apparatus be sent up on a special train and signed the message, "William M. Thornton, Chairman." He later told Prof. Thornton of his action and that gentleman approved it. To Staunton, went the message, "University on fire: beyond our control: water out: send fire department." Staunton, which had no fire engine at that time, but depended upon gravity pressure, sent a plentiful supply of hose and fifteen men, who arrived on No. 4 about noon and did good work. A similar message to Lynchburg brought a special train, bearing an engine, hose and men. The engine took up a position on the skating pond, and did excellent work in spite of the handicap of having to pump through a long line of hose up the steep hill. The Richmond Fire Department received the message to Chief Puller at 11:30 A. M. It read, "Please send a fire engine at once. The Rotunda and Public Hall on fire and the University in danger." (Signed) T. J. Williams, Chief Fire Department, Charlottesville. Mr. Minor, in charge of Fire Headquarters in Richmond, at once notified Chief Puller, who was at church, but in the meanwhile Assistant Chief Shaw had been telephoned to by Governor O'Ferrall, and the Assistant Chief had notified President Frischcorn of the Fire Commissioners for permission to send apparatus out of the city and had at the same time telephoned Mr. C. C. Walker, Assistant Superintendent of the C. &amp; O., that they needed a special train immediately. Chief Puller telegraphed Charlottesville as to water supply and received a reply saying that it was bad and suggesting that he send a chemical engine, but his experience told him that a chemical engine would be of little use at a fire like that, so at 12:05 P. M., steamer No. 3, with firemen and 1,500 feet of hose left Fire Headquarters for the old Broad Street Station of the C. &amp; O.* * Note—See records at Fire Department Headquarters, Broad and 9th Sts., Richmond, Virginia. As soon as Mr. Walker received the telephone message telling him that a special train was needed, he left his home and impressed the first vehicle that he came across, which happened to be a hack, and told the driver to get him to Broad Street Station just as fast as he could do it. While the yard engine was making up an "extra" of a couple of flats and a day coach, Mr. Walker went out to the roundhouse and got the fastest passenger engine that was under steam. When the firemen arrived at the station, they found the train waiting with white flags set. It was now but the work of a few minutes to load the apparatus, and at 12:44,—one hour and fourteen minutes after the receipt of the first telegram in Richmond,—the special was on its way to Charlottesville at sixty-five miles an hour and with right of way over everything. A stop was made for a moment at Beaver Dam for orders and Assistant Chief Shaw telegraphed the Charlottesville authorities to have horses at the station for the engine and hose wagon. When she swung around the long gradual curve going into Gordonsville, the engineer sighted the "red board" hanging across the track, so he applied his brakes in emergency, but the train did not stop until she had run several hundred feet beyond the station. Upon returning to the platform, they found a telegram to Mr. Walker saying that their services were no longer needed, as the flames had won the race and destroyed everything in their path. The special returned to Richmond, arriving there at 5:30 that afternoon, and the C. &amp; O. R. R. very generously declined to make any charge for the services of the train, as did also the Southern Railroad for the special train from Lynchburg. The night after the fire, there was a great mass-meeting of the officers, professors and students of the University in the Chapel,—"a family gathering," said Mr. Thornton, Chairman, who had called the meeting for the purpose of mutual encouragement and for making to the students some fitting official acknowledgment of their heroic efforts of the day before: professors spoke encouraging their confreres in the Faculty and commending the courage of the students; students spoke promising hearty co-operation with the Faculty to enable them to carry on the work of the University uninterruptedly, and commended the rash daring of fellow-students. Curiously enough, no mention was made of thanking the ladies for the part they had taken in the work of the day before. The Chairman was on his feet making the closing speech. Finally a student, over yonder in one of the choir-seats, arose and with faltering voice and trembling limbs, stammered out a motion "that a vote of thanks be tendered by the student-body of the University, there assembled, to the ladies of the University and Charlottesville for the valuable assistance they had rendered in handling water along the bucket-lines; for their noble examples which had stimulated the boys on to their work, and for their unceasing, noble, untiring and heroic work in saving the contents of the Library." Before the motion could be completed, the throng broke into a great cheer, for each one seemed to realize what had been left undone, and the speaker had to sit down. Needless to say, there were as many seconds as there were votes for the motion. A good many of the professors spoke at the mass-meeting,— in the following order (?), as well as can be ascertained:— Profs. Thornton, Peters, Noah K. Davis, Mallet, Barringer, Tuttle, Lile, Venable, Echols (amidst prolonged applause), Fontaine, and Dunnington. Certain it is that no occasion ever gathered into the Chapel such a throng as packed the building that Monday night, and all went away with revived spirits and a determination to live up to any emergency that the conditions might bring about, and right nobly did both students and professors sacrifice themselves to all sorts of inconveniences without even a murmur. It may be of interest to note in passing that, as there was no other place sufficiently large, the Final Exercises of that session were held in the Chapel; and when Penton, long Virginia's greatest foot-ball star, walked up to get his M. D. Degree, the Long Yell rang lustily through the arched roof over head. While the day was full of woe and grief, there were also many ludicrous happenings. Take, for instance, the lady, who rushed into the Library and threw out of a window the pitcher and basin, which Librarian Page used for washing his hands, and then brought down stairs a box of large Manila envelopes. There was also the sister-in-law of one of the professors who procured a gallon jug of whiskey from somewhere, and did splendid service in resuscitating three men (whether students or townspeople, I do not know), who took it turn about wallowing in a mud-puddle behind the Rotunda and then letting the other two bring him up to the jug to be revived. And so these three men managed to get rid of the gallon of whiskey, which the benevolent and philanthropic lady dispersed with so lavish a hand. Again, take the case of the wife of a professor, who in her ardor emptied the scrap-basket into her silken skirt and took the contents far down the Lawn and deposited them in a place of safety. There was the case of some rare old wine, stored in the attic of Dr. Buckmaster's house (Prof. Lewis' present house). It was noticed by those at the end of the bucket-line running up through this house that, the man at the trap-door was constantly changing, but nothing was thought of it until Dr. Buckmaster invited us to a repast of light refreshments, when he discovered that there was no "rare old wine" in the house, or any other kind, for that matter, and then it dawned upon us, who had been at the end of the line, why the man at the trap-door was constantly changing. When the news of the fire had permeated into Charlottesville as a real fact, the people were well on their way to church, Someone got word to the Rev. Harry Lee, who was holding services at the Midway School House (for the Episcopal Church was being rebuilt at that time), that the University was on fire, so the reverend gentleman offered up a prayer, asking that the Rotunda be spared, straightway dismissed his congregation and hastened to the University to join the firefighters. It is said that, while the work of salvage in the Library was at its height, the venerable Professor of Logic and Phychology was seen making remarkably good speed down the Lawn with a rare old canvas on his shoulder and the picture turned out to be that of,—Prof. Noah K. Davis. The following Christmas, a party of students was standing on the platform at Gordonsville, waiting for a train, homeward bound; and by the way, it might be well to note that that was the first time that the student of the University of Virginia ever knew what it was to have Christmas Holiday, for prior to that time, Christmas Day was the only day in the session that the students could call a holiday. One or two old darkies lounging around the platform got to talking to the boys, and the conversation naturally turned to the fire, "Yessa," said an old uncle, "Missa Jones,—he de gemman ober dar to de telegraf office,—he say dat de Newniversty was on fi' and dat de fi' train was a-comin', so we niggers jes' set 'round hwer' and arter awhile,—jes'es she was a-blowin' for de station,—down yonder to de county line,—Missa Jones he got a message sayin' dat de Newniversy was out en to stop 'er, so he gib'er de red bode, but, gemman, she run two hundred yards by de station 'fore she cud stop,—she was jes'aflyin', she wus, and dat big eengine a-settin' up dar on de flat-car! She jes' look like a car-load full o' di'mon's sot on fi' een de middle, but dey tell me she wus a nigger (nickle) plated eengine. Lord, but she wus flyin'!" "'Board," yelled the conductor, and we were off for Richmond and a week's vacation.
