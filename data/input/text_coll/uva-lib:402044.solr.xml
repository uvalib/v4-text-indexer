      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF VIRGINIA. VIRGINIA IN THE CONFEDERATE STATES NAVY. When President Davis formed his Cabinet, he called to the Navy department, as secretary, the Hon. Stephen Mallory, of Florida. Mr. Mallory, born on the island of Trinidad, 1813, died at Pensacola, Florida, November 9, 1873, was admitted to the bar in Florida in 1839; served in the war against the Seminoles; was some years inspector of customs and collector of customs at Key West; represented Florida in the United States Senate for the ten years preceding the secession of that state, and was chairman of the senate committee on naval affairs most of the time; served as secretary of the Confederate States Navy until that government ceased to exist; was arrested at La Grange, Georgia (where his family was then residing), May 20, 1865; confined at Fort Lafayette until released on parole in March, 1866; returned to Florida in July, 1866, and practiced law in Pensacola until his death. Upon those to whom was confided the conduct of Confederate naval affairs devolved first the task of creating a navy for a section of country without ships or seamen, unsupplied with iron or with skilled workmen to fashion it; having no mills or shops capable of turning out such work. The Tredegar Ironworks, at Richmond, Virginia, was the only establishment south of the Potomac where a large gun could be cast. There was not in the southern country a mill that could cast a two and one-half inch plate. The Confederacy had no naval arsenal, no naval stores, no natural resources available for the creation of a navy. Of the woods needed for such purpose there was, indeed, a bountiful supply in the pine belts and live-oak groves from Georgia to the Gulf; but the supply of wood was of no use without facilities for construction, and these were lacking. The people of the south were an agricultural people, and not manufacturers, nor devoted to commercial pursuits. Private shipyards were few, and of no value in the emergency. The only public dockyards within Confederate limits were at Norfolk, Virginia, and Pensacola, Florida. The latter was never of first-class position, being used for purposes of shelter and repairs. Only one vessel had ever been completely constructed at the Pensacola yard, the third-class screw steamer Seminole. The hull of the Pensacola, a second-class screw steamer, was built there, but the steamer was completed at the Washington yards. THE NORFOLK NAVY YARD IN APRIL, 1861. The yard at Norfolk was, on the contrary, one of the oldest and perhaps the most valuable and important naval establishment the United States Government possessed. It had a magnificent granite dry dock, foundry and machine shops; two complete shiphouses and one unfinished; officers' houses and naval barracks; tools and machinery of all kinds; material, ammunition and provisions of every description. From its stock had been launched two sloops-of-the-line, one frigate, four sloops-of-war, one brig, four screw steamers, and one side-wheel steamer. A vast amount of rebuilding and refitting was done there every year. On the night of April 20, 1861, this stronghold was laid waste and abandoned by the United States troops stationed there, eight hundred marines and seamen with officers, under command of Commodore C. S. McCauley. Shiphouses, storehouses and offices were fired, guns in the parks were spiked, machinery broken up. The sloop-of-war Cumberland, flagship of the Home squadron, United States navy, was lying off in the Elizabeth river. To this were carried such stores as could be transferred, and the remainder destroyed. Ships at the docks were set on fire and scuttled; the most of them burned. The ships were: Line-of-battle ships Pennsylvania and Delaware, the first in commission as a receiving ship, the second carrying seventy-four guns; line-of-battle ship Columbus, eighty guns; frigates Raritan and Columbia, fifty guns each; sailing sloops Plymouth and Germantown, twenty-two guns each; brig Dolphin, four guns, and the steam frigate Merrimac, which alone was valued at $1,200,000. The line-of-battle ship New York was in shiphouse A, and was also burned. The old frigate United States escaped destruction, and soon after the evacuation was taken down the river and sunk at its mouth by Virginia troops. The Pawnee, United States navy, had left Washington the day previous, under command of Commodore Hiram Paulding, whose orders were to bring off the vessels lying at the Norfolk yard. He was two hours too late. The work of destruction had begun, and the Pawnee was put to use to tow the Cumberland down the river with the departing Federal troops on board. The loss to the Federal Government in the destruction was incalculable. The direct value of the property destroyed was estimated by the Unites States Naval Department as $9,760,181; but a greater loss to that government resulted from allowing such valuable and much needed stores to fall indirectly into the hands of those upon whom it was about to wage war. Immediately on the departure of the Federal forces the citizens of Norfolk and the two military companies then in the city broke into the yard and devoted themselves to saving the property, heedless of personal risk from flying firebrands and igniting powder. The dry dock was saved, although twenty-six barrels of powder had been distributed in the culvert north of the dock, and a train laid to a lighted fuse. Two thousand guns were found practically uninjured, a large portion of them the new Dahlgren guns of various caliber. Small arms, machinery, steel plates, castings, construction materials, ordnance and equipment stores, were saved from the flames. Later the spiked cannon were restored to use. The fire on the Merrimac was quenched when she had burned to the water line, her hull and boilers, and the heavy and costly part of her engine, but little injured. Restored to service at a later date, she took her place in the history of the war as the famous ironclad ram Virginia. The hull of the Germantown, with her battery of ten large guns, was raised in June following. The Plymouth was also found worthy of repairs, and put to service. All this the devotion of Virginians saved to the Confederacy. On Monday morning, April 22d, the flag of Virginia, raised by Lieutenant C. F. M. Spotswood, formerly of the United States navy, floated over the yard. VIRGINIA CREATES A NAVY. Ordinance No. 9, passed by the Virginia State Convention on the same day that convention passed the Ordinance of Secession, April 17, 1861, empowered the Governor of Virginia to call for volunteers for state defense, and to "invite all efficient and worthy Virginians and residents of Virginia in the army and navy of the United States to retire therefrom, and to enter the service of Virginia," where they would be given "the same rank as that held in the United States service or its equivalent." April 22d, Robert E. Lee, late colonel United States army, was appointed commander-in-chief of the army and navy of Virginia. April 27th, an ordinance was passed creating the navy of Virginia, to consist of two thousand marines and seamen with their proper officers. The constitution of the Confederate States was ratified and proclaimed binding upon the people of Virginia by Ordinance No. 56, when all military and naval affairs in the state were transferred to the control of that government. DEFENSES ALONG THE POTOMAC, YORK AND RAPPAHANNOCK RIVERS. One of the first official acts of General Lee as commander of the Virginia forces was to provide for the construction of batteries to guard Virginia waters against the passage of hostile vessels. In May, 1861, a battery was erected at Acquia creek, on the Potomac, under supervision of Confederate States naval officers, Captain William C. Lynch, Commander Robert D. Thorburn, and Lieutenants H. H. Lewis and John Wilkinson. This protected the terminus of the railroad to Richmond, guarded the approaches to Fredericksburg from the Potomac, and at the same time menaced Federal navigation of that river. Enlistments for the navy not having fairly begun, the battery was manned by infantry volunteers, Captain Lynch in command. The Federal authorities sent the newly organized Potomac flotilla to destroy the battery, three ships, Commander James H. Ward: the Freeborn, three guns, the Resolute, two guns, the Anascostia, two guns. On May 31st and June 1st, these ships shelled the battery without effect. Captain Lynch, in his official report, dated June 2, 1861, says: "On Friday two out of three steamers abreast of the battery opened fire on us, and continued the cannonade for three hours, when they withdrew. * * * Upon our part no one was injured. Yesterday the steamers, which had laid off during the night, were reinforced by the Pawnee, and at 11:30 they commenced a brisk cannonade, which continued with little interruption until about 4:30 p. m., during which the Pawnee fired 392 shot and shell, and the other steamers 207, the greater portion of the latter being rifled shell." The firing from the battery damaged the Freeborn so much she was obliged to put back to Washington for repairs. The only casualty on the Confederate side was one man wounded in hand, losing a finger. A battery of ten heavy guns was recommended for Mathias Point, that bluff headland commanding the waters of the Potomac for more than a mile. Before work was begun, June 26th, Commander Ward detailed a party from the Resolute, which he accompanied, to seize and hold the Point, and erect a Federal battery. The detail landed, but were met by Virginia troops under Colonel R. M. Mayo, and driven back to the boats with heavy loss, Commander Ward among the killed. The Virginia troops held the Point, and a heavy battery was erected there. In September and October four heavy batteries, mounting in all twenty guns, were constructed at Evansport, near the mouth of Quantico creek. These swept the Potomac, which was but a mile and a half wide at this point, and with channel near the Virginia shore. The batteries at Acquia creek, Mathias Point and Evansport were practically a blockade of the Potomac waters, and the blockade was maintained through the entire winter following. This was not only a serious inconvenience to the Federal authorities at Washington, and to the residents of that city, but also had its effect at the North. The New York Tribune, of March 1, 1862, said: "There has been no safe communication by water between this city and the capital of this nation during all this time—a period of six months. This is one of the most humiliating of all the national disgraces to which we have been compelled to submit. It has been most damaging to us in the eyes of the world," etc. Shortly after these batteries were unmasked, a small steamer, the George Page, which had been captured by the Confederates, was armed and renamed the City of Richmond. The Federal authorities, apprehending an invasion of Maryland from the vicinity of Acquia creek, sent a division from the Army of the Potomac to the Maryland shore of the Potomac. These troops camped a mile or so back from the river, from Port Tobacco, opposite Acquia creek, to within about twenty miles of Washington. During the winter of 1861-2 the saucy little City of Richmond made several dashes across the river, shelling these camps, keeping up the fears of a Confederate landing in Maryland, aiding also in checking navigation of the river. This boat was burned by Confederate orders in March, 1862, in Quantico creek, when the troops and guns were removed from the batteries of the lower Potomac to Fredericksburg. Other fortifications erected in the summer of 1861 and winter of 1861-2 were: batteries at Harper's Ferry, covering Bolivar, and approaches by the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers; batteries at Lowery's and Accoheek Points (Fort Lowery), Gray's Point, Cherry Point, guarding the Rappahannock river; batteries at Gloucester Point, West Point and Yorktown, guarding the York river. These, and other batteries constructed to guard the Potomac, York and Rappahannock rivers, were manned mainly by infantry troops and commanded by naval officers. In the spring of 1862 the Confederate base was changed from the Potomac to the Rappahannock; from York river to the Chickahominy. The troops and guns were transferred, and batteries along the Potomac and York abandoned. THE ST. NICHOLAS. The St. Nicholas, of Baltimore, was a sidewheel steamer of about twelve hundred tons, plying regularly between Baltimore and Georgetown, D. C., and carrying supplies to the Pawnee, of the Potomac flotilla. Its capture for Confederate service was planned and executed by Richard Thomas, of St. Mary's County, Maryland, a young gentleman in sympathy, as were so many residents of that state, with the cause of the South. The capture was thus effected: Mr. Thomas, in female attire, and personating a French lady, took passage on the St. Nicholas on Friday, June 28, 1861. Of medium height and light weight, and speaking French with a good accent, he was able to carry his disguise without awakening any suspicion. At different landings of the boat, the few whom he had trusted with his plans, and who were to assist him, came on board as passengers. Among these was Captain Geo. N. Hollins, who had resigned from the United States navy, and was to command the St. Nicholas if her capture was made. When the steamer had left Point Lookout landing a mile or so behind, and was headed for Georgetown, Mr. Thomas threw off his disguise, appearing armed, and in Zouave costume. Surrounded by about twenty-five "passengers," who also were transformed into armed Zouaves, he demanded the surrender of the boat. Its officers, the crew being unarmed, accepted the situation, and Mr. Thomas took possession of the steamer. The alarm of the genuine passengers was quieted with the assurance that they should be treated with every courtesy and landed at the earliest moment possible; the officers and crew were confined in the hold, the lights were extinguished, and the steamer headed for the Virginia shore. At 3:30 the next morning she stopped at the wharf at mouth of Cone river, where she took on board some Confederate States naval officers, part of the First Tennessee Infantry, and sailors from Yorktown, waiting there by previous arrangement. Captain Hollins then took command of the boat. The intention was to bear down from that point on the Pawnee, and with these reinforcements take possession of that boat with or without a fight, as might be. This capture was feasible, as the St. Nicholas was allowed to come alongside the Pawnee with supplies unchallenged every trip. But a delay at Cone river for the arrival of the infantry gave time for the Pawnee to receive notice of the capture of the St. Nicholas, and the plan of surprise and capture was frustrated, the Pawnee retreating toward Washington. On June 29th, Captain Hollins, with the St. Nicholas, captured three vessels: the brig Monticello, from Brazil to Baltimore, cargo 3,500 bags of coffee; the schooner Mary Pierce, Boston to Washington with 200 tons of ice on board; schooner Margaret, Alexandria to Staten Island, with cargo of 270 tons of coal. On the Monticello was also found important mail and dispatches revealing the plans of the United States squadron off Brazil, which was promptly forwarded to Richmond. Lieutenant Simms, Confederate States navy, took the Monticello up the Rappahannock river, where she was unloaded, after which her former crew were permitted to take her back to her owners in Baltimore. Lieutenant R. D. Minor, Virginia navy, took the Mary Pierce to Fredericksburg, where her cargo of ice sold for eight thousand dollars. Lieutenant Robert D. Thorburn, Virginia navy, took temporary command of the Margaret. The St. Nicholas and the two schooners were a valuable addition to the Confederate naval force, the captured cargoes were highly appreciated, and, altogether, the service rendered in the two days by Mr. Thomas and Captain Hollins, with their assistants, was not only brilliant and inspiriting, but of great value. The St. Nicholas remained in Confederate service until burned with many other vessels at Fredericksburg, when that city was evacuated. Captain Hollins was transferred, July 10, 1861, to command of the naval defenses of the James river. On July 1, 1861, Governor Letcher, in recognition of Mr. Thomas' services, issued a commission as colonel of Virginia volunteers to him, under the name of Richard Thomas Zarnova, and enlistments were begun for a regiment of Zouaves to be commanded by him. Colonel Thomas-Zarnova, elated by his success and the resultant praise, conceived the idea of repeating the exploit. He returned to Baltimore and took passage, July 7th, on the Mary Washington, with friends who were to assist him in her capture. He was recognized and made prisoner on the boat, near Annapolis, and confined at Fort McHenry, where he was treated with great rigor, and made several unsuccessful attempts to escape. On December 3, 1861, he was transferred to Fort Lafayette, and held prisoner in close confinement there until released by exchange in April, 1863. It was the first intention of the Federal Government to refuse him recognition as a prisoner of war, General Dix having officially recommended that he be treated as "a traitor and a spy." Only the vigorous protest of Governor Letcher and of the Virginia legislature against such treatment of one holding commission as a Virginia officer, accompanied by threat of retaliation, saved him from this fate. He returned to Richmond after his release, but took no further active part in the war, having suffered in mind and body from his long and close confinement. DEFENSES ALONG THE JAMES, NANSEMOND AND ELIZABETH RIVERS. On April 18, 1861, Governor Letcher appointed Major-General William B. Taliaferro, of the state militia, to the command "of the state troops which are now or may be assembled at the city of Norfolk." Robert B. Pegram and Catesby apR. Jones were appointed captains in the navy and ordered to Norfolk, Captain Pegram to "assume command of the naval station, with authority to organize naval defenses, enroll and enlist seamen and marines, and temporarily appoint warrant officers, and to do and perform whatever may be necessary to preserve and protect the property of the commonwealth and of the citizens of Virginia." The land and naval forces were instructed to cooperate. These three repaired to Norfolk on the same day, General Taliaterro accompained by Major Nat. Tyler and Captain Henry Heth, of his staff. The only troops then, or until after the evacuation, in Norfolk, were two companies, the "Norfolk Blues" and the "Portsmouth Grays." On Saturday evening, the 20th, after the Federal troops had abandoned the navy yard, some four hundred state volunteers arrived from Petersburg; the next day the "Richmond Grays" reported to General Taliaferro, and on Monday three companies from Georgia. After the evacuation Commodore French Forrest took command of the navy yard, and General Walter Gwynn succeeded General Taliaferro in command of the land forces. Preparations for coast defense were at once begun, naval officers superintending the construction of batteries, all available state force detailed to the work. The necessity for this was obvious. The estuary of Hampton Roads, receiving the waters of the James, Nansemond and Elizabeth rivers, and their outlet to Chesapeake bay, was protected by the guns of Fortress Monroe. Its safe and commodious harbor was sure to become a rendezvous for Federal vessels, and vessels commanding Hampton Roads waters would not only blockade Virginia ports, but could at any time, if unopposed, descend upon her coast, ascend her rivers, and lay waste or invest her coast and river cities. Upon the James was Richmond, the capital of the state, soon to be the Confederate States capital. Upon opposite banks of the Elizabeth were Portsmouth and Norfolk, and, just above Portsmouth, nearly opposite Norfolk, the navy yard. Up the Nansemond was Suffolk, the point where the Norfolk. &amp; Petersburg railroad crossed the river, which, if seized by Federal troops, would isolate Norfolk and enable the Federals to regain the navy yard they had just abandoned. The work of fortifying was pushed with all possible expedition and with all available means. Before the winter of 1861-2 was over a line of river batteries and forts for coast defense was established. Along the Elizabeth, from the guns mounted at Fort Norfolk and a battery between the fort and the wharf, were batteries at Lambert's Point, Tanner's Creek, and extending to Sewell Point on one bank of the river; on the other, batteries at the Naval Hospital, at Penner's Point, and twenty guns on Craney island, off Wise's Point. Bushy Point and Soller's Point had batteries also. Near the mouth of the Nansemond were batteries at Town Point and Pig Point on one side, at Cedar Point and Barrel Point on the other; also at Pagan Creek. James river was defended by batteries at Jamestown, Jamestown Island, Mulberry Point, Harden Bluff. Fort Powhatan guarded the ascent of the Appomattox river. The Federals, in addition to the commanding defense of Fortress Monroe, had Fort Wool at the Rip Raps and powerful land batteries at Newport News. On May 1, 1861, Captain Pendergrast, commanding the Home squadron, United States navy, reported to the Federal authorities that he had sufficient naval force off Fortress Monroe to blockade Virginia ports, and from that date open communication between Virginia and Northern States ceased. May 24th, Brigadier-General Benjamin Huger succeeded General Gwynn in command of infantry troops in and around Norfolk. May 21st, Colonel J. B. Magruder, of the Provisional Army of Virginia, was placed in command of military operations and forces on the peninsula, with instructions to provide for the safety of Yorktown and Jamestown. July 10th, the defenses of the James river were assigned to Captain George N. Hollins, Confederate States navy. At the close of 1861 the principal forts and batteries in charge of naval officers were commanded as follows: Sewell's Point, Commander W.L Maury; Fort Nelson, Commander Charles F. McIntosh; Fort Norfolk, Commander R.F. Pinkney; Penner's Point, Lieutenant George W. Harrison; Pig Point, Lieutenant R. R. Carter. Batteries at Cedar Point, Barrel Point and Pagan Creek were in charge of Commander R. L. Page until he was sent to Gloucester Point. Lambert's Point battery was commanded by Lieutenant J. S. Taylor, Confederate States army. The first vessels available for Confederate service in these waters were gathered in the James river: The Yorktown (formerly the Patrick Henry of the New York and Old Dominion steamship line); the Jamestown (of the same line), renamed the Thomas Jefferson, but persistently called the Jamestown; the Teaser, a river tug. These, in the winter of 1861-2, were under command of Captain John R. Tucker, and stationed off Mulberry Island, where the battery at Harden's Point closed James river to the enemy. The Jamestown carried two guns, the Teaser one, the Yorktown (or Patrick Henry) six. The latter was fitted for naval service by her executive officer, Lieutenant William Llewellyn Powell, who had her cabins taken off, her deck strengthened, and one-inch iron plate (all she could bear) put abreast her boiler and engines, extending a few feet beyond each way and below the water line. This boat ran out toward Newport News and skirmished with the enemy's vessels on September 13th, and again on December 2d. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VIRGINIA. The steam frigate Merrimac was built at the Charlestown (Mass.) navy yard in 1855, of thirty-five hundred tons burden, and to carry forty guns. Her last service in the United States navy was in the Pacific squadron. As already recorded, she was lying at the Norfolk yard when it was abandoned by the Federal troops, and was scuttled and set on fire. After burning to the water's edge she sank with guns, boilers and engine practically uninjured. Six days later her guns were raised by Virginia naval officers, and sent to Sewell's Point and other defenses of Norfolk. On May 30th the frigate was raised and pulled into the dry dock. Early in June, 1861, Lieutenant John M. Brooke, Confederate States navy, a former officer of the United States navy who had resigned to enter the Virginia naval service, submitted to Secretary Mallory a plan for protecting ships with iron cladding, and suggested the remodeling of the Merrimac in accordance with the plan. Upon request of Secretary Mallory, John L. Porter, naval constructor at Norfolk, submitted a model for an iron-clad, and Secretary Mallory instructed Lieutenant Brooke and Mr. Porter to investigate the condition of the Merrimac, with William P. Williamson, chief engineer, Confederate States navy, and to "report the best method of making her useful." These officers after careful investigation reported: "In obedience to your orders, we have carefully examined and considered the various plans and propositions for constructing a shot-proof steam battery, and respectfully report that, in our opinion, the steam frigate Merrimac, which is in such condition from the fire as to be useless for any other purpose without heavy expense in rebuilding, etc., can be made an efficient vessel of that character, mounting * * heavy guns, and from the further consideration that we cannot procure a suitable engine and boilers for any other vessel without building them, which would occupy too much time. * * * The bottom of the hull, boilers, and heavy and costly parts of the engine, being but little injured, reduce the cost of construction to about one-third of the amount which would be required to construct such a vessel anew." The report was accepted, the plan adopted, Mr. Porter was put in charge of repairs and construction on the vessel, Mr. Williamson in charge of the engineer's department, and to Lieutenant Brooke was assigned the duties of superintending the manufacture of the iron plates at the Tredegar works, and the preparation of the ship's ordnance To whom should be given the honor of devising the plan on which the Virginia was constructed—that novel combination of iron-sheathed, bomb-proof battery and battering ram, destined, with the still more startlingly novel Monitor, to revolutionize the naval warfare of the world? It is accorded to Lieutenant Brooke in Secretary Mallory's report, by President Davis in his "Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government," by Pollard in his "Lost Cause," by John Taylor Wood, who was a lieutenant on the Virginia, and contributed the record of her services to to the Century war papers. Yet Mr. Porter claimed the honor, and that "great injustice" had been done himself and Engineer Williamson in Secretary Mallory's report. Scharf, in his history of "The Confederate States Navy," sides with Mr. Porter. It is certain the model submitted by Mr. Porter, and by which Secretary Mallory's official orders show the Merrimac was rebuilt into the Virginia, was distinctively the conception of Mr. Porter, worked out by him before he ever heard of Lieutenant Brooke's plans or saw his drawings. It is equally certain that Lieutenant Brooke's plans and drawings were made with no knowledge of Mr. Porter's model, that his drawings and the model offered practically the same results, and that it was by his plans the secretary's attention was first called to this innovation on accepted methods of construction. It is a singular coincidence, worthy of note in this connection, that before the Virginia was constructed the iron-cladding of boats was put to practical test, and by neither Lieutenant Brooke nor Mr. Porter. Lieutenant Powell had originated the theory also, and put it in operation on the little Yorktown. However the honor of the plans of the Virginia should be awarded, the three officers to whom her construction was entrusted are entitled to great praise for the energy with which they performed their work under discouraging circumstances. Not the least of these was the conflict of views and of authority between the constructor at Norfolk and the Bureau of Construction at Richmond; a conflict that ultimately resulted in those imperfections of the Virginia which so greatly detracted from her serviceableness. In addition to this unnecessary drawback, were others against which no provision could have been made. Experienced workmen were few, and in many instances these had to make their tools before they could use them. There were no patterns to follow in constructing the boat, no guide for the workmen except the drawings and calculations. Errors were made, and work had to be done over again. At the Tredegar works was the same paucity of workmen. These works, turned from common iron workshops into a manufactory of every kind of munition of war for the entire Confederacy, were taxed to their utmost capacity. The work on the Virginia went on but slowly, though even "blacksmiths, finishers and strikers performed extra work gratuitously, in order to expedite the completion," as Flag-Officer Forrest reported on January 11, 1862. Begun in June, 1861, the Virginia was not ready for service until the close of February, 1862. On February 27, 1862, Captain Franklin Buchanan was ordered to the command of the James River squadron. In addition to the Patrick Henry (or Yorktown), the Jamestown and the Teaser, already mentioned, the Raleigh and Beaufort, each small vessels carrying one gun only, were now a part of this fleet. To these the Virginia was now to be added as the flagship of the squadron. Its officers were: Flag-officer, Captain Franklin Buchanan; lieutenant, Catesby apR Jones; executive and ordnance officers, Charles C. Simms, R. D. Minor, Hunter Davidson, John Taylor Wood, J. R. Eggleston, Walter Butt; midshipmen, R. C. Foute, H. H. Marmaduke, H. B. Littlepage, W. J. Craig, J. C. Long, L. M. Rootes; paymaster, James Semple; surgeon, Dinwiddie Phillips; assistant surgeon, Algernon S. Garnett; captain of marines, Reuben Thorn; engineers, H. A. Ramsey, acting chief; assistants, John W. Tynan, Loudon Campbell, Benjamin Herring, C. A. Jack, R. Wright; boatswain, C. H. Hasker; gunner, C. B. Oliver; carpenter, Hugh Lindsey, clerk, Arthur Sinclair; aide (volunteer), Lieutenant Douglas Forrest, Confederate States army, Captain Kevil, commanding detachment of Norfolk united artillery; Sergeant Tabb, signal corps. The crew of three hundred men were a few seamen from Norfolk, eighty sailors whom Lieutenant Wood found in a New Orleans regiment under General Magruder on the peninsula, and other volunteers from the army. The following is Lieutenant Wood's description of the Virginia and her armament: "She was cut down to the old berth-deck. Both ends for seventy feet were covered over, and when the ship was in fighting trim were just awash. On the midship section, one hundred and seventy feet in length, was built, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a roof of pitch-pine and oak twenty-four inches thick, extending from the water line to a height over the gun deck of seven feet. Both ends of the shield were rounded so that the pivot guns could be used as bow and stern chasers or quartering. Over the gun deck was a light grating, making a promenade about twenty feet wide. The wood backing was covered with iron plates, rolled at the Tredegar works at Richmond, two inches thick and eight wide. The first tier was put on horizontal, the second up and down—in all four inches, bolted through the woodwork and clinched inside. The prow was of cast iron, projecting four feet, and badly secured, as events proved. The rudder and propeller were entirely unprotected. The pilot house was forward of the smoke stack, and covered with the same thickness of iron on the sides. Her motive power was the same that had always been in the ship. * * * Her armament consisted of two seven-inch rifles, heavily reinforced around the breech with three-inch steel bands, shrunk on; these were the first heavy guns so made [their construction was under Lieutenant Brooke's direct supervision, and every gun was tested by him] and were the bow and stern pivots; there were also two six-inch rifles of the same make, and six nine-inch smooth bore broadside—ten guns in all." THE SERVICE OF THE VIRGINIA. At noon on Saturday, March 8, 1862, the Virginia, accompanied by the tugs Beaufort and Raleigh, steamed down the Elizabeth river, cheered by the men at the Confederate batteries along the shores. Without a preliminary trial to test her speed and manageableness, she was about to offer battle to the formidable Federal fleet in Hampton Roads. Her defects were at once manifested. Not more than five miles an hour could be got out of her. Her boilers and engines, not improved by sinking, could not be depended on. Her draft was twenty-two feet, and she could not be maneuvered in shoal waters. She was so unwieldy it took from thirty to forty minutes to turn her. In the open water she was joined by the rest of the James River boats, the full fleet as follows: The Virginia, flag-ship, Captain Franklin Buchanan, ten guns; the Patrick Henry, twelve guns, Commander John R. Tucker; the Jamestown, two guns, Lieutenant-Commanding J. N. Barney; the Teaser, one gun, Lieutenant-Commanding W. A. Webb; the Beaufort, one gun, Lieutenant-Commanding W. H. Parker; the Raleigh, one gun, Lieutenant-Commanding J. W. Alexander. Total armament, twenty-seven guns. The Federal fleet off Fortress Monroe was: The Minnesota, forty guns; the Roanoke, forty guns; the St. Lawrence, fifty guns; the gunboats Dragon, Mystic, Whitehall, Oregon, Zouave and Cambridge. Behind these frowned the heavy guns of the fort. Off Newport News, seven miles above, the point itself strongly fortified and held by a large Federal garrison, were two steam frigates: The Congress, fifty guns; the Cumberland, forty guns. At the Rip Raps was Fort Wool, with its heavy gun. Off Sewell Point the Virginia and her escorts turned toward Newport News. The hurried preparations on board the Congress and Cumberland seemed to indicate that the attack was unlooked for. When the Virginia came within three-quarter mile range, the guns of the Cumberland and Congress and the shore batteries opened on her. Answering fire was reserved until the range was shortened, then the forward pivot gun on the Virginia was fired by Lieutenant C. C. Simms. The effect showed what terrible work the ironclad could be counted on to do with her guns. Nearly every one of the crew of the Cumberland's after pivot gun were killed or wounded. The next test was of her ability to disable an antagonist by a blow. The Virginia steered straight for the Cumberland, giving the Congress a broadside fire in passing, which was returned. The Cumberland was struck under the forerigging, nearly at right angles, and her side went in like an egg shell. The blow was hardly felt on the Virginia, though her ram was left in the Cumberland as she backed off, and the side of the Cumberland, Lieutenant Wood says, "was opened wide enough to drive in a horse and cart." As the Virginia backed clear of her, the Cumberland began to list to port, and fill rapidly. Her guns were manfully served as long as they were above water, and when her crew were driven to the spar deck they continued to fire her pivot guns until she went down with colors flying. She sunk in three-quarters of an hour from the time she was struck, and when her hull rested on the sands fifty-four feet below the water, her pennant was still above water, flying from her topmast. The Virginia was headed so as to give her space to turn in. As she swung round, the Congress came in range again, and Lieutenant Wood raked her with three shots from the Virginia's after pivot guns. In trying to get out of range she grounded, but in water where the unfortunate draft of the Virginia would not permit her to follow. The Virginia headed for her, and took position two hundred yards off, where every shot told. For an hour the guns of the Congress answered bravely, but her loss was terrible and her position hopeless. At about half past three she ran up the white flag and lowered her colors. Most of her guns were then disabled, more than half her crew killed or wounded, and her hull had been several times on fire. Among the killed on the Congress was her commanding officer, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, and the surrender was made by Lieutenant Pendergrast to Lieutenant Parker, of the Beaufort, that boat and the Raleigh having been ordered alongside by Captain Buchanan. The orders were to take off the crew and men on the Congress and then set her on fire. But firing from the shore batteries did not cease, although the white flag on the Congress could be seen as plainly on the shore as on the Virginia. This cruel and continuous fire wounded friend and foe alike. Lieutenant Tayloe and Midshipman Hutter, of the Raleigh, with many of the crew, were killed while taking Federal wounded from the Congress. The Raleigh and Beaufort then hauled off, with about thirty prisoners. Of those left on the Congress such as were able escaped to the shore by swimming or in small boats. That those unable thus to escape perished with the ship is to be laid to the charge of their own troops, who, safe on the shore, disregarded the white flag that otherwise would have protected these unfortunate ones. Among those who escaped to the shore was Lieutenant Pendergrast. After surrendering the colors and his side arms on board the Beaufort, he was permitted to return to the Congress to assist in removing the wounded. Violating his parole, he escaped by swimming to the shore. Captain Buchanan ordered hot shot to be fired into the Congress which was done until she was on fire, fore and aft. While directing this he was severely wounded, as was also his flag-lieutenant, Robert D. Minor Command of the Virginia then devolved upon Lieutenant Catesby apR. Jones. Several shore batteries had been silenced by the firing from the Virginia, and from her little consorts of the James River squadron. These smaller boats had been active and serviceable all day. The Patrick Henry was temporarily disabled by a shot through her boiler, which scalded four to death, wounding others. THE VIRGINIA RAMMING THE CUMBERLAND When the engagement opened, the St. Lawrence, Roanoke and Minnesota left their anchorage off Fortress Monroe to come to the assistance of the Cumberland and Congress. The two first grounded a short distance from Fortress Monroe. The Minnesota grounded half way between Old Point and Newport News, but in position to be actively engaged. Lieutenant Jones would have moved on her after the Congress was disposed of, but the pilots of the Virginia would not undertake the necessary management of her with approaching night and ebb tide upon them. The Virginia anchored off Sewell Point for the night. As the night wore away, the booming of the exploding guns of the Congress was heard. Then followed the explosion of her powder magazine, scattering her last fragments, and by her expiring light could be seen all that was left of the Cumberland, the pennant on her sunken mast. It had been a good day's work for the Confederacy. The Virginia had gone to anchor apparently uninjured, for though, under the concentrated fire of more than a hundred guns, everything above deck that could be shot away was gone, her iron armor appeared uninjured. The damage done by the wrenching off of her ram (causing her to leak in next action) was not then apparent. Her entire loss in killed and wounded was only twenty-one. Few that witnessed that day's battle, Confederates or Federals, doubted that the morrow would see the destruction, not only of the Minnesota, but of every Federal boat riding in Hampton Roads. Lieutenant Jones, however, watching on the Virginia, knew that no such victory was assured. In his very interesting contribution to the history of these engagements, published in the Southern Magazine, of Baltimore, prepared at the request of the Southern Historical Society, he says: "One of the pilots chanced, about 11 p. m., to be looking in the direction of the Congress, when there passed a strange looking craft, brought out in bold relief by the burning ship, which he at once proclaimed to be The Ericsson. We were therefore not surprised in the morning to see the Monitor at anchor near the Minnesota. The latter ship was still aground." That the commanding officer of the Virginia knew the Monitor was in the field at 11 p. m. on the 8th, should, it would seem, forever dispose of the oft-repeated assertion that it created "the utmost consternation" on the Virginia to see the Monitor on the morning of the 9th. THE MEETING OF THE VIRGINIA AND THE MONITOR. The construction of the Monitor had been watched at the North with the same interest that in the South had been felt concerning the Virginia, and her appearance afloat was even more novel. The Monitor was a small iron hull, upon which rested a large raft, surmounted by a revolving circular iron turret. The hull was 124 feet long, and thirty-four feet wide at the upper end. The raft projected at bow and stern, and was fifty feet longer than the hull. The turret was eight inches thick, nine feet high, and twenty feet inside diameter. In the turret were two eleven-inch Dahlgren guns. Her draft was ten feet. This was her first great advantage over the Virginia, that she could run into shoal water. Her second point of superiority for the work before them was, that she could turn anywhere, without appreciable loss of time. No more accurate, dispassionate and interesting account of the meeting of these two strange crafts can be given than that which Lieutenant Jones gives in the paper already alluded to, which is as follows: "At 8 a.m. we got under way, as did the Patrick Henry, Jamestown and Teaser. We stood towards the Minnesota, and opened fire on her. The pilots were to have placed us half a mile from her, but we were not at any time nearer than a mile. The Monitor commenced firing when about a third of a mile distant. We soon approached, and were often within a ship's length; once while passing we fired a broadside at her only a few yards distant. She and her turret appeared to be under perfect control. Her light draft enabled her to move about us at pleasure. She once took position for a short time where we could not bring a gun to bear on her. Another of her movements caused us great anxiety; she made for our rudder and propeller, both of which could have been easily disabled. We could only see her guns when they were discharged. We wondered how proper aim could be taken in the very short time the guns were in sight. The Virginia, however, was a large target, and generally so near that the Monitor's shot did not often miss. It did not appear to us that our shell had any effect upon the Monitor. We had no solid shot; musketry was fired at the lookout holes. In spite of all the care of our pilots we ran ashore, where we remained over fifteen minutes. The Patrick Henry and Jamestown, with great risk to themselves, started to our assistance. The Monitor and Minnesota were in full play on us. A small rifle-gun on board the Minnesota, or on the steamer alongside of her, was fired with remarkable precision. "When we saw that our fire made no impression on the Monitor, we determined to run into her if possible. We found it a very difficult feat to do. Our great length and draft, in a comparatively narrow channel, with but little water to spare, made us sluggish in our movements, and hard to steer and turn. When the opportunity was presented all steam was put on; there was not, however, sufficient time to gather full headway before striking. The blow was given with the broad wooden stem, the iron prow having been lost the day before. The Monitor received the blow in such a manner as to weaken the effect, and the damage to her was trifling. Shortly after an alarming leak in our bow was reported. It, however, did not long continue. "Whilst contending with the Monitor, we received the fire of the Minnesota, which we never failed to return when our guns could be brought to bear. We set her on fire, and did her serious injury, though much less than we then supposed. Generally the distance was too great for effective firing. We blew up a steamer alongside of her. "The fight had continued over three hours. To us the Monitor appeared unharmed. We were, therefore, surprised to see her run off into shoal water where our great draft would not permit us to follow, and where our shell could not reach her. The loss of our prow and anchor, and consumption of coal, water, etc., had lightened us so that the lower part of the forward end of the shield was awash. "We for some time waited the return of the Monitor to the Roads After consultation it was decided we should return to the navy yard, in order that the vessel should be brought down into the water and completed. The pilots said that if we did not then leave, that we could not pass the bar until noon of the next day. We, therefore, at 12 m. quitted the Roads and stood for Norfolk. Had there been any sign of the Monitor's willingness to renew the contest we should have remained to fight her. We left her in the shoal water to which she had withdrawn, and which she did not leave until after we had crossed the bar on our way to Norfolk. "The official report says: `Our loss is two killed and nineteen wounded. The stem is twisted and the ship leaks; we have lost the prow, starboard anchor, and all the boats; the armor is somewhat damaged, the steam-pipe and smoke-stack both riddled, the muzzles of the two guns shot away; the colors were hoisted to the smoke-stack, and several times cut down from it.' None were killed or wounded in the fight with the Monitor. The only damage she did was to the armor. She fired forty-one shots. We were enabled to receive most of them obliquely. The effect of a shot striking obliquely on the shield was to break all the iron, and sometimes to displace several feet of the outside course; the wooden backing would not be broken through. When a shot struck directly at right angles, the wood would also be broken through, but not displaced. Generally the shot was much scattered; in three instances two or more struck near the same place, in each case causing more of the iron to be displaced, and the wood to bulge inside. A few struck near the water-line. The shield was never pierced; though it was evident that two shots striking in the same place would have made a large hole through everything. "The ship was docked, a prow of steel and wrought iron put on and a course of two-inch iron on the hull below the roof extending in length 180 feet. Want of time and of material prevented its completion. The damage to the armor was repaired; wrought-iron port shutters were fitted, etc. The rifle guns were supplied with bolts of wrought and chilled iron. The ship was brought a foot deeper in the water, making her draft twenty-three feet. "Commodore Josiah Tatnall relieved Admiral Buchanan in command. On the 11th of April he took the Virginia down to Hampton Roads, expecting to have a desperate encounter with the Monitor. Greatly to our surprise the Monitor refused to fight us. She closely hugged the shore under the guns of the fort with her steam up. Hoping to provoke her to come out, the Jamestown was sent in, and captured several prizes, but the Monitor would not budge. It was proposed to take the vessel to York river, but it was decided in Richmond that she should remain near Norfolk for its protection. "Commodore Tatnall commanded the Virginia for forty-five days, of which time there were only thirteen days that she was not in dock or in the hands of the navy yard. Yet he succeeded in impressing on the enemy that we were ready for active service. It was evident that the enemy very much overrated our power and efficiency. The South also had the same exaggerated idea of the vessel. "On the 8th of May, a squadron, including the Monitor, bombarded our batteries at Sewell's Point. We immediately left the yard for the Roads. As we drew near, the Monitor and her consorts ceased bombarding, and retreated under the guns of the forts keeping out of range of our guns. Men-of-war from below the forts and vessels expressly fitted for running us down joined the other vessels between the forts. It looked as if the fleet was about to make a fierce onslaught on us. But we were again to be disappointed. The Monitor and the other vessels did not venture to meet us, although we advanced until projectiles from the Rip-raps fell more than half a mile beyond us. Our object, however, was accomplished; we had put an end to the bombardment, and we returned to our buoy." Captain Buchanan was promoted to be Admiral in the Confederate States Navy, and temporarily relieved from command on account of wound received in the engagement of the Virginia March 8th. On March 25th Commodore Josiah Tatnall was ordered to command of the naval defenses of Virginia waters, and he assumed command March 29th. From the 8th to the 29th the Virginia was ably commanded by Lieutenant Jones, who for this service was promoted captain. (This promotion was to captain in the Confederate States Navy; the promotion previously noted when he was sent to Norfolk was in the Virginia Navy.) The Confederate authorities entertained the belief that the Virginia would be able to drive the entire fleet of the enemy from Hampton Roads. Virginians were confident that the blockade of their shores would be raised by the ironclad. The people of the Northern coast cities anticipated seeing their harbors laid waste by it. Secretary Mallory sent Commodore Tatnall a communication on April 1st, in which he said: "The enclosed note, sent me by friend in Baltimore, will inform you of some interesting points about the Monitor. This vessel has achieved a high reputation by her recent combat with the Virginia; and the enemy, no less than our own people, look forward to a renewal of it as a matter of course, and with deep interest. I confess to a very deep interest in your success over her, for I am fully convinced that the result of such a victory may save millions of dollars and thousands of lives." The information conveyed by the note enclosed was certain points in the construction of the Monitor, a knowledge of which might be serviceable to the Virginia in meeting her again. Again on April 4th Secretary Mallory instructed Commodore Tatnall: "Do not hesitate or wait for orders, but strike when, how and where your judgment may dictate. Take her [the Virginia] out of the dock when you may deem best, and this point is left entirely to your discretion." Commodore Tatnall in his defense before court-martial said. "Aware that Hampton Roads furnished me no field for important operations, I early turned my thoughts to passing the forts and striking unexpectedly at some distant point, say New York, or Port Royal, or Savannah, and in a letter of the 10th of April to the Secretary, I conveyed my views." At a meeting of the Federal Cabinet called after the fight in Hampton Roads, Secretary of War Stanton said: "The Merrimac [Virginia] will change the whole character of the war; she will destroy, seriatim, every naval vessel, she will lay all cities on the seaboard under contribution. I shall immediately recall Burnside, Port Royal must be abandoned. I will notify the governors and municipal authorities in the North to take instant measures to protect their harbors." But hopes and fears were unfounded. No further victory was to be won by the Virginia. No victory at sea, for she had not one seagoing qualification, and could only be used for harbor defense. No victory in Hampton Roads, for her fighting qualities had been tested, and the enemy were not minded to meet her again. As Lieutenant Jones testifies, whenever she came out of the Elizabeth, all Federal boats fled to shallow water where she could not follow; and the Monitor, while her officers loudly claimed a victory for March 9th, was kept close under the guns of Fortress Monroe, and could not be tempted into another engagement. The movements of the two opposing armies on the peninsula, in March and April, 1862, resulted in the change of base of Gen. Joe E. Johnston's army from the Yorktown lines to the west bank of the Chickahominy, and from this change resulted the, perhaps, unnecessary order for the Confederate evacuation of Norfolk. On May 10th the Confederate land forces fell back from the vicinity of Elizabeth river, the batteries at Craney Island, Sewell Point and all along the river were abandoned. General Huger with his troops withdrew from Norfolk, the mayor of the city negotiated its surrender to General Wool, and once more the navy yard was given over to the flames. The smaller vessels of the Confederate fleet had in April withdrawn to James river, and after Norfolk was abandoned moved up the river to positions behind the fortifications at Drewry's and Chapin's bluffs. Commodore Tatnall ordered the Virginia lightened and run up James river to the protection of Richmond. After the crew had worked five or six hours lightening the boat, and she was lifted so that she could not be defended where she lay, the pilots announced their inability to carry her up the James (where the draft was eighteen feet) beyond Jamestown Flats, at which point it was reported the enemy held both banks of the river. Only one course could then be pursued to keep her out of the enemy's hands. She was put on shore and fired, and her crew landed as near Craney Island as possible, the only way of retreat open to them. She burned about an hour, and blew up a little before five o'clock on the morning of May 11th. This unlooked for end to the career of the ironclad, whose victories had been exaggerated, whose defects were then not known, and from which so much was expected, created great dissatisfaction throughout the Confederacy. Commodore Tatnall was severely censured for destroying the Virginia, not only by those ignorant of the facts in the case, but also by those whose knowledge of the situation should have led them to endorse his action. He called for a Court of Inquiry, which reported, in substance, that the Virginia ought not to have been destroyed at the time and place it was done. As soon as this finding was made known, the Commodore promptly and very properly called for a court-martial, which was convened on July 5, 1862, composed of the following officers: Admiral Franklin Buchanan; Captains Lawrence Rousseau, Sidney S. Lee, George N. Hollins; Commanders Robert G. Robb, Murray Nelson, Eben Farrand, A. B. Fairfax, M. F. Maury, George Minor; Lieutenants W. L. Maury, Robert B. Pegram; Judge Advocate Robert Ould. By this court Commodore Tatnall was honorably acquitted, the court finding: "That after the evacuation of Norfolk, Westover on James river became the most suitable place for her [the Virginia] to occupy; that while in the act of lightening her for the purpose of taking her up to that point, the pilots for the first time declared their inability to take her up. That when lightened she was made vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy. The only alternative, in the opinion of the court, was to abandon and burn the ship then and there, which, in the judgment of the court, was deliberately and wisely done." The Monitor, of which quite as much was expected in the North as in the South was expected of the Virginia, had a career almost as brief and much less serviceable. After some slight service in the James river in the summer of 1862, she was taken to Washington for repairs in September, returning to Hampton Roads two months later. On December 29th, she set out for Beaufort, North Carolina, in tow of the Rhode Island, and two days later she sunk in a heavy gale off the North Carolina coast. UP THE JAMES RIVER. Virginia was now, as had been foreseen, to become the great battle ground of the war. To reach the Confederate capital by land or water was the aim of every movement of the Federal army in the east Chesapeake bay and James river, the water approaches to Richmond, were henceforth to be the scene of all naval engagements of any importance on Virginia waters. After the abandonment of Yorktown, May 3, 1862, and of Norfolk (May 10th), the James river squadron moved slowly up that river, skirmishing with the advancing Federal fleet. The Nansemond and Hampton, gunboats built at the Norfolk navy yard, were sent to Richmond. Two other boats nearly finished, and greatly superior to any in the fleet, were burned with the yard. As McClellan advanced on the peninsula, the Federal fleet moved from Hampton Roads up the James. On May 8th the fleet shelled Fort Huger, at Hardy's Bluff, three hours without driving out its garrison. The defense was conducted by Capt. J. M. Maury, Confederate States Navy. The next day an engagement came off between shore batteries and the Federal boats, in which the Patrick Henry and the Jamestown assisted the batteries. These and other slight engagements affording only a temporary check to the advance of the Federal fleet, the anticipation was awakened in the North that the fleet would reach Richmond without encountering serious opposition. But the Confederates were using the time to good advantage, concentrating their forces and strengthening their defenses at Drewry's Bluff, to give battle there. This bluff, on the right bank of the James, about seven miles below Richmond, was an admirable point for defense, having great natural advantages. It has an elevation of about two hundred feet above the river, which at this point is only one mile wide. Preparations for defense there had been begun with one battery mounting three guns. In April the first obstructions were placed in the river. Piles were driven into the bottom, and filled in with logs, stones and iron rubbish. On the approach of the enemy's boats, the Jamestown, Curtis Peck, Northampton, and several smaller boats were sunk in the channel. The earthworks previously constructed were extended. In addition to the three guns of the first battery, a number of heavy navy guns were mounted. Rifle pits for sharp shooters were dug on the opposite bank of the James. A heavy battery at Chapin's Bluff, a few miles down on the left bank of the river, was commanded by Lieut. T. J. Page. THE BATTLE OF DREWRY'S BLUFF. Capt. Eben Farrand, Confederate States navy, was senior officer in command of the naval and military forces at Drewry's Bluff. Capt. A. Drewry commanded a battalion of artillery. The bluff took its name from his family, in whose possession the land had been many years. The naval battery, which had been constructed under supervision of Capt. John Randolph Tucker, and in which the guns from the Jamestown and Patrick Henry were mounted, was manned by some of the officers and the crews of the Patrick Henry, Jamestown and Virginia. The sharpshooters in the rifle pits on the left bank were under command of Lieut. John Taylor Wood of the navy. Two companies of marines, commanded by Capt. John D. Simms, also served as sharpshooters. The Federal fleet consisted of three ironclads, the Monitor, the Galena and the Naugatuck, and two wooden gunboats, the Aristook and Port Royal. The battle opened at 7:30 on the morning of May 15th, and was fierce and well conducted on both sides but of brief duration. In three hours the Federal fleet was in retreat. As the Monitor passed down close to the left bank, Lieutenant Wood called out to the officer in her pilot-house: "Tell Captain Jeffers that is not the way to Richmond!" On the Federal side the loss was fourteen killed, eighteen wounded; the Brooke rifle balls penetrated the ironcladding of the Galena and crippled her; the Parrot rifled gun on the Naugatuck burst as she fired her seventeenth round, and she was compelled to drop out of action before the others withdrew; the Monitor was not injured. The wooden boats were not actively engaged, but were put to service in towing the crippled ironclads to a place of safety. The Port Royal came into range once, and received a shell. On the Confederate side the loss was seven killed, nine wounded. No serious damage was done the fortifications. The Confederate squadron was drawn up above the obstructions, which the enemy's boats did not reach. Midshipman Carroll, of the Patrick Henry, was killed while acting as signal officer and aide to Captain Farrand. Brief and comparatively bloodless as was this engagement it taught the Federal authorities one lesson: That the "On to Richmond!" movement for which the North was clamoring was not to be made by way of the James river. The Federal fleet made no further attempt to pass Fort Drewry. Captain Sidney S. Lee had been ordered to relieve Captain Farrand in command at Drewry's Bluff, and arrived on the 15th, after the battle had begun. Declining then to interfere with Captain Farrand's command, he acted in co-operation with him, rendering valuable aid and council through the engagement. Subsequently the obstruction of the river at this point was completed under Captain Lee's supervision. Sidney Smith Lee was of the distinguished Lee family whose public services are interwoven with the history of Virginia on so many pages of this work. The second son of "Light-Horse Harry," he was born at Camden, New Jersey, in 1805, while his father was attending a session of Congress at Philadelphia. In his fourteenth year he was appointed midshipman in the United States navy, in which service he remained over forty years. Among the positions of honor he ably filled in this service were: Commander of war vessel, Mexican war, and engaged in siege of Vera Cruz; Commandant of United States Naval Academy at Annapolis three years; Commandant of Philadelphia navy yard three years; Captain of flag-ship Mississippi, in Commodore Perry's expedition to Japan; member of the Naval Board to receive and entertain Japanese Ambassadors in their visit to this country; Chief of the Bureau of Coast Survey at Washington. This last position he resigned when Virginia was forced out of the Union, following the course of his younger brother, General Robert E. Lee, tendering his service to the State that reckons him one of her honored sons. At the close of the war Captain Lee was chief of the Bureau of Orders and Detail at Richmond. He died at Richland, Virginia, on the 22d of July, 1869. He was the father of Governor Fitzhugh Lee of Virginia, the "Fitz Lee" of Virginia cavalry fame, and of S. Smith Lee, jr., of the Confederate States navy. THE JAMES RIVER SQUADRON AGAIN. The Richmond, "the first fully armored ship that the South put afloat on the James river," was completed in July, 1862. An appeal for funds to be used to build such a ship, the construction to be under supervision of naval officers, and the ship to be tendered the government when completed, appeared in the Richmond Dispatch, March 17, 1862. A number of wealthy Virginia gentlemen having volunteered a part of the necessary sum, the remainder was raised by the patriotic ladies of Williamsburg and Richmond, through committees and by a fair the Richmond ladies held. The Richmond was described as "a fine vessel, built on the plan of the Virginia, not so large; her ends not submerged. She carried a bow and stern pivot and two guns in broadside." Exaggerated reports of her size and strength reached the North, where she was called the "Merrimac No. 2." On July 30th she steamed down to Drewry's Bluff, ready for service. Another boat added to the James River fleet in 1862 was the Drewry, mounting one large gun. When McClellan fell back beaten from the peninsula, comparative quiet returned to James river. At the close of the year the James River squadron, Captain French Forrest commanding, consisted of the Richmond, Patrick Henry, Nansemond, Hampton, Beaufort, Raleigh and Drewry. The Teaser had been captured, July 4th, when she got aground in Turkey Bend while reconnoitering. Only one affair of note occurred on James river in 1863. All summer Federal ironclads remained in the vicinity of Drewry's Bluff, without again attempting its capture. The Confederate fleet was in daily expectation of an engagement which the enemy never offered. The river itself had been well prepared to receive them. In addition to the obstructions opposite Fort Drewry, Lieutenant Hunter Davidson had prepared torpedo defenses, which were sunk in the river below that point, and could be fired by an electric arrangement on shore having wire connections with the torpedoes. On August 1st a number of Federal generals left Fortress Monroe for a reconnoissance of Fort Drewry. Their squadron consisted of the monitor Sangamon, and two gunboats, the Commodore Barney and the Cohasset. Some five miles below Drewry's Bluff they reached a line of torpedoes. These did not do all that was expected of them, only one exploding. That was under the keel of the Commodore Barney, and lifted her bow high in air, tearing away the timbers on her sides. So much heavy material went overboard as she careened that she righted herself; twenty of her crew were washed off her deck, all but two of whom were picked up by boats from the other ships. The squadron retreated down the river, and the next day came in range of a masked force of Confederate artillery and infantry at Deep Bottom. The Commodore Barney, then hardly afloat, got a shell in her boiler, and the Cohasset had her engines damaged by a solid shot. In September, 1863, the Federal transport John Farron was seriously injured by a torpedo in the James. OPERATIONS ON THE JAMES IN 1864-5. Two ironclads were added to the James River squadron before operations opened in 1864. One was a second ironclad Virginia, built in part like her namesake, and in part like the Richmond, not having submerged ends. She was plated with six inches of armor on the sides of her casements, and eight inches on the ends. Her armament was two six-inch and two eight-inch Brooke rifled guns, so placed that three could be fired at a broadside. The other ironclad was the Fredericksburg, having four inches of armor, and carrying four six-inch guns. Commander John K. Mitchell had succeeded Captain Forrest in command of the squadron. General B. F. Butler, after establishing his army at Bermuda Hundred, detailed gunboats to drag the James river for torpedoes. On May 6th the Commodore Jones, so engaged, rested near Four and a Half Mile Creek, directly over one of Lieutenant Davidson's tank machines, containing four hundred pounds of powder. The torpedo was connected with a galvanic battery secreted in a pit on shore, with a detail of three men from the submarine battery service to operate it. The spark was transmitted, the machine exploded, and the Commodore Jones was blown into fragments, losing in killed and wounded, seventy-five out of a crew of one hundred and twenty; fifty were killed outright. The next day the gunboat Shawsheen was destroyed near Turkey Bend, and all her crew killed or captured. When the Commodore Jones was destroyed a boat from an accompanying gunboat was sent to the shore, and the men operating the galvanic battery were captured. One of these, placed in the forward boat searching for the torpedoes, rendered his own position as safe as possible by communicating to his captors all the information he possessed relative to the position of the torpedoes. In this way the Federal boats were able to locate and remove twenty torpedoes. One contained a charge of 1,900 pounds of powder. Drewry's Bluff was now threatened with an attack from Butler on the land side, and was strongly reinforced. The obstructions were removed from the river opposite the fort, and the James River fleet passed down to Chapin's Bluff. The Federal fleet below responded by sinking hulks at Trent's Reach to prevent the Confederate vessels coming down any further. The river was further closed by stretching booms and cables between the hulks. When this had been completed, Commander Mitchell, understanding that the Federal fleet declined to meet him, took his vessels back to Fort Drewry. The commander of the James River squadron did not, however, remain inactive in the summer of 1864, but contrived to keep the Federal fleet in the James, and away from Southern Ports, by a naval battery on the hill at Howlett House, from which he shelled the fleet at long range, and by sending one and another of his boats to harass that part of Butler's army working on his purposeless canal at Dutch Gap. A more serious engagement occurred on October 22d. After the Federals captured Fort Harrison (September 19th) they erected a new battery on the left bank of the James, about two miles below Chapin's Bluff, and fortifications on Signal Hill. These were masked until the morning of October 22d, when the trees in front of them were cut away, and they were uncovered with range on the Virginia, Richmond, Fredericksburg, Hampton and Drewry, then lying near Cox Landing. The two last moved out of range, the Drewry receiving one shell which struck one of her gun carriages wounding five men. Commander Mitchell with the flag ship, Virginia, bore down toward the battery, signaling Captain Maury to follow with the Richmond, and Captain Roots with the Fredericksburg. The three gunboats kept up the duel with the battery until it was silenced, then returned to Drewry's Bluff. The Fredericksburg had her casement damaged, and six of her crew wounded. The Richmond had her smoke-stack shot away, but sustained no other injury. The Virginia was not damaged at all, though hit by seven 100-pound conical bolts from the enemy's rifles, not one of which more than dented her iron plating. The four Federal monitors made no move to come up and participate in the engagement, although Admiral Lee, commanding the Federal fleet, had assured the Federal authorities that in putting down the obstructions the work had been so done the obstructions could be removed quickly at any time it was desirable for the fleet to go up the river. On December 7th, the Virginia, Richmond and Fredericksburg came down to Fort Brady, a Federal fortification on the right bank of the James, and exchanged a few shots with its garrison. In December, five boats of the Federal fleet were sent into Roanoke river, and on December 9th anchored near Jamesville. The gunboat Otsego, searching for torpedoes, passed over two of them, which exploded, destroying her. The next day the gunboat Bazely and Launch No. 5 met the same fate, and the expedition was abandoned. With the opening of 1865 the one hope that remained of relieving Lee's beleaguered and enfeebled army rested in the James River squadron. This was "a forlorn hope," indeed, but the gallant naval force that had never yet faltered was ready to make the most of it. If the squadron could get down the James, and disperse the Federal fleet at City Point, Grant's base of supplies would be destroyed, and Lee might gain some advantage thereby. Circumstances favored the attempt. Believing the Confederate boats would not try to pass the obstructions, all the Federal monitors except the Onondaga had been sent to Fort Fisher. High water came on January 22d, carrying great blocks of ice down the river. It was hoped that the freshet and the ice blocks would carry out the obstructions at Trent's Reach, so as to let the Confederate ironclads through. As soon as night fell a reconnoitering party was sent down to examine the obstructions. The report was that the passage was feasible. Lieutenant C. W. Read hastened with the intelligence to General Lee at Petersburg, and was by him sent to Secretary Mallory at Richmond with it, and to ask for an order that the ironclads be sent down that night. At three o'clock on the morning of the 23d, such order was delivered by Lieutenant Read to Commander Mitchell. The expedition moved as soon as night fell on the 23d, the ironclads Virginia, Richmond and Fredericksburg; the gunboat Drewry; the torpedo boat Torpedo, and three torpedo launches under command of Lieutenant Read, the Wasp, Hornet and Scorpion, which were to be used against Federal boats. These all passed the upper Federal batteries undiscovered, and anchored just above the obstructions. Captain Mitchell then went on board the Scorpion and sounded through the obstructions, finding a spar lying across the opening, which was removed. While the sounding was going on a Federal picket boat discovered the Confederates and a heavy fire was opened from both banks. Captain Mitchell returned to his fleet and went on board the Fredericksburg, lightest draft of the ironclads, and himself took her through the obstructions. Returning on the Scorpion, he found both the Virginia and Richmond aground. The launches were pulling on them but could not move them. The Federal batteries had opened all along the line. This put an end to any possibility of surprising the Federal fleet. The Fredericksburg was ordered to return. The James River boats would have to fight for it to get back up the river. Daybreak disclosed them lying directly under the guns of Fort Parsons, which opened fire on them. The Drewry was destroyed by a shell; the Wasp by a solid shot; the other wooden boats went into shelter under a bank. At nine o'clock the Onondaga came up and began to fire on the Virginia and Richmond, still grounded. None of the guns of the Confederate ironclads could be effectually worked. With the rising tide the grounded ships got afloat, but not until the Virginia had received a 15-inch solid shot knocking a hole through her armor and wood backing, killing six and wounding fourteen. After a council on board the Virginia, Captain Mitchell decided to resume hostilities after dark, and at nine in the evening again headed down stream. A blazing calcium light was thrown on his boats from a Federal battery and firing resumed from all the ports. Reluctantly the expedition was abandoned and the fleet returned to Chapin's Bluff. The Federals strengthened the obstructions, and added two monitors to the guarding fleet. COMMODORE MATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY The aggressive work of the James River squadron was now ended. On February 18, 1865, Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes, of Alabama fame, was appointed its commander. Many of the officers and crew of the squadron had been detached to the naval brigade, which under command of Capt. J. R. Tucker, was manning Fort Drewry, and Batteries Brooke, Wood and Semmes. These were joined by three hundred officers and men from the vessels destroyed at Charleston and Wilmington, when those cities were abandoned, making a formidable force, specially well trained for accurate firing of heavy guns. The only work left for the fleet was yet a worthy one. Richmond was secure from approach by water while the three ironclads remained on guard at Drewry's Bluff. On the afternoon of April 2d Admiral Semmes received official notice from Secretary Mallory that Richmond would be evacuated that night. He was further instructed to arm and equip his men for duty in the field, and report with his force to General Lee after destroying his vessels. Between two and three o'clock on the morning of the 3d, the naval troops were on their way up the James in the wooden boats, and the ironclads of the James river squadron were on fire. The explosion of the Virginia, it was said, "shook the houses in Richmond, and waked the echoes of the night for forty miles around." THE LAST GALLANT STAND OF VIRGINIA NAVAL FORCES. At midnight of April 4th, Semmes reached Danville with his forces. Here he found President Davis and Secretary Mallory, to whom he reported. He was ordered to form his command as a brigade of artillery to serve in the defenses around Danville. Only four hundred men were left him, but these were divided into the regiments which remained in the Danville trenches until the bitter end. The naval brigade under Captain Tucker withdrew from Drewry's Bluff on April 2d, and joined General Custis Lee's division of Ewell's corps, acting as Lee's rear guard in the retreat from Richmond. It was a dreary march for four days, without rest, without food, in falling rain and heavy mud, with the cavalry of the victorious army hovering about them on every hand. On April 6th a stand was made at Sailor's Creek, and the last heavy battle on Virginia ground was fought. Scharf, in his "Confederate States Navy," pays this eloquent tribute to the Virginia naval force: "Ewell's depleted ranks were enveloped by the masses of Sheridan's infantry and cavalry, and came to a stand at the creek for their final resistance to the overwhelming thousands of the enemy. The naval brigade held the right of the line, where it repulsed two assaults of cavalry and one of infantry with its firm formation and rapid, steady fire, the Federals splitting on its front and going to the right and left of it. In one of these dashes of cavalry General Ewell and his staff were captured, and he passed the order of surrender to his troops, whose line, except that held by the sailors, had been pierced by the Federal charges. The naval brigade and two hundred marines, under command of Major Simmons, were holding precisely the same position then which had been assigned them in the morning. Commander Tucker was informed that Ewell had ordered a surrender but refused to believe it. The brigade of infantry on either side of him had ceased flring, but with the remark `I can't surrender,' he ordered his men to continue the engagement. General Wright, commander of the Federal Sixth Corps, had directed the fire of a dozen batteries upon him, and a mass of cavalry were making ready to ride him down, when he was informed for the second time of the surrender, and followed the example of the infantry. He had continued fighting fifteen minutes after they had lowered their arms, and the naval colors were the last to be laid down. The bravery of the sailors was observed along the Federal lines, and when they did surrender the enemy cheered them long and vigorously. The salutations of the foe to the men who `didn't know when to surrender,' brought to a close the history of the Confederate States navy upon the waters of Virginia." PRIVATEERING AND INDIVIDUAL EXPLOITS. No annals of war awaken greater interest than those which deal with gallant feats of individuals and record desperate undertakings against great odds. While results thus achieved may not be relatively great, there is something ever inspiriting in dwelling upon such records. The capture of the St. Nicholas, recorded upon a previous page, was such an enterprise, and the following are equally worthy of preservation. On the night of July 25, 1862, a Confederate boat's crew stole in among the Federal transports and supply ships near Harrison's Landing, and boarded the schooner Louisa Rives, loaded with army stores. Making their way to the captain's cabin, they informed him he was under arrest by order of General McClellan, and conveyed him to their boat. Some of the party remained behind in the cabin long enough to set it on fire in several places. Then the boat pulled off, leaving a burning ship behind them, surrounded by its just awakened consorts, any one of which could have blown the daring raiders and their boat out of the water. A notable exploit was executed in Chesapeake bay by Lieut. John Taylor Wood with a boat's crew from the Patrick Henry, on the night of November 28, 1862. Just below the mouth of the Rappahannock they boarded the Alleghanian, a fine ship from Baltimore bound for London, that had come to anchor on account of a heavy storm. The ship's officers were completely surprised, and offered no resistance. In the darkness one boat's crew escaped; the remainder and the officers were sent prisoners to Richmond. After a portion of the ship's stores had been transferred to the boats, she was set on fire and burned. The ship and cargo were valued at $200,000. The Federal gunboat Crusader was only a few miles away from the Alleghanian, but when the fire from the latter brought boats from the Crusader to the rescue, Lieutenant Wood was gone with his prisoners and supplies, and the fire was beyond control. Early in 1863 John Yates Beall was commissioned acting master in the Confederate States navy. He organized a privateering force which did not at anytime number more than twenty men. Mathews county, Virginia, was their place of rendezvous. In July they cut the United States telegraph cable across the Chesapeake. In August they wrecked the light-house at Cape Charles. In September they captured the sloop Mary Anne, and two fishing vessels, and the schooners Alliance, Horseman, Pearsall and Alexander. In November they captured a schooner on the Accomac shore of the Chesapeake. Meantime the noise of Beall's successes had reached the North, and the Federal government sent to Mathews county to capture him and his twenty men, one regiment of infantry, two of cavalry, one battalion of artillery and three gunboats. He was made prisoner on board his last prize with a number of his men. They were held in irons at Fort McHenry six weeks, subjected to every indignity. Information of this reaching President Davis he promptly ordered an equal number of Federal naval prisoners to be put under the same treatment. As on previous like occasions, this retaliatory measure secured for Beall and his men proper treatment as prisoners of war. This was the last attempt of the Federal government to ignore the customary usage of war, and treat privateersmen as "pirates." Beall was sent to City Point on March 20, 1864, and exchanged in May following. The balance of those captured with him were exchanged in September, 1864. On March 6, 1864, Lieutenant Wood scored another brilliant success in a dangerous undertaking. He crossed the Chesapeake bay from Mathews county with a small party of men in open boats to Cherrystone Harbor, on the eastern shore. Running in at nightfall and cutting the telegraph wires they made prisoners the Federal cavalry pickets there, and during the night captured two United States dispatch boats from Fortress Monroe, touching there, the Iolas and the Titan. They then fired the wharf warehouses, containing the commissary stores, valued at $50,000. Lieutenant Wood ordered the Iolas fired, also, but upon the representation of her captain that she represented all he owned in the world he was permitted to bond her for $10,000 and depart on parole, with a part of his crew. The remainder of the prisoners were taken away on the Titan, which was run up the Piankatank river to Freeport, and there burned. The two steamers had just been put in service, newly built, and were valued at $40,000 each. In retaliation the Potomac flotilla entered the Rappahannock, and destroyed a large amount of naval material, including ship timber and boats. Two dashing privateering feats were executed in Chesapeake bay in 1865. Captain Thaddeus Fitzhugh, of the Fifth Virginia cavalry, who had accompanied Lieutenant Wood in his foray on Cherrystone Harbor, crossed into Maryland with a small force of men, and placed all but about a dozen of them in hiding on the Chesapeake shore near Patuxent river. With the smaller number he then proceeded in disguise to Fair Haven, Maryland, where they took passage, April 4th, on the Harriet Deford for Baltimore. Out in the stream they threw off their disguise, appearing in Confederate uniform, took possession of the boat, brought their concealed companions on board, returned to Fair Haven and landed the passengers and part of the crew, then took the captured vessel across the bay, and the next day burned her. On April 6th, Lieut. John C. Brain, Confederate States navy, captured the St. Mary, off the mouth of Patuxent, ran her to the Virginia shore and burned her. These are illustrations of the successful work of privateers in Virginia waters during the war. Their most valuable service was not, however, in the injury they did the enemy, so much as in the aid they gave the Confederate government by running the Federal blockade, bringing in recruits, armament and much needed stores. VIRGINIANS IN THE MARINE CORPS. The following Virginia officers resigned from the U. S. marine corps at the beginning of the war: Major Henry B. Tyler; Brevet-Major George H. Terrett; Captains, Robert Tansill, Algernon S. Taylor, John D. Simms; First Lieutenants, George P. Turner, Israel Greene. About one hundred men left the same service, and constituted the nucleus of the C. S. marine corps, organization of which was begun at Montgomery, and continued at Richmond in May, 1861. Lloyd J. Beall, of Richmond, a former officer U. S. A., was appointed commander, with rank of colonel; Henry B. Tyler, lieutenant colonel; George H. Terrett, major; Algernon S. Taylor in charge of quartermaster's and commissary's departments, with rank of major; Israel Greene, adjutant, rank of major; John D. Simms, captain. The other officers at organization were from other States. Richard Taylor Allison, who was appointed paymaster with rank of major, the office and rank he had resigned in the U. S. navy, was a Kentuckian, and nephew of President Taylor. The corps served in and around Richmond in the summer of 1862. Its service in the battle of Drewry's Bluff has been already noted. Soon after, the corps was broken up into detachments, some of which guarded land defenses, others served on board ship. Their discipline as veteran marines rendered their service of great value when they were thus scattered among troops and seamen of less training, but for the reason they were thus kept in service through the war no records of the corps were or could have been separately made. A detachment was engaged in the land and water battles at Mobile; another served in the defense of Fort Fisher; others on the cruisers Sumter and Alabama; others on the Atlanta, Tennessee, Gaines and other steamers. The final stand of that part of the corps left in Virginia was under Captain Tucker at Sailors Creek. THE CONFEDERATE STATES NAVAL ACADEMY. An act providing for a Confederate States Naval Academy was passed by the Confederate Congress early in 1862, but it was not until March, 1863, that Secretary Mallory began to carry out its provisions. The steamer Patrick Henry was selected as the schoolship of the academy. Capt. John M. Brooke had charge of the establishment of the school; Capt. Sidney Smith Lee was appointed on the board of examiners; Lieut. Wm. H. Parker was appointed commandant of the school. In the fall of 1863 it went into operation. The cadets found more fighting than schooling was before them. The Patrick Henry was most of the time stationed at Drewry's Bluff, and in the engagements in that vicinity in 1864 the cadets were oftentimes called on to lay down their books and take up their arms. There was less of inculcation of theory than of actual experience of war. Early in 1865 the protection of the bridge over the James at Wilmot was entrusted to the Patrick Henry, the school then consisting of sixty cadets and ten officers. On the evening of April 2d they left Richmond for Danville, guarding the train on which was being transported the archives of the Confederate government, and the contents of its treasury. From the 3d to the 9th they remained in Danville, then went by rail to Greensboro, North Carolina. For nearly a month longer they moved about, by rail and by wagon train, to various points in North and South Carolina and in Georgia, still guarding their charge, and seeking for some one authorized to receive it. At the close of April they reached Abbeville, South Carolina, a second time, and there Lieutenant Parker found President Davis and Secretary Mallory. By their orders he turned over the treasure to the acting secretary of the Confederate States treasury. The cadet corps was then disbanded, at Abbeville, on May 2, 1865.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">EMINENT VIRGINIANS. Signers of the Declaration of Independence. GEORGE WYTHE. "The honor of his own, and the model of future times," was the eulogy pronounced upon George Wythe at his death, by Thomas Jefferson, who in youth had been his pupil at law, and in later years his coadjutor in Congress, and a warm personal friend. George Wythe was born in 1726, in Elizabeth City county, Colony of Virginia. His father was a Virginia gentleman of the old school, amiable, courteous, a lover of his family, a good manager of his large estate, but with more fondness for outdoor life than for his study, and a better acquaintance with the denizens of field and forest than with his classics. From his mother, George Wythe inherited his intellectual tastes and mental vigor. She was a woman of great strength of mind, and was possessed of singular learning for her day, among her accomplishments reckoning a thorough knowledge of Latin. Under the tuition of his mother, George Wythe attained an excellent education, pursuing with her the study of grammar, rhetoric and logic, mathematics, natural and moral philosophy, civil law, Latin and Greek. Of the latter tongue Mrs. Wythe had no knowledge, but she assisted her son in his acquisition of it by reading an English version of the works which he studied, and so testing the accuracy of his translations. This devoted mother died before her son attained the years of manhood, and his father dying about the same time, George Wythe entered upon the possession of a large fortune. For some time he abandoned study, and led a life of dissipation. He was thirty years of age when he shook off youthful follies, and entered upon the life of honor and usefulness which has perpetuated his name. Thenceforth, for fifty years, it was his privilege to pursue, with unremitting ardor, all the noble purposes of life, but at its close he looked back upon the wasted years of his young manhood with deep regret. Under the instructions of Mr. John Lewis, a noted practitioner in the Virginia courts, George Wythe read law and fitted himself for practice. His success in his chosen profession was equal to his desert. As a pleader at the bar his extensive learning, fine elocution, and logical style of argument, made him irresistible. But his distinguishing characteristic was his rigid justice. The dignity of his profession was never prostituted to the support of an unjust cause. In this rule he was so inflexible that if he entertained doubts of his client's rights, he required of him an oath as to the truth of his statements before he undertook his cause, and if deception were in any manner practiced upon him, he would return the fee and abandon the case. Such a stand as this early called attention to Mr. Wythe's fitness for administering justice in important causes, and ultimately led to his appointment as chancellor of Virginia, the important duties of which position he discharged with the most exact justice until the day of his death. Early in life Mr. Wythe was elected to represent Elizabeth City county in the House of Burgesses, a position he filled for many years. November 14, 1764, he was appointed a member of a committee of the House to prepare a petition to the king, a memorial to the House of Lords, and a remonstrance to the House of Commons, on the "Stamp Act," then a measure before Parliament. The paper was drawn by Mr. Wythe, but its language was so vigorous and his utterances so abounding in plain truths that must give offense to his majesty, that the draft was considered treasonable by his hesitating colleagues, and was materially modified before the report was accepted. The "Stamp Act" was passed, and the news was received in the House of Burgesses of Virginia, as an intimation on the part of king and Parliament that the rights of the colonists were to be deliberately disregarded. Before the session of 1765 closed, in May, Patrick Henry offered resolutions of defiance that received the cordial support of Mr. Wythe, and, after a stormy debate and some alterations, were carried, although so close was the contest that the fifth, and strongest resolution, only passed by a single vote, and the following day, during Henry's absence from the convention, this resolution was expunged from the journal. The repeal of the "Stamp Act," and other conciliatory measures on the part of England, now left a few years of quiet legislation, during which Mr. Wythe attended to his professional duties. But his stand was taken upon the justness of the demands of the colonies, and when events tended toward independence, he early favored the movement, and exerted his influence among his colleagues in that direction. In these efforts he had the assistance of Thomas Jefferson; and the two, who had been preceptor and pupil, now stood friends and counselors, noble examples of self-sacrificing patriots, in the very front of danger. In 1775, Wythe joined a corps of volunteers, believing a resort to arms the only hope of the colonists. But his services as a statesman were of more importance, and he left the army in August, 1775, to attend the Continental Congress as one of the delegates of Virginia. He held this position until after the Declaration of Independence had become a matter of record, with his name as one of its fifty-six attesting witnesses. November 5, 1776, he was one of a committee of five appointed by the State Legislature to revise the laws of Virginia. Of this committee two members, George Mason and Thomas Ludwell Lee, were prevented from serving, and the remaining three, Wythe, Jefferson and Edmond Pendleton, worked so industriously and so ably that on the 18th of June, 1779, they reported to the General Assembly one hundred and twenty-six bills. In 1777, Mr. Wythe was chosen speaker of the House of Burgesses. In the same year he was appointed one of the three judges of the high court of chancery of Virginia, and on a change in the form of the court was constituted sole chancellor. In December, 1786, he was one of the committee who prepared the constitution of the United States, and in 1787 was a member of the Virginia convention which ratified the constitution on behalf of that State. He was subsequently twice a member of the electoral college of Virginia. His political record now closes, unless to it is added his indirect influence exerted through the distinguished pupils whom he trained for the bar and for public life. Some of the most noted sons of Virginia at the bar and in the Senate were his pupils, and in the list we find one chief justice and two presidents of the United States. The death of George Wythe is the saddest record of these pages. Already past his eightieth year, and with his days still filled with useful and benevolent deeds, he died the victim of poison, administered, it seems but too evident, by the hand of one who was a near kindred, and who should have been bound to him by the ties of gratitude for daily kindnesses and tokens of love. In the midst of the lingering hours of agony produced by the slow action of his death potion, Wythe thought of others and not of himself. As long as he retained his senses, he gave his mind to the study of the cases pending in his court, and his last regret was that his fatal illness would cause delay and added expense to those who had appeared before him. Mr. Wythe had been twice married, but had no living children, and at his death his estate passed to the children of a sister, his last act of justice being to add, upon his deathbed, a codicil to his will which revoked all benefits which would have accrued to the nephew who had hastened his death. He expired on the morning of the 8th of June, 1806. Like many great minds who cannot accept of a formulated creed, Mr. Wythe was considered an infidel by his cotemporaries. The student of to-day will, however, more willingly believe of such a life that, in the words of Jefferson, "while neither troubling nor perhaps trusting any one with his religious creed, he left to the world the conclusion that that religion must be good which could produce a life of such exemplary virtue." RICHARD HENRY LEE, Who was born in Westmoreland county, Virginia, January 20, 1732, was descended from a family eminent in public life and of high social standing in that colony. The grandfather whose name he bore, was Richard Lee, a member of the King's council, and his father, Thomas Lee, was for a number of years president of that council. His maternal grandfather, who was a son of Governor Ludington, of North Carolina, was also a member of that body of statesmen. Richard Henry Lee was sent to England, and attended school at Wakefield, in Yorkshire. At the age of nineteen, he returned to his native colony, and having ample means and no desire to pursue a professional life, he gave himself up to his love of books, for a number of years pursuing with ardor the study of ethics and the philosophy of history. In 1754, he was rudely awakened from his student's dreams by the encroachments of Indians upon the border counties of Virginia, and the appeal of the frontier settlers to be protected from their atrocities. In his twenty-third year he was called on by the Westmoreland Volunteers to place himself at their head and lead them to protect the living and avenge the dead. Reporting with his troops to General Braddock, at Alexandria, Virginia, that vain-glorious general, who was to pay with his life for his ignorance, decided that "the British troops could quell a handful of savages without the help of the provincials," and the young volunteers, with their young leader, were sent home. In 1757, Mr. Lee was appointed justice of the peace for Westmoreland county, and in the same year was elected to serve that county as its representative in the House of Burgesses. The first few years of service in that body rendered by Richard Henry Lee, who was yet to be styled "the Cicero of America," have left little record of his action, save that he was too diffident to take the prominent position his merits warranted. Before the contest between the colonists and the royal government was begun, Mr. Lee's most prominent act in the House of Burgesses was the discovering and bringing to light and punishment of defalcations on the part of the treasurer of the colony. The holder of this important trust was a Mr. Robinson, a leader of the aristocratic party in the House, and a man so surrounded by powerful family associations, that even those best convinced of his guilt, and upon whom should have rested the duty of his punishment, shrank from the task as being one impossible of fulfillment, and which would only bring odium and defeat upon any one who attempted it. Richard Henry Lee, regardless of such base motives for inaction, entered upon this task, nor desisted from its prosecution until his object was attained and the colony secured from heavy loss and pecuniary embarrassment. When the evidence necessary had been secured and Lee rose, in the presence of the man accused and of his collegues who were to be his judges, the candor of Lee's countenance, which was stamped with sorrow at the painful necessity of his words, and the persuasive eloquence accompanied with scathing denunciations with which he spoke, absolutely silenced those who expected by sophistry to turn aside the evidence, and by sarcasm and intimidation to silence the truth. When the British ministry entered upon the system of taxation of the colonies without their consent, Lee was one of the first to see whither the action would tend. Writing to a friend in London, May 31, 1764, he said: "Possibly this step, though intended to oppress and keep us low, in order to secure our dependence, may be subversive of this end. Poverty and oppression, among those whose minds are filled with ideas of British liberty, may introduce a virtuous industry with a train of generous and manly sentiments, which, when in future they become supported by numbers, may produce a fatal resentment of parental care converted into tyrannical usurpation." Mr. Lee, in 1764, was one of the committee who prepared the remonstrance of Virginia presented to the king and parliament, and in 1765 he supported the famous resolutions of Patrick Henry. Both the remonstrance and the resolutions are more fully spoken of elsewhere in the volume. [See sketch of Wythe and of Harrison.] Liberty-loving Virginia found a fit representative in Richard Henry Lee in the dark years which followed. Under his lead men of all parties and of all social grades united in opposition to the "Stamp Act," binding themselves to each other, to God, and to their country to resist its action. In Westmoreland county, a resolution was framed by Lee, and written in his hand as follows: "As the stamp act does absolutely direct the property of the people to be taken from them without their consent, expressed by their representatives, and as in many cases it deprives the British-American subject of his right to be tried by jury, we do determine, at every hazard, and paying no regard to death, to exert every faculty to prevent the execution of the stamp act in every instance, within this colony." The repeal of the "Stamp Act" did not for a moment blind Mr. Lee as to the future troubles awaiting the colonies, and for his clear understanding of the position and intention of Parliament at all steps of the struggle that ensued, he was largely indebted to his brother, Dr. Arthur Lee, who was then in London, and with whom he was in constant correspondence. THE HOUDON STATUE OF WASHINGTON. These remarkable sons of Virginia must have been brothers in thought and mind, as well as of blood, so closely were their feelings allied. At one time Dr. Lee wrote: "Let me remind you that no confidence is to be reposed in the justice or mercy of Britain, and that American liberty must be entirely of American fabric." Through all the intermediate steps between the resistance to the "Stamp Act" and the meeting of the first Continental Congress, in 1774, Richard Henry Lee was conspicuous for his talent, his energy, his courage and his patriotism. When the royal displeasure dissolved the House of Burgesses, the representative men of Virginia met in private houses and continued to formulate their defiance to oppression, and the sanction of the people was the only authority they had, or desired to have. August 1, 1774, the first Assembly of Virginia was convened at the call of the people. By this Assembly Lee was deputed, with Washington and Henry, to represent Virginia in the Congress of Colonies at Philadelphia. This body met in that city, September 5, 1774, and when in its first session a sense of the responsibility of the situation fell upon the representatives so that "a silence, awful and protracted, prevailed," it was a voice from Virginia that broke the spell. Patrick Henry spoke first, followed by Lee. The sweetness of Lee's voice and the harmony of his language soothed, subdued and yet strengthened the souls of his associates, while with eloquence which none could rival or resist he showed that there was now but one hope for their country and that was in the vigor of her resistance. Serving now on many important committees, and largely engaging in the spirited colonial correspondence which filled those years, Richard Henry Lee continued to represent Westmoreland county in the Assembly, and the Assembly in the Continental Congress until in the Congress of 1776, on the 7th of June, he offered the memorable resolution, from which the Declaration of Independence was formulated, that "These united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States." This motion Mr. Lee introduced in words of ringing eloquence. In concluding, he said: "Why, then, sir, do we longer delay? Why still deliberate? Let this happy day give birth to an American republic. Let us arise not to devastate and to conquer, but to re-establish the reign of peace and of law. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us. * * * If we are not this day wanting in our duty, the names of the American legislators of 1776 will be placed by posterity at the side of Theseus, Lycurgus, and Romulus, of the three Williams of Nassau, and of all those whose memory has been, and will be, dear to virtuous men and good citizens." Three days later, while Lee's motion was still under discussion, he received news of the serious illness of his wife, and hastened to her side, leaving others to carry out the work he had so well begun. The absence of Mr. Lee from Congress continued until August, 1776, when he again took his seat, appended his signature to the Declaration, and resumed his arduous committee work. In this work he also continued through the session of 1777, taking a prominent part in preparing a plan of treaties with foreign nations. During this time he was the mark of British malignity; his person constantly in danger if he returned to his home; that home itself broken in upon by British troops ostensibly seeking to effect his capture, and his sons, then at school at St. Bedes, subjected to the insolence of the royalists, one of whom assured these boys that he hoped to live to see their father's head on Tower Hill. Yet the "ingratitude of republics," even at such a time, fell upon Lee, many friends of the new government loudly proclaiming him a "tory." His first act on returning home was to demand of the Assembly an investigation of his conduct as its representative, and that body not only exonerated him from blame, but through the venerable George Wythe passed him a vote of thanks for his able services, freely rendered. In 1778-79, Mr. Lee was again a representative in Congress, although his failing health forced him often to be absent from its sessions. During the latter year the British troops were turning their attention more largely to the Southern States, and were harassing the coast of Virginia with predatory incursions, and Mr. Lee, as lieutenant of the county, was appointed to the command of the Westmoreland militia. In the field his energy, activity and good judgment were as conspicuous as in the councils of the nation, and the protection he afforded Westmoreland county is conveyed in the complaint of the commander of the British troops in that vicinity: "We cannot set foot in Westmoreland without having the militia immediately upon us." November 1, 1784, Mr. Lee again resumed his seat in Congress, and on the 30th of November was unanimously chosen to fill the presidential chair, then the highest office in the nation. When his term of service expired, he sought the repose of private life, which he enjoyed until, on the adoption of the Federal Constitution, he consented to serve his beloved Virginia once more in a public capacity, and took his seat as her first Senator under the new Constitution. This important position he filled until 1792, departing then to his home honored with a vote of thanks for his services, passed unanimously by the Senate and House of Delegates of Virginia, October 22, 1792. In his home life Richard Henry Lee abounded in those courtesies and graces which mark the gentleman. His hospitable mansion was open to all; the poor and the afflicted frequented it for help and consolation; the young for instruction, and all ages and classes for happiness. His large family of children, the offspring of two marriages, were happy in his love and grew to noble womanhood and manhood under his instructions. He died June 19, 1794, in his 64th year, at Chantilly, Westmoreland county, Virginia. [The life of Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in behalf of Virginia, will be found on another page.] BENJAMIN HARRISON. The name of Harrison has been prominent in the annals of American history, since in 1640, the first Harrison settled in the county of Surrey, province of Virginia. At the present day, one of that name and race occupies an honorable position among our legislators. It seems fitting, therefore, that one of the name should be a Signer of the Declaration, and this honor was reserved for Benjamin Harrison, born in Berkeley, Charles City county, Virginia, about 1740. He was the oldest son of Benjamin Harrison, born also at the family mansion in Berkeley, and himself a son of a Benjamin Harrison, who was the oldest born in his father's family. It seems to have been the custom of the family that the first born male representative in each generation should have the name of Benjamin, as we trace it back through several generations where the oldest son was always so named. The representative of the name of whom we write, was the grandson, on his mother's side, of Mr. Carter, King's surveyor-general in his day; so that we see he was a fitting representative of the Virginian families in whose interest he voted for the independence of the colony. He entered public life in 1764, becoming a member of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, where his abilities, family prominence and social gifts soon made him a leader. He had before this proved his executive ability by managing the family estates from the death of his father, while he was yet a student in William and Mary College, so that their value was greatly increased. The representatives of the British ministry, pursuing their usual course toward a colonist who seemed of prominence and likely to lead the people, endeavored to purchase his influence in the interest of England, by soliciting him to become a member of the governor's executive council, the highest office open to one born in the colonies, the governor being always a native of Great Britain. Benjamin Harrison, closely noting the course of events, and sympathizing with the position of the colonists, refused to bind himself to work against their interests, or even to remain neutral, and declined the honor. November 14, 1764, he was one of the members of the House appointed to prepare an address to the King, a memorial to the House of Lords, and a remonstrance to the House of Commons against the Stamp Act. During the next ten years he was constantly a member of the House of Burgesses, and was one of those illustrious Virginians, among whom were Randolph, Wythe, Jefferson and Lee, who fought, step by step, in the interest of their colony, against the accumulating encroachments of the tyrannical representatives of the British crown. In August, 1774, Benjamin Harrison was one of seven delegates appointed to represent Virginia in the Congress of Delegates, called to meet in Philadelphia, to discuss the mutual interests of the colonies, and on September 5, 1774, he took his seat in the First Continental Congress, convened in Carpenter's Hall in that city, where he had the pleasure of seeing a Virginian occupy the first presidential chair in that body. March 20, 1775, the second Virginia convention assembled in Richmond, of which convention Benjamin Harrison was a member. Before the convention adjourned, they elected delegates to the second General Congress, and Mr. Harrison was among those returned, and in May, 1775, he again repaired to Philadelphia, to take his seat in the second Congress. Here, in a house he had taken with his coadjutors, George Washington and Peyton Randolph, he entertained his friends with true Southern hospitality and prodigality, often exceeding his means. During this Congress, Randolph, then presiding officer, was recalled to Virginia, by public duties there, and Hancock, of Massachusetts, was unanimously elected president in his stead. While he was hesitating as to his ability to fill the position as his predecessor had done, Harrison caught him in his athletic arms and forcibly seated him in the presidential chair, crying aloud: "We will show Mother Britian how little we care for her, by making a Massachusetts man our president, whom she has excluded from pardon by a public proclamation." June 24, 1775, Mr. Harrison was made chairman of the board of war. August 1, Congress adjourned, and on the 11th of August, the Virginia convention a third time returned Mr. Harrison as their representative, and on September 13 he took his seat. In that month he was one of a committee of three sent to consult with Washington, the commander-in-chief of the army, and with the governors of several colonies, regarding the interests of the Continental army. November 29 he was made chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and three days later was sent to help the people of Maryland to raise some naval force with which to meet Lord Dunmore who, driven from Virginia, had gathered a band of desperadoes and renegades, and was laying waste the coast of the Chesapeake. During the troubled days for the Continental Congress with which the year 1776 opened, Benjamin Harrison was busy in the interests of the colonists. January 17, he brought in a report regulating the recruiting service; on the 24th he was placed on a committee to establish a general war department; on the 26th he was one of three sent to New York to arrange with Lee a plan for its defense; and immediately upon his return he was named on a committee for arranging military departments in the Middle and Southern colonies. March 6, he became chairman of the Committee of Marines. In May he was chairman of the committee on the Canada expedition; May 25, was appointed chairman of a committee of fourteen whose arduous duty it was to arrange a plan for the coming campaign. Through the first days of that stormy year Benjamin Harrison was ever at his post, working indefatigably for the interests of the people, until August 11, when his term of service expired and he returned to Virginia, having first had the pleasure of affixing his signature, as one of Virginia's representatives, to the Declaration of Independence, and the honor of presiding over the Committee of the Whole who discussed the question through its most momentous days, June 8-12, 1776. During the remainder of 1776, Benjamin Harrison was one of the eight counselors of State, whose duty it was to guide the political affairs of Virginia. In the fall of 1776, Thomas Jefferson resigned his seat in the senate, and Mr. Harrison, on the 10th of October, was chosen to fill out his term, and took his seat November 5, having been absent from Congress less than three months. By resolution of Congress he was immediately restored to his former place on all standing committees. Through the dark days of the terrible winter of 1776-7, he was always active and hopeful in the interests of the colonies, and on May 22, 1777, by joint ballot of both houses, Virginia returned him first of her delegates to Congress, and for the fourth time he took his seat in that body, and, as before, was actively engaged on committees, and presiding over the deliberations of the house. Toward the close of 1777, Benjamin Harrison permanently retired from Congress, leaving behind him the character of one who was ardent, honorable, prudent and persevering in the interests of those who entrusted their rights in his keeping. Again in Virginia, he was immediately returned by his county to the House of Burgesses, and elected speaker of that body, which office he held uninterruptedly until 1782. During this time he was chief magistrate in his county, and commander of the militia, bearing the title of "colonel," by which title he is generally spoken of in the records of his State. In 1782, Benjamin Harrison was elected governor of Virginia, on the resignation of Thomas Nelson, and through the arduous duties of the trying times which accompanied the close of the Revolution, filled the executive chair with wisdom and to the best interests of the people. After being twice re-elected governor, Mr. Harrison became ineligible by the provisions of the constitution, and in 1785 returned to private life. In 1790, against his wishes, he was again brought forward as a candidate for the executive chair, and was defeated by two or three votes. In the spring of 1791, Mr. Harrison was attacked by a severe fit of the gout, from which, however, he partially rallied. In April, 1791, he was unanimously elected to the legislature, and in the evening following the announcement of his success, he entertained his friends at a dinner party, receiving their congratulations, and assurances that he was to be the next governor of Virginia. During the night following, a dangerous return of his illness seized him, and his death speedily followed. The wife of Benjamin Harrison was Elizabeth, a daughter of Colonel William Bassett, of Eltham, New Kent county, Virginia, and a daughter of the sister of Martha Washington. She was a very beautiful woman, remembered as being as good as she was beautiful, and survived her husband only one year. They had many children, of whom three sons and four daughters lived to mature years. Their third son, William Henry Harrison, was ninth President of the United States. THOMAS NELSON, JR., Was the eldest son of William Nelson, an English gentlemen who settled at York, province of Virginia, in the early part of the eighteenth century, and engaged for a time in a mercantile business. Acquiring a fortune, he invested it in large landed estates, and gradually withdrew from commercial pursuits. In the interval between the administrations of Lord Botetourt and Lord Dunmore, William Nelson filled the office of governor of Virginia. After retiring from this office he presided over the supreme court of the province, and was regarded as the ablest judge of his time. He died a few years before the Revolution, leaving five sons. Thomas Nelson, jr., "the worthy son of such an honored sire," was born at York, December 26, 1738. In the summer of 1753 he was sent to England to receive a collegiate education, and after attending private school was entered at Trinity College. Here he distinguished himself by honorable conduct and good scholarship until his return to America, in the winter of 1761. In August, 1762, he was joined in wedlock with Lucy, daughter of Philip Grymes, of Middlesex county, Virginia. They established themselves at York in such a home as their abundant means justified, and lived in a style of great elegance and hospitality. Thomas Nelson's public record begins in 1774, when we find him a member for York of that House of Burgesses which the wrath of Lord Dunmore dissolved, on account of their resolutions censuring the Boston port bill. Mr. Nelson was one of the eighty-nine delegates who assembled themselves the next day at a friendly tavern, and formed the celebrated association which resolved at all hazards to defend their rights and maintain their liberties. Mr. Nelson was elected from his county a member of the first Virginia Convention, which met at Williamsburg, August 1, 1774. In March, 1775, he was again a representative to the Virginia convention, and was prominent in the debate of that session on the advisibility of a military force, Mr. Nelson asserting that such a force was necessary to the interests of the colonists and so putting his vote upon record. The third Virginia convention assembled at Richmond, Virginia, July 17, 1776, and again Thomas Nelson, jr., was the representative of York. The work of raising colonial troops was now being actively pursued, and Mr. Nelson was made colonel of the second regiment raised, the command of the first regiment having been given Patrick Henry. August 11, 1775, Virginia appointed among her delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia Colonel Nelson, and he, believing the post of danger and of duty was there, resigned his military command, repaired to Philadelphia, and took his seat in Congress September 13, 1775. Here he was one of the first to advocate an absolute separation from Great Britain. Writing to a friend February 13, 1776, Colonel Nelson said: "Independence, confederation, and foreign alliances are as formidable to some of the Congress (I fear a majority) as an apparition to a weak, enervated woman. Would you think we have still some among us who expect honorable proposals from the administration! By heavens, I am an infidel in politics, for I do not believe, were you to bid a thousand pounds per scruple for honour at the court of Britain, that you would get as many as would amount to an ounce. If terms should be proposed, they will savour so much of despotism that America cannot accept them. * * * What think you of the right reverend fathers in God, the bishops? One of them refused to ordain a young gentleman who went from this country, because he was a rebellious American; so that, unless we submit to parliamentary oppression, we shall not have the gospel of Christ preached among us." Through the opening of the session of 1776, Colonel Nelson maintained this advanced position on the question of independence, and in that spirit signed his name to the Declaration. During the remainder of that term, and the beginning of the term of 1777, he served on many important committees, and took part in all measures that advanced the general welfare of the new States. A severe indisposition seized him while in his seat in Congress, May 2, 1777, and a recurring trouble of the head warned him for a time to cease his labors, and he returned home, leaving his term to be filled by another. In August, 1777, the British fleet appeared off the coast of Virginia again, and again Colonel Nelson was called to the field. He was appointed by the governor brigadier-general and commander of the forces of the commonwealth of Virginia, and at once entered upon the discharge of all the important duties of that command, while refusing to take from the impoverished nation any remuneration therefor. In the October following, General Nelson, as a member of the State legislature, had another opportunity to show his sense of the honorable in money matters. An act was introduced and passed by the assembly for the sequestration of British property. Such an act could, and would, of course, be construed so that all debts owed those who were known to be loyal to England would be considered outlawed. General Nelson vehemently opposed the passage of the bill, and in closing a speech supporting his position, said: "I hope the bill will be rejected; but whatever its fate, by God, I will pay my debts like an honest man." The breach of order into which his feelings had betrayed him was overlooked, but the bill became a law. General Nelson continued in active service with the army until his health was restored, when, on the 18th of February, 1779, he took his seat in the State Assembly. Again the same illness attacked him, and, yielding to the expostulations of his physician, and the entreaties of his friends, he returned to his home for rest. But in the following month he again took the field. During the gloomy days of financial depression and disastrous defeats that followed, no man's influence in Virginia was more widely felt or more generously given to the American cause than that of General Nelson. In the spring of 1781, he was elected governor of the Commonwealth, but after performing the arduous duties of that office until the November following, constant and increasing illness forced him to resign. Retiring now permanently from public and political life, Mr. Nelson passed his time alternately between his two estates, one called Offly, situated on the left bank of South Anna river, in Hanover county, and the other in York county. Surrounded by friends and relatives, he now passed several years in comparative quiet, though with always failing health. Death ended his sufferings Sunday, January 4, 1789. FRANCIS LIGHTFOOT LEE. The fourth son of Thomas and Hannah (Ludwell) Lee, was born October 14, 1734, in Westmoreland county, province of Virginia, and was named Francis Lightfoot Lee. He received his education at home under the tuition of a Scotch clergyman named Craig, and having at his command a valuable library collected by his father, afterward the property of the oldest son of the family, Philip. About the time he reached manhood his three older brothers, Philip, Thomas and Richard Henry, returned from abroad, where they had been educated, and in their society he attained that polish and refinement of manner which was in after life one of his distinguishing characteristics. In 1765, Francis Lightfoot Lee took his seat in the House of Burgesses, as member from Loudoun county, in which county he was possessed of a considerable estate. He continued a member of the House for Loudoun county until 1772. In that year he married Rebecca, second daughter of CARTER BRAXTON, Signer of the Declaration of Independence. (Never before published or engraved.) From a miniature in the possession of his family. Colonel John Tayloe, of Richmond county, and took up his residence in that county. In the same year he was returned to the House of Burgesses for Richmond county. August 15, 1775, the convention of Virginia elected him to a seat in the Continental Congress, which position he filled so as to receive three successive re-elections: June 20, 1776; May 22, 1777; May 29, 1778. His work in Congress, faithfully performed, was not of the brilliant character of his elder brother's work, as he was no orator. But when future generations remember the name of Richard Henry Lee, as that of the gallant Virginian whose voice was first raised in advocacy of our independence, it will not be forgotten that among the devoted sons of that State who supported his position was one, his brother in blood, and his colleague in principle, Francis Lightfoot Lee. In the spring of 1779, Mr. Lee retired from Congress, and was immediately elected to the Senate of Virginia under the new constitution of that State. He did not long remain in public life, however, all his inclinations being toward home life and rural occupations, and the state of the country no longer demanding from him the sacrifice of his private tastes. Reading, farming, and the entertainment of friends and neighbors filled his remaining days with quiet happiness, until his death, which occurred in April, 1797. His beloved wife died within a few days of his own demise, and they left no children. CARTER BRAXTON, Seventh signer of the Declaration of Independence in behalf of the province of Virginia, was born at Newington, King and Queen county, Virginia, September 10, 1736. His father was George Braxton, a wealthy planter, and a member of the House of Burgesses. His mother was Mary, daughter of Robert Carter, who was a member of the King's council, and in 1726, its president. Carter Braxton received a liberal education at William and Mary College, and upon leaving college entered at once upon the possession a large property, having lost both his parents, his mother when he was seven days old, and his father during his school days. At the early age of nineteen he married Judith, daughter of Christopher Robinson, of Middlesex county. She was possessed of uncommon beauty as well as a large fortune, and they enjoyed two years of wedded happiness when the lady died, in giving birth to a second daughter, December 30, 1757. Soon after his wife's death Mr. Braxton visited England, returning in 1760. May 15, 1761, he married Elizabeth Corbin, eldest daughter of Richard Corbin, of King and Queen county, receiver-general of customs for the colony of Virginia. The offspring of this marriage were sixteen, six of whom died in infancy. Mrs. Braxton survived her husband, dying in 1814. It is believed, but cannot be absolutely ascertained, that Carter Braxton was a member of the House of Burgesses as early as 1761. It is certain he took an active part in the eventful session of 1765, supporting the celebrated resolutions of Patrick Henry. He was also a member of the House in 1769, which was dissolved by Lord Botetourt. But this dissolution of the House did not change the material of which it was composed. The indignant people returned the same members, without one change, and Mr. Braxton, among the rest, was present at the opening of the session of November, 1769. He continued a member of the House until the dissolution of the assembly of 1771. Accepting then the office of high sheriff of his county (then King William), he was ineligible to act as representative. The first Virginia convention was assembled at Williamsburg, August 1, 1774, and to this convention Mr. Braxton was elected by King William county. The convention met again March 20, 1775. The last and most important meeting of the House of Burgesses was convened by Lord Dunmore, June 1, 1775. Mr. Braxton was an active member of this house, serving on three of the regular and on several of the special committees. This assembly, however, was in session only fifteen days. They had met on the 1st of June, and on the night between the 7th and 8th, the governor, Lord Dunmore, fled from his palace to the "Fowey." No entreaties or assurances on the part of the House could induce his return, and as they very properly refused to convene on board his frigate, it was impossible to transact further business. On the 15th the session was adjourned until October, but it was never re-assembled. The Convention of Virginia, however, again assembled July 17, 1775, and continued in session until August 26th. It met again in December, 1775, and on the 15th of that month appointed Carter Braxton to succeed Peyton Randolph, lately deceased, in the national council. He repaired to Philadelphia, and continued in his seat until the Declaration of Independence had received his signature. In 1776 Mr. Braxton was elected to the House of Delegates of Virginia, and in that House he served during the sessions of 1877, '79, '80, '81, '83 and '85. In the last year he was one of the supporters of the act for establishing religious freedom in Virginia, an act penned and proposed by Jefferson and advocated by Madison. In January, 1786, Mr. Braxton was appointed a member of the council of State, and continued to act with that body until March 30, 1791. In 1793, he was again appointed to the executive council, and taking up the duties of the office May 31, 1794, he continued to perform them until his death, meeting for the last time with the council October 6, 1797, only four days before his death. The last years of his life were distressed by great pecuniary embarrassments. Of the large fortunes in his possession when he was twenty-one, nothing remained. His personal property had passed into the hands of the sheriff; part of his vast estates had been sold from time to time, the remainder, with his slaves and household goods, was heavily mortgaged. Presidents of the United States. GEORGE WASHINGTON, First President of the United States, was born February 22, 1732, and died on the 14th of December, 1799, in his 68th year. The first of the name of Washington to settle in America were two brothers, John and Lawrence, who emigrated from England to Virginia in 1657, and purchased land in Westmoreland county, between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. John Washington married Anne Page of Westmoreland county, became an extensive planter and a magistrate and member of the House of Burgesses. As Colonel Washington he led the Virginia militia against the Seneca Indians, and the grateful people whom he defended named in his honor that district of Westmoreland county which still bears the name of Washington. Augustine Washington, grandson of John, was born in 1694 on the family estate which he in time inherited. He was twice married, his second wife being Mary, daughter of Colonel Ball, of Virginia, and their first child, George Washington, born in Westmoreland county. Not long after the birth of this son Augustine Washington removed to a family estate in Stafford county, and here the childhood of George was passed, and he received what instructions could be gathered from the limited acquirements in reading, writing and arithmetic of one Hobby, who was one of his father's tenants, and combined the duties of parish sexton with the swaying of the birch in the little field school house on the estate. But in the home circle young Washington had good example and good instruction in all that constitutes gentle breeding, and from his ninth year he had the intimate companionship of his eldest half brother, Lawrence, who had been, as was the custom with the eldest son of a colonial gentleman, educated in England. There was a difference of fourteen years in the age of the half brothers, but a warm affection between them, and George naturally looked upon his cultivated senior as a pattern after which he should model his own mind and manners. The death of Augustine Washington in 1743 left the children of his second marriage to the guardianship of their mother. She was equal to the trust—prompt to decide and to act, controlled by common sense and by conscience, she governed her family with a firm hand, and held their love while exacting their obedience. Through his entire life Washington acknowledged with love and gratitude how much of what he was he owed to his mother. He preserved with tender care a manual of instruction from which she was accustomed to read to her fatherless little ones, and this manual may now be seen in the archives of Mount Vernon. When about twelve years of age, Washington went to pass some time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and to avail himself of better school facilities, but his education was confined to plain English branches of study. In the autumn of 1747, he took a final leave of school, having a good knowledge of mathematics and of surveying, which he put to practical use. In March, 1748, he was sent by Lord Fairfax to survey some wild lands in what was then the western borders of settlement, a difficult task, which he completed in a month's time. He then received the appointment of public surveyor, which office he held three years. For some years the French and English governments had been disputing the ownership of the North American continent, and each, by diplomacy, endeavoring to secure the alliance of the Indian tribes. October 30, 1753, George Washington, not yet twenty-two years of age, was sent by Governor Dinwiddie, of Virginia, on the important embassy of securing terms of friendship with the Indian sachems along the Ohio, and to expostulate with the French commander at Venango for his aggressions on the territory of His Britannic Majesty. The ability with which Washington executed his difficult mission, which he accomplished so that he was able to report, January 16, 1754, may be considered the foundation of his future eminence. From this date he was the rising hope of Virginia. French and English alike now began preparations for war, and in Virginia three hundred militia was raised, and Washington made second in command, with rank of lieutenant-colonel. On the 2d of April he took the field at the head of only two companies of men, about 150 in all. For five years following he was in the royal service, and in several battles was in command. During the engagement known as "Braddock's Defeat," he received four bullet-holes through his coat, and two horses were shot under him. The interest of the Virginians in the French and Indian war ended with the expulsion of the French from the Ohio Valley, and Washington resigned his command. January 17, 1759, he married Mrs. Martha Custis, and having inherited Mount Vernon at the death of his loved brother, Lawrence, July 26, 1752, they made their home on that estate. Early in the year of his marriage Washington repaired to Williamsburg to take the seat in the House of Burgesses to which he had been elected. By a unanimous vote the house had agreed to greet his installation with a testimonial of their gratitude for his military exertions in behalf of Virginia. This was conveyed to him in a graceful speech from Mr. Robinson, speaker of the House. Washington rose to reply, blushed, stammered, trembled—and was dumb. "Sit down, Mr. Washington," said the Speaker, "your modesty equals your valor, and that surpasses a force of any language I possess." During the next sixteen years Washington's time was occupied with his property interests and in attendance on the sessions of the House of Burgesses, of which he continued a member. His residence was at Mount Vernon, and his growing reputation drew about him there many distinguished guests, whom he entertained with true Virginian hospitality. His own home life was exceedingly simple. He was an early riser, often leaving his room before daybreak of a winter's morning. He breakfasted at seven in summer, and eight in winter, his breakfast usually consisting of two small cups of tea and three or four "hoecakes." Immediately after breakfast he mounted his horse and made a personal inspection of the work on his estate. At two he dined, eating heartily, and drinking small beer or cider, followed by two glasses of old Madeira. He took tea, of which he was very fond, early in the evening, and retired for the night at nine o'clock. The troubles between the colonists and Great Britain engaged the attention of the House of Burgesses during the last years of Washington's attendance on that body, and he was a member of that House which was dissolved by the royal governor for sympathizing with the colonists of Massachusetts in regard to the "Boston Port Bill." He was a delegate from Virginia to the first Continental Congress, in 1774, and continued in his seat until in June, 1775, at the request of his colleagues he resigned to assume command of the Continental army. July 3, 1775, General Washington took up his headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts, welcomed with unbounded enthusiasm by his troops. The thoughts of a Cæsar, the ambition of an Alexander, might be supposed to have swelled his heart that day. But at its close, he wrote to his friend and neighbor, George William Fairfax, then in England: "Unhappy it is to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America are to be either drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves. Sad alternative! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?" The eight years of the Revolutionary War now ensued, during which time Washington was constantly at the post of duty assigned him; now commanding the battle on the fields of Trenton, of Princeton and of Brandywine; now quelling the factious spirit of subordinate officers who thought themselves able to command because they could not obey, and anon encouraging with kind words and little acts of self-sacrifice the drooping spirits and failing hopes of his sorely-tried army; now appealing to Congress for munitions of war for bread for his soldiers, and for soldiers to recruit his thinning ranks, and anon, kneeling in the snowy darkness of the winter's night at Valley Forge, and appealing to the God of battles and of right; now rebuking Lee on the field of Monmouth; and now seated on his white charger at the head of his victorious troops at Yorktown, receiving from the representative of Cornwallis the sword whose surrender betokened the downfall of the British cause in America. April 19, 1783, eight years from the battle of Lexington, cessation of hostilities between the two armies was proclaimed, and on the 3d of September following a definite treaty of peace, as between two equal nations, was concluded and signed in Paris, by the representatives of Great Britain and of the United States of America. In October, 1783, Congress disbanded the troops enlisted for the war, and Washington put forth his farewell address to the army. December 4, 1783, in the public room of a tavern at the corner of Broadway and Pearl streets, New York City, Washington, "with a heart full of love and gratitude," to quote his words, took leave of the officers who had served under him. Each in turn grasped his hands in farewell, while tears fell upon their cheeks, and upon the forehead of each of his companions in arms he left a kiss of farewell. At noon on the 23d of December, he entered the legislative hall at Annapolis, and resigned to Congress the authority with which he had been commissioned eight years before. Accompanied by his wife he at once set out for their loved Mount Vernon, which they reached on Christmas Eve, 1783. Washington now participated little in public affairs except to attend as delegate the Philadelphia convention in May, 1787, which framed the Federal Constitution. He was unanimously chosen to preside over this convention, which duty fulfilled, he returned to Mount Vernon, and to private life. A few months before the disbanding of the army the "Society of the Cincinnati" was formed, and Washington was made its President-General, an office which he held until his death. The objects of the association were to promote cordial friendship among the soldiers of the Revolutionary army, and to extend aid to such members of the society as might need it. To perpetuate the association it was provided in the constitution that the eldest male descendant of a member should be entitled to wear the "Order" and enjoy the privileges of the society. The "Order," or badge, consists of a gold eagle suspended upon a ribbon, on the breast of which is a medallion, with a device representing Cincinnatus receiving the Roman Senators. History repeated itself upon the day when, on the 14th of March, 1789, Charles Thompson, Secretary of Congress, waited on Washington to inform him that he was chosen under the new Constitution as the first President of the United States. The soldier-farmer-statesman was found making the daily tour of his fields. Accepting the office, Washington made immediate preparations for his journey to the seat of government. His first duty was to his mother. Toward evening of the day on which he accepted the highest dignity of the nation, he rode from Mount Vernon to Fredericksburg, and knelt beside the chair of her to whom he owed the qualities which made him worthy of the honor bestowed upon him. It was a touching interview, and, as both felt, their last meeting on earth, for the venerable lady was now past eighty years of age, and suffering from an incurable disease. She gave him a mother's blessing, and sent him to fullfil the high destinies to which Heaven had called him. Before his return to Virginia her death occurred, in August, 1789. April 6, Washington left Mount Vernon for New York, accompanied, as far as Alexandria, by a cavalcade of his neighbors and friends. At every step of his journey he was greeted with demonstrations of reverence and love. At Georgetown he was received with honors; at Baltimore he was feasted; near Philadelphia he rode under a triumphal arch of laurel, and little Angelica Peall, concealed among the foliage, placed upon his head a civic crown of laurel, while from the assembled multitude went up a shout of: "Long live George Washington! long live the Father of his Country." When he crossed the Delaware at Trenton, scene of his victories and defeats in his struggle with Cornwallis, he passed under an arch, supported by thirteen pillars, which had been erected by the women of New Jersey and bore the words: "The defender of the mothers will be the protector of the daughters." At Elizabethtown, he was met by a committee from the two houses of Congress, and by a deputation of civil and military officers. They had in waiting a magnificent barge manned by thirteen pilots in white uniforms. In this the president-elect was conveyed to New York, where every display had been made in honor of his coming. April 30, 1789, the inauguration took place, the chancellor of New York State, Robert R. Livingston administering the oath. The bible used was then and is now the property of the St. John Lodge of Free Masons of New York City. When the ceremony was ended, President Washington proceeded at once to the Senate Chamber and pronounced a most impressive inaugural address, and the new government was ready to enter upon its duties. In the fall of 1792, he was elected to a second term as President of the United States, and served four years longer. Then, declining another re-election, he took leave of the people in a farewell address, issued to the country September 17, 1796. In this address he appealed to the people as the sovereign power in a Republican form of government, to preserve the Union as the only hope for the continuance of their liberties and the national prosperity. His career as President had been a most honorable one, calmly pursued amid trying difficulties, and though often obstructed by the hostile criticisms of that factious spirit which is yet the curse of American politics. Under his administrations the government had been put in motion, its financial, domestic and foreign policies established, and its strength maintained and augmented. The remaining years of Washington's life were passed on his estate at Mount Vernon. Here, in 1798, he was found at the time of threatened war between the United States and France, when Adams appointed him commander-in-chief of the American armies, and the commission was borne to Mount Vernon by the secretary of war in person. Washington was in the fields, superintending his grain harvest, and thither Secretary McHenry repaired. Washington read his commission, and, without hesitation, answered: "The President may command me without reserve." Happily the storm-cloud passed over, and his patriotism did not again call him from Mount Vernon. December 12, 1799, Washington was exposed to a storm of sleet, and took a cold which, on the following day, merged into something like an attack of membranous croup. All that love and skill could do to save him was powerless, and death ensued between ten and eleven o'clock on the night of the 14th. Fitted for all the uses of life, this great man was ready for death. To his friend and physician, Dr. Craik, he said: "I die hard, but I am not afraid to go." And his last words were: " 'Tis well." THOMAS JEFFERSON, Third President of the United States, was born April 2, 1742, and died July 4, 1826, at the age of 84 years. Virginia, glorious in the annals of American history as the birthplace of a Washington, a Patrick Henry, a Monroe and the Lees, was also the place of birth of Thomas Jefferson, the framer of the Declaration of Independence and the Third President of the United States. He was born at Shadwell, Albemarle county, son of Colonel Peter Jefferson, a well-known gentleman of means in the province of Virginia, and Jane (Randolph) Jefferson, daughter of Isham Randolph, of Goochland county. He received his collegiate education at William and Mary College, read law with the celebrated George Wythe, afterward chancellor of the State of Virginia, and began practice in 1767. In 1769 he became a member of the House of Burgesses, where he served the interests of the colonists until, March 27, 1775, he was chosen one of Virginia's representatives in the Continental Congress. In 1774, he published his defense of the colonists, entitled, "Summary View of the Rights of British America," wherein he boldly set forth such doctrines that Lord Dunmore, then governor of the province, threatened him with a prosecution for high treason. June 1, 1775, Lord Dunmore presented to the legislature of Virginia certain resolutions of the British parliament, to which Jefferson, as chairman of the committee appointed for that purpose, made response in one of the ablest State papers on record. Wednesday, June 21, 1775, Thomas Jefferson took his seat in the Continental Congress, where he soon became conspicuous, both for his talent and the ardor with which it was devoted to the cause of liberty. He served during the remainder of that year, and through the following year, acting on many important committees, and on the 9th of June, 1776, he was appointed chairman of that committee to whom was delegated the important duty of preparing a draft of a Declaration of Independence. When he appended his signature to that document, as amended and accepted, the moment was to him the greatest and the gravest of his life. After serving actively in Congress during the summer of 1776, Mr. Jefferson returned home, and during the remaining years of the Revolutionary war devoted himself mainly to the service of his own State. June 1, 1779, he was elected governor of Virginia, and as chief magistrate of that Commonwealth his patriotism and statesmanship made him an invaluable aid to the harassed and overburdened commander of the Continental army, then seeing its darkest days. He remained in constant correspondence with Washington, and gave a soldier's cheerful obedience to any suggestions and requests that General made concerning Virginia. His term of office expired June 2, 1780, but as a private citizen he continued to serve the State until peace was declared. Near the close of 1782, he was appointed minister plenipotentiary to join the representatives of the United States already in Europe, but the treaty of Paris, in 1783, rendered his services unnecessary, and he remained in America. June 6, 1783, he was again chosen delegate to Congress, and took his seat on the 4th of November following. March 30, 1784, he was chosen to preside in Congress, and was chairman of that committee which performed the important work of revising and getting in proper working order the treasury department. May 7, 1784, he was appointed to join John Adams and Benjamin Franklin in Paris, and negotiate treaties of commerce for the United States with foreign nations. Accompanied by his oldest daughter, he set sail in July and joined his colleagues in the following month. March 10, 1785, Mr. Jefferson was unanimously chosen by Congress to succeed Dr. Franklin as minister to the court at Versailles, and, re-appointed in October, 1787, he remained in France until October, 1789, in that time successfully conducting many important and intricate negotiations in the interest of the United States. Immediately upon his return to America, Thomas Jefferson was appointed by President Washington Secretary of State, and he conducted this department of the new and untried government past many perils and by many momentous and statesmanlike decisions through the four years of Washington's first administration, resigning the office December 31, 179. Three years of private life ensued, and then again Mr. Jefferson found himself in the political arena, this time as the leader of one of the two political parties into which the American voters had become divided. By the party then calling themselves Republicans, Mr. Jefferson was nominated for President, and the Federal party nominated John Adams of Massachusetts as his opponent. The vote was counted in the presence of both houses of Congress in February, 1797, and Mr. Adams receiving the majority was declared President, Mr. Jefferson, as was then the law, becoming vice-president. March 4, 1797, he took the oath of office, and as presiding officer in the Senate, delivered before that body a speech which is yet a model of dignity, modesty and statesmanship. Much of the four succeeding years, Mr. Jefferson spent in tranquillity at his country home, Monticello. He had married New Year's Day, 1772, Martha, daughter of John Wayles, a distinguished lawyer of Charles City county, Virginia, and their union had been blessed with two beautiful daughters. The death of the wife and mother occurred about ten years subsequent to her marriage, and toward his two children Mr. Jefferson always manifested a mother's tenderness combined with a father's care. When the time for another presidential election approached, Mr. Jefferson was again the candidate of his party, his opponent being Aaron Burr of New York. The vote was a tie, and the election devolved upon the House of Representatives. After thirty-five ineffectual ballots, a member from Maryland, authorized by Mr. Burr, withdrew that gentleman's name, and on the thirty-sixth ballot Mr. Jefferson was elected president, Colonel Burr becoming vice-president. March 4, 1801, President Jefferson delivered his inaugural address in the presence of both Houses of Congress, in which, among many wise utterances, were the following words, which embody the only safe principles for the American government: "Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none." In December, 1801, President Jefferson established the custom of sending a President's annual message to the houses of Congress. Before that time the president had in person made the communication, to which the Speaker, in behalf of Congress, had at once replied in a formal address. Re-elected to the presidency, Jefferson served two terms, his second term of office expiring March 4, 1809. The record of his administration's is a matter of the history of the country. At the age of sixty-six, Thomas Jefferson retired to private life at Monticello, nor did he again engage in public affairs. Here he passed fifteen tranquil years, surrounded by friends and admirers, and in the happy consciousness of the growing and assured prosperity of the country he loved. His last public utterances were embodied in a letter addressed June 24, 1826, to a committee who desired his attendance at the coming anniversary of Independence Day. The letter is marked by that statesmanship which characterized all his words to the people. Among its utterances was the following: "All eyes are opened, or are opening to the rights of man. The general spread of the lights of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favoured few, booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, `by the grace of God!' " Two days after this letter was written, an indisposition under which Mr. Jefferson was labouring assumed a more serious form, and his death was anticipated. But he rallied on the 2d of July, and, on ascertaining the date, eagerly expressed a wish that he might live to see the dawn of the fiftieth anniversary of Independence. His wish was granted. He lived until one o'clock of the afternoon of July 4, 1826, passing then from this world to another with the tranquillity with which the philosopher's life is ended. JAMES MADISON, Fourth President of the United States, was born March 16, 1751, and died June 28, 1836, in his 85th year. He was born at King George, King George county, Virginia, his father an opulent planter of that province. The oldest of seven children, he received the best education the times afforded. He was prepared for college under the instructions of a private tutor, Rev. Thomas Martin, and entered Princeton, from which university he was graduated in 1771, with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The movement toward American Independence was thus well begun when he stepped into the arena of public life. In 1775 he was a member of the committee of safety of Orange county, and in 1776 represented that county in the Virginia Convention. In 1777 the House of Delegates elected him to the executive council of Virginia, and of that body he continued a leading member until the close of 1779. In 1779 he was chosen to represent Virginia in the Continental Congress, where he took his seat March 20, 1780. He remained in Congress nearly four years, or until the first Monday of November, 1783. He was thus a member of that body during the last years of the Revolutionary war, and a part of the first year following the peace. During this time he had an opportunity to observe the inefficiency of the confederated form of government, and was active in all the remedial measures that were proposed in Congress. In 1784, Mr. Madison was elected to the State Legislature of Virginia, and by annual re-elections continued a member of that body until November, 1786, when, having become re-eligible as a candidate for Congress, he was returned to the national legislature, and resumed official position there February 12, 1787. During his membership in the State legislature he became the champion of religious liberty. In 1784 Thomas Jefferson had introduced in the Virginia legislature a "Bill for the Establishment of Religious Freedom." At that time all colonists were taxed for the support of the Church of England and its clergy, although many were indifferent to that form of worship, and others were earnestly opposed to it on the ground of conscientious scruples. The bill failed to pass that year, and in 1785, Mr. Jefferson being absent from the State legislature, James Madison took up the bill, and urged and achieved its passage, against strong opposition. In the same and the following year, as chairman of the judiciary committee, he presided over and assisted in the revision of the statutes of Virginia. May 9, 1787, the committee which prepared the Federal Constitution was convened at Philadelphia, and James Madison was a delegate from Virginia. Four months of anxious deliberation and steady labor enabled this committee to report, on the 17th of September, the articles which, when amended and adopted, became the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, Madison was elected to the first House of Representatives under the new Constitution. He served until the close of Washington's administration, and then retired to private life. In 1794, he was united in marriage with Mrs. Todd, nee Dolly Payne, widow of a distinguished lawyer of Philadelphia. The lady was a Virginian by birth, a member of the Payne family, and a sister of the wife of George S. Washington. Her marriage with James Madison was consummated in what is now Jefferson county, West Virginia, at a substantial stone mansion which is still standing in an excellent state of preservation. This house has many historical associations, having been built in 1752 by Samuel Washington, eldest full brother of George Washington, who occasionally visited here. Here, too, Louis Phillippe was entertained during his visit to America, and in the sitting-room where Madison and Mrs. Todd were married, is a mantle presented to the family by General La Fayette. During Jefferson's administrations, 1801-9, Madison was his most intimate adviser outside of his cabinet, and the friendship between the two men continued throughout Madison's administration, where the direction of the statesmanship of Jefferson could be often seen. March 4, 1809, James Madison assumed the duties of President of the United States, to which office he had been elected by a majority of 122 out of 175 electoral votes. Madison's administration continued through eight years, its most important event being the war of 1812. During this war the British obtained possession of Washington, August 24, 1814, and plundered and destroyed with fire a large portion of the city. Mrs. Madison, then presiding at the White House, was obliged to seek safety in flight. Her carriage stood at the door, and her friends were urging her immediate departure, when she returned to her drawing-room and cut from its frame a full-length picture of Washington. "Save it, or destroy it," she commanded the gentlemen who were in attendance upon her; "but do not let it fall into the hands of the British!" Then she entered the carriage which conveyed her, with other ladies, to a place of refuge beyond the Potomac. The treasure she took from the White House in her own hands, and held concealed in her wrappings as she was driven away, was the precious parchment upon which was engrossed the Declaration of Independence, with its fifty-two signatures. March 4, 1817, Madison's long and useful connection with national affairs terminated, and he retired to his farm of Montpelier in Virginia, where his life was peacefully ended. Nineteen years of private life preceded his death, and the time was largely devoted by him to the production of the voluminous writings which he left to posterity. From his earliest years he had been a hard student, with tenacious memory; he led a life of spotless virtue upon which the breath of calumny never rested; his bearing was both modest and dignified; his speech always clear and concise; his public career distinguished by honesty and singleness of purpose. Some time after his death Congress purchased from his widow, for $30,000, all his MSS., and a portion of them have been published under the title, "The Madison Papers." Mrs. Madison survived her husband some years, dying in Washington, July 12, 1849, and they left no children. JAMES MONROE, Fifth President of the United States, was born April 28, 1758, and died July 4, 1831, in his 74th year. His birth was in Westmoreland county, Virginia, and he was a lineal descendant of one of the first patentees of that province. His father was Spruce Monroe, a well-known and wealthy planter of Westmoreland county. At the time Independence was declared, James Monroe was a student in William and Mary College. Without finishing his course there he entered the army as a cadet. His military career, though brief, was glorious. He gave his young manhood to his country's service in the hour of her adversity; he joined her standard when others were deserting it; he repaired to Washington's headquarters when the army had dwindled to the verge of dissolution, and Great Britian was pouring her native troops and foreign mercenaries by thousands upon our coasts; he was one of the heroes who followed Washington in his perilous mid-winter journey across the Delaware; he fought at Harlem, at White Plains, and at Trenton, and was wounded in the last named engagement. He was promoted for gallantry on the field, and returned to the army to serve as aide-de-camp to Lord Sterling, through the campaign of 177778, taking part in the engagements of Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth. After this campaign Monroe left the army, and engaged in the study of law, with Thomas Jefferson. In 1781 he served as a volunteer with the Virginia forces, when that State was invaded by the armies of Cornwallis and Arnold, and at the request of the governor of Virginia he visited the more Southern States, 1780, to collect military information. In 1782 he was elected a member of the Virginia legislature, and by the legislature appointed a member of the executive council. June 9, 1783, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he took his seat on the 13th of December following. He continued a member of this body until the close of the session of 1786. In the last named year he married a daughter of Lawrence Kortright, of New York City, and took up his residence in Frederickburg, Spottsylvania county, Virginia. He was elected to a seat in the Virginia legislature, and served three years. In 1790 he was chosen United States Senator, and served until 1794. He was then appointed to succeed Gouveneur Morris as minister at the French Court. The appointment was made upon the recommendation of President Washington and one of the first acts of President Adams was to recall Monroe. During Monroe's ministry in France, his views upon the question of the neutrality of the United States in the war between England and France, then the paramount subject of consideration in America, were not in harmony with the administration, and his course of action was severely censured, and his national popularity for a time decreased. Virginia, however, stood by the son of her soil. His own county, immediately upon his arrival home, returned him to the State legislature, and the votes of the people transferred him thence to the gubernatorial chair. As governor he served three years (1799-1802), the term limited by the State constitution. In 1802 he visited France, appointed by Jefferson as envoy extraordinary to act with Mr. Livingstone at the court of Napoleon. He assisted in the negotiations for the purchase of Louisiana, and then joined Mr. Pinckney in Spain, to assist in the settlement of some boundary questions. In 1807 he went from Spain to England, to protest against the impressment of American seamen, and with Mr. Pinckney to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain. Five years had now been given by Mr. Monroe to public duties abroad, and finding no success attending his efforts to ratify a treaty with Great Britain, he returned to America, reaching home in the closing month of 1807. At the next State election he was again called to the chief magistracy of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which office he filled until, in 1811, he was called to a seat as Secretary of State, in the cabinet of President Madison. This office he held until the close of President Madison's second term, with the exception of about six months, the last months of the second war with Great Britain, when he discharged the more arduous duties of Secretary of the War Department. On the retirement of President Madison, in 1817, James Monroe was chosen fifth President of the United States, and in 1821, was re-elected without opposition. His opponent in the canvass of 1816 was Rufus King, of New York, who received only 34 electoral votes, Mr. Monroe receiving 183. Only one vote was cast against him at his second election, one of the New Hampshire electors voting for John Quincy Adams. Monroe's electoral vote was 228. The distinguishing act of President Monroe's administration, at least that in which posterity is most interested, was the assertion of what has since become known as "The Monroe Doctrine." It was first formulated by President Monroe in his annual message to Congress in 1824. "The occasion has been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers." In popular language, and in the widest sense of the words, this may be interpreted as: "America for Americans," including, of course, all who choose to become American citizens. During his administrations Monroe encouraged the army, increased the navy, protected commerce, and infused vigor and efficiency in every department of the public service. March 4, 1825, he retired to his residence of Oak Hill, in Loudoun county, Virginia. In the winter of 1829-30, he presided over a convention called to revise the constitution of Virginia, but an increasing indisposition necessitated his withdrawal from the convention before its labors were ended, and he never again participated in public affairs. In the summer of 1830 his beloved wife died, and he was unable to bear the solitude of the home her presence had so many years brightened. He removed to New York City, making his home with his son-in-law, Samuel L. Gouveneur, where the few remaining months of his life were passed. Mr. Monroe had been a poor financier in personal matters. Although he had inherited considerable property, and his wife had brought him as much more, and although he had received $350,000 for public services, in his last days pecuniary embarassments were added to his bodily infirmities, and his old age was harassed by debt. In 1858 the remains of ex-President Monroe were removed, with great pomp, from New York to Richmond, Virginia, and on July 5th were re-interred in Hollywood cemetery. The members of President Monroe's cabinet were: Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, 1817-1825; Secretary of the Treasury, Wm. H. Crawford, of Georgia, 1817-1825; Secretary of War, Geo. Graham, ad interim; John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, December, 1817, to March, 1825. (President Monroe tendered this position to Isaac Shelby, governor of Kentucky, who did not qualify, and in December, 1817, declined the office on account of advanced age.) Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin W. Crowninshield, of Massachusetts, March, 1817, to November, 1818; Smith Thompson, of New York, November, 1818, to December, 1823; Samuel L. Southard, of New Jersey, December, 1823, to March, 1825. Attorney General, Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania, March to November, 1817; William Wirt, of Virginia, November, 1817, to March, 1825. The office of Postmaster General for these eight years was filled by Return Jonathan Meigs, March, 1817, to June, 1823, then by John McLean, of Ohio, until March, 1825. WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, Ninth President of the United States, was born February 9, 1773, and died April 4, 1841, in his 69th year. On the banks of the James river, in Charles City county, Virginia, lies the beautiful estate called Berkeley, for several generations the home of the Harrisons. Here was born Benjamin Harrison, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his third son was William Henry Harrison. He received his scholastic education at Hampden-Sidney College, and then began the study of medicine in Philadelphia. But about that time an army was gathering to be sent against the Indians of the Northwest, and young Harrison displayed an inclination toward military life. At the age of nineteen he received from President Washington an ensign's commission, and joined the army, under General St. Clair. In 1792 he was promoted to a lieutenancy, and in 1794 he fought under "Mad Anthony" Wayne, whose aid-de-camp he became. In 1795, Harrison was commissioned captain and placed in command at Fort Washington, now the site of Cincinnati. Here he was joined in marriage with a daughter of John Cleves Symmes, a pioneer in that locality, who first laid out the tract of country on which Cincinnati now stands. Harrison's wife survived him more than twenty years, dying at their home in North Bend, Ohio, February 26, 1864. In 1797, Harrison was appointed secretary of the Northwestern Territory, and resigned his military commission. Two years later, he was elected the first delegate to Congress from the territory. General St. Clair was then governor of the territory, which included the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In 1801 the Northwestern Territory was divided, Indiana was erected into a separate territorial government, embracing what is now the States of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, and William Henry Harrison was appointed first governor of the new territory. By consecutive re-appointments Harrison was continued chief magistrate of Indiana until 1813. During this time he also held the official position of commissioner of Indian affairs, and concluded thirteen important treaties with the different Northwestern tribes. His knowledge of the Indian character and the respect with which he was regarded by them on account of his fighting qualities, enabled him to conduct these treaties greatly to the advantage of the government. Before the expiration of his last two years' service as governor, Harrison had again distinguished himself by his military skill, and was again embarked upon a military career. Among his other achievements was the successful resistance of his troop of 800 men against a night attack of the followers of Tecumseh, led on and incited by his brother, the Prophet. This was the engagement on the night of the 6th and morning of the 7th of November, 1811, made famous in subsequent history and song as the "Battle of Tippecanoe." As early as the spring of 1810 the hostile preparations of the Indians of the Northwest, under direction of Tecumseh and his brother, induced Governor Harrison to call them to account. In August they met the governor in council at Vincennes, where the appearance of 700 disciplined troop of militia somewhat abated the ardor of the brothers for an immediate conflict. In the following year, however, Tecumseh succeeded in forming a league of the Choctaws, Chickasaws and Creeks against the whites, and Harrison, using the discretionary power vested in him, gathered a force from his own territory and from Kentucky, at Vincennes, and late in September, 1811, marched up the Wabash valley toward the town of the Prophet, near the junction of Tippecanoe creek and the Wabash river. On the way he built a fort near the site of the present city of Terre Haute, which was called Fort Harrison. In the beginning of November, the governor and his troops encamped on what became the battle-field of Tippecanoe. Tecumseh had gone south to arouse the Indians of Florida, and the Prophet rashly undertook to give battle to Harrison, believing the camp could be surprised and an easy and bloody victory given his deluded followers. The result made Harrison the popular hero of Tippecanoe. Early in 1812, Harrison was brevetted major-general in the Kentucky militia, and later in the same year, in September, was appointed brigadier general of the regular United States army, with command of the Northwestern division. In 1813, he received commission as major-general of the regular army. His services in the war with Great Britain were continued until 1814, during which time the battle of the Thames, and other victories in the lake country, were added to his laurels. In consequence of a misunderstanding with Armstrong, secretary of war in 1814, General Harrison resigned his commission, and retired to his farm at North Bend. He, however, served the government as Indian commissioner in negotiating the treaties of peace, and in 1816, resumed public life as member of Congress, from the Cincinnati district. After serving in the House three years, he was chosen, in 1819, to the State Senate of Ohio, and served in that position five years. In 1824 he became a member of the United States Senate from Ohio, and was given the chairmanship of the military commission. In 1828 John Quincy Adams appointed him minister to Colombia, South America, but Jackson recalled him during the first year of his administration. For the twelve succeeding years General Harrison lived in private life, his only public functions in that time being the discharge of the duties of clerk of the court of Hamilton county, Ohio. In 1836 the Whig party made him their candidate for the chief magistracy, and he received 73 electoral votes. Van Buren, the Democratic candidate, and the protege of the retiring president, Jackson, was elected; but the financial depression which accompanied his administration rendered it unpopular, and gave the Whigs an opportunity to gain the next election. December 4, 1839, General Harrison received the nomination from the Whig party, and the canvass which followed was the most remarkable one that had been witnessed in American politics to that date. It was the "log cabin and hard cider" campaign; the "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" campaign. The press and politicians who rallied about Van Buren brought forward as a slur against Harrison that he lived in a log cabin and drank nothing but hard cider. The friends of Harrison caught up the implied reproach and made it their rallying cry. Their political meetings were held in halls on whose walls were inscribed the words, "log cabin and hard cider," their processions were headed by banners bearing the inscription, and accompanied by miniature log cabins borne in teams or on the shoulders of Harrison supporters. A wave of popular enthusiasm swept the country, landing William Henry Harrison in the White House, March 4, 1841, with 234 electoral votes, and stranding Martin Van Buren at Kinderhook, he having received only 60 electoral votes. The new president, a man of slender constitution and now almost three score and ten years of age, entered upon his presidential duties after this exciting campaign, only to fall a victim to an illness which in eight days from its first appearance culminated in his death just one month from the day on which he took the oath of office. JOHN TYLER, Tenth President of the United States, was born March 29, 1790, and died January 17, 1862, in his 72d year. He was born in Charles City county, Virginia, the second son of John Tyler, a patriot of the Revolution, and governor of Virginia, 1808-11. John Tyler, sr., was also made a judge of admiralty for Virginia, and was holding that office at the time of his death, in 1813. His wife, the mother of the subject of this sketch, was Mary, only child of Robert Armstead, whose ancestors emigrated to Virginia from Hesse-Darmstadt, in early colonial days. John Tyler received a collegiate and legal training, being graduated from William and Mary College in 1807, and admitted to the bar in 1809. He was never in active practice of his profession, entering public life in 1811, when he was elected to the State legislature. He served five years in the legislature, or until his election, in 1816, to fill a vacancy in Congress. To this position he was twice re-elected. In the House he was a member of what was becoming known as the Southern party. He voted in favor of the resolutions of censure on Jackson's conduct in the Seminole war; and his negative vote is recorded against internal improvements; against United States banks; against a protective policy; and he strongly opposed and voted against any restriction on the extension of slavery into the territories. In 1819 he resigned, on account of ill health. 1823-5, he was a leading member of the Virginia legislature, and in December, 1825, was chosen governor of that Commonwealth, serving two terms of one year each. In March, 1831, Tyler was chosen to succeed John Randolph of Roanoke, as United States Senator, and in 1833 he was re-appointed. During his term in the Senate he was one of the most active members of that body. His vote was almost invariably recorded against any act favored by Adams and his cabinet. As in the House, he now set himself against internal improvements, and a protective tariff. He voted against the tariff bill of 1828, and during the debate on Clay's tariff resolutions, session of 1831-32, Tyler spoke three days on the question. He opposed direct protection, and argued for a tariff for revenue, with incidental protection to home industry. In 1832, he was in sympathy with the nullification movement of South Carolina, and spoke against the "force bill." The bill passed the Senate with only one negative vote recorded. Calhoun and others of its opponents retired from the chamber when the motion was to be put, and only John Tyler voted against it. He also voted for Clay's "compromise bill," by which the trouble was adjusted. Receiving from his constituents a request that a vote of his should be expunged from the records, Tyler resigned and returned to Virginia before the expiration of his second term of service in the Senate. He removed to Williamsburg, James City county, and became affiliated in politics with the Southern Whig movement. From this party he received the nomination for vice-president in 1836, and for that office the electoral vote was given him in the States of Maryland, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee. In 1838, the James county Whigs elected him to the State legislature, where he served until he received the nomination for vice-president in 1839. The Whig delegates convened at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, December 4, 1839, and Tyler was present as a member of the convention from Virginia. They nominated Harrison and Tyler, and these candidates were elected in the following year, entering upon their respective offices March 4, 1841. On the death of President Harrison, one month later, John Tyler became his constitutional successor. He was called to Washington from his home in Williamsburg, by Harrison's cabinet, on the 4th of April (the day on which the president died), and he reached the national capital at four o'clock on the morning of the 6th. At noon the ministers called upon him in a body, and Judge Cranch administered to him the oath of office. To the supporters of the administration gathered about him, Tyler said: "You have only exchanged one Whig for another." His course as chief executive of the nation was not in consonance with this assurance. Before a year had elapsed he had lost the confidence of the Whig party, principally by his veto of the bank bill, which was strictly a Whig measure. When the bill had been amended so as, it was thought, to meet his approval, and had been again vetoed, his entire cabinet (the one chosen by Harrison) resigned, with the exception of Daniel Webster, Secretary of State, who was then engaged in important negotiations with England, and who resigned as soon as those negotiations were completed. During the three remaining years of his administration, Tyler was three times compelled to form a new cabinet. In May, 1844, a Whig convention assembled at Baltimore, Maryland, nominated Tyler for the presidency, and the nomination was accepted. But the convention was not a voice of the people, being composed principally of office holders under Tyler, and the president, finding that his defeat at the polls was certain, withdrew his acceptance of the nomination, and at the end of his four years retired to private life. Mr. Tyler's administration had been a stormy one, as the many cabinet changes sufficiently indicate. Sincere in his attachment to the Whig party, he was no sooner surrounded by its leaders, than he saw that the policy they would have dictated was one not for the country's interests. However painful his position was made by that knowledge, however much his consequent actions, necessarily antagonistic to party ends, were condemned, he was faithful to his own more statesmanlike views. In less than twenty years his course was justified. In less than twenty years the party he had endeavored to hold in check had become, under another name, a party bent upon plunging the country into civil war. In February, 1861, he presided over the Peace Congress which was convened in Washington, pursuant to a call from the Legislature of Virginia, but he had no hope of good results from its deliberations. In a public speech in Richmond, Virginia, the day following that on which the Congress closed its session, he stated that the South had nothing to hope, but in separation. Acting upon his convictions, Mr. Tyler renounced his allegiance to the government, and entered upon active labors in behalf of the Southern Confederacy. He was one of the committee who, in April, 1861, transferred to the service of the Confederate government, the military forces of Virginia, and when the seat of that government was established at Richmond, Virginia, he was a member of its Congress. In that capacity he was serving when his death occurred. ZACHARY TAYLOR, Twelfth President of the United States, was born November 24, 1784, and died July 9, 1850, aged 66 years. His birth was in Orange county, Virginia, and he was a son of Colonel Richard and Sarah (Strothers) Taylor, both parents of eminent Virginia families. The Virginian Taylors were allied to the oldest and most distinguished families in that State—the Madisons, the Lees, the Pendletons, the Barbours, the Conways, the Gaineses, the Hunts, the Taliaferros. But the character of our twelfth President seems to have been largely determined by the rude border life in which his childhood and youth were passed. Battling with the hardships and dangers of frontier life, rather than Virginia cultivation, stamped the character of him who was to be known as "Old Rough and Ready." In 1785, Colonel Taylor settled with his little family in Kentucky, in what is now Jefferson county, two miles from the Ohio river, and five miles from the present site of Louisville. Here young Zachary grew to manhood, his earlier years spent in the acquisition of such book knowledge as could be obtained; and his time, when he had grown old enough and strong enough, given to the actual labors of the farm, where he worked with his father until he was nearly twenty-four years old. His book learning was confined to a knowledge of reading, writing, spelling, and plain arithmetic, but during his boyhood's days he also acquired a love for military life from the many border skirmishes with the Indians of which he was a spectator, or in which he participated. His instructor in the arts of warfare was one Whetsel, a noted border character, who taught young Taylor how to load and "fire running." The latter accomplishment Taylor never availed himself of. May 3, 1808, Zachary Taylor received a commission as first lieutenant in the 7th United States Infantry, and his regiment marched under Harrison in his expedition against the Indians of the Northwest. Taylor was now in active service until the close of the second war with England. In the beginning of the year 1812, President Madison commissioned him captain, and he was placed in command of Fort Harrison, on the Wabash. Here he achieved the first of those brilliant victories which in after years formulated the axiom, "Taylor never surrenders," on which his soldiers enthusiastically relied. On the night of September 4, 1812, a band of 400 Indians fell upon the fort, expecting to surprise it and massacre its garrison. They succeeded, in the first onslaught, in firing the block-house, in which the garrison's stock of whisky was stored, and it burned with uncontrollable fury. Captain Taylor, then only twenty-eight years of age, found himself shut up in a burning fort, with 400 savages outside its walls, and only fifty men at his command, twenty-six of them sick with malarial fever, and unfitted for duty. He calmed the women and children, encouraged the men, directed the control of the flames, held the fort and defeated the enemy. For this victory he was brevetted major by President Madison. In 1816, Major Taylor was ordered to Green Bay, and remained in command of that post for two years. Then returning to Kentucky he passed one year with his family, and was then ordered to New Orleans. In 1822 he superintended the erection of Fort Jesup; in 1824 was in the recruiting service, then ordered to Washington, and thence to the South again. He had been made lieutenant-colonel in 1819, and in 1832 was promoted to the rank of colonel. The contest known as the "Black Hawk War" opened in 1832, and Colonel Taylor commanded the expedition which resulted in the defeat and capture of Black Hawk. His military decision was shown in this campaign by his control of his own troops, as much as by his action against the enemy. The pursuit of Black Hawk's band had brought the troops to Rock River, the northwestern boundary of Illinois. Here the militia, called out (as they claimed) to defend their State, considered their services ended. The orders of Taylor were to continue the pursuit with his "full army." The militia held a sort of town meeting, at which Taylor was present. Deceived by his quiet manner, the leaders of the movement for disbanding grew insolent, and the spirit of mutiny was augmented by their inflammatory speeches. When Taylor had listened to several of these gentlemen, his own speech was ready: "Gentlemen, the word has been passed on to me from Washington to follow Black Hawk, and to take you with me as soldiers. I mean to do both. There are the flat boats drawn up on the shore, and here are Uncle Sam's men drawn up behind you on the prairie." The militia did not disband that day. After the Black Hawk war, Colonel Taylor was in command at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien, where he remained until, in 1836, his services were required in Florida in the Seminole war. In Florida he won the battle of Okee-chobee, January, 1838, and was promoted to brigadier-general. In April, 1838, he was appointed to the command of the Florida troops, and continued in that responsible position until he was relieved in April, 1840, at his own request. He was at once appointed to the command of the army of the southwest, which comprehended the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, with headquarters at Fort Jesup, in the latter State. The annexation of Texas, in 1845, and the consequent war with Mexico, next called General Taylor into active service. He was ordered to the frontier of Texas, and made his headquarters on the Rio Grande del Norte. The war which followed terminated in success to the American arms and independence for Texas, and recorded the name of General Taylor as victor at Palo Alto, Reseca de la Palma, Monterey and Beuna Vista. The battle of Beuna Vista was the last in which General Taylor engaged. He returned to his home, now in his 63d year, to find that a portion of the people desired to reward his services by making him the chief magistrate of the nation. His own views upon accepting the honor tendered him were expressed in a letter written before he left the seat of war. He desired to be "elected by the general voice of the people, without regard to their political differences." His want of knowledge of party politics is explained, however, in the same letter. He says: "I have never yet exercised the privilege of voting." The soldier had been too busy all his life fighting for all America, to interest himself in any sectional or party question. He was nominated by the Whig convention at Baltimore, June 7, 1848, and elected in the November following. His opponent was Lewis Cass, of Michigan, and the electoral vote stood: Taylor, 163; Cass, 127. The inaugural ceremonies were observed March 5, 1849, the 4th of March that year falling upon Sunday. His administration of affairs extended over very little more than a year, and was principally occupied in long debates over the adjustment of the questions connected with the new territory of the United States. July 4, 1850, President Taylor attended some national demonstrations in honor of the day, in his usual health and spirits. In the evening, while overheated, he partook freely of fruits and iced water and milk. Within an hour he was seized with cramps which took the form of violent cholera morbus, and after lingering in terrible pain until the end, death supervened at 1 p. m., July 9th. Taylor married in 1810, and the wife of forty years knelt at his death-bed with their weeping children about her, and his last unintelligible word was an effort to speak to her once more. Of the four children born of their union, three survived him and were present at his death-bed, his only son, Colonel Taylor, and two daughters. One of his sons-in-law was Jefferson Davis, who had served under him in Mexico, and later became the president of the Confederate States. The death of President Taylor was widely mourned; the people, who held him second only to Washington, mourned a popular hero; the army mourned "Old Rough and Ready." The loss to the Nation was the loss of a sincere patriot and an honest man. A man of application as well as of military genius, he has left an enduring record. GOVERNOR FITZHUGH LEE. If there be aught of assurance of, and incitation to, worthy exemplification in a heritage of lineal record of honor and dutiful action, then might confidence have been held in the career of Fitzhugh Lee, in whom is united the blood of patriots, whose names and deeds are indissolubly and imperishably connected with the history of our Union and of Virginia. Fitzhugh Lee (or Fitz Lee, as he was familiarly styled in the army, and is still popularly known, and as he subscribed himself until recently), son of Commodore Sydney Smith Lee (a brother of General Robert E. Lee), late of the Confederate States navy, and formerly of the United States navy, was born at "Clermont," the seat of his grandfather, General John Mason, in Fairfax County, Va., November 19, 1835. His mother, Anne Mason, was the granddaughter of George Mason, of "Gunston Hall," the author of the Virginia Bill of Rights. She was the sister of Hon. James Murray Mason, of Mason and Slidell fame. The family name of Fitzhugh has been held in cherished recognition in Virginia for two centuries. Fitzhugh Lee was appointed a cadet at large to West Point Military Academy, July 1, 1852, and was graduated July 1, 1856, and appointed brevet second lieutenant of United States cavalry. Among his class graduates were Generals Samuel S. Carroll, W. P. Sanders, J. W. Forsyth, George D. Bayard, Herman Biggs, Francis M. Vinton, Orlando M. Poe, Miles D. McAllister and John K. Mozart, of the Federal Army, and Generals Wm. H. ("Mudwall") Jackson and L. L. Lomax, of the Confederate army. His first service was in the cavalry school at Carlisle, Pa., where he remained until January 1, 1858, when, at his own request, he was assigned to duty with his regiment, the Second Cavalry, on frontier service; was at Forts Inge and Mason, and Camp Radminezbec, Texas, scouting against the Indians; on May 13, 1859, in a combat in Nescatunga Valley, Texas, with the Comanches, was shot through the lungs with an arrow and his life despaired of; later, at Camps Cooper and Colorado, Texas, near the last of which was engaged in a hand to hand combat with the Comanche Indians; in November, 1860, was detached from his regiment and ordered to report to West Point as instructor of cavalry, a complimentary detail. Under his tuition there were several who were subsequently famous as cavalry officers—Generals Kilpatrick and Custer being among them; promoted first lieutenant of cavalry March 31, 1861; resigned his commission May 31, 1861, and offered his services to his native state. His first service in the Confederate States army was in the Adjutant-General's department, under General Beauregard at Manassas, and in the battle of July 21, 1861, he served on the staff of General Ewell. In September following he was, upon the recommendation of General Joseph E. Johnston (then in command of the army) and General J. E. B. Stuart, commanding its cavalry, made lieutenant-colonel of the First Virginia Cavalry (Stuart's old regiment), and at the reorganization of that command in April, 1862, near Yorktown, he was elected colonel. On the retreat from Yorktown, Lee's regiment was given the duty of watching York river, and it was he who first gave information of the flanking movement of Franklin, and of his locating at Barhamsville. Lee personally reconnoitered so close to the enemy that he was enabled to give not only the number but the names of their gunboats and transports. In the succeeding operations around Richmond, Lee was with the command of General Stuart, and participated in all of the enterprises of that officer. About the middle of June, 1862, Stuart executed his famous raid around the army of McClellan as it lay in front of Richmond, and Lee, with his regiment, was selected to accompany him, sharing with one other regiment and a battalion the hazards of that feat, which "blazed the way for Jackson's subsequent flank movement." After the battles around Richmond more cavalry was brought from southern states and formed into a second brigade under General Wade Hampton, and Stuart was promoted to the rank of major-general and assigned to the command of the division, Lee being promoted to brigadier-general and to the command of Stuart's old brigade, composed of the 1st, 3d, 4th, 5th and 9th regiments of Virginia cavalry, with a battery of horse artillery under Captain James Bunthed. In the latter part of 1863 the cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia was divided into two divisions of three brigades each, and Hampton and Lee promoted to command them, the two being under Stuart as senior major-general. The skill and courage evinced by Fitz Lee occasioned the repeated mention of his name in the exact reports of the commander-in-chief of the Army of Northern Virginia, made it familiar to the public, and the latter, in May, 1863, soon after the battle of Chancellorsville, in a letter, thus warmly commended him: "Your admirable conduct, devotion to the cause of your country, and devotion to duty, fill me with pleasure. I hope you will soon see her efforts for independence crowned with success, and long live to enjoy the affection and gratitude of your country." Again, he wrote: "Your division has always had a high reputation. It must not lose it." In the disastrous battle of Winchester Fitz Lee was conspicuous in his gallantry, exposing himself in every part of the field. Three horses were shot under him, one his beautiful mare, Nelly Gray, a favorite of the command, and at last he was brought to ground by a minie-ball which pierced his thigh. He was kept from duty by this wound for several months. In the spring of 1865 he was summoned to Richmond, and, by order of the commanding general, placed in command of the cavalry corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. He was one of the three corps commanders (the others being Gordon and Longstreet) who, with General Robert E. Lee, composed the council of war just before the surrender at Appomatox C. H., April 9, 1865. The cavalry, having cut their way through the enemy's lines, to save their horses, before the surrender, General Fitz Lee, thus without a command, remained to share with his loved commander and relative the cares and trials of the bitter closing act of a resplendent drama. The war over, he turned his attention as earnestly to a peaceful vocation as he had been devoted in arms, and is said to have literally put "his hands to the plough." He first farmed at "Richland," in Stafford county, and later near Alexandria, Va. Accepting the result of the war, General Lee endeavored by genial influence to aid as far as in him lay the fraternization of the late contending sections, and in his utterances and engaging presence, it is claimed, has accomplished much in the cause of conciliation. His address at the Bunker Hill Centennial was widely commended. At the Yorktown Centennial in 1881 he was a conspicuous figure. At the inauguration of President Cleveland he commanded the Virginia Brigade, and received a continuous and enthusiastic recognition. In several visits north and the west since, he has been welcomed with the utmost cordiality. On November 3, 1885, he was elected Governor of Virginia over the republican nominee, John Sargeant Wise, by a majority of about sixteen thousand, and took his seat January 1, 1886. The administration of Governor Lee, which has comprehended a serious wrangle by the English bondholders over the state debt, has been conservative and generally judicious. Governor Lee was urged as an available candidate for the nomination of Vice-President by the late National Democratic Convention. Governor Lee has a bright blue eye, and is of genial presence. Rather below medium stature, and originally of slight physique, he has developed into a figure, Napoleonic in bulk. He is happily married, and has an engaging household. He married Miss Ellen Bernard, daughter of George Fowle, Esq., of Alexandria, Va., and has five children: Ellen Fowle, Fitzhugh, George Dashiell, Nannie Fitzhugh and Virginia, the last named after the state, having been born in the gubernatorial mansion. R. A. BROCK. Robert Alonzo Brock, eldest son and child of Robert King and Elizabeth Mildred (Ragland) Brock, was born in Richmond, Va., March 9, 1839. His parents were both natives of Hanover County, Va., and his ancestors were among the early settlers of the colony, although in him is intermingled the blood of several nationalities. His father, long a respected merchant of Richmond, was the son of John Philip and Elizabeth (daughter of Alexander King) Brock, and his mother the daughter of Fendall and Sarah (Nelson) Ragland, the granddaughter of Pettus and Elizabeth (daughter of John Davis, from Wales) Ragland, and great-granddaughter of John and Anne (Beaufort) Ragland, from Glamorganshire, Wales. The latter, with sons and daughters, settled in that portion of New Kent which was subsequently Hanover county, about 1720, and patented several thousand acres of land, which descended to his children. R. A. Brock, although possessed of antiquarian tastes from childhood, was bred to mercantile pursuits, and, following the conclusion of the late war between the states, was so engaged until August, 1881, when he disposed of his interests to give more attention to the Virginia Historical Society, of which he has been corresponding secretary and librarian since February, 1875. He has been a frequent contributor to the press and magazines since boyhood; was one of the editors of the Richmond Standard, a select family paper, with departments of science, history, genealogy, etc., from 1879 to 1882; has edited seven volumes of the new series of the "Virginia Historical Collections," published by the Virginia Historical Society, and one volume of the "Papers" of the Southern Historical Society (of which he has been the secretary since July, 1887), and other historical, antiquarian and genealogical works, besides contributions to standard works, and preparing various statistical and historical papers for the United States Government, and his native state and city. The labors of Mr. Brock have met gratifying recognition in accorded membership in many learned bodies in the United States, Canada and Europe—about two-score in number. Solicitous to aid, as far as his ability has admitted, in the general advancement of intelligence, he has cheerfully met inquiry until his extended correspondence, although a great pleasure, has become an onerous tax upon his time. He married, April 29, 1869, Sallie Kidd, daughter of Richardson Tyree and Margaret Mills (Watt, said to be of the family of the celebrated James Watt) Haw, of Hanover county. She died February 6, 1887, leaving two daughters, Elizabeth Carrington and Anne Beaufort, who compose their father's household. In the late deplorable war between the states of our Union Mr. Brock served in defense of his section, entering the service of the Confederate States with "F" company, a select body from Richmond, which shared the fortunes of the Army of Northern Virginia, to the surrender at Appomattox C. H., April 9, 1865, and whose ranks furnished it many officers from the grade of subaltern to that of general. A few survivors are banded together as "F" Company Association, of which Mr. Brock is the secretary and historiographer. He is also a member of several secret and benevolent orders, among them that of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. His lodge, Richmond Lodge, No. 10 (of which he is historiographer), is the oldest in the city, having been chartered December 29, 1780. Its membership has comprised some of the most illustrious of Virginia and of the Union. Quiet and retiring by nature, and simple in his habits, Mr. Brock, occupied with his pursuits, has never sought political station, but his efforts, as in him reasonably lay, have always been earnest in what his judgment deemed best for the sustenance of the interests of Virginia and the weal of the nation. He is of robust physique, and six feet in stature. MAJOR WILLIAM T. SUTHERLIN. The Sutherlin family have long been among the honored residents of Pittsylvania county. George S. Sutherlin, now deceased, the father of Major Sutherlin, was born near Danville, Virginia. His mother, Polly S. Norman, was born in Henry county, Virginia. He was born on his father's estate, near Danville, on April 7, 1822. At Greensboro, North Carolina, October 18, 1849, he married Jane E. Patrick, who was born in North Carolina, Sept. 11, 1829. Two daughters were born to them, Janie Lindsay and Martha Ella. Both are now deceased, the latter dying in infancy. Mrs. Sutherlin is the daughter of William and Martha W. (Dict) Patrick, formerly of North Carolina, now deceased. Janie Lindsay, their eldest daughter, grew up into a beautiful and accomplished woman, whose lovely character endeared her to all who knew her. She was born January 24, 1851, and died in Danville, Virginia, August 24, 1876, and a beautiful monument marks the spot in Greenwood cemetery, where she is buried. She was the mother of three children, two died in infancy, and one, Janie Sutherlin Smith, whose home has been with her grandparents in Danville since the death of her mother, is now a school-girl, and promises to make an accomplished and useful woman. November 22, 1871, she married Col. Francis L. Smith, of Alexandria, Virginia, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute. He went with the corps of cadets into the late war, and received in his first battle a severe wound in the neck. Besides filling other important positions, he has been a member of the State Senate, and is now one of the leading lawyers in the State. Major Sutherlin's earliest education was received in a home school, after which he went to the male academy in Danville three years, then to the private school of Joseph Godfrey, in Franklin county, Virginia. Until twenty-one years of age he remained on his father's estate, then he entered into trade as a dealer in tobacco. From 1846 to the opening of the war, he was a manufacturer of tobacco in Danville, and one of the most successful managers of business of that day. He was mayor of Danville from 1855 to 1861, and was a delegate to the Virginia Convention which adopted the Ordinance of Secession. He at once entered the Confederate States Army, but, owing to impaired health, was unable for field duty, and received appointment as commandant of the post at Danville. Later he was also made chief quartermaster for the said post, and he served till near the close of the war, when his increasing ill health necessitated his giving up all official duties. The winter after the close of the war he went to Cuba for his health, and was greatly improved, when he returned to Danville where he has ever since been engaged in agricultural pursuits, and the development of his State and section, living at his beautiful home, which is accounted the most pleasant residence location in Danville, if not in the State. Major Sutherlin was elected early in the war a member of the Board of Public Works. He served two years in the legislature since the war. Was a prominent director in the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad for near fifteen years. He has built two railroads, the Milton &amp; Sutherlin and the Danville &amp; New River, and it is generally conceded that neither would have been built but for his energy and ability. He has been prominent in building up most of the enterprises in Danville for the past forty years, and contributed liberally of his time and means to secure them. It was mainly through his sagacity and efforts that Roman Eagle Lodge of Masons now owns its large and elegant building, and is one of the wealthiest lodges in the State. It was through him that the first agricultural society and fair was held in the South after the war, in Danville, which was successfully kept up for several years. When the Virginia State Agricultural Society was reorganized after the war, he was unanimously elected its president and held the office for two years, and it was chiefly through his untiring efforts that the Society was placed upon a basis of success. He secured a charter and established the Danville Bank, and its capital at the breaking out of the war was three hundred thousand dollars. He was a very large stockholder and the only president the bank ever had. It was chiefly through his efforts that the Border Grange Bank at Danville was established, and he was its first president. He has been a liberal contributor to the establishment and maintenance of his church (Methodist) in all her enterprises. He is a trustee of Randolph-Macon College, and has contributed liberally to its support. He was a large contributor to the college for young ladies in Danville, and was the first President of the Board of Directors. His generous liberality has been continuous all through life, never withholding his support from any worthy enterprise either in church or State. He has often been prominently spoken of for Governor of the State, and member of Congress from his district, but belonging to that class of politicians who think the office should seek the man, and not the man the office, he has been content to serve his party, and not push his own claims for office. Major Sutherlin is a clear and forcible writer, and has written many valuable and interesting papers which have found a large circulation through the press of the country. As a public speaker he is forcible, practical and strong, especially in debate, generally getting the best of his opponent. As an enterprising, practical business man, there is no one in Virginia who stands higher in the estimation of the people generally throughout the State than Major Sutherlin. GEN. V. D. GRONER. General Groner was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on September 7, 1836. He married, in New Orleans, Louisiana, in April, 1866, Katherine Campbell, who was born in Mobile, Alabama, and who was a daughter of Justice John A. Campbell, formerly a Judge of the United States Supreme Court, and who, during the Confederacy, was associated with Vice-President A. H. Stephens, and Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, Senator from Virginia, as commissioners to meet President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward, at Hampton Roads, just before the close of the war. Their children are three sons: John A. C., Duncan Lawrence and Robert Newell. At the age of eighteen the subject of this sketch, who had previously graduated at the Norfolk Military Academy, organized a military company, known as the "Independent Greys," and in the succeeding year he was made lieutenant-colonel of a regiment of Virginia militia, at Norfolk. After studying law one year, he entered into a business life, and was two years agent for an express company, then for a time in the employ of the New York &amp; Virginia Steamship Co. In 1859 he went to Texas, where he was the guest of Gen. Sam Houston. There he tendered his services to Baylor's Texan Rangers, and assisted in subduing the Comanche Indians, and other hostile tribes. On the election of Lincoln, he left Texas with the intention of returning to Virginia, but at the request of Governor Pettus of Mississippi he went to New York, and performed the delicate and valuable service of purchasing and shipping arms for Mississippi. This accomplished he returned to Virginia, and perfected a secret organization for the capture of Fortress Monroe, which would have been successfully accomplished but for the interference of Governor Letcher. He then returned to Mississippi, and was tendered commission as adjutant-general of Mississippi by Governor Pettus, which commission he declined. Going to Montgomery he was commissioned and appointed captain and assistant-adjutant general of the regular Confederate States Army, and assigned to duty at the seat of government, the fifth military appointment made by the new government. He remained in this service at Montgomery and in Richmond until after the first battle around the latter city, when he was directed to take charge of the archives of the government, which he removed by canal, in the direction of Lynchburg. During this trip the James River overflowed, and when its waters receded the canal banks were washed out. Knowing the importance of this feeder for supplying troops at Richmond, General Groner appealed for aid to the farmers, and by the labor they furnished, had the canal thoroughly repaired in twenty-four hours, a work for which he was warmly commended by the President of the Canal to President Jefferson Davis. While the second battle around Richmond was being fought, he reported on the field to General R. E. Lee, with whom he remained until after Malvern Hill battle. As a part of his service in the Adjutant Department, he had charge of the Organization Bureau, and the entire Confederate Army, so far, had been organized through his office. Desirous of more active service, he was now assigned to the 59th North Carolina Cavalry, with headquarters at Franklin, Virginia, and with this regiment he was engaged in the fighting around Suffolk. At the time the Army of Northern Virginia was in Maryland, he was made colonel of the 61st Virginia Infantry, and took charge of the same at Warrenton, Virginia, defending the bridges both at Warrenton and at Rappahannock Station. When Lee's Army moved back from Maryland into Virginia, General Groner was ordered to Fredericksburg, his command then consisting of his own regiment, the Norfolk Blues Battery, and a Mississippi Battery, to which, after he reached Fredericksburg, a portion of Ball's Regiment of Virginia Cavalry and a Battalion of Mississippians were added. Arriving in Fredericksburg, he took possession at Falmouth Ford, just as Burnside's Army reached the opposite shore. He at once engaged in an artillery duel, so defending the fort until Lee's Army reached Fredericksburg, two days later. Shortly after, his regiment was assigned to Mahone's Brigade, with which he took part in all the subsequent gallant fighting of the Army of Northern Virginia, except when absent some two months with severe wounds received at Spotsylvania Court House. While yet on crutches, he rejoined the army around Petersburg, and engaged in battles there when he had to be assisted to mount his horse, his wound preventing the use of his limb. In a number of battles he commanded the brigade. He surrendered at Appomattox Court House. After the war was ended he returned for a short time to his home in Norfolk, then went to New York City, where he and Gen. Joe Davis (nephew of President Davis) were together some months. He then for a time accepted the management of a steamship line running between Virginia and New York, then was a short time general agent at Norfolk for the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg R. R., and was then appointed general agent of the Merchants' &amp; Miners' Transportation Co., a position he has ably filled ever since. During reconstruction periods, General Groner was a zealous conservative, and he was largely instrumental in the election of Hon. Gilbert C. Walker to the Governorship, and received from him tender of commission as State adjutant-general, and also the tender of post of private secretary, both of which he declined. He was once candidate for Governor of Virginia, and has been several times endorsed by his city for United States Senator. He was president of both branches of the Norfolk City Council from the re-organization of the city government, after the war, to about 1880. During his administration, the bonds of the city appreciated from 47 to 107, and he was instrumental in saving the city a large amount of interest, for which, as well as for other acts in the interest of the city, he was, and still is, held in high esteem. General Groner gives little attention to politics, being immersed in business, holding the following positions, at once onerous and honorable: President of the National Compress Association; President of the Steamship Line run by this Association between Norfolk and Liverpool; General Agent of the Merchants' &amp; Miners' Transportation Company, running steamers to Boston and Providence; General Manager of the Washington Lines, running daily boats between Washington City and Norfolk; and actively engaged in many other enterprises. Norfolk as a shipping port is greatly indebted to him. HON. ALEXANDER DONNAN. Alexander Donnan was born in Galloway Shire, Scotland, on May 21, 1818, the son of David and Mary (Stewart) Donnan. The same year his parents came to America and made their home in Petersburg, Virginia. Both were born in Galloway Shire, Scotland. Alexander went to school in Petersburg to Young D. Perkins; to the Public School then taught by Minton Thrift; then to Jonathan Smith; then to the University of Virginia, session of 1839-40. He studied law under David May, brother of Judge John Fitzhugh May, and in May, 1840, commenced practice, which he has followed continuously since that date. He is senior member of the firm of Donnan &amp; Hamilton. During the late war, being a member of the City Council, he performed local duty at Petersburg.

He had three horses shot under him, was himself several times struck, but never seriously wounded. Two reminiscences of his service are of much interest, and are as follows: At the capture of Harper's Ferry he was assigned to a pass on Loudoun Heights, in the Signal Service, and this being an intermediate station, Gen. Jackson's order of attack was sent over its line to Maryland Heights. This order covered nearly one page of legal cap paper, and from the time it was begun at Jackson's headquarters till it was completed at the Maryland Heights end of the line only five minutes elapsed. Gen. Jackson warmly complimented the Signal Service for this efficiency. The distance to have delivered the order by courier would have been twenty miles, causing dangerous delay. From Harper's Ferry Capt. Adams went to Sharpsburg, where with the Third Corps he went into immediate action, the Corps going in on the Confederate right, which had just been turned by Burnside, and hurling him back with great loss. Capt. Adams had one brother in the service. After the close of the war, the first business in which Capt. Adams engaged was coal and lumber and coal mining in the Alleghany mountains.

Mr. Goodwin entered the Confederate States Army as first sergeant of the Mobile Rifles, which became Company K, 3d Alabama regiment. With this he was in active service, under Gens. Jones M. Withers, Braxton Bragg, and Joseph E. Johnston, until transferred to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, under Col. R. L. Owen. From that time to the close of the war he served the Confederate States government as superintendent of this road.

MAX GUGGENHEIMER The subject of this sketch was born in Bavaria, Germany, on May 19, 1842, the son of Sigmund and Clara Guggenheimer. His father died in 1844, aged 36 years. On June 13, 1888, his mother completed the 73d year of her life. The Virginia branch of the Guggenheimer family settled in this State in 1838. Max Guggenheimer landed in New York City in August, 1856. He came at once to Lynchburg, arriving August 20th. His purpose in coming to America was to study thoroughly here the English language, and his intention then was to return to Germany in a year or two. He at once entered Mr. Reed's private school, which he attended about eighteen months, keeping books for his brother-in-law during this time, evenings. Leaving school then he became clerk and bookkeeper for his brother-in-law, who was carrying on a dry goods business in Lynchburg, and so continued until the war began. He then, at age of nineteen years, went into service in the Lynchburg Home Guards, April 23, 1861, and was with this company until discharged in the fall of 1862, on account of disability. He went to Chattanooga, whence he returned in 1863, since which time he has remained in Lynchburg. Immediately after the close of the war, he entered into partnership with his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Guggenheimer, in a dry goods business established by the latter in 1842. The brother-in-law being unfitted by sickness to transact business, Max became its head, and Nathaniel dying on January 16, 1866, Max has also been the head of the family since that date, the family consisting of the widow of Nathaniel and her five children. The business of which he is the head has been one of vast proportions and constant increase since that date. The largest amount of sales of the old firm was $40,000 in 1860; to-day it is known as the largest wholesale house in the State. When the retail trade had reached a business of $200,000 it was given up that the attention of the firm might be given entirely to its growing wholesale trade, Mr. Guggenheimer understanding, as far back as 1868, that Lynchburg was geographically located to do a good and healthy distributing trade. In 1870 wholesale boots and shoes was added to the dry goods department. In 1876, on account of the great extent of the dry goods business, Mr. Guggenheimer retired from the shoe business, and with special capital, started, in conjunction with two gentlemen from Baltimore, the first exclusive wholesale shoe house in the city. He retired from this firm in July, 1887, and in June, 1888, opened the second exclusive wholesale shoe house. He had a younger brother who was a short time in service during the late war, in a Lynchburg battery, and Maurice Guggenheimer, his cousin, served through the war in the 2d Virginia Artillery, dying in March, 1885. The wife of Mr. Guggenheimer, Bertha V., daughter of M. Rosenbaum, was born in Richmond, Virginia, in December, 1857. They were married by a Jewish Rabbi of Baltimore, and have one daughter, Cecile Isabelle, born October 23, 1877. The father of Mrs. Guggenheimer was born in Wurtburg, Bavaria, Germany, her mother in Richmond, Virginia. Mr. Guggenheimer was a member of the city council in 1879 and 1880, chairman of its finance committee; resigned in February, 1881. He has been president of the opera company; president of the Jewish Congregation; director of the Lynchburg National Bank. JAMES MADISON IRWIN.

He founded his business in Culpeper, Virginia, in 1854, and continued in business there until his removal, in 1881, to Lynchburg. In 1882 he admitted to partnership his son, J. B. Johnson. A long record of more than thirty years strictly honorable business dealings, combined with unsurpassed excellence in goods manufactured and dealt in, has given the present firm a reputation and a business that is no unimportant factor in the reputation of Lynchburg as a commercial center of the South. The wholesale, retail and manufacturing departments of the house are filled with orders representing every State of the South as well as Virginia; and as far as Massachusetts on the north, Colorado and Mexico to the west and southwest, the well tested goods of this firm command a market, which competitors in other localities are not able to draw away from Lynchburg. The firm supplies all the colleges of the South with medals, badges, etc., and makes a specialty of engraving monograms, and other designs, catalogues of which are furnished on application. Other specialties of the firm are diamonds, watches, clocks, silver and plated ware, spectacles and eye-glasses, gold and silver-headed canes and umbrellas.

He is of English descent, his grandfather coming to America before the Revolutionary war, in which he was a soldier of the Continental army, and also serving in the war of 1812, with rank of major. Judge Nowlin entered the Confederate States Army on April 23, 1861, in Company G, (Old Home Guard of Lynchburg), 11th Virginia Infantry. He was with his regiment in the fights of July 18 and 21, 1861, and in the battle of Williamsburg, May 5, 1862, where he was badly wounded and captured. He was taken a prisoner to Washington, D. C., and confined in the "Old Capitol Building," about six months. Was exchanged among the first prisoners, but never again able for field duty on account of wound. He was on local military duty from that time to the close of the war, and took part in the defense of Lynchburg when it was attacked by Hunter. In 1867 he graduated in law, and began practice. In 1872 removed to Texas, where he remained twelve years. He was appointed district judge of the Denton district, Texas, by Gov. Roberts of Texas; served a number of years and resigned; served two years as city attorney of Dallas; returned to Virginia in 1883, and is now attorney for the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad. In Campbell county he married Lutu M. Nowlin, of Virginia, Rev. Jos. Spriggs uniting them, and they have three children: Percy V., Elmo P., and Viva M. COL. KIRKWOOD OTEY Was born in Lynchburg, October 19, 1829; was graduated at the Virginia Military Institute in July, 1849; enlisted in the same year in the Virginia Volunteer Militia, serving until April 23, 1861, when he was mustered into service at Richmond as First Lieutenant of Company G, 11th regiment, C. S. A. He served through the war, rising to the command of the regiment, and was twice severely wounded: first, in the last day's fighting at Gettysburg, in the famous charge of Pickett's Division; again at Drurys Bluff, May 16, 1864, the latter wound permanently disabling him from active service in the field. After the close of the war he assisted in the reorganization of the Lynchburg Home Guards, the company with which he entered service in the war becoming Company E, 3d Virginia Regiment. With this he has ever since been connected, and is now captain, constituting altogether, except two brief intervals, an almost uninterrupted military service of forty-three years. He is present commander of Camp Samuel Garland, Confederate Veterans, of Lynchburg. Col. Otey is serving as auditor of the city of Lynchburg at the present time. He married, February 19, 1862, Lucy Dabney Norvell, daughter of Fayette H. and Mary C. (Roane) Norvell, born at Trenton, Tennessee, January 14, 1845. They have three children living: John M., born February 5, 1866; Norvell, born November 17, 1872; Kirkwood, jr., born March 3, 1884. Their first-born was a daughter, Mina Gaston, born February 23, 1863, died August 12, 1879. The paternal grandfather of Col. Otey was Major Isaac Otey, of Bedford county, Virginia, who ably represented that tier of counties of which Bedford is one, in the Senate of Virginia for thirty years. The family of Col. Otey was of essentially military stock, adding well-earned laurels for the name in the late war. Of seven brothers and the only brother-in-law in the family, all entered the Confederate States Army at its first call for troops, and served through the war, or were killed or died in the service. An extract from a Lynchburg paper published in the Spring of 1861, the article entitled "A Military Family," shows this and is worthy of perpetuation here. It reads: The family of the late Capt. John M. Otey of Lynchburg are all in active service, as follows: Dexter Otey, first lieutenant of a cavalry company, Lynchburg; Van. R. Otey, member of the same company; John Stewart Walker (son-in-law), captain of the Virginia Life Guards, at Yorktown; Kirk Otey, captain of a Lynchburg company at Manassas Junction; Hays Otey, first lieutenant in provisional army at Norfolk; Gaston Otey, first lieutenant in provisional army at Yorktown; John M. Otey, second lieutenant in provisional army under Col. Cocke at Manassas; Peter J. Otey, second lieutenant provisional army at Sewells Point, fired the first gun in response to the salutations of Lincoln's vessels. All of these gentlemen, we believe, have the advantage of a military education, one served in Mexico, and four were at Harpers Ferry and Charlestown. We may mention the fact that twenty years ago, Captain John M. Otey, father of the seven above named, and father-in-law of the other, at a time of profound peace, and when there was an absence of all military spirit, expressed the opinion that the boy who made himself the best soldier would be likely to find the most ready and useful employment before he had passed the maturity of manhood. He confirmed it by graduating five of them at the Virginia Military Institute, and tho' deprived by death of the pleasure and gratification 'twould have given him, his widow lived to see every one of them in the active military service of her beloved Southern country, not even detailing one of them to remain at home as her "Safe-Guard." The further service in the field of Col. Kirkwood Otey has just been given; that of Major Peter J. Otey is in the sketch following this. Of the others the record is: Dexter, lieutenant in the Wise troop, died in 1863; Van. R., lieutenant Company B, 2d Virginia Cavalry, rendered unfit for field service by sickness contracted in army, made provost marshal at Lynchburg, and died in 1864; Gaston, captain of the Otey Battery, wounded and died in Lynchburg in 1863; W. H. (Hays), adjutant of the 56th Virginia regiment, subsequently captain of ordnance; Col. John M., on staff duty, assigned to Gen. Beauregard's staff at Manassas in 1861, served with him until after battle of Shiloh, subsequently with Gens. Bragg and Joseph E. Johnston in their western campaigns, returned to Gen. Beauregard at Charleston, and surrendered at Greensboro, N. C., in 1865, and paroled by Gen. Sherman. Major John Stewart Walker (Col. Otey's brother-in-law) raised and chiefly out of his private means armed and equipped, the Virginia Life Guards of Richmond, was promoted major of the 15th Virginia Infantry, and was in command of his regiment when killed in battle of Malvern Hill. The devoted mother of this family, Mrs. Lucy W. Otey, rendered service not less to be commemorated. She established, organized, and managed the Ladies' Confederate Hospital at Lynchburg (which was independent of the Confederate States Medical Department there), reporting direct to the Surgeon General's office, Richmond, Virginia. It was well known throughout the Confederacy through those who had been inmates thereof, and was in great measure maintained by those officers and soldiers who had experienced the kind attention, care and nursing of the officers and ladies of the hospital. John M. Otey, father of Col. Kirkwood Otey, was born Dec. 2, 1792, in Bedford County, Virginia, and died in Lynchburg, Feb. 3, 1859. He removed to Lynchburg at an early age, and was successively the Book-keeper, Teller and Cashier of the Bank of Virginia at that place, holding the latter position at his death. Was for 21 years a member of the City Council and for 18 years its president. His wife, Mrs. Lucy Wilhelmina Otey, daughter of Capt. William Norvell, was born Feb. 28, 1801, and died in May, 1866, in Richmond, Virginia. COL. PETER J. OTEY, One of the sons of the distinguished family whose military and family record has just been given, was born in Lynchburg. At Wytheville, Virginia, Father Walters officiating, he married Mallie, daughter of Benj. Rush Floyd, and granddaughter of the first Gov. John Floyd. Mrs. Otey's mother was Nannie S. Mathews, granddaughter of Gen. Smyth, member of Congress from Virginia. The record of the children of Col. and Mrs. Otey is: Mary, born March 4, 1866, now Mrs. Mitchell, living in Lynchburg; Nannie, born January 18, 1869, now Mrs. Miller, living in Lynchburg; Floyd, born June 7, 1872, and Nathalie F., born March 8, 1876, living at home; Peter J. jr., born July 21, 1879, died February 7, 1882; Charles Heald, born May 15, 1884, died same day. Col. Otey entered the Confederate States Army as lieutenant, April 19, 1861. On May 19 following, his was the hand that fired the first gun at Sewells Point, Virginia, the first gun fired after the declaration of war, and the first blood shed after the declaration was in the two hours engagement following, when the "Monticello," under command of Commodore Eagle, was repulsed. He served as adjutant in battles of Carnifax Ferry, Fayette C. H., Charleston, Montgomery Ferry, and Cotton Hill, all under Floyd and Loring; was assistant adjutant general battle of Fort Donelson; was major of 30th Virginia battalion, and commanded one wing of same in charge of Breckenridge on Siegel at New Market. There Col. Otey was wounded, having right arm shattered. Later was transferred to Early's command, participating in campaign of the Valley, succeeding Lieut. Col. Clark (who was disabled) in command of 30th Va. Battalion; commanded brigade in battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864; commanded battalion in battle of Waynesboro, March 2, 1865, and was there captured; held in Fort Delaware until released May 31, 1865.

CAPT. JOHN MEEM PAYNE Was born in Lynchburg on November 11, 1840, and was educated at the University of Virginia. From April 17, 1861, to May 4, 1865, he was in the military service of the Confederate States, entering service as first lieutenant of Company "C," Irish Battalion, Second Brigade, Jackson's Division. With this command he was in active service, taking part in all its engagements until after the battle of Fredericksburg. He was then appointed a captain in the Ordnance Corps C. S. A., and stationed first at Wilmington, then at Greensboro, North Carolina, where he was surrendered with Genl. Johnston's army. At "Walnut Grove" in Montgomery county, Virginia, on December 2, 1863, he married Elizabeth Allen Langhorne, who was born at "Edge Hill," Montgomery county, on December 20, 1842. Their children are six: Archer Langhorne, Robert Spotswood, John Meem, jr., Margaret Kent and Eliza M. Payne. The genealogy of the families of Capt. Payne and his wife is thus traced: Capt.

A portion of the family moved to Connecticut, where, in 1800, William Burgess was born. At six years of age, he moved with his parents to Central New York, locating in Herkimer county, where he grew to manhood, marrying in his nineteenth year Lois Harding, members of whose family had already moved to Kentucky; and in time connecting their name indissolubly with the history of that State. They raised a large family, seven sons living to manhood. In 1852, he with his wife and sons Lewis and Rush moved to Virginia, where he became interested in building the plank road from Petersburg to Boydton, purchasing from Mrs. Goodwyn a large plantation on Hatcher's Run, and erecting thereon large grist and saw mills, his sons Clark and John moving down shortly after their completion and uniting with him in business. These mills together with all other buildings were totally destroyed during the war, and the land torn up and rendered almost valueless by forts, breastworks, etc., for it was here that the "Battle of Hatcher's Run," or "Burgess' Mill," was fought. At the close of the war his son Clark rebuilt the place and restored it to its former usefulness. Here they spent nearly all the remaining years of their long lives; they now rest with their sons, David, William, John and Lewis (who was killed in battle), in old Blanford Cemetery. Clark Burgess was born in Herkimer county, New York, June 1, 1827; in his twenty-third year was married to Gertrude A. Walker, of the same county.

The war coming on, he remained at Richfield Springs and Herkimer until the close, when he discontinued business at the North, and moved his family to Virginia, where he rebuilt the old place on Hatcher's Run, and still lives enjoying the confidence and esteem of all who know him. Thomas Jay Burgess, son of Clark Burgess, and his wife, Emily A., was born in Herkimer county, New York, August 12, 1854. His early childhood was spent at the North and in Virginia, where after the war he removed with his parents, living with them until his twenty-fourth year, on the old place at Hatcher's Run. Becoming tired of country life he determined to study dentistry. Commencing with Dr. Sherman, near Petersburg, but remaining only a short time with him, he then went to Fredericksburg, Virginia, as a student of Dr. Jas. F. Thompson; from there, after a short time spent at home, he went to Saginaw City, Michigan, and engaged work in the office of Dr. W. P. Morgan. During his stay in Michigan, he took one year's course at the Dental School of the University, and the next year graduated at the Philadelphia Dental College. He commenced practice in Petersburg, Virginia, May 1, 1882, and has been very successful, enjoying a large and lucrative practice.

STEPHEN ALONZO JACKSON About 1762 Edward and John Jackson, brothers, left England for America. They lived for a few years near New Castle, Delaware, but having been with a scouting party to the little Kanawha, in Virginia, and being deeply impressed with the fertility of the soil and the abundance of game there, they concluded to remove to that region with their families. Consequently they came to Virginia just prior to the revolution, the families expecting to settle as neighbors. But upon arriving at the "Old Field," in Hampshire (now Hardy) county, Elizabeth Cummings, the wife of John Jackson, was for stopping there, and did stop, her superior size being a sufficient reason with her much smaller husband. She endeavored to pursuade Edward, and his wife Martha, to remain there with their families, but Edward asserted his right to decide for himself and those with him, and decided he was going on to Harrison county, unless scalped in the attempt, and went on, settling about four miles west of Clarksburg, where some of his descendants live to this day. John Jackson, after a short residence near the present site of Moorefield, moved his family to the Buckhannon river, in what is now Upshur county, West Virginia, and only about a day's journey from where his brother Edward had settled. Both Edward and John Jackson served in the Revolutionary war, and each had three sons in service, distinguished for bravery. One of these was Capt. Stephen Jackson, wounded in battle of Yorktown. The renowned and still lamented Confederate general, "Stonewall" Jackson, third cousin to Stephen Alonzo, was of this stock, inheriting the gentleness of his great grandfather, John, and the fire and bravery in time of danger of his great grandfather's brother, Edward.

The Hon. Minter Jackson married secondly, August 10, 1864, Isabella Holt Beattie, a grand daughter of Gen. John Beattie, who was a Comissary general under Gen. Washington in the Revolutionary war.

H. was four years old, lived at Burks Garden, and died on February 29, 1864. The maternal great great grandfather of Vint H. Thomas was Haynes Morgan, who with an only sister was brought from Wales to America when both were children. Their parents died soon after and their uncle raised them. Gen. Daniel Morgan of Revolutionary fame is believed to have been of this family. A son of this Haynes Morgan served in the French and Indian wars, also in the Revolutionary war, where he received the title of colonel, married Mary Thompson, sister of Col. Billy Thompson—the Thompsons a Virginia family. Haynes Morgan, son of—Morgan and his wife Mary, was born at Williamsburg, Virginia, in the time of the Revolution; was raised in Pittsylvania county, married a Miss Shelton, daughter of Vinton Shelton of Virginia, her mother a Robertson, who lived near Richmond, Virginia. Haynes Morgan moved to Roanoke county, North Carolina, in 1818, and raised his family there; he was a successful farmer. His daughter, Elizabeth Shelton, mother of Vint. H.

He is now a farmer and stockraiser of Washington county, near Saltville. THE TRIGG FAMILY. The Trigg family of Virginia are descendants of Abraham Trigg (who was the progenitor of the family in America), who emigrated from Cornwall, England, very early in the 18th century—about 1710. Of his five sons Abram, the eldest, was colonel of a regiment in the Revolutionary army, and representative in Congress, 1797-1809. The second son, Stephen, went to Kentucky as a member of the court of land commissioners, in 1779. He, also, was colonel of a regiment, Revolutionary war, and was killed in the battle of Blue Licks, while bravely leading his men to a charge. His name is on the Frankfort monument, and Trigg county, Kentucky, is named in his honor. John, third son of Abraham, was a major in the Revolutionary army, an officer of artillery, was present at the surrender of Cornwallis, and represented Virginia in the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Congresses of the United States. William, fourth son, from whom the Virginia branch of the family descended, was also a man of prominence and ability, as was the fifth son, Daniel. Tradition tells us that the old generation of Triggs were "Cultivated people of remarkably fine personal appearance, and endowed with social qualities far above the average." William, fourth son of Abraham, married Mary Johns, and their son Daniel, through whom this branch of the family continues, was born August 14, 1749.

William, sixth of these children, and fourth son, removed in early manhood from what is now known as Montgomery county, Virginia, to Abingdon, Washington county. His removal, and that of the other sons and daughters of Daniel Trigg and his first wife, Anne Smith, was brought about by the marriage of the eldest daughter, Mary, to William King, proprietor of the Kings Salt Works, this sister having filled a mother's place to the younger children when they were deprived of that parent. William married (1806) Rachel Findlay, a niece of Mr. King, and died August 4, 1813, leaving four sons; William King Trigg, Daniel Trigg, Connally Findlay Trigg, Lilburn Henderson Trigg. William King Trigg, the eldest of these sons, married Miss Susan Hickman of Kentucky. He removed to Missouri (near Lexington) in his early married life. His descendants, two sons, Frank Smith Trigg and William King Trigg, survive him; his daughter intermarried with the LeSeur and Sheilds families; his eldest son Daniel, who was killed in the Confederate Army, also married a Miss Anna Sheilds and leaves descendants.

He died in 1879; his descendants reside in Texas. Lilburn Henderson Trigg, the fourth son of William, married Barbara Colquohoun. He was a lawyer, graduate of the University of Virginia. He died in 1854. Two children survive him, Mrs. E. D. Myers, of Richmond, and William Robertson Trigg, of Richmond. ABRAM BYRD TRIGG Was the eighth child of Daniel Trigg, and his first wife Anne Smith, the record of the family found in the pages immediately preceding this.

Abram Byrd, jr., lost his life by remaining in the city of Greenville, Mississippi, (of which he was the honored and beloved mayor), during the fatal yellow fever epidemic of 1878. Though entreated to leave the city, he remained to die for what he believed to be his duty to the home of his adoption and to the unfortunate citizens whom it was in his power thus to serve. He left one child, Mary Byrd. Hon. Wyndham R. Trigg is Chancellor of the 4th District of Mississippi, an able and prominent lawyer and popular judge. His children are; Ellen G., Sue, Pelham, Byrd C., Mary Hurst and Thomas K. The children of Joseph E. C.

He unfortunately endorsed, to an unlimited extent, for a younger brother, who was a reckless speculator in Kentucky, and the endorsements culminated in his financial ruin, his magnificent estate and all his earthly possessions being sold at vendue, even down to his gold snuff-box, presented to him by an English friend. This sudden and complete ruin wrecked the mind of his young wife, who died a maniac. Being yet in the prime of life, of iron constitution, possessed of his integrity and a man of ability, he rallied from this disaster, and accumulated a handsome estate, and at his death left his children in comfortable circumstances. The wife of John M. Wingfield is a daughter of Peter C. Nelson, born in Hanover county, February 2, 1794, died in that county in 1852. He was a son of Peter Nelson, who was born and died in Hanover county, and who was an Episcopalian clergyman in early life, later a Baptist minister. The wife of Peter Nelson was Ann Lawrence, born and died in Hanover county. Mrs. Wingfield's mother was Sallie Cary, born in Norfolk county, Virginia, November 6, 1806, died in Lynchburg, November 11, 1848. Sally Cary was a daughter of Miles Cary, born in Norfolk county, March 8, 1773, died in Lynchburg in 1850. His wife was Elizabeth King, born in Norfolk county in 1778, died in Lynchburg in 1855. Captain Miles Cary, maternal grandfather of Mrs. Wingfield, was the eldest descendant of the Cary who came with two brothers to the colony of Virginia from England. He had at his death the "Court of Arms," of England, which is still in the possession of his descendants. It is said there are many millions of dollars in the vaults of the Bank of England belonging to the Cary family. The earliest seated in Virginia of the Wingfield family was Edward M. Wingfield, first President of the Council of Virginia (see pp. 8 and 14, of Volume I). Of many other illustrious names connected with this family, or of it, may be mentioned J. Richard Wingfield, cousin to John W., former senator to the Virginia legislature, now consul to Costa Rica, residence at San Jose. Judge Gustavus Wingfield, of the circuit court of Franklin county; Bishop Wingfield, of the Episcopal church, Virginia; and Henry Clay, the orator and statesman of Kentucky. Of the same family as the last-named was Henry Clay, of "The Slashes," Hanover county, who was first cousin to Mr. Wingfield's father. The so-called "Winfield" Scott, general U. S. A., was a Wingfield by maternal descent. From some foolish freak or foolish pride he petitioned the Legislature to permit him to drop the "g" from the name his mother had given him, she being a Miss Wingfield, which request was granted, he thus becoming "Winfield" Scott.

Drogo de Montague was born in 1040, and became the trusted companion, follower, and intimate friend of Robert, Earl of Moriton, the favorite brother of William, Duke of Normandy, accompanying his expedition against England. After the conquest, William rewarded him with large grants of land, thus establishing the family in England. Drogo de Montague bore the kite shaped shield of the Norman invaders; its color is cerulian blue, and upon it is the full length Griffin segreant (rampant with wings spread), and painted a bright golden hue. This was the original Montague coat of arms in England. The subject of this sketch is descended from Peter Montague of that family, who came from Boveney, Parish of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1621. He settled in Virginia, and entered lands in the counties of New Norfolk, Nansemond, Middlesex and Essex. Peter Montague became rich, a large land holder, and a man of prominence in the colony. He was a member of the Assembly (House of Burgesses) 16511658 from Lancaster county, Virginia. He left two sons, William and Peter Montague who lived on their handsome estates in Middlesex, known as "Montague Island," two hundred years ago. From them are descended a countless progeny, generally independent planters, remarkable for their amiability of disposition, high sense of honor, strict integrity, and generous hospitality, and it may be added, as a distinguished member of the family was wont to say, "also for their strict virtue and personal beauty of the females." These general characteristics are still preserved in the family to a considerable extent. Meredith Fox, son of John H. and Melinda Montague, was born in Richmond City, on August 3, 1856.

He was then in business one year in New Glasgow, merchandise and tobacco, after that studied law at Amherst C. H., with Robert M. Brown. Admitted to the Bar in March, 1849, he formed a partnership with his former teacher, and the two practiced together until 1855. From 1855 until the beginning of the war, Colonel Whitehead practiced individually, was a Master Commissioner in Chancery, and was also engaged in farming. In April, 1861, he made up the company known as the "Amherst Rangers," of which he was elected first lieutenant, and which was assigned in service as Company E, 2d Virginia Cavalry. In 1862 he was elected captain, and after having been twice wounded was promoted major of the same regiment. His first wound was received at Stevensburg, in the left knee, from a ricochetting cannon ball; the second, gunshot in the left arm, at Trevilian Depot, disabled him for active service, and from that time till the close of the war he was, by order of General Lee, detailed on a Military Board.

JOHN HOWE PEYTON Of Staunton, Virginia, was born in Stafford county, Virginia, in 1778, and died in Augusta county in 1847. He was descended from the ancient English family of Peytons of Isleham, County Cambridge, England, was graduated A. M. at Princeton, New Jersey, in 1797, after a brilliant university career, competing for the highest honors with Richard Rush of Philadelphia and Chas Fenton Mercer of Virginia, studied law under Judge Bushrod Washington of the U. S. Supreme Court, was admitted to the Bar in 1799, establishing at once a reputation as a lawyer, debater and orator. In 1806 he was elected a delegate to the General Assembly of Virginia, from Stafford, and was regarded in the House as a parliamentary leader and orator of the first order. He was author of the celebrated report and resolutions on the subject of a tribunal for settling disputes between the States and Federal judiciary, adopted by the legislature of Virginia in 1810. He removed from Stafford to Augusta county in 1809, and was appointed attorney for the commonwealth in the circuit, the most lucrative and important office in the state at that time, which office he held until he resigned in 1845, acquiring in the thirty-six years the reputation of being the ablest criminal lawyer and public prosecutor Virginia ever had. In 1812 he was commissioned major, and served in the army under Gen. Robert Porterfield until 1815, his minor children receiving a pension for his services in the war. On the return of peace he resumed the law practice, and was appointed deputy U. S. district attorney for Western Virginia. Though greatly engrossed by professional duties he found time to contribute to reviews papers rich in lessons of truth, wisdom and faith, on literary, social and political topics, and to maintain a correspondence with Jefferson, whose counselor he was, with Chief Justice Marshall, who also, in his business affairs, availed himself of Mr. Peyton's legal abilities, with Presidents Monroe and Madison, with Gov. Thos. M. Randolph, Wm. C. Rives, and others of eminence. In 1836 he was elected to the Senate of Virginia, re-elected in 1840, occupying in that body a position of commanding influence, and giving a general support to the Whig party. In 1840 he was appointed by President Harrison a visitor to West Point. He resigned his seat in the Senate in 1845 on account of ill health. In his biographical sketch of Mr. Peyton, Major John T. L. Preston speaks of him as a complete lawyer, a man knowing every part of his profession, and who had met in contest the strongest men in each department of his profession, and had made himself a champion in all. As a speaker his language, Prof. Preston says, was "forcible, pure and idiomatic;" "his mind no Sybil's cave whence came forth wind-driven leaves inscribed with mighty thoughts disposed by chance, but a spacious castle, from whose wide-open portals issued men-at-arms orderly arrayed." Prof. Preston continues that while Mr. Peyton was "thoroughly furnished in every part of his profession, in one department his qualifications were peculiar and unsurpassed—he was the best commonwealth attorney in the State. He was the lawyer of the commonwealth, which he treated as a client, laboring for her with the same zeal, industry and fidelity that he manifested in behalf of any other client. The oft-quoted merciful maxim of the common law, "better that ninety and nine guilty men should escape than that one innocent man suffer," he interpreted as a caution to respect the rights of the innocent, and not as an injunction to clear the guilty, and he labored to reduce the percentage of rogues unwhipt of justice as low as possible. With a clearness and force rarely equalled, would he point out the necessity of punishing the guilty in order that the innocent might be safe, thus exhibiting the absolute consistency of strict justice with true mercy. So simply and earnestly would he do this, that he not only bound the consciences of a jury, but also made them feel that they were individually interested in the faithful execution of the laws. Here his clear perception of the moral principles upon which rests the penal code and his fondness for recurring to general principles stood him in great stead. It was delightful to hear him expatiate upon the theme, for upon no other was he more truly eloquent." In the great discussion in the U. S. Senate between Daniel Webster and Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina, Mr. Webster referred to and quoted from the preamble and resolutions presented to the Virginia legislature in 1810 by Mr. Peyton, and said they were so conclusive of the questions involved in that controversy that they would not admit of further discussion. Mr. Peyton was inflexible in his integrity, or, as Hon. Daniel Sheffey expressed the idea: "was not only a great, but a good man." B. Watkins Leigh, referring to him said he was "the greatest lawyer west of the Blue Ridge." Judge Henry St. Geo. Tucker said: "I regard Mr. Peyton as one of the most profound and learned of lawyers." Mr. Peyton married first Susan, a daughter of Wm. S. Madison, nephew of Bishop Madison of Virginia and of Gov. George Madison of Kentucky. She died, leaving him one son, Col. Wm. Madison Peyton, of Roanoke county, Virginia. (Wm. Madison Peyton, born in 1803, died 1868, was educated at Yale College; was a member of the legislature of Virginia; was tendered, on recommendation of Hon. Wm. C. Rives, by President Jackson, the position of secretary of the Legation, Paris, in 1829, which he declined; married, in 1826, Sally, daughter of Judge Allen Taylor, and left a large family. He was a man of extensive acquirements, of genius, with charming manners, a brilliant speaker and conversationalist.) Secondly Mr. Peyton married Ann Montgomery Lewis, a daughter of Major John Lewis of the Revolutionary army, who owned and lived at the Sweet Springs, Monroe county, (now) West Virginia, whose wife was a daughter of Col. Wm. Preston of Smithfield, Montgomery county, Virginia, and a cousin of Hon. Wm. C. Preston of South Carolina, Gov. James McDowell of Virginia, Gen. P. B. Porter of New York, Gen. John C. Breckinridge, vice-president of the United States, and many other eminent Southern men. By this marriage Mr. Peyton left a large family. The only son of the second marriage, John Lewis Peyton, author of (1) "The American Crisis, or Pages from the Note-Book of a Confederate Foreign State Agent," published in London; (2) "Over the Alleghanies and Across the Prairies, or Personal Recollections of the Far West;" (3) "A History of Augusta County, Virginia;" (4) "Rambling Reminiscences of a Residence Abroad," and many other popular works highly esteemed by men of letters, and favorably reviewed in the periodicals of this country and Europe. While in England Col. J. L. Peyton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London and a member of the "Society of Americanists" of Luxembourg, Prussia. He is also a corresponding member of the Virginia and the Wisconsin Historical societies, and of other learned bodies. From the University of Virginia he received the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1845. In 1855 President Pierce tendered him the position of United States district attorney for Utah, which he declined. When not abroad, he has spent his life principally on his fertile and beautiful estate of "Steephill," by Staunton, Virginia, serving under the old constitution as a justice of the peace, as a bank director, and as a member of the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution at Staunton. He has always taken a warm interest in public improvements, in the advancement of education, and in the general promotion of all good and worthy objects. John Esten Cook, reviewing in the Southern Review of Baltimore, Colonel Peyton's "American Crisis," says of his sketches of the public men at the head of the Confederacy: "He has the art to make them more interesting than any other author of the time." In England Colonel Peyton was a general favorite in society, and Hepworth Dixon, editor of the Athenæum, and author of "New America," said. "He was the ablest of the able men sent to Europe to represent the Southern cause," and that his return to America was "the subject of general regret, especially to persons of literature and science." Colonel Peyton married Henrietta Clark, a daughter of Col. John C. Washington, of Kinston, North Carolina, a descendant of the illustrious Washington family of Virginia, by his wife Mary Bond, sprung from one of the Mayflower "Pilgrim Fathers." Mrs. Peyton is a niece of the late Gov. Wm. A. Graham of North Carolina, Secretary of the Navy, U. S. Senator, etc., and a relative of the Haywards, Branches, Cobbs, Bryans, Clarks, Blounts, and other distinguished Southern families Colonel and Mrs. Peyton have issue one son, Lawrence Washington Howe Peyton. John Howe Peyton's seven daughters married as follows: (1) Susan Madison, married Col. John B. Baldwin, a distinguished lawyer, and member of the C. S. Congress, (2) Mary Preston, married R. A. Gray, (3) Lucy Garnett, married Judge John N. Hendren (4) Elizabeth Trent, married Hon. Wm. B. Telfair of Ohio, (5) Margaret Lynn, married Capt. George M. Cochran, jr., of Staunton, (6) Virginia Frances, married Col. Joseph F. Kent of Wythe county, (7) Cornelia, married Dr. Thos. Brown, and after his death, Wm. H. Greene of Augusta. HON. JOHN LEWIS PEYTON, Of Steephill, by Staunton, Virginia, lawyer, litterateur, and author, was born in Staunton in 1824, and is a son of the eminent lawyer, John Howe Peyton, by his second wife Ann Montgomery, a daughter of Major John Lewis of the Sweet Springs, West Virginia, a distinguished officer of the Revolutionary army, son of Col. William Lewis, a colonial military officer, and one of the survivors of Braddock's bloody defeat, a nephew of Gen. Andrew Lewis, the hero of Point Pleasant, and a grandson of Col. John Lewis, the Huguenot founder of Augusta county Major Lewis married Mary, a daughter of Col. William Preston of Smithfield, Virginia, and thus J. L.

Gratz Brown of Missouri, Francis P. Blair, Gen. T. T. Crittenden, Senators Randall, Lee Gibson of Louisiana, and John E. Kenna of West Virginia, and of many other distinguished men of the South. He was graduated B.

He published in 1854 "Pacific Railway Communications and the Trade of China," and "A Statistical View of the State of Illinois," etc., which had an extended circulation, and which the Editor of DeBow's Review said "were invaluable contributions to the literature of the Times." [See 16 &amp; 17 vol. of DeBow's Review.] Owing to his high rank at the Chicago bar, was tendered by President Pierce, the office of U. S. District Attorney for Utah, which he declined from ill health, returned to Virginia, and was elected Magistrate, Bank Director, etc., and was appointed by the Governor of Virginia a member of the Board of Visitors of the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution at Staunton, writing the report of the Board to the Legislature for the year following. In 1855 married Henrietta, daughter of Colonel John C. Washington, of Lenoir County, North Carolina, of the illustrious Washington family of Virginia, whose wife was a daughter of Southey Bond Esq., of Raleigh, a descendent of one of the Mayflower's Pilgrim Fathers, and has one son, Lawrence W. H. Peyton. Mrs. Peyton is a niece of the late Gov. William A. Graham, of North Carolina, U. S. Senator, Sec'y of the Navy, etc., and is connected with the Haywards, Branches, Blounts, Bryans, Swains, Clarks, Saunders and other distinguished North Carolina and Southern families. In 1861, while Col. J. L. Peyton was engaged in raising and drilling a force for the Confederate States Army, he was appointed agent of the State of North Carolina in Europe, broke the blockade at Charleston, South Carolina, in the Confederate States' Man-of-War, "Nashville," Capt. R. B. Pegram commanding, and reached the Bermuda Islands, where he was received and entertained with distinguished consideration by Gov.

Col. Peyton has been a voluminous writer and is author of "The American Crisis, or Pages from the Note Book of a State Agent during the Civil War in America," 2 vols., London, 1866. "Over the Alleghanies and Across the Prairies—Personal Recollections of the Far West," London, 1867. "A History of Augusta Co., Virginia," Staunton, 1882. "Rambling Reminiscences of a Residence Abroad," Staunton, 1888, and other able and popular works. He edited, with an introduction, "The Glasse of Time," reprinted in 1887 in New York, from the London edition of 1620. Col. Peyton's books published in England were most favorably received by the British public, and flatteringly reviewed by the leading literary magazines and journals. Hepworth Dixon, author of "New America," etc., and editor of "The Athenæum," of London, said that Col. Peyton had sketched the public men of the civil war in "sharp and biting acid, and that he was the ablest of the able men sent by the South to represent her cause in Europe." Bezer Blundell, F. R. S., remarks, in a pamphlet review of 46 pages of Col. Peyton's works, "He is a scholar and a gentleman, who, in his exile has not now to learn what Bœthius discovered more than 1300 years ago, that `the sense of misfortune may be dignified by the labor of thought.' " . . . "He will, we persuade ourselves, take in good part our exhortation to emulate the historical renown of his fellow-countrymen, Bancroft and Motley, or the late Wm. H. Prescott . . . To the annals of Col. Peyton's native Virginia, he has contributed valuable materials, but since her entire history, at least on a scale adequate to her political importance, has yet to be written, we would commend to his consideration the old classic admonition spartam nactus es, hanc exorna." John Esten Cook, in the Southern Review says: "He is a liberal minded traveler, cosmopolitan in taste, with a quick eye for the characteristic, the humorous and the picturesque. His style is direct, lucid, unassuming, and at all times full of simplicity and ease. He observes keenly and narrates incidents and adventures as he describes character, with the art of a raconteur, and succeeds in riveting the attention." "That these works (The American Crisis, and Over the Alleghanies) possess unusual merits, we feel safe in asserting. One merit, it is not in our eyes a slight one, is that Col. Peyton everywhere writes like a gentleman. The age we live in has carried its `fast' and `slap dash' propensities into literature. Repose, simplicity and that charming unreserve which characterizes the well-bred gentleman, writing for persons of culture and intelligence, is his. His descriptions and comments possess great directness and picturesqueness, mingled with a natural and agreeable humor, and render his volumes extremely agreeable reading. . . . The works would prove highly successful, we think, if republished in America." Mr. Cook writes again: "I have been recently re-reading your excellent `American Crisis,' and think it your most attractive work. You should employ your leisure, I think, in adding to these life-like sketches, which, I think, you have the art to make more interesting than any other author of the time." During his long residence in England Col. Peyton was cheered by the respectful consideration and friendly esteem extended to him by all classes, particularly persons of literature and science, and his departure for America was regretted as a general loss to society. Victor Hugo testified his esteem and friendship by presenting him a copy of his likeness, suitably inscribed in his own hand writing, which is preserved at Steephill as a precious souvenir of the immortal poet. Our author's works, published in America since his return, have been received with general favor. Literary men, north and south, commending them as models of their kind, as says Professor Schele de Vere, of the University of Virginia; and says Professor Richardson, of Dartmouth College: "Had I possessed the volume in time, I would have used parts of its investigation in my vol. 1st of American Literature." Broad, comprehensive, and Catholic in his political views and sentiments, he does not indulge in State prejudices, or sectional antipathies, and once remarked to the writer in speaking of the worth of nations, that "Justice requires that while their follies and vices are remembered, their virtues should not be forgotten. Individuals and nations are equally stung with a sense of wrong when their crimes are acrimoniously recapitulated, and their great and good actions are all forgotten. This fatal forgetfulness is the origin of that rancor which has so long desolated the Earth. It distracts private families, confounds public principles and turns even patriotism into poison. Let those who have the smallest love for the happiness of mankind, beware how they indulge this pernicious propensity. He who in every man wishes to meet a brother will very rarely encounter an enemy." Col. Peyton "is," says a writer in one of our journals, giving an account of a visit to his lovely country home, "an old-fashioned man in the simplicity of his manners and habits, enjoys a joke, goes to the fairs with the young folks, and is not ashamed to be seen, as he was recently, surrounded by a troupe of friends, old and young, at a circus. He makes it a rule to go a fishing at least once a summer with all his household. He thinks nothing vulgar but what is mean, and he thinks nothing mean that contributes to health and cheerfulness. Hs is, in a word, a contented man, whom no good fortune can pamper or corrupt, no adversity sour, and no fashion change." Professor C. R. Richardson, on p. 426, of the 2nd vol. of his able and valuable history of American Literature, gives an extract from a letter of Col. Peyton, which not only testfies to his own liberal and national sentiments as to sectionalism in Literature, but to those of the present generation of Southerners Prof. R. says: "An able, unquestionable and admirably concise and strong expression of the true Southern attitude toward American literature, is made by a very competent authority, in a personal letter to me, from which I am permitted to quote. Col. J. Lewis Peyton, of Steephill-by-Staunton, Virginia, is peculiarly qualified to speak on this subject, by descent, by remarkably extended family connections with the great men of the South, by important services to the Confederate States, when their representative in England, and by his own relation to literary work. He writes: `In the South, as with you, nobody now thinks of the birth place of an American writer, we only wish to know what he has turned a sheet of white paper into, with pen and ink, and I hardly think any but a man of diseased mind and imagination, like Poe, would ever have uttered such sentiments as he did as to Edward Coate Pinkney. The enlightened men of this region, as of yours, know no north or South in literature—only one grand Republic of letters, in which every man standeth according to the Soundness of his heart and the strength of his understanding.' " It will interest the public to learn that Col. Peyton is now engaged in the composition of a work entitled: "A History of Virginia from the Retrocession of Alexandria to the Reconstruction of the Union." The Staunton Spectator says of this forthcoming work that "it will cover the whole period of the Civil War and the causes which led up to it, and that the great erudition of the author, his laborious habits and vast research, together with his literary abilities, will make it one of the most valuable and important books ever published in the State." The Valley Virginian says: "Concentrating his brilliant powers on this work, it cannot be doubted that it will be worthy of the subject and the fame acquired by the author in his previous works. The public will await the book with impatience. The calm, dispassionate, philosophical character of Col. Peyton's mind, his uncommon industry and painstaking research, his varied knowledge and graphic style, will, in our opinion, enable him to produce an elegant and faithful history, such as Virginia may well be proud of." The two original settlers in the Colony of Virginia, John and Robert Peyton, were both of the Ancient Isleham Peyton stock, which sprung from Reginald de Malet, a nephew of William de Malet, one of the great Barons who accompanied William Ist to the Conquest of England, and was his mace bearer at the battle of Hastings. From him sprung Sir Robert Peyton de Ufford or Orford, who was summoned to Parliament as a Baron, 1308, and was so distinguished in the wars of Edward II and III, that he was granted the town and Castle of Orford or Ufford, in the county of Suffolk, and also for the personal danger he incurred in arresting Mortimer and some of his adherents in the Castle of Nottingham, a further grant of large landed possessions. In eleventh of Edward III, he was created Earl of Suffolk, and was sent on an embassy to treat for peace with David Bruce, King of Scotland. In the same year he was with the Earl of Derby at the battle of Cajent. In 12th Edward III he served in Flanders and Brittany. Five years later, he was with the Black Prince in France and at the battle of Poictiers, and gained the highest Military renown by his skill as a leader and his personal courage. He was one of the Founders of the order of the garter. He died in 1369, and among other bequests leaves to his son William, 2nd Earl of Suffolk "the sword, wherewith the King girt him when he created him Earl; as also his bed, with the Eagle entire, and his summer vestment powdered with Leopards." (See Froissart vol. I, ch. 237.) A long line of Peytons sprung from this source namely, 1st, the Peyton's of Isleham, the Peyton's of Knowlton, the Peyton's of Doddington, among whom there were many men conspicuous for their talents and virtues—one of whom was the eminent lawyer Robert Peyton, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland time of Henry III. Sir John Peyton M. P., time of Edward I. Gen. Sir Robert Peyton, time of Henry VIII. Sir Edward Peyton, author of the History of the Reign of James I. and other works. Thomas Peyton, of Lincolns Inn, author of "The Glasse of Time," published 1620, and which is by many regarded as the original of Paradise Lost. Gen. Sir John Peyton, Governor of Ross Castle. Gen. Sir John Peyton, Governor of Jersey and author of a code of Norman-Jersey laws. Gen. Sir Henry Peyton, Governor of Galway, time of Queen Anne. Sir Henry Peyton, member of the London Co. for the settlement of Va. Sir Sewster Peyton, a Cabinet Minister in the reign of Queen Anne, and others too numerous to mention. The family is, in 1889, represented in England by Sir Algernon Peyton, Baronet of Doddington, late of the 11th Hussars, born 1855, whose brother, Revd. Thomas Thornhill Peyton M. A., who married a daughter of Sir William Styles, of Wateringburg Place, Kent. is Rector of Isleham, a benefice which has been in the Peyton family over 400 years. The parish church was begun to be rebuilt 17th year of Edward IV. (A. D. 1479) and is in 1889 in perfect preservation. In the Chancel and the Peyton Chapel many members of the family are interred, over whose remains fine monuments have been erected—one of these bears this quaint inscription: "Here under lyeth a worthy Esquire that, Richard Peyton hight, An honest gentleman, &amp; thyrd Son to Robert Peyton, Knight In Grays Inn Student of the Lawe, where he a reader was, He feared God, and loved hys word, in truth his life did pass In practising of justice, loe, was his whole delight, He never wronged any one to whom he might do right Whom he esteemed an honest fryend, who he might stand instead, He never left to do him good with words, with purse &amp; deed Fourteen years space he married was unto a beautiful wife, By parent named Mary Hyde, they lived devoid of stryfe The earth him bear twice twenty years, and virtuously he lived, A virtuous life he did embrace &amp; virtuously he dyed Anno Domini 1574 The thiertieth day of April, year seventy &amp; four, A thousand five hundred being put to that more." John Peyton settled in Westmoreland County, Virginia in 1664, and Robert Peyton in Gloucester County in 1660, and through the researches of Dr. Robert A. Brock, the accomplished Secretary of the Virginia Historical Society we are enabled to give the following extracts from the Land registry office, at Richmond, Virginia, showing the early date at which several members of the family possessed themselves of Virginian lands, viz, Henry Peyton, of Acquia, Westmoreland County, took up in that county 400 acres of land, Nov. 1st 1657. Col. Valentine Peyton, of Nominy, County Westmoreland, took up in that county 1600 acres July 20th 1662. Major Robert Peyton, took up in New Kent County, April 23rd 1681, 1000 acres. Thomas Peyton, of Gloucester entered June 16th, 1758, 150 acres. The prominent members of the American family not heretofore mentioned have been Yelverton Peyton, Lieut U. S. A. 1794; Garnett Peyton, Capt. U. S. A. 1799, a son of John R. Peyton, of Stony Hill, Stafford County, Virginia who was styled in Virginia, "the first gentleman of his day." Francis Peyton M. D. Surgeon U. S. A. 1799; Robert Peyton Capt. U. S. A. 1812. James R. Peyton Capt. U. S. A. 1813, Col. Harry Peyton, of Revolutionary fame and the ancestor of Col. John B. Baldwin, Mrs. A. H. H. Stuart, Mrs. James M. Ranson, Mrs. R. T. W. Duke and others, John S. Peyton Capt. U. S. A. 1813; Bernard Peyton, Capt. U. S. A. 1813, adjutant General of Virginia and in 1840-44 Post-Master at Richmond, Va. Richard H. Peyton, Capt. U. S. A. 1839 who died the same year in Florida, a distinguished Graduate of West Point, Balie Peyton M. C. 1835-1837, appointed Sec'y of War 1841, but declined, Colonel of 5th Louisiana regiment in the Mexican war, and aid de camp to Gen. Worth and voted a sword of honor by the State of Louisiana, in 1848-52 Minister Plenipotentiary to Chili and later U. S. Attorney for California. He was a splendid soldier, an eloquent speaker and was called the "Silver tongued orator." Col. John Peyton Commisary-General of the Revolutionary army elected by the Legislature of Va. 1779; Jos. H. Peyton M. C. for Tennessee, Samuel O. Peyton M. C. for Kentucky. Judge E. G. Peyton Chief Justice of Mississippi, an eminent lawyer, Col. Charles L. Peyton, Greenbrier Co., W. Va. a son of Craven Peyton, of Monteagle, Albermarle Co. Va., by his wife Jane Jefferson, dau. of Randolph Lewis, whose mother was a sister of President Jefferson, Robert Ludwell Yates Peyton, a Missouri State Senator and Senator for Missouri in the Confederate Congress, a colonel in the C. S. A. and a man of such remarkable talents and such rare oratorical powers that he was styled the "Patrick Henry of the West." He graduated B. L. of Va. 1843 and died in 1862, from disease contracted in the field, at the siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Col. Charles S. Peyton, of W. Va., who lost his arm at the battle of Manassas, but as soon as his wound was healed reassumed his old command, and participated in nearly all the battles of the eastern theatre of the war—leading his regiment (the 19th Virginia), in the celebrated charge of Pickett's brigade at Gettysburg and when every field officer was killed or shot down, took command and led the remnant of that heroic force, with Lee's retreating army, to Virginia. He is a noble specimen of humanity, a man sans peur et sans reproche. Col. William Madison Peyton, long the representative of Roanoke and Botetourt in the General Assembly of Virginia, the only son by the first marriage of Hon. John Howe Peyton, a man endowed with great vigor and vivacity of intellect, purity of heart and sweetness of disposition. His master passions were freedom of thought and love of country. It is the opinion of those who knew him best, and the high and commanding influence he exerted in his day, that but for his continued ill-health, which largely destroyed his physical and mental energies, he would have played a great part in the affairs of his country. Disease caused him to spend his time in study, when he could study, at his country seat in Roanoke, a quiet only occasionally interrupted by the part he was compelled by the importunities of his friends and neighbors to take in public affairs as a magistrate, a director in public companies and a delegate to the Legislature. Oftener than once has it been remarked of him that he was a fine illustration of the truth of the remark that the "world knows nothing of its greatest men." The Peytons are extensively connected with the leading families of the State, such as the Brokenboroughs, Baldwins, Bernards, Conways, Carters, Clarks, Fitzhughs, Greens, Garnetts, Harvies, Harrisons, Jeffersons, Lewis', Masons, Munfords, Madisons, Moncures, Prestons, Randolphs, Stuarts, Scotts of Fauquier, Skipwiths, Tuckers, Washingtons, Woodvilles and Wallaces, and of that vast ramification of families traced out by the late Orlando Brown in his Memoranda of the Preston family.
