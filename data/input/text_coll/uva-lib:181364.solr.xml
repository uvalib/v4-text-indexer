      <field name="fulltext">Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1933-34. THE movement for the preservation of research materials, sponsored by the Social Science Research Council in 1929, is steadily becoming national in scope, and the report of another year's work in Virginia affords good evidence for this contention. While the project for the survey and collection of social science source materials in this State originated with the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences and the Library of the University of Virginia, its inception was made possible by the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research of the SSRC and the American Council of Learned Societies;1 1. Cf. First Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-31 (University, Va., 1931), page 7. and during the past two or three years the activity of other national and local organizations along the same line has further demonstrated its fundamental importance for all related fields of scholarship. That the State is the unit best adapted to carrying on this work of preservation and enlargement of research materials seems fairly certain in view of the progress made in this direction by the Public Documents Committee of the American Library Association, which has taken over this project from the Committee on Public Administration of the SSRC. The plan to preserve these materials in every state is now well launched in several commonwealths.2 2. Notably in Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania as well as in Virginia. While public documents, i. e., official publications of state and local governments, were emphasized first, all related materials, printed and manuscript, were included in the categories of sources worthy of preservation, as defined by the chairman of the Committee.3 3. A. F. Kuhlman, "A Movement to Preserve Social Science Source Materials," American Journal of Sociology, vol. XXXIX, no. 1 (July 1933), pages 54-58. These categories coincide, for the most part, with those which the archivist listed in 1930 in outlining the survey in Virginia,4 4. First Annual Report of the Archivist, page [8] although he laid more stress upon manuscripts. Subsequent reports of the archivist, however, have indicated the inclusion of all kinds of printed documents, reports, and pamphlets, especially on Virginia and the South. The broad scope of the project was outlined in a report to the Public Documents Committee at the Chicago meeting of the American Library Association in October 1933.5 5. Public Documents . . . Policies and Problems . . ., ed. by A. F. Kuhlman (Chicago, 1934), pages 46-47. This tendency of intellectual movements to become nation-wide has been furthered by the program of the federal government, making funds available for educational projects as well as for public works. Plans for an inventory of all state and local archives, through state and sub-committees, were formulated in Washington, D. C., but before they were ready for action, the rapid expenditure of federal funds forced the disintegration and transfer of the project to the separate states where, unfortunately, relief funds had already been allocated, or largely so. Thus in Virginia the committee, composed of the late Dr. H. R. McIlwaine, Mrs. P. W. Hiden, and the archivist, was unable to secure authorization of the inventory. Another proposal for similar aid came from the Tennessee Valley Authority, to employ qualified workers to take inventory of those Virginia county archives in the area drained by tributaries of the Tennessee River. In this case, just as the work began in one county, the project was disallowed for lack of funds. It does not require much rationalizing, however, to convince oneself that the problem of personnel was serious; trained workers in most of the counties were scarce and undoubtedly much of the inventory must have been redone. Although, according to the original plan at the University of Virginia, the inventory of archives and manuscript collections was to be stressed rather than the collection of materials for the Library,6 6. First Annual Report of the Archivist, page 1. as the survey of successive counties has brought to light many original papers that might be acquired, negotiations to secure them could not well be postponed. The increasing proportion of time which this phase of the work requires, along with the concentration upon Virginia newspapers, was noted in the preceding Annual Report.7 7. Third Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1932-1933, pages 1-2. This condition has inevitably prevailed during the past year, with the result that the inventory was carried into only three new counties, viz., Brunswick, Halifax, and Russell. While this state of affairs is to be regretted, the gathering of data by correspondence, as in the case of certain lodges and churches,8 8. Second Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1931-32, page 2; Third Annual Report, pages 2-3. has actually extended the survey into many counties and cities not yet included in the list by geographical regions. In other words, the problem is being met from several angles, thereby affording cross-sections of various kinds of records throughout wide areas. Since all the county archives contain the same types of records, with some variations, it is planned to compose a form-sheet, a copy of which can be checked for each county and individual differences noted, with considerable saving of time. As part of the inventory of Rockbridge County the records of Washington and Lee University were listed, including some interesting manuscripts concerning Liberty Hall Academy of the Revolutionary period. Previous work in the archives of Montgomery County resulted this year in the transfer as a loan deposit to the University Library of a large collection of miscellaneous private manuscript books, exhibits in old law suits. Those of particular interest to the economic historian are two letter-books, the teller's settlement, and blotter of the Farmer's Bank of Virginia, 1855-64; statements of the office of the Bank in the Valley of Virginia, 1858-64; the journal and day book of the Peach Bottom Copper Mine, 1860-61; the Montgomery Hotel ledger, 1872-78; and account books of a shoemaker, furniture-maker, blacksmith, hardware dealer, and collier, ca. 1850-73. Another book containing a "List of subscribers to the new Presbyterian Church" of Christiansburg, 1852-60, is worthy of mention. The bibliography of Virginia newspapers,9 9. Cf. Third Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 2-3. to be published as Part I of the Guide to Virginia historical sources, is in preparation for the press. This compilation will list every known newspaper title, but because Dr. Clarence P. Brigham is revising his Bibliography of American Newspapers, 1690-1820, in the present Virginia work bibliographical data and holdings of libraries will be given only for papers since 1820. The collection of newspapers for the University Library has progressed along with the assembling of information on the editors and their journals. It is estimated that about two hundred Virginia papers are represented in the files of the Library. Many of these are rare single issues of papers of which, very probably, no files are extant. For recent years, especially since 1900, there are files of varying length from every section of the State, and fairly good files of a number of papers of the nineteenth century, especially since 1850. Because of lack of space in the Virginia Room, the Law School has kindly provided space in the stacks of Clark Hall where the papers since 1870 are kept. Most of the newspapers are gifts from editors and other generous persons; some have been obtained by exchange with other libraries. A few editors have placed their old files on deposit and the archivist, at the meeting of the Virginia Press Association in Charlottesville, July 1934, urged the members to give serious consideration to the preservation of their files in the same way. This research on newspapers provides another example of wide cooperation along cultural lines. The projected "Union List of Newspapers in the United States and Canada" was begun in October 1933 with Miss Winifred Gregory as editor. In every State at least one chairman has been appointed to be responsible for submitting the data on the papers in that State, restricted to those since 1820. The compilation of the archivist, to be published in 1935, will serve as the report from Virginia. The inventory of the rapidly increasing holdings of the University Library and the transcription of the data to cards were greatly facilitated by student aid financed by the FERA. Indeed, without this help, this part of the work could not have been kept up to date. The range of available information on all aspects of Virginia history, especially during the nineteenth century, continues to broaden with the acquisition of more manuscripts. A number of the larger collections which are on deposit deserve special mention for the value of their content. The papers of General Joel Leftwich, ca. 1785-1840, are concerned with business relations in Bedford County, with militia routine, and with military activities during the War of 1812. The Ambler Family Manuscripts, 1790-1850, consist chiefly of vouchers, receipts, and letters to John Jaquelin Ambler of "Glen Ambler" in Amherst County, including some papers of his kinsmen the Barbours; these manuscripts throw much light upon plantation life and include a number of letters from men prominent in public affairs. Of special interest is the four volume journal of John Jaquelin Ambler, describing in detail his "grand tour" of Europe, 1823-26, prefaced by his autobiography and supplemented by notes on his life at "Glen Ambler" for several years after his return. The Sydnor-Chapin correspondence, ca. 1830-80, deals with general social and religious conditions, especially Baptist, in King and Queen County and vicinity and with education in a "female academy" in Washington, D. C. From the descendants of General John Hartwell Cocke, co-founder with Jefferson of the University of Virginia, come his correspondence, plantation diaries, and accounts, ca. 1800-66, loaned for certain special investigations now in progress. The Wallace Family letters and documents, presented to the Library, date back to 1750 and treat of the commercial ventures of these Scottish-American merchants, especially during the period 1773-1805. Army life, from the viewpoint of the soldier and the physician, and military affairs in Washington's command are discussed in entertaining fashion in letters written from Valley Forge, tidewater Virginia, and elsewhere. It is appropriate that the letters of Francis Walker Gilmer to Peter Minor, 1812-24, long in private hands west of the Alleghanies, should be acquired finally by the University of Virginia, since they discuss the beginnings and first problems of the institution. The papers of the late Armistead C. Gordon, former rector of the University, presented by his children, are those concerning his policies and activities as a member of the Board of Visitors (1894-98, 1906-18). Life at the University is depicted in the letters of Robert M. Rucker, a student during 1849-51. The diary of Alanby M. Miller, former student in the University, tells of his experiences at the University of Heidelberg, 186869. From Cumberland County come the Palmore papers of a county sheriff, treating of general economic and social conditions, 1858-96. The records of Henry T. Harris, superintendent of schools in Nelson County during the early years of the present century, afford some conception of public education in a mountain district. Among the manuscripts of a more purely economic nature deserving special notice are the business records of James S. Easley and Easley &amp; Willingham of Halifax Court House, whose profits from a lucrative merchandising enterprise in ante bellum days were invested in public lands in Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The file of letters received by Easley and by his son, R. Holt Easley, and of copies of letters sent, 1854-60 and 1865-ca. 1900, is well-nigh complete. It forms, in the opinion of one economic historian who has examined them in detail, one of the most valuable sources on the disposal of the public lands as well as on early banking methods in that region of the Middle West. The journals and ledgers of Easley's store in Halifax cover a period of half a century, beginning in the latter 1830's. The iron industry in southwestern Virginia may be studied from the letters, receipts, and account books of David Graham's ironworks in Wythe County, ca. 1820-60. From Christiansburg come the general merchandise account books of the firm of Johnston &amp; Co., 1865-92; from Charlotte Court House records of a similar business, operated successively for over fifty years from 1819 by William Smith, Samuel S. Fuqua, J. &amp; J. Overbey, and others, along with a tavern and blacksmith shop. Records of the general country store, so typical of agrarian business enterprise and now so rapidly disappearing, are on file in the Library from every section of Virginia, forming a composite collection spanning practically the entire period from 1790 to the present. The law practice of W. W. Hurt in Pittsylvania County, embracing a variety of economic matters, is revealed in his papers for the years 1850-80. The fragmentary records of the Pittsylvania Central Alliance Trade Union, 1890-92, shed some light upon a characteristic organization in the days of the populist movement. The diary of L. C. Catlett from Gloucester County, 1913-16, represents an attempt to improve agricultural methods in tidewater Virginia. The Virginia and Southern collection has been further augmented by numerous books, periodicals, maps, and pamphlets, and by unpublished sketches of churches, societies, and economic developments.10 10. William Kohler, "Description, History and Recollections of the Lead Mines [in Southwestern Virginia, 1750-1868]" (typescript), is worthy of special mention. A growing appreciation for ephemeral pamphlet material, both old and recent, may be noted in the fact that the Public Documents Committee of the ALA devoted an entire session of its meetings in Montreal last June to the problems of acquiring, preserving, and filing these so-called "fugitive materials." Since they include official documents of the United States and of state and local governments, now being issued increasingly in "near-print" form, they have created a common problem for social scientists and librarians of research institutions throughout the country. The idea of promoting co-operation among Virginia libraries,11 11. Cf. First Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 6, 16. to preserve and make accessible the historical sources of the State, was furthered during the past year by the University Library through the Co-operation Committee of the Virginia Library Association. Lists of books available for the cost of transportation were sent to a number of libraries, to be checked by them and returned as requests. In this way many duplicates were put into use and, it is hoped, the nucleus of an exchange service created. The collecting of duplicate Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia from the county clerks' offices, begun last year,12 12. Third Annual Report of the Archivist, page 6. to be used for exchange purposes, has progressed satisfactorily. The establishment of the Public Document Clearing House of the National Association of State Libraries will greatly facilitate this means of enriching the University's holdings of this type of research material. The need for photostatic equipment13 13. Ibid., page 5. to make copies of materials that come to hand as loans for only a brief period, was met by purchasing a Leica camera. The photographing is done on 35 mm. motion picture film which may be used in a projector or from which enlarged prints can be made at low cost.14 14. The latter method is used in the University of Virginia Library, the prints being filed and indexed the same as original pieces. So simple is the equipment that the camera can be set up and operated anywhere with sunlight or ordinary Mazda lamps. Thus the camera can be brought to the manuscript anywhere, with the advantage of photographing material which the owner is unwilling to let go out of his hands. The extent to which this photography will enrich the Library cannot yet be measured. A word of thanks for helpful suggestions is due Professor Robert C. Binkley of the Joint Committee on Materials for Research, who for several years has studied methods of reproducing such materials.15 15. Cf. his Methods of Reproducing Research Materials (Ann Arbor, 1931). It has been thought advisable to make available in preliminary form certain sections of the inventory of historical sources. Appended to the present report, therefore, is a list of original Episcopal church records in the Diocese of Virginia, before 1900. Those of the colonial and revolutionary periods are among the most valuable of the early official records of Virginia, and those of the nineteenth century have been too long neglected. It is hoped that this appendix will be justified by its usefulness to students of Virginia history and that other original records may be listed in subsequent reports. With the departure of Mrs. Joseph Lee Kinzie, whose valuable work on the Virginia manuscripts and documents has rendered these materials so accessible since the inception of the project, Mr. John Cook Wyllie of the Library staff has become curator of the Virginia Collection. The need for an assistant to work with the archivist in the field, especially in the survey of local archives, is more pressing than before, as the work of inventory and collection grows more involved. The suggestion that such an assistant might be employed part-time in the Virginia Room,16 16. Third Annual Report of the Archivist, page 7. is urgently repeated. It is encouraging to find a growing consciousness throughout the State that the University of Virginia Library is a recognized repository for research materials and to feel that this archival work is a real part of a national movement. In conclusion, the archivist wishes to express his appreciation for the co-operation of the Library and Research Institute staffs and the faculty and for the genuine interest and generosity of many Virginia citizens, so indispensable to the advancement of the work.

      <field name="fulltext">Appendix PARISH RECORDS OF THE DIOCESE OF VIRGINIA, 1653-1900 The following list of parish records consists chiefly of registers and vestry books in the present Diocese of Virginia. This area includes all of Virginia north of the James and east of the Blue Ridge except the counties of York, Elizabeth City, Warwick, James City, Nelson, and Amherst; and all the Shenandoah Valley below (north of) Augusta County. All records listed are in manuscript, except a few in typescript and those which are printed (titles in italics). Every record without a mark above the date is to be found in the individual parish; the data were obtained mainly by questionnaire addressed to the rectors. A few rectors did not reply and, to that extent, the list of extant records is incomplete. A large number of the older manuscript books and photostat copies of them are to be found in libraries, indicated by the following marks: d Virginia Diocesan Library, 110 W. Franklin St., Richmond. h Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. u University of Virginia, Charlottesville. v Virginia State Library, Richmond. A date followed by a plus sign (+) indicates that the particular record covers the period from that year to the present and is still continuing. In consulting this guide, it is well to note that Bishop William Meade's Old Churches, Ministers and Families of Virginia (1857) is indispensable in research involving Virginia parish records. Edward L. Goodwin's The Colonial Church in Virginia . . . (1927) also contains much useful information. Many of the old records which Bishop Meade examined are no longer extant; indeed, the ravages of time have seriously depleted these colonial and revolutionary treasures, and a surprisingly large number of the nineteenth century have also disappeared. It is hoped that more parishes will realize the importance of preserving their records, either in a central repository, such as the Virginia Diocesan Library or the Virginia State Library, or at least in a local fire-proof vault. For their co-operation in compiling the following data grateful acknowledgments are hereby made to the Rt. Rev. H. St. George Tucker, Bishop of Virginia, to Dr. G. MacLaren Brydon, Secretary of the Diocese, to Mr. Wilmer L. Hall, State Librarian, and to the several Rectors in the Diocese. Generald 1. Bruce fund.
