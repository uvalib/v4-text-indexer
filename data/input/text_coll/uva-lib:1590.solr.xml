      <field name="fulltext">1 THE HISTORY OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION The first chapter in the History of the Former Han Dynasty contains an account of the rise of Liu Chi, who became Emperor Kao-tsu and the founder of the Han dynasty, and of the important events in his reign. In accordance with the canon of Chinese historical writing that the most reliable account is to be obtained by copying sources practically verbatim, this chapter is largely a copy of the chapter devoted to Kao-tsu in Sze-ma Ch'ien's Historical Records or Shih-chi, together with additions taken from the SC chapter on Hsiang YÃ¼. Those chapters were probably themselves largely copied from the Ch'u-Han Ch'un-ch'iu by Lu Chia, who presented his book to Kao-tsu in 197 B.C. His book is now lost, but it was preserved in T'ang times, and notations of the information it contained in addition to what is found in the HS are found in the notes. Very little indeed is so noted. Probably this book was allowed to disappear because practically everything in it had been incorporated into the History. We have thus in the first part of this chapter an account of the conflict that arose after the death of the First Emperor of the Ch'in dynasty, taken from documents contemporary with those events. The second part of the chapter contains the chronicle of events in Kao-tsu's reign after he assumed the title of Emperor. This part of the chapter is also copied largely from the corresponding chapter in the SC, but there are significant additions, especially among the imperial edicts recorded for that period. Pan Ku seems to have had access to a collection of imperial edicts preserved in the archives at the capital and to a set of annals of important events kept by imperial officials. Since he admired Szu-ma Ch'ien so greatly, he made Szu-ma Ch'ien's account the basis of his own account, and added to it or corrected it at the few places where changes seemed necessary. The Imperial Annals, the first of which constitutes this chapter, are merely the chronological summary of the History of the Former Han Dynasty, a typical Chinese encyclopedic history. In this History the twelve Annals constitute only about one twentieth of the whole work. 2CHAPTER I It is therefore not to be expected that the Annals should give the whole story of any reign or even any detailed account of the events in it. Pan Ku realized that history cannot be broken off at the death of each emperor. He conceived of history as the record of the deeds of individuals, so he put into his Memoirs and Treatises many facts that are essential to a full understanding of historical movements. While this chapter does contain many more details than usually appear in annals, yet much additional material is to be found in the relevant Memoirs. We have summarized in the Glossary the important Memoirs bearing on this and other reigns; it is suggested that the reader consult the Glossary sub the names of places and persons in each chapter. He will find there many events not to be found in the Annals. Pan Ku limited himself to one dynasty because the immense wealth of material at his command made a limitation of scope imperative. He has indeed been criticized for the great length to which his history grew, yet that great length was needed for an adequate picture of this unusual period. Because his history was planned as an encyclopedia rather than as a straightforward account, the extraordinarily complete picture given by Pan Ku will not be available until the whole of this long History has been translated. *â*â* The account of the rebellion against the Ch'in dynasty and the rise of Kao-tsu, given in the first part of this chapter, is quite logical and is told in detail. The China of that day was still largely confined to the Yellow River valley. In 209 B.C., at the opening of revolt, the imperial capital was at Hsien-yang, near the present city by the same name in Shensi. Central Shensi, then called Kuan-chung, is a great natural fortress, with mountains and the Yellow River making a formidable barrier to invasion. To the east, Kuan-chung was entered chiefly by the Han-ku Pass, which is easily defensible. Within this fortress is the Wei River valley, then very fertile and well populated. This region had been the seat of the Ch'in state, which had conquered China and whose king had taken the proud title of the First Emperor in 221 B.C. He had extinguished all the feudal nobility and had divided China into thirty-six commanderies, each governed by an official appointed by himself. Southwest of Kuan-chung in the mountainous southwestern Shensi was the Han-chung Commandery, from which difficult roads led to the commanderies of Pa and Shu in the present Szechuan. This region had not yet been fully civilized; it was still a region of exile. Here was soon to be established the kingdom of Hans, to which Liu Chi was appointed. 3INTRODUCTION Travel east of Kuan-chung went chiefly down the Yellow River valley to the place where the great coastal plain begins to broaden out. There was also a road across the mountains of eastern Shensi and up the Fen River valley, which debouched through mountain passes onto the great plain in the present central Hopei. Because of its difficulties, traffic usually took the other road via the Yellow River valley. The northern road was the one followed by Han Hsin in his conquest of Chao, Yen, and Ch'i in 205-3 B.C. In the narrow east and west corridor which is the Yellow River valley east of Kuan-chung, lay the city of Jung-yang, which Kao-tsu long made his headquarters when fighting Hsiang YÃ¼, and where he was besieged by the latter and almost captured. Here too was the immense granary of Ao, on a mountain by the shore of the Yellow River. It contained so much grain that for three years Kao-tsu's forces, numbering hundreds of thousands, continued to draw food from this granary, and yet did not exhaust it. Its location made it easily defensible; Hsiang YÃ¼'s failure to garrison adequately this stronghold left him without an appropriate base of supplies to fight Kao-tsu and eventually brought about his defeat. At the place where the plain starts to broaden out had been the last capital of the ancient state of Hanh. The Yellow River at that time turned north from its present bed near the place where the Peiping-Hankow railroad now crosses the River, and flowed northeast, following approximately the present Grand Canal, until it emptied into the sea near the present Tientsin. Between this channel of the Yellow River and the Gulf of Chihli (then called the P'o Sea) had been the ancient state of Ch'i, one of the richest parts of China. West of the Yellow River had been the ancient state of Chao, and north of Chao, Yen. South of the Shantung promontory, in the present northern Kiangsu, was P'eng-ch'eng, the last capital of the ancient state of Ch'u. Not far away was the birthplace of Liu Chi. To the south in the seaboard plain, across the Yangtze River, was the K'uai-chi Commandery, which had formerly been the state of Wu, from which arose Hsiang YÃ¼ and his uncle. The remainder of the present China, outside the Yellow River valley and the seaboard plain, had not yet become important. Even the Hsiang River valley, which later became the kingdom of Ch'ang-sha, was still considered as "low, damp, and poverty-stricken," and was used as a place of exile. Present Fukien was the seat of a semiindependent barbarian kingdom, Min-yÃ¼eh; present Kwangtung was the seat of another barbarian kingdom, Nan-yÃ¼eh. The First Emperor had conquered these regions and had sent convicts there as 4CHAPTER I colonists, but these regions were still sparsely settled, largely barbarous, and played only a small part in the Chinese politics of the time. The significant regions of China, in which most of the matters related in this chapter occurred, were Kuan-chung, where was the capital, the narrow valley where the Yellow River flows eastwards, and the seaboard plain, where had been located the flourishing states that had been conquered by Ch'in. Among these states there started the revolt which finally conquered Ch'in. In the background of this revolt there lay the exactions and cruelly overwhelming force wielded by the First Emperor. After his death, his son, the Second Emperor, continued his harsh policy. The people's resentment had gradually accumulated and a spark set it aflame. Ch'en ShÃª was an ambitious farm boy who became one of the chiefs in a levy of men made in the present southern Honan, which had been part of the ancient kingdom of Ch'u. In the late summer of 209 B.C., a bad rain prevented this levy from reaching its destination on time. According to the Ch'in laws, the officers and men of the levy would have been condemned to death; they accordingly conspired to rebel. As a slogan they falsely called themselves partisans of Fu-su, the displaced heir of the First Emperor, and fabricated miracles to legitimize themselves. The rebellion was not thus at first openly directed against the dynasty, but was merely the act of men driven to desperation by over-harsh laws. Success in capturing important cities and the favorable response of the people led Ch'en ShÃª to call himself the King of Ch'u and appoint subordinate generals to overrun the surrounding country. These generals found themselves welcomed by the people, and set themselves up as kings of the regions which they controlled. Soon much of eastern China was aflame. The Ch'in forces were sent to put down the rebellion, with Chang Han, a very capable general, at their head. He defeated Ch'en ShÃª and relieved the siege of an important city. Ch'en ShÃª's important generals were likewise defeated, and he fled eastwards into the present northern Kiangsu, where he was assassinated by his own charioteer. But neither the death of Ch'en ShÃª nor the continued successes of Chang Han could stop the rebellion. Ambitious men all over eastern China saw their opportunity, excited their neighbors to arise and massacre the officials appointed by the Ch'in dynasty, and put themselves at the head of a rebel force. Against such a wholesale uprising even the ablest general could do little, for he could not be everywhere. Soon the less able rebel generals subordinated themselves to the more successful ones. 5INTRODUCTION In the present southern Kiangsu, an uncle and nephew, Hsiang Liang and Hsiang YÃ¼, murdered the Commandery Administrator, took his army, and marched north. They were descendants of the famous generals in Ch'u, and as they came north other generals came to them with their armies. They set up a successor to Ch'en ShÃª in the person of a scion from the ancient kings of Ch'u, thus legitimizing their rebellion and bringing further recruits. Their capital was put at P'eng-ch'eng, in the present northern Kiangsu. Among the generals who had previously come to Hsiang Liang was Liu Chi, the future Kao-tsu. (There is no evidence that he used the name Liu Pang until after his coronation, when that name was tabooed.) He was a former village official who had become a bandit as the result of official oppression and bad luck, and had been summoned with his followers when the chief town of his commandery intended to rebel. He killed its vacillating magistrate when the magistrate changed his mind and refused to rebel, then he made himself master of P'ei, a city in the present northern Kiangsu, together with surrounding cities. From that time he was known as the Lord of P'ei. A subordinate who had been left in charge of Feng went over to another rebel general who had a better pedigree than Liu Chi, and Liu Chi was unable to retake Feng. He finally applied to Hsiang Liang, who gave him troops and enabled him to recapture Feng. When Chang Han defeated and killed Hsiang Liang, Liu Chi attached himself closely to Hsiang YÃ¼ and was made a marquis by the King of Ch'u. Meanwhile rebellion had flared throughout the present Shantung and Hopei. The King of Chao was besieged by the Ch'in forces at ChÃ¼-lu in central Hopei and sent to Ch'u for rescue. At that time two projects required the urgent attention of Ch'u: the raising of the siege at ChÃ¼-lu and the carrying of the war to the capital of the dynasty at Hsien-yang, in Kuan-chung. The ablest generals, including Hsiang YÃ¼, were sent north, and Liu Chi was sent west. The General-in-chief in charge of the army sent to the relief of ChÃ¼-lu proved dilatory and incompetent, so Hsiang YÃ¼ boldly killed him and took charge of the army. Hsiang YÃ¼'s prestige was so high that generals from other parts of the country joined him in rescuing Chao. When he crossed the Chang River he boldly burnt his boats and destroyed all but three days' provisions, then advanced to the attack. In nine battles he defeated the besiegers, captured their general, burnt their camp, and raised the siege. The fame of this deed brought to Hsiang YÃ¼'s standard the outstanding generals of the country. Then he turned his attention to Chang Han. 6CHAPTER I Chang Han had been fighting rebels for almost two full years; they had gained in strength in spite of his victories. A defeated general could expect little but execution from the harsh authorities at the capital. Chang Han was said to have lost over a hundred thousand men in those two years. The imperial authority was then in the hands of a eunuch Chancellor of State, who had slaughtered his enemies. Chang Han was now defeated in battle by Hsiang YÃ¼, and, when the latter promised him a kingdom, Chang Han was ready to surrender, although his army was said still to contain more than two hundred thousand soldiers. When the surrendered army showed signs of discontent at this action of its generals, Hsiang YÃ¼ had it massacred at night. Then he started for Hsien-yang with an army said to be of four hundred thousand men. Meanwhile Liu Chi had worked his way westwards. He had been sent off with a totally inadequate force and with the promise that the person who conquered the capital would be made the king of that region. He spent a whole year going westwards, gathering recruits, preaching rebellion, making friends, and fighting with the Ch'in armies, usually, but not always, successfully. When he reached the borders of Kuan-chung, he first sent a messenger into that region to preach rebellion, then avoided the easily defensible Han-ku Pass, made a detour to the southwards, and entered the lightly defended Wu Pass. After tricking and crushing the Ch'in army sent against him, he arrived at the suburbs of the capital, which was empty of troops. There, in Nov./Dec. 207 B.C., the last ruler of the Ch'in dynasty came and surrendered to him. Kao-tsu later dated the beginning of his reign with this event. Liu Chi showed himself generous and kindly. Instead of looting the city, he sealed up the imperial palaces and treasuries and moved his troops out of the capital, for Hsiang YÃ¼ might ask for an accounting of its treasures. Hsiao Ho, his future Chancellor, took the charts and registers out of the imperial chancellor's office. Through their possession, Liu Chi was later able to know the strategic points of the empire, the size of the population, and the people's grievances. Liu Chi gathered the leaders of the region and announced to them that he had been promised the kingship of Kuan-chung and that he was going to agree with them on a code consisting of only three articles: death for murder, proportionate punishment for robbery and assault, and the repeal of all other penal laws. While this drastic abrogation of the detailed and vexatious laws in effect in Ch'in could not be entirely carried out, yet it actually meant a great lightening of the people's burdens and secured for Liu Chi their good will. Then Liu Chi sent a guard to the Han-ku Pass. 7INTRODUCTION When Hsiang YÃ¼ reached that Pass and found it barred, he forced it and marched on to the capital. Not only was he enraged that Liu Chi should have dared to try to keep him out (an act of rebellion by a subordinate against his Commander-in-chief), but he was jealous that another person should have captured the capital. With an overwhelming force, he hastened to crush Liu Chi. But the latter was forewarned and came to make apologies. With lordly generosity, Hsiang YÃ¼ accepted them, especially since the treasures of the capital had been left for him to loot. He marched into the capital, massacred its people, killed the surrendered King, and burnt the imperial palaces. That fire was the real "Burning of the Books," for in the imperial palaces there had been preserved the proscribed literature for the use of the imperial Frudits and officials. Those fires did not cease until the third month. Hsiang YÃ¼ proceeded to divide the conquered empire. It was a military man's division. The King of Ch'u, who had done little but reign, was nominally elevated to be Emperor, but really exiled to southern Hunan, where an emissary of Hsiang YÃ¼ soon assassinated him. Hsiang YÃ¼ made himself King of Ch'u and Lord Protector of the Empire, with Kiangsu, southern Shantung, and parts of Honan and the Yangtze valley as his territory. The agreement about making the conqueror of Kuan-chung its king was disregarded; Liu Chi was made King of Hans, a region located in southwestern Shensi and Szechuan. Kuan-chung was divided into three kingdoms, with the three generals of Chang Han's surrendered army as its kings. Chang Han was put in that kingdom which bordered upon Hans, to serve as a buffer against Liu Chi. Those generals and nobles who had conquered parts of the country and had followed Hsiang YÃ¼ to the capital were confirmed as kings of their territory. In so doing, a few former kings had to be moved, and T'ien Jung, who had conquered Ch'i (northern Shantung), but had refused to submit to Hsiang YÃ¼, was left out. P'eng YÃ¼eh, a bandit chieftain in eastern Honan, was likewise neglected. Liu Chi saw that any opposition to this unjust division was useless, so went to his capital, burning the bridges behind him; Hsiang YÃ¼ and the other generals went to their kingdoms. A month later Liu Chi returned, surprised and defeated Chang Han, and besieged him in his capital. Then Liu Chi overran Kuang-chung. In Ch'i, T'ien Jung likewise attacked the kings that Hsiang YÃ¼ had appointed to that region, and made himself king. Hsiang YÃ¼ attacked Ch'i first, for it was nearer his own kingdom and he was told that Liu Chi had no designs on the east. He defeated T'ien Jung, who was then assassinated. But Hsiang YÃ¼'s excesses in the 8CHAPTER I conquest of Ch'i so roused the people that the dead King's brother was able to raise an army to continue the struggle. Meanwhile Liu Chi had established himself firmly in Kuan-chung and invaded Honan as far as Lo-yang. When the assassination of the new Emperor by an emissary of Hsiang YÃ¼ became known, Liu Chi preached a crusade against the murderer, persuaded and compelled five kings to follow him, and marched east with a coalition army said to comprise five hundred and sixty thousand men. He captured and entered Hsiang YÃ¼'s capital, P'eng-ch'eng. Hsiang YÃ¼ was in Ch'i; with thirty thousand picked troops, he reached P'eng-ch'eng by forced marches, and surprised the coalition army at the city where it had been feasting, crushing it utterly. A hundred thousand men were forced into the rivers and drowned. Liu Chi escaped and fortified himself in Jung-yang (near the present Cheng-hsien, Honan). There he was reinforced by new troops from Kuan-chung and elsewhere. Then he sent emissaries to stir up rebellion against Hsiang YÃ¼ in Anhui, and sent Han Hsin, who was his titular General-in-chief, to conquer Shansi and Hopei, and thence to press into Shantung. When Hsiang YÃ¼ proceeded to besiege Liu Chi in Jung-yang, Liu Chi was now able to offer peace, dividing China in half, with only that part west of Jung-yang for his own. Hsiang YÃ¼ refused and pressed the siege. Liu Chi had to escape and permit the city to be captured; he returned to his impregnable fortress of Kuan-chung, and drew Hsiang YÃ¼ into northern Hupeh by going out of the southern part of Kuan-chung. Meanwhile P'eng YÃ¼eh was looting near P'eng-ch'eng, so Hsiang YÃ¼ had to return to his capital. Then Liu Chi recaptured the cities he had lost in Honan. When Hsiang YÃ¼ returned to Honan, Liu Chi fled, but sent assistance to P'eng YÃ¼eh, who burnt Hsiang YÃ¼'s stores. When Hsiang YÃ¼ pursued P'eng YÃ¼eh, Liu Chi crushed the army Hsiang YÃ¼ had left behind and took possession of his treasures. Meanwhile Han Hsin, in a brilliant campaign, had conquered the region into which he had been sent, and had established himself in Ch'i. Liu Chi entrenched himself in the hills northwest of Cheng-hsien, where he could draw food from the immense granary at Ao. There he was besieged by Hsiang YÃ¼. But Anhui and Shantung revolted against Hsiang YÃ¼; P'eng YÃ¼eh cut off his supplies, and finally Hsiang YÃ¼ had to make peace and agree to the same division of the country as that previously proposed by Liu Chi. When Hsiang YÃ¼ returned east, Liu Chi, disregarding the treaty, pursued him with fresh troops. By promises of territory, he induced Han Hsin, P'eng YÃ¼eh, and others to unite with his forces. Together 9INTRODUCTION they besieged Hsiang YÃ¼ in his camp near his capital. By a trick they got him to flee from his camp with a body of cavalry, pursued, and killed him in Dec./Jan. 203/2 B.C. Liu Chi now feared Han Hsin most, so he rode into Han Hsin's entrenchments, took away his army, and appointed him King of Ch'u. Ch'i was too valuable a territory to be left to anyone who might rebel. Liu Chi also sent his generals to overrun Ch'u and extinguish rebellion there. Liu Chi's nobles and adherents now proposed to make him Emperor. He declined the requisite number of times, and was enthroned on Feb. 28, 202 B.C. He proceeded to organize his empire and appoint his followers as marquises or kings. At a great banquet, he tactfully declared that his success had been due to Chang Liang, his chief advisor, Hsiao Ho, his Chancellor, and Han Hsin, his best general. The organization of the empire was largely the work of Hsiao Ho, who had done no fighting, but whom Kao-tsu esteemed most highly among all his nobles. Because of its natural strength, Kao-tsu moved his capital from Lo-yang to Ch'ang-an in Kuan-chung (Shensi). *â*â* During the remainder of his reign, Kao-tsu was chiefly occupied in putting down a series of revolts, and in appointing his sons and relatives to the kingdoms thus vacated. When Kao-tsu took the throne, there were seven kings in the empire who were not members of the imperial family, and no members of the imperial family who were kings. Gradually the kings who were not members of the imperial family revolted or were disposed of. The first to revolt was Tsang Tu, who had been a follower of Hsiang YÃ¼ and had been appointed by him as King of Yen, with his capital at the present Pei-p'ing. Kao-tsu marched against him, captured and executed him, and made his own boyhood companion and best friend, Lu Wan, the King of Yen. Then Li Chi, who was a marquis and had previously been a general of Hsiang YÃ¼, but had submitted to Kao-tsu, became afraid of treachery, and rebelled. He was routed. Han Hsin, now King of Ch'u, failed to deliver up promptly a friend who had taken refuge with him and who had been proscribed by Kao-tsu; Kao-tsu marched to Ch'u with an army, caught Han Hsin unprepared, and arrested him. He was imprisoned, then pardoned and made a marquis, but kept at court where he could be watched. Hanw Hsin had been made King of Hanh in Honan. But Kao-tsu wanted that territory free from possible rebels, so in the spring of 201, he moved Hanw Hsin to be King of a new Hanh, located in the present 10CHAPTER I Shansi. That autumn, the Huns besieged Hanw Hsin in his capital. Kao-tsu suspected his loyalty and made the mistake of sending him a letter reproving him; whereupon Hanw Hsin became suspicious of Kao-tsu's intentions and went over to the Huns. Kao-tsu himself took the field and routed Hanw Hsin, but Hanw Hsin's generals and the Huns continued to make incursions and to stir up trouble. At Lou-fan, Kao-tsu's soldiers were almost frozen to death; at P'ing-ch'eng, Kao-tsu was almost captured by the Huns. The invaders were finally driven out. At the court of his son-in-law, Chang Ao, King of Chao, Kao-tsu did not bother to be polite; the scrupulous Chancellor of the kingdom was enraged, and ambushed Kao-tsu the next time he traveled through the kingdom. A premonition saved Kao-tsu's life. When the conspiracy was discovered, its members committed suicide and Chang Ao was degraded to be a marquis. Then in Sept./Oct. 197, Ch'en Hsi, whom Kao-tsu sincerely trusted, and who had been made Chancellor in Tai (southwestern Chahar), was induced by Hanw Hsin to revolt. Kao-tsu was unprepared for another revolt; he rushed to Han-tan (in Hopei), but found himself without an army. Even an urgent call for troops was slow in bringing results. Kao-tsu spent the winter in Han-tan waiting. Not until spring was Ch'en Hsi's power broken and Hanw Hsin killed as he came to Ch'en Hsi's aid. Ch'en Hsi was pursued and killed the next winter. Meanwhile, in the capital, the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ had become so alarmed and suspicious that she lured Han Hsin into the palace and executed him. P'eng YÃ¼eh had sent troops to the assistance of Kao-tsu at Han-tan, but had failed to come himself; whereupon Kao-tsu impatiently and angrily sent a rebuke to P'eng YÃ¼eh. Then P'eng YÃ¼eh himself wanted to go to Kao-tsu. He was however warned that the Emperor would probably execute him in anger. So he feigned illness. Then a disgruntled official went to Kao-tsu and informed him that P'eng YÃ¼eh was planning rebellion. Kao-tsu thereupon had P'eng YÃ¼eh arrested, dismissed him from his kingdom, and sent him into exile. On the way he met the Empress; she promised to plead for him, but instead she had Kao-tsu informed that P'eng YÃ¼eh was again planning to revolt, whereupon he was executed. The remaining loyal kings who were not members of the imperial family were now very suspicious, wondering when their turn would come. Ch'ing Pu had been Hsiang YÃ¼'s Commander-in-chief, and had been made King of Chiu-chiang. An emissary of Kao-tsu had induced him to rebel against Hsiang YÃ¼; he had been compelled to flee to Kao-tsu in Jan./Feb. 204 with a very few men. Kao-tsu then used him to stir 11INTRODUCTION up trouble for Hsiang YÃ¼ in the lower Yangtze region, and gave him a kingdom in southern Anhui and northern Kiangsi. After the execution of Han Hsin and P'eng YÃ¼eh, Ch'ing Pu became very nervous, and started to collect troops so as not to be caught defenseless. Word of this move was brought to Ch'ang-an, and an envoy was sent to investigate; Ch'ing Pu feared what was coming, and put his army into the field in open rebellion. He was an able general and fighter; he routed two neighboring kings belonging to the imperial house, killing one of them. But Kao-tsu had kept a large standing army ready for emergencies; he was himself ill, nevertheless he took the field against Ch'ing Pu, routed him in northern Anhui, drove him south, and finally compelled him to flee. Ch'ing Pu was killed by the people at a stopping-place. After the death of Ch'ing Pu, no one else dared to rebel; indeed it is very doubtful that even he would have rebelled had he not felt that there was no other way to escape execution. It was discovered however that Lu Wan, the King of Yen, had had secret communication with the Huns and with Ch'en Hsi. Lu Wan had been afraid that he would be the next king to be dispossessed and killed, so had dallied with the thought of rebellion. Kao-tsu sent an emissary to investigate the matter. Some evidence was unearthed and Kao-tsu summoned Lu Wan to court. He claimed illness, so the Emperor sent two generals to attack him. Lu Wan did not think of resisting the imperial forces; he took his family and several thousand troops and moved just outside the Great Wall, hoping for a chance to come to court and beg his old friend for pardon. The Emperor's death deprived him of that chance, and he fled to the Huns, who gave him a kingdom. There was left now only one king not of the imperial houseâthe King of Ch'ang-sha. His kingdom was so small and unimportant that it was not worth while to disturb him. Kao-tsu's suspicions had eliminated almost all those not of his own family and had put his clan and the men from his prefecture into practically all the important positions. At his death, nine of Kao-tsu's sons and relatives occupied kingdoms. Kao-tsu was ill before he started out against Ch'ing Pu; a wound from a stray arrow became infected and killed him seven months later. While he was suffering from this wound, the problem of the succession to the throne became acute. As a political move in 205, ten years previously, Kao-tsu had appointed Ying, the son of the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼, as his Heir-apparent. The boy was now fifteen. He had been domineered over by his mother, and had turned out to be a weakling. Kao-tsu was not pleased with him, saying openly that Ying was not like himself. Kao-tsu's favorite concubine was the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i, whose 12CHAPTER I son, Ju-yi, was only nine. Kao-tsu liked the boy greatly and said, "He is like me." The Empress hated the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i bitterly, and Kao-tsu realized that after his death the Empress would probably try to injure the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i and Ju-yi. For Kao-tsu it was a choice between a weak heir with a strong and capable but cruel mother, and a mere child with a beloved mother. The Lady nÃ©e Ch'i's pleadings finally brought Kao-tsu to the point of ordering the feast at which he would announce the change. But during that feast he found that Ying had secured the following of certain learned men whom Kao-tsu had been unable to attract, and so refused to change the succession. When Kao-tsu died, on June 1, 195 B.C., the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ was at first uncertain whether her party would be able to enthrone her son. She concealed the death for four days and toyed with the notion of assassinating the prominent generals who might stand in the way of her son. But she soon saw that this policy was not really feasible, so distributed rewards to them liberally, and succeeded in enthroning her son on the day of Kao-tsu's burial, twenty-two days after his death. Kao-tsu was probably forty when rebellion first broke out against the Second Emperor. His early life had been spent in farming, holding a village office, and finally, as a bandit chieftain. His ability to make decisions rapidly and surely and his willingness to consult with and take advice of others were powerful assets. He was ambitious, yet he recognized the abilities of others, and realized that he must depend on others for his own greatness. He had the ability to choose the right man for the place. Han Hsin was utterly undistinguished, a common soldier who had been a mere peasant and a beggar, when Hsiao Ho recommended him to Kao-tsu; he was immediately made General-in-chief. Kao-tsu's personality attracted to him able men and kept them loyal. Hsiao Ho, his Chancellor, was his former official superior. He had been Chief Official in the prefecture where Liu Chi was a village official; when the Prefect showed himself incapable, Hsiao Ho assisted in summoning Liu Chi, helped to make him Prefect, and became his loyal follower. Li Yi-chi, a garrulous Confucian, was so attracted by the sight of Liu Chi that he voluntarily came to him. As a general, Kao-tsu showed great but not superlative capacity. He won most of his battles, but lost a respectable number of them. His tactics in the campaign against Hsiang YÃ¼ were admirable. Liu Chi refused to fight a pitched battle and kept Hsiang YÃ¼ running from one part of the country to another, then defeated Hsiang YÃ¼'s generals when Hsiang YÃ¼ had gone. Hsiang YÃ¼ never lost a battle in which he commanded, yet Liu Chi succeeded in eliminating him. It was as a 13INTRODUCTION politician that Kao-tsu showed himself most capable; he drew away from Hsiang YÃ¼ his capable subordinates, inducing them to revolt or stirring up Hsiang YÃ¼ to suspect and dismiss them. Kao-tsu was himself suspicious of even his greatest intimates and was quite careless about good manners. But he was just and not opinionated, so that he was quite ready to make changes. He was favored by circumstances in many ways, but he also created his circumstances. His achievements mark him as one of the world's great men. *â*â* The accession of Kao-tsu marks, in at least two important circumstances, an epoch in Chinese history. In the first place, it marks the final breakdown of the ancient aristocracy. The Ch'in dynasty had disestablished all noble titles. But the noble families remained, and retained much of their prestige. A large number of the early leaders against the Ch'in dynasty were aristocrats. Hsiang Liang and Hsiang YÃ¼, who became the dominant leaders, were members of the family which had given generals to the state of Ch'u, and owed much of their success to their family's prestige. When they killed the Administrator of K'uai-chi, the people came to them because of their family's reputation. That reputation likewise brought them important recruits when they started north. When Hsiang YÃ¼ killed Sung Yi, his family's prestige enabled the former to secure the following of the army. The first leaders in Ch'i, T'ien Tan, T'ien Fu, T'ien Tu, T'ien An, T'ien Jung, T'ien Kuang, and T'ien Heng were all of the princely family in Ch'i. Wei Chiu, who became King of Weih, was a scion of the ancient princes of Weih. Chao Hsieh, the first King of Chao after the rebellion began, was a descendant of the kings of Chao. Han Ch'eng, the first King of Hanh, was likewise a descendant of its kings. King Huai, the third King of Ch'u, was a grandson of the older King Huai of Ch'u. Indeed, there was a distinct tendency in all the states to make the descendant of some noble family the titular ruler of the state, although that state might have been conquered by a commoner. The commoner took a subordinate position, such as Chancellor or General-in-chief. Ch'en Ying was offered the kingship in Ch'u by the people, but he refused, for he did not come from a noble family. On the other hand, some of the early leaders, especially the earliest ones, were commoners. Few aristocrats would risk themselves until the people had taken the lead. Ch'en ShÃª, who inaugurated the revolt and became the first King of Ch'u, was a commoner. So were Ching ChÃ¼, the second King of Ch'u, whose reign lasted only three months, 14CHAPTER I Wu Ch'en, the first King of Chao, Chang Erh, the Lieutenant Chancellor and finally the King of Chao, Ch'en Yu, the General-in-chief of Chao who made himself King of Tai, Han Kuang, the first King of Yen, and others, including Liu Chi. But the aristocrats did not do so well in the test of severe competition. Indeed they did so poorly that in the apportionment of kingdoms after the downfall of the Ch'in dynasty, Hsiang YÃ¼ contemptuously disregarded birth. Thirteen kingdoms were given to commoners and only six to scions of noble families. Three of these nobles were given their kingly assignments merely because they had followed along in the train of Hsiang YÃ¼, so that he could not very well dismiss them; they were degraded by being removed to kingdoms smaller than those they had previously occupied. Two more were appointed to Ch'i, which seems to have had stronger aristocratic prejudices than other parts of the country. The only aristocrat who really distinguished himself was Hsiang YÃ¼. One king, Han Ch'eng, had shown himself so weak that Hsiang YÃ¼ killed him and put a commoner in his place. When King Huai dared to oppose Hsiang YÃ¼, the latter had him exiled and assassinated. The T'ien family in Ch'i showed some vigor, but it was crushed. Thus the drastic testing of war eliminated most of the noblemen very soon after the revolt began. The result of this debacle among the aristocracy was a turning of popular opinion away from the aristocrats and a strengthening of its attitude to those commoners who had dared to set themselves up as leaders. Liu Chi's followers were practically all commoners, and came, especially at first, mostly from his own district, P'ei. Only one aristocrat achieved any distinction in his groupâChang Liang, whose family had given the Chancellors to Hanh. He acted as Liu Chi's advisor; in physique he was sickly and weak, and as a general he was a failure, although as a strategist he was excellent. Practically all of Kao-tsu's nobles were self-made men who had achieved distinction in the hurly-burly of war. His Empress had an aristocratic surname, LÃ¼, but her family had no aristocratic connections. The accession of Kao-tsu thus represents a popular movement. He seems to have caught the popular imagination; he maintained personally the bearing and habits of a peasant rather than those of an aristocrat. He was continually squatting downâsomething that, in those days before the introduction of chairs, no cultivated person would do and all peasants did. The language he used so vituperatively was that of a peasant, so that many cultivated persons avoided him. Yet his very evident desire to help the common people attracted to him such people 15INTRODUCTION as Li Yi-chi (cf. 43:1b). The common people turned to Liu Chi and helped him. The old gentleman Tung (1A: 31a) advised Liu Chi to use the assassination of Emperor Yi as a pretext for a league against Hsiang YÃ¼. Thus the accession of Kao-tsu marks the definite ending of the ancient aristocratic tradition. He showed that even the highest position does not require aristocratic descent. Yet the aristocratic prejudice was not thus easily exorcised. For Kao-tsu himself there was fabricated a long pedigree, tracing his descent to the nobility of Chin and the early emperors; this pedigree served to convert many followers. The families he ennobled became as aristocratic as the old nobility had been. But there was a great difference, for the Han nobility was under the thumb of the emperor. The commonest punishment for crime was deprivation of noble rank. One after another family was deprived of its rank, so that very few noble families lasted more than a century. With kingdoms and marquisates thus enduring only for a time and revokable for cause, hereditary nobility counted for much less than before. Under such circumstances the aristocratic prejudice was greatly weakened, until at last it disappeared. In the second place, the accession of Kao-tsu marks the victory of the Confucian conception that the imperial authority is limited, should be exercised for the benefit of the people, and should be founded upon justice, over the legalistic conception of arbitrary and absolute sovereignty. While Kao-tsu and his successors technically remained absolute sovereigns, in practise their powers were much limited by custom. The theory and practise of government in the Ch'in state and empire was that of centralized absolutism. The Ch'in ideal of government was that "none will dare not to do what the ruler likes, but all will avoid what he dislikes" (The Book of Lord Shang, Duyvendak, p. 292). The primary concern of Lord Shang's theorizing, like that of Macchiavelli, was to make the ruler all powerful. In this respect, the First Emperor of the Ch'in dynasty was a thorough-going exemplar of the legalist theory. While Kao-tsu adopted many of the Ch'in practises, he nevertheless realized that what the people most condemned in the Ch'in rule was precisely this unreasoning absolutism, and he carefully avoided any semblance of such absolutism. He realized that he was handicapped by his peasant birth, and knew that he must gain the good-will of the people in order to maintain his rule. Hence he consciously adopted the policy of always considering the interests of the people and the requirements of justice and righteousness. Before he entered Kuan-chung, he sent an emissary to its people in order to acquaint them with his virtuous 16CHAPTER I intentions. At the surrender of the Ch'in king, he was careful to be generous and indulgent and to avoid plundering the people. One of his first official acts in Ch'in was to summon the people and inform them that he was doing away with the severe and cruel laws of Ch'inâan act which helped him greatly when he had later to reconquer the region. He refused to exact food from the people for his army, preferring to use that stored up in the government granaries. When Hsiang YÃ¼ gave him a kingdom in Hans, he asserted that injustice had been done because a covenant had been broken. He exempted from taxes those people who had been too heavily burdened in furnishing the armies with supplies, and granted his soldiers various and increasing exemptions. He continued the practise of giving the representatives of the people the position of San-lao, and had them advise with the officials so that the people would have a direct voice in government. He granted general amnesties on all appropriate occasions. He had his soldiers who had died in battle enshrouded and encoffined and sent home to be buried at official expense. He appointed caretakers for the graves of the great kings, in order that their hungry manes might not disturb the country. He waited to assume the title of Emperor until it was formally offered him by his followers, and then accepted it because "the vassal kings would be favored by it and they considered it to be an advantage to all the people in the world." At his accession he freed all slaves and restored to civil rights all refugees and exiles. He granted aristocratic ranks to all his soldiers. He fixed the amount of the military tax so that the people would not be oppressed by exactions. More important still, soon after his accession he adopted the practise of not taking the initiative in appointing any of his relatives or sons to any kingdoms or nobilities, but acting only at the suggestion of his followers. Of course it was always possible to give hints to others about what the Emperor wanted to be done. Yet this practise that the Emperor acts only at the suggestion of others became a real check upon absolutism. At first it seems to have been confined to the enfeoffment of the emperor's sons, but later it was extended to other important matters, so that the standard practise in enacting an administrative measure, even the appointment of an Empress, came to be that some official or group would memorialize the Emperor concerning what they thought should be done, and the Emperor approved the suggestion. This custom, that the ruler acts at the suggestion of his important subordinates, was a real and often effective limitation upon the imperial power. When the Emperor Hsiao-hui died, the Empress Dowager nÃ©n LÃ¼ was unable to obtain any effective power until one of the great officials 17INTRODUCTION suggested to her that she appoint her two nephews to the highest positions in the government and members of her own family as kings. Until that suggestion was made, she could only spend her time weeping helplessly. After it had been made, she rewarded very highly the person who first suggested it (cf. Glossary, sub Liu Tse). When this custom was disregarded by the ruler, the results were disastrous. After the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼ had dismissed the son of Emperor Hui from the throne, she asked the high officials to suggest his successor. The Emperor had had only this one son, although the Empress Dowager had enfeoffed six other babes on the pretense that they were his sons. The officials refused to suggest any of them for the throne, and the Empress Dowager, on her own motion, appointed one of these babes as Emperor. But the officials, by refusing to suggest him, had disclaimed responsibility for him, and, when the Empress Dowager died, they selected a son of Kao-tsu as the new emperor and killed this boy whom the Empress had put upon the throne. This Han custom was expressed most forcibly after the death of the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼. The high officials sent someone to tell her nephew, LÃ¼ Lu, who was then in control of the army, that "the establishing of the kings . . . was a matter all done after discussion with the great officials, announcement, and information to the vassal kings. The vassal kings considered it suitable." LÃ¼ Lu was warned that if he tried to do anything contrary to the will of the great officials, the greatest disaster would come upon him. So strongly did he realize the truth of the assumption behind those words, namely that the rule of the emperor is not absolute, but is vested in him in consultation with the great officials, that he finally (though too late) resigned his powers. After the extermination of the LÃ¼ family, the next emperor was chosen by the high officials and the heads of the Liu family. The Han rulers also recognized the principle that the empire belonged, not to Kao-tsu alone, but also to his followers and associates, for they had helped him to conquer it. As long as any of Kao-tsu's companions were alive, they and no others were given the important positions in the government. Perhaps this was the reason that the high officials tolerated the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼ as long as she was alive. She had taken an active part in the conquest of the country. In 179, Emperor Wen gave additional rewards to those of Kao-tsu's followers who were still alive, and sought out some thirty of his followers who had not been previously rewarded. For this reason, until 176, the imperial chancellors were all military men. Not until 150 was there an imperial chancellor who had not been a follower of Kao-tsu, and then it was Chou 18CHAPTER I Ya-fu, the son of Kao-tsu's General, Chou P'o, who had also been Chancellor under Emperor Wen. The first chancellor who was not even a son of Kao-tsu's followers was Wei Wan, appointed in 143 B.C. Thus Kao-tsu's followers controlled the government for sixty years after his accession. Even after that time, the government made an effort to continue the marquisates of Kao-tsu's outstanding followers, in spite of the lack and derelicitions of their heirs. As Kao-tsu said in an edict of 196 B.C., "I, by the spiritual power of Heaven and by my capable gentlemen and high officials, have subjugated and possess the empire. . . . Capable men have already shared with me in its pacification. Should it be that any capable persons are not to share with me in its comfort and its profit?" The emperor was thus limited by the necessity of giving high office to those who did outstanding services to the state. Since the government cultivated popular support and the Emperor recognized that he depended upon his officials, it was quite natural that Kao-tsu should have initiated the procedure which finally brought about the Chinese imperial civil service examination system. In an edict of 196 B.C., possibly at the instigation of Hsiao Ho, Kao-tsu ordered the officials to send to the Chancellor of State all people of excellent reputation and manifest virtue, so that their accomplishments and appearance could be recorded and they could be given positions. Emperors Wen and Wu continued this practise, and the examination system gradually grew out of it. We have said that this conception of imperial rule as limited by consultation with the high ministers and by moral considerations was specifically Confucian. This doctrine is to be found in the Book of History, where the great rulers consult their ministers on all important matters. It is the outgrowth of the attitude represented in that Book (II, iii, iv, 7), that Heaven sees as the people see, in Mencius (VII, ii, xiv, 1), when he says that the sovereign is inferior to the people and the spirits, and in HsÃ¼n-tzu (IX, 4), "The prince is the boat; the common people are the water. The water can support the boat, or the water can capsize the boat." The Han dynasty became the first great patrons of Confucianism and under Emperor Wu that philosophy became an important influence in the theory of government and in the training of government servants. It has not always been realized that this Confucian influence began with Kao-tsu. Kao-tsu was not himself a Confucian. He seems indeed to have had, especially in his earlier days, a deep dislike for the learned pedants of the time. It is said, in the biography of Li Yi-chi, that before 207 B.C., probably when Kao-tsu had just started out as a general, some literati came to him in full costume, with their literati's bonnets on, and that 19INTRODUCTION Kao-tsu, in order to show his contempt for them, suddenly snatched off a bonnet and urinated into it. It is also told that when, in May 205, Shu-sun T'ung came to Kao-tsu and wore his literatus's robes, Kao-tsu hated it, so that Shu-sun T'ung changed and wore short clothes like those worn in Ch'u. Thus Kao-tsu had an aversion to the sight of the Confucian literatus. That fact does not however warrant us in holding that Kao-tsu disliked Confucianism and was not influenced by it. Quite the contrary seems to have been the case. In Kao-tsu's father's home, four sons grew to maturity. The two oldest sons seem to have been farmers; Liu Chi, the third to grow up, studied military matters and became the Chief of a T'ing; Liu Chiao, the youngest, was sent to the state of Lu, which was not far from the homestead, and studied with three Confucian teachers. Later he studied the Book of Odes with Fou-ch'iu Po, a disciple of HsÃ¼n-tzu, who became the most outstanding member of the Confucian school. After Liu Chiao had been made the King of Ch'u, he summoned the three Confucian teachers with whom he had studied in his youth, and honored them as his Palace Grandees. In the time of the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼, he sent his own son to study under Foueh'iu Po. Liu Chiao is furthermore said to have been very fond of the Book of Odes and to have himself written a commentary on it. Thus Liu Chiao, the younger brother of Kao-tsu, was himself a devoted and life-long Confucian, who secured an excellent Confucian classical education at the center of Confucian culture. Liu Chiao was an intimate follower and companion of Kao-tsu from the time that Kao-tsu started out as a general. Kao-tsu left his older brother, Liu Chung (the oldest, Liu Po, had died previously), and Shen Yi-chi at the homestead to care for his father and wife, and took his other friends and followers with him to swell his army. It is said specifically that when Kao-tsu became Emperor, Liu Chiao waited upon him. He and Lu Wan, a boyhood friend, were the two persons closest to the Emperor. They had access to his private chambers, served as intermediaries, carried messages, and helped him to decide matters and make secret plans. Through his brother, much Confucian influence undoubtedly reached Kao-tsu. No one else of any education had as close relations with him; while Kao-tsu disliked the pedant and the pedant's appearance, yet he probably welcomed the Confucian teaching when it came to him divorced from the pedant. There were several others who undoubtedly influenced Kao-tsu towards Confucianism. The earliest was Chang Liang, who came to Kao-tsu in February 208. He was not a literatus, but a politician, the descendant 20CHAPTER I of the chancellors in Hanh. He was a well-educated man, and on occasion is represented as using classical allusions to back up advice on politics in a thoroughly Confucian manner. Kao-tsu respected him very highly, and publicly recognized him as his best advisor. Li Yi-chi was a well-read Confucian who came to Kao-tsu in March/ April 207. He was known to the people of his town as a Master or teacher, sheng, and came voluntarily to call upon and advise Kao-tsu. The latter contemptuously squatted upon the k'ang with two maids washing his feet, as he received him. But Li Yi-chi was more than a pedant, even though he probably wore his literatus's robes on that occasion. He was over sixty years old, six feet tall (English measure), and fearless. He reproved Kao-tsu for his discourtesy; the latter, who seems to have been trained to respect his elders, was impressed by the old man, arose, dismissed the maids, begged Li Yi-chi's pardon, and escorted him to the seat of honor. At that time Kao-tsu could not afford to lose any worthwhile advice; Li Yi-chi delighted him with stories of earlier times, then gave him direction and assistance in capturing a neighboring city. For that Kao-tsu rewarded him; the old man was quite garrulous; he had earned the nickname of "the Mad Master," and Kao-tsu liked him. At the time, Kao-tsu was giving honorary titles to those of his followers who distinguished themselves; to Li Yi-chi he gave the title of Baronet Enlarging Our Territory. Kao-tsu respected the old man, consulted with him about important matters, and sent him as a confidential envoy on important commissions. In April 205, when Kao-tsu came to Lo-yang, the old gentleman Tung, who was a San-lao or leader of the people, stopped him and advised him, in thoroughly Confucian terms, to declare a crusade against Hsiang YÃ¼ because the latter had caused the assassination of his superior, the Emperor Yi. This practise, that of leading a military force to chastize a wicked ruler, is typically Confucian; in the Book of History Kings T'ang and Wu are both said to have led such a crusade and to have founded their dynasties in so doing. The notion was welcomed by Kao-tsu; he found it worked, for it enabled him to lead a coalition army of 560,000 men with five kings against Hsiang YÃ¼, and to capture his capital. After this experience, Kao-tsu would not have looked with disfavor upon a teaching that so helped him against his enemy. Confucianism now became to him a most useful and helpful philosophy. Shu-sun T'ung had been made an Erudit by the Second Emperor, and had served Hsiang YÃ¼ as an Erudit. When, in May 205, Kao-tsu captured P'eng-ch`eng, Hsiang YÃ¼'s capital, Shu-sun T'ung, who followed the policy of making himself useful to whoever was in power, 21INTRODUCTION surrendered to Kao-tsu. He pleased Kao-tsu with stories of fighting and war, avoiding any typically Confucian teaching. Kao-tsu made him an Erudit and gave him a title. When Kao-tsu ascended the throne, Shu-sun T'ung arranged the ceremony. After the court had been established, Kao-tsu found himself at a loss without any court ceremonial. He himself believed in simple direct intercourse without bothering about ceremonial. Possibly what he most disliked in Confucianism was its excessive ceremonialism. Now Kao-tsu's courtiers, who were his old camp-companions, were behaving in the court just as they did in camp. Especially when under the influence of liquor, they quarrelled, shouted, acted mannerlessly, and even pulled out their swords and hacked at the columns of the palace. Kao-tsu was very much worried, for he saw that this sort of conduct must somehow be stopped. Shu-sun T'ung offered to remedy the matter by arranging a court ceremonial. Kao-tsu saw that something of that sort was necessary, so told him to go ahead, with the admonition, "Make it easy." Shu-sun T'ung called some thirty odd literati from Lu, and with them created a court ceremonial by mixing the Confucian ceremonial with that of the Ch'in court. After more than a month of preparation, the ceremonial was performed out in the country before Kao-tsu, who approved it, and had it put into practise at the court of November 201. After the ceremony Kao-tsu was so impressed that he said, "Now, I have today known what is the greatness of being an Emperor." Thus Kao-tsu even accepted a semi-Confucian ceremonial for his court. Lu Chia came to Kao-tsu possibly at the same time as Li Yi-chi, for we find them associated together only a few months later. He was also a highly educated man and was sent as an envoy to Ch'ao T'o, King of Nan-yÃ¼eh, whose capital was at the present Canton. After his return in 196 or 195 B.C., he is said to have quoted the Book of Odes and the Book of History to Kao-tsu, whereat the latter scolded him and said, "I got the empire on horseback; why should I bother with the Book of Odes or the Book of History?" Lu Chia replied, "You got it on horseback, but can you rule it from horseback?" Then he proceeded to quote cases, from ancient history, of kings who had lost their thrones through their wickedness, concluding with the Ch'in dynasty, which Kao-tsu had himself overthrown. Kao-tsu blushed for shame and asked Lu Chia to write a book explaining why these rulers had lost their kingdoms. That book has come down to us. It is a piece of thoroughly Confucian exhortation, which argues that the rise and fall of dynasties depends on their virtue. It is said that when each chapter was completed, Lu Chia read it to Kao-tsu, who praised it and gave the book its 22CHAPTER I title, the Hsin-yÃ¼, "New Discourses." This event undoubtedly deepened Kao-tsu's gradual conversion to Confucianism. As his experience of statecraft increased and as he saw deeper into the necessities of an empire, Confucianism thus looked more and more attractive. It is recorded that when in December/January 195/4 Kao-tsu passed through Lu, he sacrificed a suovetaurilia to Confucius, but this record is very likely unhistorical. The climax of Kao-tsu's allegiance to Confucianism came when he proposed to change the succession to the throne. Chang Liang, Shu-sun T'ung, and others remonstrated with Kao-tsu against this change, but without effect. Because of Kao-tsu's lack of manners, some Confucians had refused to come to his court. Kao-tsu had by this time realized how deep was the influence of the Confucians with the people. He knew that just as he had won the throne, so his successors could only keep it by securing the respect of the people. When, in the first part of 195 B.C., Kao-tsu came actually to change the succession, and found that his Empress had succeeded in bringing to follow her son, Ying, four outstanding Confucians who had previously refused to come to Kao-tsu, he refused to change the succession, for he knew how powerful was their influence. Thus Kao-tsu finally bowed to the influence of Confucianism. The gradual turning of Kao-tsu to Confucianism does not mean that other philosophies had no influence. Chang Liang was much more a Taoist than a Confucian. The imperial administration was taken over from the Ch'in court, and brought with it much Legalist influence. Ts'ao Ts'an was a devotee of Lao-tsu. It was only gradually that Confucianism came to have nominally exclusive sway as a philosophy in the Han court. Under Emperor Wen, there were Erudits who specialized in the non-Confucian philosophers; the only Confucian erudit at his court was Chia Yi. It was not until 141 that Emperor Wu forbade the promotion of scholars who were learned in the non-Confucian teachings. Even after that, many Legalist practises persisted. Thus the victory of Confucianism was only a gradual growth, yet it was a natural continuation of the development in Kao-tsu's own thought. *â*â* The tremendous achievement of Kao-tsu in rising from the status of a farmer boy to Emperor against the keenest competition, early attracted the attention of thoughtful persons and led them to state reasons for his victory. At a grand feast after Kao-tsu's accession, he is said to have asked his courtiers to name the reasons for his victory. Kao Ch'i and 23INTRODUCTION Wang Ling declared that although Kao-tsu was unmannerly and rude to people, while Hsiang YÃ¼ was kind and respectful, yet Kao-tsu rewarded his associates adequately, sharing his conquests with them, whereas Hsiang YÃ¼ was suspicious of capable people, did not give them any recognition for their victories, and kept the fruits of victory for himself and his family. Kao-tsu replied that there was an additional factor: Hsiang YÃ¼ did not trust his most capable advisor, whereas Kao-tsu succeeded because he could make use of his followersâa most tactful speech. Kao Ch'i and Wang Ling undoubtedly hit upon a most unfortunate defect in Hsiang YÃ¼. He seems to have been jealous of anyone else who achieved any military glory. He probably minimized other people's achievements. He had several uncles and cousins who had to be taken care of, so that he was not free to give the best territory to others. He also seems to have been suspicious of those who were not of his own clan. (Kao-tsu was also suspicious, but he trusted the men of P'ei, who were his early followers, and gave them high positions.) As a consequence, the best of Hsiang YÃ¼'s followers left him or rebelled. Han Hsin came to Kao-tsu because Hsiang YÃ¼ had rebuffed him. Ch'ing Pu, Hsiang YÃ¼'s Commander-in-chief, rebelled and came to Kao-tsu because of the treatment he had received from Hsiang YÃ¼. At the division of the territory, the kings complained that Hsiang YÃ¼ had given himself too much of the best territory. Hsiang YÃ¼'s unfortunate temperament thus more than undid all he accomplished by his wonderful military ability. About 22 A.D. Pan Piao, Pan Ku's father, wrote his Discussion on the Destiny of Kings (cf. ch. 100), in which he argues that Kao-tsu's rise was not due to chance, as many were saying, and enumerates five reasons for that victory: (1) his descent from Yao, (2) his unusual body and features, (3) his military success, (4) his liberality, perspicacity, benevolence, and consideration for others, and (5) his keenness in judging others and in selecting his subordinates. He adds that Kao-tsu was faithful and sincere; he made far-reaching plans and was willing to accept the advice of others; he did not hesitate, but acted promptly; and he was favored by the supernatural powers with marvellous events. Pan Piao concludes that Kao-tsu's success was due to supernatural influence. His list of reasons undoubtedly contains much insight. There have been very many other such lists, from early Han times down. We mention here three further factors. First, Kao-tsu made the people feel that he was governing in their interests. This factor appeared in his conception of rule as ethical, not an arbitrary absolutism. 24CHAPTER I Secondly, there was probably a general fellow-feeling among the common people for this commoner who was aspiring to the supreme position. The oppression of the aristocrats, which culminated in the cruelties of the Ch'in dynasty, brought about a reaction in popular feeling, so that many common people came to prefer for their ruler a commoner to an aristocrat. Especially when the aristocrats showed their weakness as generals in competition with others, this feeling was bound to have been intensified. The actions of Hsiang YÃ¼, the outstanding aristocrat, did not help matters. His carelessness for the people's lives became notorious. At the storming of Hsiang-ch'eng, in June 208, he massacred every living thing in the city. In July/August 207, when the surrendered army of Chang Han threatened trouble, he had the whole army massacred, said to be more than twenty thousand men. Such acts were sure to set the common people against the aristocrats. By contrast, Kao-tsu took care to be generous and mild. When, in October 208, the older generals of King Huai had to select someone to go west and attempt to capture the Ch'in capital, they chose Kao-tsu rather than Hsiang YÃ¼, because of the reputation for destructiveness that Hsiang YÃ¼ had acquired at Hsiang-ch'eng, and because of Kao-tsu's reputation for generosity. They were afraid that the news of Hsiang YÃ¼'s approach would nerve the people of Kuan-chung to defend their country vigorously, in which case it would be impregnable. Kao-tsu acquainted these people with his mild purposes, and they made no move to support their rulers, so that the capital fell. After Kao-tsu had acquired their confidence and got them to mount their natural barriers, Hsiang YÃ¼ did not even attempt to invade Kuan-chung. Kao-tsu's generous and kindly treatment of the people thus brought to him the fellow-feeling of the people. They realized that he was one of them. More than once the leaders of the people came to him with important advice. His lack of manners and use of churlish language towards even his most distinguished followers probably accentuated the kindly feeling of the people to him. He won because he manipulated public opinion in his favor; that feeling was so strong two centuries later that, at the downfall of his dynasty, only another Han dynasty with the same surname could gain the throne. In the third place, Kao-tsu introduced not only new ideas, but also new blood into the government. His nobles were self-made men who fought their way to distinction. His government was organized by Hsiao Ho. The latter was a personal friend and fellow-villager of Kao-tsu, who had been promoted to be Chief Official in P'ei because of his skill in the law. He was a trained administrator, and was put in charge 25INTRODUCTION of Kuan-chung as Chancellor while Kao-tsu went out fighting. Hsiao Ho thus administered Kao-tsu's base and organized Kao-tsu's supplies. He furthermore enacted the fundamental laws of the Han empire and gave to the government its organization. He performed this task so well that for half a century afterwards, his successors merely followed in his footsteps. He built the imperial palaces in a grander style than Kao-tsu had conceived of, because he knew that this magnificence was necessary to impress the people. When the campaign against Hsiang YÃ¼ was over, Kao-tsu awarded to Hsiao Ho the first place in the court and gave him the title of Chancellor of State, even though he had done no fighting, for Kao-tsu realized the importance of Hsiao Ho's work. To the frugal and simple administration of government by Hsiao Ho and his assistants must be credited much of Kao-tsu's success. After Hsiao Ho, except for his immediate successor and the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼'s uncle, both of whom were not important historically, the high title of Chancellor of State was not used again, so great was the respect of the dynasty for Hsiao Ho. Whether we shall ever be able to state all of the reasons for the success of Kao-tsu is doubtful. His own personality, the mistakes of his opponents, especially of the Ch'in dynasty and Hsiang YÃ¼, Kao-tsu's cultivation of the people's good will, the fellow-feeling of the people for this commoner, and the ability of the new blood he introduced into the government, especially Hsiao Ho, are undoubtedly important factors. 27 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] [FIRST DIVISIONâTHE IMPERIAL ANNALS] Chapter I THE FIRST [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [The Emperor]1 1 Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) shows that the word ti was not originally in the title of the first twelve chapters, and that these chapters were merely called "Annals." The Ching-yu ed. (1034-5), prepared in the Imperial Academy, has not this character in the title of the first twelve chapters. Ch. 100B, in summarizing each chapter, likewise does not use ti. In HS 31: 22a, a cross reference is made to ch. 1, and ti is not used. Yen Shih-ku (581-645) in a comment in ch. 2 refers to ch. 1 without using ti. Elsewhere references in the text and by Yen Shih-ku similarly do not use this word. Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) adds that the Ch'ien-tao ed. (1171) likewise does not use ti or divide the chapters into parts, and that Yen Shih-ku divided the chapters into parts. The words that have been supplied in the heading of this chapter are in the present text or in the Chinese table of contents. The first part of this chapter is copied, almost verbatim, from SC ch. 7 and 8, with very few significant variations. Not until the second part of the chapter is much new material added. This practise of copying verbatim from earlier sources is the common practise in writing Chinese history; the SC does it constantly. It does not constitute plagiarism in China, it was merely the commonly accepted practise and is considered the surest method of securing dependable records. In ancient times no credit needed to be given to works from which passages were copied, for no credit was expected, and educated persons (who knew the books and whose opinion was alone worth while) would know whence statements were taken. The HS says in its introduction (100B: 1a) "Hence I have scrutinized and have taken from the previous records, and have put together and compiled what I have heard." Kao-[Tsu] PART I Kao-tsu was a man from the hamlet of Chung-yang [in the district] town of Feng, [prefecture2 2 In the Ch'ing period a hsien was a sub-division of a prefecture ; in Han times, however, as Chavannes remarks (cf. Mh, II, 531), there was no administrative division between a hsien and a commandery, hence I have followed him in translating hsien for Han times as "prefecture." The Han dynasty's commandery corresponded roughly to the modern province in that it was the primary subdivision of the country, although the ancient term , which I have translated "province," was later also put into use. Under the Ch'in dynasty, there were 36 commanderies; under the Han the number kept increasing until there were 108. A "district town" was a walled city which was the administrative center for a subdivision of a prefecture. In ancient times the was a large walled city and the was a small walled town; under the influence of the Lord of Shang, Kung-sun Yang, the Ch'in dynasty had organized towns into districts, which districts were often given the name of their walled towns. The districts were subdivided into t'ing (cf. p. 29, n. 3), and the t'ing were further subdivided into hamlets. It is an interesting fact that quite a few of Kao-tsu's early followers came from the same district as he: Hsiao Ho, Ts'ao Ts'an, Wang Ling, Chou P'o, Fan K'uai, Hsia-hou Ying, Chou Hsieh (cf. HS ch. 41), Chou Ho, Chou Ch'ang, and Jen Ao (cf. HS ch. 42); while his general Lu Wan came from the same hamlet as Kao-tsu. of] P'ei. 28KAO-TSU 2a His family name was Liu. One day the old dame, 1A:2a his mother, was resting upon the dyke of a large pond 2b when she dreamed that she had a meeting with a supernatural being.1 1 A supposed ancestor of Kao-tsu, Liu Lui, is said to have tamed dragonsâthus the story about Kao-tsu's conception would appear natural. The reliable commentators do not even give the surname of his mother. Huang-fu Mi (215-282), a decidedly unreliable source, says, "The old dame was probably surnamed Wang ." She died before Kao-tsu came to the throne, so that her surname was not preserved. Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831) notes that the T'ai-p'ing Huan-yÃ¼ Chi (written by Yo Shih, 930-1007) tells that 6 li north of the city of Feng there was a large marsh. The Book of Odes, I, xii, x, 1 (Legge, p. 213) has a similar passage, "By the dyke of that marsh. . . . There is the beautiful lady." The word yÃ¼ is said by Yen Shih-ku to mean "a meeting; to meet without having an appointment is called yÃ¼." Wang Min-sheng (1720-1798) adds that sexual intercourse is implied. Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831) adds that the conception here is similar to that in the stele of 175 A.D. to the Emperor Yao, which says, "Ch'ing-tu had intercourse with a red dragon, and gave birth to Yi Yao," [Yi was the surname of Yao], and the Ling-t'ai stele at Ch'eng-yang, which says, "She wandered and glanced around on the shore of the [Yellow] River, and, affected by intercourse with a red dragon, she then gave birth to Yao." This account thus likens Kao-tsu to his supposed ancestor, Yao. At the time there was thunder and lighting, and it became dark. When [Kao-tsu's] father, the T'ai-kung,2 2 T'ai-kung is a term of respectful address for an aged and respected grandfather. It merely means, "the aged and respected head of the family." Huang-fu Mi (215-282), who is not reliable, says that his name was Chih-chia . Wang Fu (i &amp; ii cent.) said that his name was T'uan . Chang Shou-chieh (fl. 737) quotes the Ch'un-ch'iu Wu-ch'eng (now lost, written before 386), as saying, "The old dame Liu [Kao-tsu's grandmother] dreamed [about] a red bird like a dragon playing [with her]. After that she gave birth to Chih-chia." None of these sources is reliable; perhaps Kao-tsu's father, like his sons, had no given name. came to look for her, he saw a 29KAO-TSU 1A: 2b scaly dragon1 1 The HS writes ; the SC (8: 2a) writes chiao ; so does HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh (148-209) in his Han-chi, and the Wen-hsÃ¼an (ca. 530). Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that HS ch. 51 reads as HS ch. 1 does, but we have not been able to find this passage. He also says that these two characters were interchanged. Hence we have followed the SC, for the HS is copying it here. The Kuang-ya (by Chang Yi, fl. 227-233) says, "When it has scales it is called a chiao dragon." The Shuo-wen (ca. 100) defines chiao as follows: "A sort of dragon. When in a pool there are 3600 fish, the chiao comes and is made their leader. He is able to lead the fish and to fly. If a basket fish trap is put in the water, he thereupon leaves." Couvreur (Dict. Classique) says that the chiao is a crocodile. Cf. 6: 29a and note 29.2. above her. After that she was with child and subsequently gave birth to Kao-tsu. 248 B.C. Kao-tsu was a man with a prominent nose and a dragon forehead. He had a beautiful beard on his 3a chin and cheeks. On his left thigh were seventy-two black moles.2 2 Seventy-two was a mystic number, being the number of the days of each year attributed to each of the five elements, the number of ancient sovereigns who had performed the feng and shan sacrifices, the number of the metals, etc. Cf. Mh II, 325, n. 6. It was also the number of the Ch'ih-yu brotherhood, cf. Granet, Chinese Civilization, p. 197. He was kindly disposed to others, benevolent, and liked people. His mind was vast. He always had large ideas and so did not follow the same productive occupations [as those followed by] the members of his family. When he grew up, he took the tests for officials, and was made Chief of the Szu-shui T'ing.3 3 The t'ing was an administrative division usually composed of ten hamlets , each of 25 to 50 families. Stein (Serindia, II, 748) found that, at the boundary, a t'ing was expected to maintain a tui or company (whose average effective strength was 150 men), both as to personnel and supplies. Probably something of the same sort was required in China proper in times of war. Ten t'ing usually made a district . Cf. Mh II, 236, n. 1. The chief of a t'ing had charge of both a military and civil affairs of the t'ing. Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) writes, "In ancient times he was called `The Bearer of the Crossbow.' " In Han times he used all five weapons: crossbow, lance, sword, bow, and cuirass. Instead of "the Szu-shang T'ing", the SC (Mh II, 336) reads "the Szu-shui T'ing", which reading is confirmed by HHS, Tr. 20: 13b. Shang is an error for shui. The Kua-ti-chih 5: 5b (vii cent.) said, "The Szu-shui T'ing is in HsÃ¼-chou, 100 paces east of P'ei Hsien, and has a temple to Kao-tsu." There was none of the officials in the 30KAO-TSU great hall1 1 Yen Shih-ku writes, " `In the great hall' [means] in the great hall of the commandery headquarters." whom he did not dare to treat cavalierly. 1A: 3a He liked wine and women. He frequently went to an old dame Wang and an old lady Wu to buy wine 3b on credit. While he was sleeping off the effects of the wine, the old lady Wu and the old woman Wang frequently saw wonderful sights above him.2 2 The SC reads differently: these women "often saw a dragon above him and wondered at it." HS 100A: 11a reads, "He had prodigies of dragons and snakes." Every time Kao-tsu came to buy wine, he would stay and drink, and they would sell several times [as much as usual],3 3 Chao Yi (1727-1814) suggests an interpretation for this sentence similiar to the story in HS 8: 3a, that when Emperor HsÃ¼an, as a young man, bought cakes, he made them popular, so that the seller made great sales. and when they saw the wonderful sights, at the end of the year, these two shop-keepers often broke up his accounts4 4 Accounts were kept on pieces of bamboo or wood. and forgave his debt. Kao-tsu was frequently made to do fatigue duty in Hsien-yang, and had free access to see the Emperor of the Ch'in [dynasty]. Moved in spirit he would heave a deep sigh and say, "Ah! A real man should be like this." A man of Shan-fu, the old gentleman LÃ¼, was a good friend of the magistrate in [the city of] P'ei. 4a In order to escape a feud, he came to [the magistrate] as his guest and consequently settled there. When the eminent and distinguished persons and officials of P'ei heard that the magistrate had an important 31KAO-TSU 1A: 4a guest, they all went to congratulate him.1 1 Such congratulations necessitate the bringing of gifts, in this case, of money, and a feast in return. Hsiao Ho was the superintendant of officials and took charge of the offerings. He made announcement to the prominent guests, saying, "Anyone who comes presenting less than a thousand cash will be directed to sit below the [main] hall." Although Kao-tsu was [only] Chief of a t'ing, he used to treat his fellow-officials contemptuously, so he falsely had written on his card: "I come to congratulate [with an offering of] ten thousand cash." Really he did not bring even one cash. When his card was sent in, the old gentleman LÃ¼ was greatly surprised, arose, and welcomed him at the door. [Now] the old gentleman LÃ¼ liked to physiognomize2 2 It is still a common practice in China to tell a person's fortune by `reading his face.' This is the practise referred to. HsÃ¼n-tzu (ca. 320-235 B.C.) attacks this practise (cf. his ch. V). Wang Ch'ung (29-97) defends it in the Lun-heng, ch. ii (Forke p. 305), and quotes this passage. people and it was because he noticed Kao-tsu's appearance and features that he greatly honored him. He escorted him in and seated him at the seat of honor. Hsiao Ho said, "Liu Chi 4b certainly talks very big, but he achieves little." Because Kao-tsu was contemptuous of the guests, he thereupon seated himself on the place of honor without any signs of nervousness. When the drinking drew to an end,3 3 So that some of the guests were leaving. Guests do not necessarily stay through a feast. Wen Ying (fl. ca. 196-220) says, "It says that of those who drank wine half had left and half were [still] present." the old gentleman LÃ¼ glanced at Kao-tsu in such a way as definitely to detain him. After the drinking was over, the old gentleman LÃ¼ said, "Your servant, from his youth, 32KAO-TSU has liked to physiognomize people. I have physiog- 1A: 4b nomized many people. [But] none of them had [as auspicious] a physiognomy as yours, Chi. You, Chi, should take care of yourself. There is a daughter born to your servant whom I would like to make your hand-maid."1 1 He uses a set expression for "wife," which is literally, "the concubine of the dust-pan and broom." The word "concubine" gives it a depreciatory turn. Cf. Mh II, 328, n. 3. When the feast was over, the old lady LÃ¼ was angry with the old gentleman LÃ¼, and said: "Previously you, sir, have always wanted to hold this girl precious in order to give her [in marriage] to some distinguished person. The magistrate of P'ei is your good friend. He has asked for her, but you would not give her to him. Why did you yourself thus senselessly promise to give her to this Liu Chi?" The old gentleman LÃ¼ replied, "This is not anything that children or women can understand." In the end he gave her to Kao-tsu. The daughter of the old gentleman LÃ¼ was [later] the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ and gave birth to the Emperor Hsiao-hui and the Princess YÃ¼an of Lu. 5a Kao-tsu once asked for leave to go home to his fields. While the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ and her two children were in the fields,2 2 The SC says that they were weeding. At the time, the Empress LÃ¼ was merely a peasant woman; the historian respectfully uses the title later bestowed upon her. So with the children. an old man went by and asked for a drink; the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ therefore fed him. The old man physiognomized the Empress and said: "Madam will be the most honorable 5b personage in the world." She [then] asked him to physiognomize her two children. When he saw the Emperor Hsiao-hui, he said, "The reason that 33KAO-TSU 1A: 5b Madam will be such an honorable personage is this boy." He physiognomized the Princess YÃ¼an of Lu [and said] also, "Both will be honorable personages." When the old man had gone, Kao-tsu happened to come in from a neighboring dwelling. The Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ told him everything, "A stranger has gone by who physiognomized me and the children, [and told me that] we would all be very honorable personages." When Kao-tsu questioned her, she added, "He has not yet gone far." So he went after him and caught up with him. When he questioned the old man, the old man said, "The madam and children whom I have just looked at are all like you, sir [in princely signs].1 1 The SC reads for the HS . Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265) and Ch'ien Tao-chao (1744-1813) think that the SC's reading should be adopted. The Han-chi 1: 3a however reads, "The [princely signs of] the madam and children are due to your power, sir," and Yen Shih-ku wishes to read this passage similarly. The Lun-heng (by Wang Ch'ung, 29-97) reads like the SC. We have adopted its reading. Your physiognomy, sir, is honorable beyond all telling." Kao-tsu thereupon thanked him, saying, "If it should really happen as you say, I shall not dare to forget what you have done for me." When Kao-tsu became an honorable personage, no one knew where the old man was. When Kao-tsu was the Chief of a t'ing, he constructed a hat of bamboo-skin and ordered his thief-catcher to go to Hsieh to have it perfected.2 2 Ying Shao writes that anciently there were two subordinates to the Chief of a t'ing: one, called the T'ing-fu , whose duty it was to open and shut the gates, sweep and clean [streets]; the other, called the Thief-catcher ch'iu-tao , pursued and caught robbers and thieves. Chavannes (Mh II 330) did not understand that ch'iu-tao was the name of an officer, so mistranslated this sentence. For an account of this ceremonial article, cf. Glossary sub Hat of the House of Liu. From 6a time to time he wore it. When he became an honorable personage, he wore it constantly; it is 34KAO-TSU called the "Hat of the House of Liu." 1A: 5b Kao-tsu, in his capacity as the Chief of a t'ing, had to escort convict laborers1 1 Enslavement or convict labor was a common punishment; a criminal could be sentenced to enslavement for a number of years. The First Emperor used these convicts on his works. As a guard, Kao-tsu was personally responsible for each prisoner, and would be punished if one was lost. to Mount Li for the prefecture. Many [of the convict laborers] escaped on the way. He thought to himself that before he arrived [at his destination] all of them would have escaped. When [the party] got to the Tse-chung T'ing, west of Feng, he stopped to drink. At night he unbound and set free all the convict laborers he was escorting, saying, "Gentlemen, all go away. From this time on I too will abscond."2 2 Since he had lost his prisoners, Kao-tsu could not return home, and also became a fugitive. Some ten odd of the stout fellows among the convict laborers were willing to follow him. Kao-tsu, under the influence of liquor, was 6b traversing the marsh [one] night. He had ordered a man to go in front. The man who was in front returned and reported, "Up ahead there is a large serpent blocking the path. We had better go back." Kao-tsu was drunk and said, "When a strong man walks along, what is there to fear?" Then he went ahead, drew his sword, and cut the serpent in two.3 3 The San-fu Huang-t'u (quoted in iii cent.; prob. completed by 587) 6:2a, b sub Ling-chin Nei-fu, says, "When the Grand Emperor [Kao-tsu's father] was an humble person, he wore a sword that was three feet long. On it there were unintelligible words engraved. Tradition says it was made just at the time when `Kao-tsung of the Yin [dynasty, i.e., the Emperor Wu-ting, reigned 1324-1266 B.C.] attacked the Demon region.' [A quotation from the Book of Changes, hexagram 63, Legge, p. 205. The `Demon region' was among the Western Jung.] When the Grand Emperor was travelling around Feng and P'ei, in the middle of the mountains, at a temporary lodge in an obstructed valley there was a man casting metal. The Grand Emperor stopped beside him and asked him, `What implement are you casting?' The workman laughingly said, `I am casting swords for the Son of Heaven. Be careful and do not speak.' He [later] said, `If I could secure the sword which you, sir, are wearing, mix it [with the metal], and cast it, then it would make a marvellous implement, which could conquer and subjugate the world. The essence of the Pleiades is helping, the [element] wood is decreasing and [the element] fire is increasing [water was the element by which the Ch'in dynasty is said to have ruled, and fire the element of the Han dynasty]âthis is an unusual omen.' The Grand Emperor loosened his pi-shou [a sword with its point in the form of a spoon], and threw it into the furnace. When the sword was completed, he killed three victims in order to anoint [the sword] with the blood of the sacrifice. The workman asked him where he had gotten this [sword which had been melted], and the Grand Emperor replied, `At the time of King Chao-hsiang of Ch'in [306-251 B.C.], I was going along a path in the fields and a rustic gave it to me, saying, "This is a supernatural thing from the time of the Yin [dynasty]." ' The workman thereupon took the sword and gave it to the Grand Emperor. The Grand Emperor therefore gave it to Kao-tsu. Kao-tsu wore it, and this it was which cut in two the white snake. When he had subjugated the world, he stored it in the treasury for valuables. The guardian of the storehouse saw a white vapor like a cloud coming out of the door, in shape like a dragon or snake. The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ changed the treasury's [name] and called it, `The Storehouse for Supernatural Metallic [Objects].' When the Emperor Hui came to the throne, he used this treasury to store the [imperial] reserved military equipment, and its name was called, `The Palace Office for Supernatural Metallic [Objects, i.e., ling-chin nei-fu]." The Chin Dynastic History, in the Treatise on Carriages and Clothes, says, "In the time of the Emperor Hui, the military treasury was burnt by fire." The Shih-chi Cheng-yi (pub. 737) quotes the Kua-ti-chih, (vii cent.) as saying, "The Ditch [Where] the Snake Was Cut in Two has its source in the territory of Chung-p'ing, P'ei Hsien, HsÃ¼-chou, [in present Kiangsu]. Hence old people say, `It is the place where Kao-tsu cut in two the snake.' [It flows] to [a place] 15 li west of the hsien, where it flows into the P'ao River." The serpent was divided into two 35KAO-TSU 1A: 6b parts and the way cleared. After walking several li, he was overpowered by drink1 1 The SC, the Official ed. of the HS (1739) the Academy ed. (prob. 1124), and Lin Chih-lung's ed. (1581) read ; Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) points out that gives a much better sense. We have followed him. and slept. When a man [who came along] afterwards reached the place where the serpent had been, an old woman was 7a weeping there in the night. The man asked the old woman why she wept, and the old woman replied, "A man killed my son." The man said, "How did your son come to be killed?" and the old woman replied, "My son is the son of the White God. He metamorphosed himself into a serpent and blocked the way. Just now the son of the Red God has cut him in two; hence I weep [for him]."2 2 Ying Shao comments, "Duke Hsiang of Ch'in [777-766 BC], from the time that he dwelt in the west [771 B.C., cf. Mh II, 14f], took as his lord the spirit of Shao-hao [supposed to have reigned 2598-2515 B.C.], made the Western Sacred Place [120 li southwest of Ch'in Hsien, Kansu] and sacrificed to the White God [the SC says that he sacrificed to a Lord on High , cf. Mh II, 59]. In the time of Duke Hsien [384-362 B.C.] at Yo-yang it rained metal, which was considered an auspicious [omen]. He also made the Ch'i Sacred Place [in Yo-yang] and sacrificed to the White God, Shao-hao, who has the virtue of metal. The Red God is a descendant of Yao, and refers to the Han [dynasty]. The killing makes plain that the Han [dynasty] must destroy the Ch'in [dynasty]." This incident was applied by Liu Hsiang to the theory of the five elements. The relationship of the elements to each other was differently conceived by different theorists. One theory was that metal overcame wood, wood overcame earth, earth overcame water, water overcame fire, fire overcame metal, and so on. Another theory was that wood gave birth to fire, fire gave birth to earth, earth gave birth to metal, metal gave birth to water, water gave birth to wood, and so on (cf. Forke, Lun-heng, vol. II, App. I). Chang Ts'ang (d. 152 B.C.) held that the Han dynasty ruled by virtue of the element water; Chia Yi (200-168 B.C.), followed by Szu-ma Ch'ien, held that the Ch'in dynasty ruled by virtue of water, and was overcome by the Han dynasty because the latter ruled by virtue of earth. Liu Hsiang (76-6 B.C.) and his son, Liu Hsin, however argued from the passage in the text that the Han dynasty ruled by virtue of the element fire, whose color is red, and that the Ch'in dynasty ruled by virtue of wood, which gave birth to fire (cf. HS 25 B: 23b). Wang Mang adopted this latter theory and argued that since he was descended from the Yellow Emperor, whose virtue is earth, and since earth is born of fire, he must succeed the Han dynasty. Ying Shao's interpretation is still different: the Ch'in dynasty reigned by virtue of metal, which was overcome by fire, the virtue of the Han dynasty. Thus history was interpreted to yield a philosophical theory of the elements and that was used to prognosticate events and legitimize usurpation. Now the man thought that the old woman was not speaking the 36KAO-TSU truth, and wanted to trouble her.1 1 The SC has "beat," instead of the HS's k'u "trouble." HsÃ¼ Kuang (ca. 352-425) says that one text of the SC writes k'u, and Shen Ch'in-han quotes a similar passage from the LÃ¼-shih Ch'un-ch'iu (possibly ii cent.) Bk. XXII, ch. iii, also using k'u. Therefore the 1A: 7a old woman suddenly disappeared. When the man [who came along] afterwards reached [the place where Kao-tsu was], Kao-tsu had awakened, [and so] he told Kao-tsu [about it]. Then Kao-tsu privately rejoiced in heart and took confidence in himself, while his followers daily feared him more and more. The First Emperor of the Ch'in dynasty once2 2 The SC has "continually," instead of the HS "once." said, "In the southeast there is the emanation of a Son of Heaven."3 3 Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) notes that the Chin Dynastic History, in the Treatise on Astronomy, says, "The emanation of the Son of Heaven is red within and yellow without on all sides. In the place where it appears there must be either a king or the Son of Heaven. If there is a place to which he is going to travel, that place also beforehand produces this emanation. Sometimes there are the gates of a city indistinctly in the midst of the vapor or emanation. . . . Sometimes the emanation is like a person clothed in black clothes without hands to the west of the sun. Sometimes it is like a dragon-horse [an auspicious kind of horse]. Sometimes there is a mixed emanation rising towards heaven. These are all the emanations of an emperor or king." Thereupon he travelled to the east in order to check and obstruct [his rival]. 37KAO-TSU 1A: 7b Kao-tsu was hiding among the mountains and 7b marshes of Mang and Tang. The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ sought him, together with some men, and always found him. Kao-tsu was surprised and asked her about it. The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ replied, "Above the place where you, Chi, are, there is always a misty emanation. So we follow after it and always find you, Chi."1 1 Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) says that the Shih-chi Cheng-yi (737) quotes Yen Shih-ku as saying that Ching Fang (i cent. B.C.) in his Yi-chao-hou says, "How can a sage who is hiding be known? In all directions there always is a great cloud with all five colors, yet it does not rain. Below it there is then a sage hiding himself. Thus the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ looked at the cloudy emanation and found him." This comment is lacking in the present text. Kao-tsu was again glad. When some of the young men in P'ei heard of it, many wanted to attach themselves to him. In the first year of the Second Emperor of the Sec. Emp. Ch'in dynasty, in the autumn, the seventh month,2 2 P'ei Yin (fl. 465-472) quotes HsÃ¼ Kuang (ca. 352-425) as saying "Kao-tsu was at this time in his 48th year." Dates will be given in accordance with the calendar in "VariÃ©tÃ©s Sinologiques," vol. 29, PÃ¨re P. Hoang, Concordance des Chronologies NÃ©omÃ©niques, Shanghai 1910. But its Gregorian dates will be changed to Julian dates, in accordance with the common usage of historians and astronomers. Yr. I Ch'en ShÃª arose at Chi1 and came to Ch'en2, setting 209 B.C. himself up as King of Ch'u.3 3 Li Chi (fl. ca 200) explains, "The [state of] Ch'in had destroyed [the state of] Ch'u, [hence] the people of Ch'u hated Ch'in. Hence [Ch'en] ShÃª, because of the people's desire, called himself the King of Ch'u, according with the people's hopes." He sent Wu Ch'en, Aug./Sept. 38KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. I 209 B.C. Chang Erh, and Ch'en YÃ¼ to overrun1 1 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says, "Whenever it says , it always means to take it as one goes along with little labor or force." the region of 1A: 7b 8a Chao. In the eighth month, Wu Ch'en set himself up Sept. as the King of Chao, and most of the commanderies and prefectures, in responding to [Ch'en] ShÃª, killed Oct. their chief officials. In the ninth month, the magistrate of P'ei wanted to have P'ei also respond to [Ch'en ShÃª]. The Chief [Jailor] and the Superintendent of the Officials, Hsiao Ho and Ts'ao Ts'an, said [to him], "You, sir, have been an official of the Ch'in [dynasty] and now wish to rebel against it, and lead the young men of P'ei [in rebellion]. We are afraid that they will not follow you. We wish that you, sir, will summon back all those who have fled outside [the city].2 2 Yen Shih-ku writes, "At that time they suffered from the oppressive government of the Ch'in [dynasty]. Taxes were heavy and corvÃ©e labor much. Hence there were those who fled and escaped to avoid the officials." You can get several hundred men. Then by using them you can coerce the people, and the people will not dare but follow you." So he ordered Fan K'uai to summon Kao-tsu. Kao-tsu's followers had at this time reached [the number of] several hundred.3 3 The SC says, "Almost a hundred." Then Fan K'uai came in the train of Kao-tsu [to P'ei]. The magistrate of Pei had however repented [for what he had done], for he had feared that there would be trouble, and so had closed the city [gates] and defended the city wall. He wanted to execute Hsiao [Ho] and Ts'ao [Ts'an]. Hsiao [Ho] and Ts'ao [Ts'an] were afraid, escaped over the city wall, and took refuge with Kao-tsu. Kao-tsu then wrote [a message on a piece of] silk and shot it over the city 39KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. I 1A: 8a wall, saying to the elders of P'ei, "The world1 1 Lit. "All under heaven." The ancient Chinese, like the Romans, thought of their country as being the [known] world, or all of it that counted. has 209 B.C. already been filled for a long time with bitterness against the Ch'in [dynasty]. Although you are now defending the city for the magistrate of P'ei, the nobles are all rising and they will immediately slaughter [the people of] P'ei. Now if [you, people of] P'ei, together execute your magistrate, select 8b someone who is able to lead you, make him your leader, and make common cause with the nobles, your houses and families will thereupon be safe; otherwise old and young will all be slaughtered. Do not allow [that to happen]." So the elders led the young men and together they killed the magistrate of P'ei, opened the city gates, and welcomed Kao-tsu [in]. They wanted him to be the magistrate of P'ei, [but] Kao-tsu said, "At present the world is in disorder. The nobles have all risen [in arms]. If now2 2 Reading with the Southern Academy ed. (1530), the Fukien ed. (1549), the Official ed. (1739), and the SC instead of the present . you should set as your commander someone who is not capable, after a single defeat, you will be trampled to the ground. It is not that I am concerned about my own safety; I fear that I am not capable enough and that I shall not be able to keep you safe, elders and brothers.3 3 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says, "Of the people in a village or town, those who are aged and older [than the speaker] are the group of `fathers and older brothers' [we have translated this binomial `elders']; those who are young and younger [than the speaker] are the group of `sons and younger brothers' [we have translated `brothers'], hence he addressed them all." This is an important matter. I hope that you will select again4 4 Reading with the Southern Academy ed. (1530), the Fukien ed. (1549), the Official ed. (1739) and the SC, instead of . a 40KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. I 209 B.C. more capable person." Hsiao [Ho], Ts'ao [Ts'an], 1A: 8b and the others were all civil officials. They were concerned about their own safety, and feared that, if things should not turn out [successfully], the Ch'in rulers would later destroy them together with their families and kindred. So they every one withdrew in favor of Kao-tsu. The elders all said, "For a long time we have heard of wonders and prodigies concerning Liu Chi, and that he was worthy to become an honorable personage, and moreover that in divination, no one's [lot was ever] nearly as auspicious as that of Kao-tsu." Kao-tsu refused several times, but no one in the crowd was willing to undertake [the office]. So Kao-tsu was set up as Lord of P'ei.1 1 Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) says, "[The rulers of] Ch'u had formerly usurped the title of King, and their rulers in the prefectures were made kung . Ch'en ShÃª was made the King of Ch'u; P'ei kung [i.e., Kao-tsu] arose in response to [Ch'en] ShÃª, hence he conformed to the regulations of [the state of] Ch'u and called [himself] kung." In the time of the Chou dynasty, the kung were the highest of the noble ranks, and the word is accordingly to be translated `Duke.' In Ch'u however somewhat different practices had prevailed. At this time the feudal ranks had broken up; the Han dynasty preserved only the titles, Kings, Marquises, and Baronets. In Ch'u the kung were members of the official hierarchy rather than nobles; hence we have translated kung in this and similar titles as `Lord'. Kung was also commonly used to denote a father or aged person. Cf. p. 28, n. 2. From this time until he was made King of Hans, Kao-tsu is regularly styled `the Lord of P'ei.' Cf. Mh II, 335, n. 1. He worshipped2 2 The distinction between the two words used for the worship of these two gods is not exact. Chi (here translated "sacrificed to") seems to have been the general term for sacrifices. The Li-chi, ch. XX, uses chi as the title of its chapter on the various kinds of sacrifices. The Shuo-wen says, "Chi is to worship. [It comes] from `worship' and a hand holding meat." Of tz'u (here translated "worshipped"), the Shuo-wen says, "The spring sacrifice (chi) is called tz'u. Few objects and many words [are used. It comes] from `to worship' and the sound szu. In the second month of spring, in the tz'u, sacrificial animals are not used. Jade tablets and circlets together with leather (furs) and silk are used." But this sacrifice of Kao-tsu was made in October. The Chou-li ch. XIX (Biot's trans. p. 454) says, The Szu-szu [an official] "establishes the great sacrifices, which use jade, silk, and pure victims. He establishes the second class sacrifices, which use victims and silk. He establishes the inferior sacrifices, which use victims." Then tz'u is a sacrifice of the first rank. The difference between these two words then seems to have been that chi was a general term for sacrifice, whereas tz'u denoted a worship mainly verbal and of the first rank. the Yellow Emperor, sacrificed to 9a, 9b Ch'ih-yu in the great [prefectural] hall of P'ei, and 41KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. 1 1A: 9b anointed his drums with blood.1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "Anciently people, when they had newly completed a bell or a three-legged cauldron, had to anoint it with blood." This procedure was an aspersion of the blood of the sacrificed animal upon an object. The aspersing of the newly-made war-drums made them efficacious. Cf. Mh II, 336, n. 1. His standards and2 2 Wu Jen-chieh (ca. 1137-1199) and Wang Hsien-ch'ien think that "standards" should be read with the preceding sentence and "pennons" with the next. Yang Shu-ta (1885-present) shows that these two words are generally read together and that there is no reason to separate them. The correctness of his view is shown by the similar phrase in 1B: 26a. 209 B.C. pennons were all red,3 3 Chu Tzu-wen (lived before 1195) remarked that the last part of this sentence, beginning with "because," is an interpolation, since it repeats what had previously been said. But the story referred to was one of the important justifications of Kao-tsu's claim to the throne (cf. 100A: 8a), hence it is deservedly emphasized. because the snake which was killed was the son of the White god and the killer was the son of the Red god. Because of this [fact] all the 10a younger braves and officials, like Hsiao [Ho], Ts'ao [Ts'an], Fan K'uai, and others, gathered together the youths of P'ei [for Kao-tsu. Thus he] secured three thousand men.4 4 Some sentences in the SC are omitted here. In this month, Hsiang Liang and his older brother's Oct. son, [Hsiang] YÃ¼, arose in Wu; T'ien Tan, together with his cousins, [T'ien] Jung and [T'ien] Heng, arose in Ch'i, setting himself up as King of Ch'i. Han Kuang set himself up as the King of Yen. Wei Chiu set himself up as King of Weih. A general of Ch'en ShÃª, Chou Chang, [led an army] 42KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr.

Wang Hsien-ch'ien points out that 39:10b tells that Ts'ao Ts'an attacked YÃ¼an-ch'i and K'ang-fu. Ch'i might then be YÃ¼an-ch'i, q. v. in Glossary. The Lord of P'ei's Junior Major5 5 His Junior Majors at that time were K'ung ChÃ¼, Ch'en Ho, and T'ang Li, according to Chou Shou-chang. They are named in ch. 16. captured and killed 11a him. Then the Lord of P'ei returned, encamped at K'ang-fu, and went to Fang-yÃ¼. The King of Chao, Wu Ch'en, was killed by his Jan. general.6 6 SC 16: 4a names his murderer as Li Liang . In the twelfth month, the King of Ch'u, 43KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 1A: 11a Ch'en ShÃª, was killed by his charioteer, Chuang 208 B.C. Chia.1 1 SC 48: 7b says that the murder was committed "in order to surrender to Ch'in." Chuang Chia was killed by LÃ¼ Ch'en. Cf. 31: 7a. A man of Weih, Chou Fu, overran the regions of Feng and P'ei. He sent men to say to Yung Ch'ih, "Feng was formerly a colony of Liang. Already several tens of cities in the region of Weih have been subjugated. If now you, [Yung] Ch'ih, come under the rule of Weih, then the state of Weih will make you, [Yung] Ch'ih, a marquis and put you in charge of Feng. If you do not submit, then I will massacre [the people of] Feng." Yung Ch'ih had not previously wanted to be subordinate to the Lord of P'ei, so when [the state of] Weih summoned him, he immediately rebelled [against the Lord of P'ei] and guarded Feng for [the state of] Weih. The Lord of P'ei attacked Feng, but could not take it. [Then] the Lord of P'ei returned to P'ei.2 2 The SC adds that Kao-tsu (the Lord of P'ei) was sick. In this section, the HS is not copying the SC literally; it adds and omits phrases and sentences. He held a grudge against Yung Ch'ih because he had rebelled against him together with the youths of Feng. In the first month, Chang Erh and others set up a 11b descendant of [the kings of] Chao, Chao Hsieh, Feb. as King of Chao. The Baronet Ning of Tung-yang and Ch'in Chia set up Ching ChÃ¼ as King of Ch'u at Liu2. The Lord of P'ei went to attach himself [to Ching ChÃ¼]. On the way he got Chang Liang. Thereupon they together visited Ching ChÃ¼, and asked him for troops to attack Feng. At that time 44KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 208 B.C. Chang Han was pursuing1 1 Yen Shih-ku says that means "to pursue" and quotes in substantiation the Preface to the Book of History, verse 14, (Legge, p. 5). [the army of] Ch'en. A de- 1A: 11b tached general,2 2 Liu Pin (1022-1088) and Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggest reading "general" with the succeeding proper name. Ssu-ma Yi, brought an army north to subjugate the region of Ch'u; he massacred [the people of] Hsiang, [and then] went to Tang. 12a The Baronet Ning of Tung-yang and the Lord of P'ei led their troops westwards and fought with [this general] west of Hsiao without success. So they returned, raised troops, and collected them at Liu2. Mar. In the second month, [the Lord of P'ei] attacked Tang; after three days he took it by storm.3 3 Yen Shih-ku writes, " is to break into a walled city or town and take it. It is like pulling up a tree and getting both its trunk and roots." Then he collected the soldiers [that had been in] Tang and secured six thousand men. He united them to his former [troops; thus] altogether [he had] nine thousand Apr. men. In the third month he attacked the city of Hsia-yi and took it by storm. Then he turned May back and attacked Feng, but did not take it. In the fourth month, Hsiang Liang attacked and killed Ching ChÃ¼ and Ch'in Chia and stopped at Hsieh.4 4 Hsiang Liang wanted to do some king-making on his own account. Since Ching ChÃ¼ had not done much for him, Kao-tsu felt quite free to go over to Ching ChÃ¼'s successor. [So] the Lord of P'ei went to interview him. Hsiang Liang added to the Lord of P'ei's troops five thousand men and ten generals who were Fifth [Rank] Grandees. [Then] the Lord of P'ei returned, led his army to attack Feng, and took it by storm. Yung Ch'ih fled to Weih.5 5 Weih was the state to which Yung Ch'ih had given his allegiance. Kao-tsu's steadfast purpose to recapture Feng and punish a traitor deserves attention. June In the fifth month, Hsiang YÃ¼ captured Hsiang-ch'eng 45KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 1A: 12a by storm, [then] returned. Hsiang Liang 208 B.C. [next] summoned all the detached generals. In the sixth month the Lord of P'ei came to Hsieh, July and, with Hsiang Liang, both together set up the grandson of King Huai of Ch'u, Hsin, as King Huai of Ch'u.1 1 The SC does not mention Kao-tsu as being prominent in setting up this king. Chang Han2 2 This paragraph is taken from SC ch. 6 (Mh II, 206) or its source. routed and killed the King of Weih, [Wei] Chiu, and the King of Ch'i, T'ien Tan, at Lin-chi. In the seventh month there was a great prolonged Aug. rain. The Lord of P'ei attacked K'ang-fu.3 3 At this point the HS resumes copying SC ch. 8. Chang Han besieged T'ien Jung at Tung-a. The Lord of P'ei and Hsiang Liang together rescued T'ien Jung and routed Chang Han's [army] completely at Tung-a. 12b [Thereupon] T'ien Jung attached himself to the Lord of P'ei. Hsiang YÃ¼ pursued the fleeing4 4 Wei Chao (197-273/4) says that is the ancient word for pei "turn the back upon." Wang Nien-sun shows from the Shuo-wen and the Kuang-ya (by Chang Yi, fl. 227-233) that these two words were interchanged. He quotes a passage from the Kuan-tzu (iii cent. B.C.) ch. 31: 3b saying that the first word above "means to turn the back upon one's lord." He says that this word takes the meaning of turn the back upon, hence to be defeated and to flee is also denoted by this word. He also quotes the Tso-chuan, Dk. Huan, yr. IX (Legge, p. 53) where the word has the same meaning. Anciently these two words had the same pronunciation, hence were interchanged. troops to Ch'eng-yang. He attacked the city and massacred its [people], then encamped his army east of P'u-yang. Again he fought a battle with Chang Han, and again 13a routed him. Chang Han again rallied [his forces] and defended P'u-yang, encircling it with water. The Lord of P'ei and Hsiang YÃ¼ went to attack Ting-t'ao. In the eighth month, T'ien Jung set up Aug./Sept. the son of T'ien Tan, [T'ien] Fu, as King of Ch'i. Since Ting-t'ao had not yet fallen, the Lord of P'ei 46KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 208 B.C. together with Hsiang YÃ¼ went westward to overrun 1A: 13a the territory as far as Yung-ch'iu. They had a battle with the Ch'in [dynasty] troops and defeated them severely. They beheaded Li Yu, the Administrator of San-ch'uan. [Then they] returned and attacked Wai-huang, [but] Wai-huang did not yet submit [to them]. Since Hsiang Liang had twice routed the Ch'in [dynasty] armies, he became arrogant. Sung Yi admonished him, but he would not listen. [The state of] Ch'in reinforced the army of Chang Han. Sept./Oct. In the ninth month, Chang Han, after having put gags1 1 . Cf. Mh II, 341, n. 2. Chinese generals, in a night attack, had their men hold sticks of wood, like chop-sticks, in their mouths, to prevent talking. into the mouths of his men, attacked Hsiang Liang by night at Ting-t'ao, and routed his [army] completely, killing Hsiang Liang. At this time there had been continuous rains from the seventh month to the ninth month. The Lord of P'ei and Hsiang YÃ¼ were just then attacking Ch'en-liu. When they heard that [Hsiang] Liang was dead, the officers and soldiers were afraid, so [the Lord of P'ei and Hsiang YÃ¼], together with the general LÃ¼ Ch'en, led the army [away] and went to the east, moving King 13b Huai from HsÃ¼-yi and establishing the capital at P'eng-ch'eng. LÃ¼ Ch'en encamped east of P'eng-ch'eng; Hsiang YÃ¼ encamped west of P'eng-ch'eng; and the Lord of P'ei encamped at Tang. The younger brother of Wei Chiu, [Wei] Pao, set himself up as King of Weih.2 2 In this and the next paragraph, the HS departs from the SC ch. 8. This paragraph is taken from SC 16:6b (Mh III, 63) or its source (it is contradicted in SC 90:1b). The next paragraph is taken from SC ch. 7 (Mh II 260, 261). Oct./Nov. In the intercalary ninth month, King Huai united the armies of LÃ¼ Ch'en and Hsiang YÃ¼, commanding [the united army] in person. He made the 47KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 1A: 13b Lord of P'ei the chief of the Tang Commandery, and 208 B.C. appointed him as the Marquis of Wu-an commanding the troops of the Tang Commandery. He made [Hsiang] YÃ¼ the Duke of Lu, and appointed him as the Marquis of Ch'ang-an. LÃ¼ Ch'en was made Minister over the Masses; his father, LÃ¼ Ch'ing, was made Chief Chancellor. When Chang Han had crushed Hsiang Liang, he thought that the troops in the region of Ch'u were not worth serious attention, so he crossed the [Yellow] River, went northward, attacked the King of Chao, [Chao] Hsieh, and routed his [army] completely. [Chao] Hsieh [then] took refuge in the city of ChÃ¼-lu. A general of the Ch'in [dynasty], Wang Li, besieged him. [The state of] Chao several times requested rescue. Then King Huai made Sung 14a Yi First [Ranking] General, Hsiang YÃ¼ the Second General, and Fan Tseng the Lowest General, to go north and rescue [the state of] Chao. Formerly King Huai had made a covenant with the generals [to the effect that] he who would first enter and subjugate Kuan-chung would be made its king. [But] at that time the troops of the Ch'in [dynasty] were strong and very often took advantage of their victories to pursue the fleeing, [so that] none of the [Ch'u] generals [thought it of] any advantage to be first in going thru the pass. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ alone, who held a grudge against [the forces of Ch'in] for having routed Hsiang Liang, was seething with energy and wanted to go west and enter through the pass with the Lord of P'ei. [But] the older generals of King Huai all said: "Hsiang YÃ¼ in character is fiery, violent, and very 48KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. II 208 B.C. destructive.1 1 The SC has "treacherous," instead of the HS's "causing destruction"; these two words are however written almost alike in the seal character, so that the HS's reading is probably the original one, for Hsiang YÃ¼ was not particularly treacherous. When he attacked Hsiang-ch'eng, he 1A: 14a left nothing alive;2 2 Lit. "no creature was left to chew," seemingly a vigorous local expression. For the massacre at Hsiang-ch'eng, cf. 31: 11b; Mh II, 255. wherever he passes, he destroys and exterminates. In addition, although [the state of] Ch'u has several times [attempted to] advance and conquer, both of the former [leaders], King Ch'en 14b [ShÃª] and Hsiang Liang, have been defeated. It is better to send instead a person of outstanding qualities who will abide by just conduct as he goes to the west, and have him announce and proclaim [our purposes] to the elders of [the state of] Ch'in. The elders of Ch'in have already been filled with bitterness about their rulers for a long time. If now [our state] can indeed secure a person of outstanding qualities to go, and if he does not exploit or tyrannize [over the people], it is possible that [the state of Ch'in] could be conquered. Hsiang YÃ¼ should not be sent. Only the Lord of P'ei is habitually generous and an outstanding person." In the end [the King] did not permit [Hsiang] YÃ¼ [to go], but sent the Lord of P'ei to go to the west to collect the scattered soldiers of King Ch'en [ShÃª] and of Hsiang Liang. Then he went by way of Tang to Ch'eng-yang.3 3 The HS writes Yang-ch'eng , but the SC writes Ch'eng-yang , inverting the words. HS 39:8a reads, "He attacked the army of Wang Li south of Ch'eng-yang, and also attacked Chiang-li, routing its [troops] completely." Hence the reading of the SC should be followed. [Next] he went to Chiang-li and attacked the walled camp of the Ch'in armies, routing the two [Ch'in] armies.4 4 The SC has a quite different reading. A commentator on the SC says that this passage refers to the battle at Wu-ch'eng, with which Chavannes agrees. Cf. Mh II, 344, n. 2. The HS dates this battle before the tenth month, in which the SC says that the battle at Wu-ch'eng occurred. The HS also mentions this battle before it mentions the rebellion of T'ien Tu (which happened, according to the SC, on the fourth day of the month, whereas the battle at Wu-ch'eng happened on the fifteenth day). Cf. Mh III, 64. Hence the battle at Chiang-li and the one at Wu-ch'eng must have been two different events. 49KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 1A: 14b In the third year of [the Second Emperor of] 208 B.C. Yr. III Ch'in, the tenth month, a general of [the state of] Nov./Dec. Ch'i, T'ien Tu, rebelled against T'ien Jung and brought his troops to aid Hsiang YÃ¼ rescue [the king of] Chao. The Lord of P'ei attacked and routed [the troops of] the Military Governor of the Tung Commandery at Ch'eng-wu. In the eleventh month, Hsiang YÃ¼ killed Sung Dec./Jan. Yi,1 1 Sung Yi was cautious and would not advance to raise the siege of ChÃ¼-lu even though his soldiers were cold and hungry; hence Hsiang YÃ¼ killed him. Cf. 31: 14a. and united his troops [with his own, then] 207 B.C. crossed the [Chang2 2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien, in a note to 31: 14b, says that this was the Chang River. River. He set himself up as the First [Ranking] General; all the generals, Ch'ing Pu and the others, became his subordinates. In the twelfth month, the Lord of P'ei led his Jan./Feb. troops to Li,3 3 The HS omits a sentence in the SC which tells that Kao-tsu fought an unsuccessful battle with the Ch'in armies and was forced back to Li. met the Marquis of Kang-wu,4 4 Ying Shao says, "He was a general of King Huai of Ch'u. HS 16: [19b] has a Marquis Kang of Chih-p'u, Ch'en Wu [cf. p. 227, n. 3.]. Wu was also surnamed Ch'ai [as the present text reads] should properly be . He was a general of Weih." Meng K'ang (iii cent.) objects, "According to HS chap. 16, Ch'ai Wu arose as a general at Hsieh, went to Pa-shang, and entered Han [-chung]. He was not a general of King Huai, and also not a general of Weih. According to custom, he should not be called by his posthumous name." Yen Shih-ku also objects to Ying Shao's statement and declares that he has no evidence for it. Wu Jen-chieh (ca. 1137-1199) says, "This man is Kang-wu Hou and [the text] certainly cannot be changed to make him Ch'en Wu." He however proceeds to attempt to identify Ch'en Wu with the General of P'u or General P'u , who is said in 31: 11a to have been a subordinate of Hsiang Liang and who consequently became a general of King Huai after the death of Hsiang Liang. But there seems to be no evidence for this identification and Wei Chao says that P'u was a surname. Ying Shao seems to have identified the Marquis of Kang-wu with General P'u and with Ch'en Wu. In all probability the surname and given name of the Marquis of Kang-wu have merely been lost. and 15a took away by force his army of over four thousand men, uniting them [with his own]. He joined armies 50KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 207 B.C. with those of the Weih generals, Huang Hsin and 1A: 15a Wu Man1 1 The SC, the Fukien ed. (1549) and the Wang Wenshen ed. (1546) of the HS write Wu Man's given name as . The SC adds the title of Weih. The Ch'ien-tao ed. (1167) writes as in the text. , [then] attacked the Ch'in army and routed it.2 2 This event and the next few events, down to the attack upon Ch'ang-yi, are taken from SC 16: 7a, b (Mh III, 65; which is not a complete translation). T'ien An, the grandson of the former King of Ch'i, [T'ien] Chien, subjugated Chi-pei and followed Hsiang YÃ¼ to rescue [the state of] Chao. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ completely routed the Ch'in army below [the city of] ChÃ¼-lu. He captured Wang Li and put Chang Han to flight. Mar./Apr. In the second month, the Lord of P'ei, coming from Tang, went north and attacked Ch'ang-yi. He met P'eng YÃ¼eh, and [P'eng] YÃ¼eh assisted him in attacking Ch'ang-yi, but it did not fall. The Lord 15b of P'ei [then] went west past Kao-yang. Li Yi-chi, who was superintendent of the gate to a hamlet,3 3 The commentary of Ho Hsiu on Kung-yang's Commentary, written by the end of the later Han dynasty, sub Duke HsÃ¼an, 15th year, says: "In a district there are [subdivisions] called li [the word we have here translated "hamlet"]. A li [consists of] eighty houses. Eight families together [compose] a lane . In a li there is an assembly house. [The li] selects some members from those who are over sixty years of age and have very good character, and calls them the Elders. One person, who is eloquent, can protect the people, and is robust, is made the Head of the li. . . . In the spring, when [the people] go to work in the fields, at dawn the Elders and Head of the li open the gate, sitting in the rooms beside the gate [to keep watch]. Those who are late in going out, coming after the [appointed] time, are not allowed to go out. In the evening those who do not return bearing firewood are not allowed to come in." The superintendent of the gate to a li was thus not an underling, but the most respected member of the hamlet (he had the privilege of riding a horse), and had underlings subordinate to him to sprinkle and sweep the streets and watch the gates. said: "Many generals have passed through this place; as I see it, the Lord of P'ei has the greatest plans [of them all]." So he asked to see the Lord of P'ei. 51KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 1A: 15b The Lord of P'ei was just then squatting on a bed, 207 B.C. with two maids washing [his feet]. Master Li did not prostrate himself, [but] made a deep bow and said, "If your honor firmly wishes to destroy the utterly inhuman [dynasty of] Ch'in, it is not fitting that you should interview your senior squatting down." Thereupon the Lord of P'ei arose, holding up [the skirts of] his garments, begged his pardon, and conducted him to the seat of honor.1 1 This incident has become famous. [Li] Yi-chi advised the Lord of P'ei to make a surprise attack upon [the city of] Ch'en-liu.2 2 The SC adds, "So he took possession of the grain which the Ch'in [emperor] had accumulated there." Cf. Mh II, 346. Kao-tsu followed Li Yi-chi's advice. For that the Lord of P'ei made him the Baronet Enlarging Our Territory, and made his younger brother, [Li] Shang, the general in charge of the troops at Ch'en-liu. In the Apr./May third month, [the Lord of P'ei] attacked K'ai-feng, but did not take it by storm. [Then] he went westwards, 16a met with the Ch'in general, Yang Hsiung, fought with him at Pai-ma, also fought east of Ch'Ã¼yung, and routed his [army] completely. Yang Hsiung fled and went to Jung-yang, [so] the Second Emperor 52KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 207 B.C. sent a messenger to behead him as an example. 1A: 16a May/June In the fourth month [the Lord of P'ei] went southwards, attacked Ying-yang,1 1 The HS has , but the second word of this name is written in the SC, which is correct. Ying-ch'uan was the name of a commandery in Ch'in and Han times (cf. glossary), in which the city of Ying-yang was located. and massacred its [inhabitants]. Because of Chang Liang, he thereupon overran the region of Hanh.2 2 Chang Liang's ancestors had been for five generations the Chancellors of Hanh, hence Kao-tsu seized that region for him. At that time a detached general of Chao, Szu-ma Ang, was just then wanting to cross the [Yellow] River and enter the [Han-ku] Pass, so the Lord of P'ei went north, attacked P'ing-yin, and closed the ford of the [Yellow] River [to him.3 3 , which Yen Shih-ku wishes to interpret, "traversed the ford." Liu T'ai-kung (1751-1805) justifies our translation, saying it implies that Kao-tsu closed the ford in order to prevent Szu-ma Ang from getting ahead of him into the pass. Then] he went southwards and fought a battle east of Lo-yang, but his army was not victorious. So he went by way of the Huan-yÃ¼an [Pass] to Yang-ch'eng, and collected horses and cavalrymen for his army. In July/Aug. the sixth month, he fought a battle with the Administrator of the Nan-yang [Commandery], 16b [LÃ¼] Yi, [at a place] east of Ch'ou, routed him,4 4 The present text adds the word , meaning that LÃ¼ Yi suffered a severe defeat; the Ching yu edition (1034/5) and the SC are without this wordâit is probably an interpolation. and overran the Nan-yang Commandery. The Administrator of Nan-yang fled to take refuge in his capital city, and defended [the city of] YÃ¼an. When the Lord of P'ei led his troops past YÃ¼an westwards, Chang Liang admonished him as follows: "Although you, Lord of P'ei, want to hurry into the Pass, the Ch'in troops are still numerous and are holding the strategic positions. If now you do not 53KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 1A: 16b subjugate YÃ¼an, [the forces of] YÃ¼an will follow you 207 B.C. and attack you from behind, while ahead of you will be the strong [forces of] Ch'in. This is a dangerous policy." Therefore the Lord of P'ei by night led his troops to return by another route with his flags and pennons rolled up, and, when it became first light, he had already surrounded the city of YÃ¼an with three lines. The Administrator of Nan-yang 17a wanted to cut his own throat, [but] a man of his suite, Ch'en K'uei, said [to him]: "There is still ample time to die." Then he climbed over the city wall and interviewed the Lord of P'ei, saying [to him], "Your servant has heard that your honor has entered into a covenant that he who will first enter Hsien-yang shall be king over it. [But] at present your honor is held [here] by the defenders of YÃ¼an. The prefectures of the commandery [in which] YÃ¼an [is located form] several tens of adjoining walled cities; its officials and people think that they will certainly die if they surrender; hence they all defend [their cities] firmly, mounting the city walls [to guard them]. If now your honor stops to attack [YÃ¼an] for all the days [required to capture it], many of your soldiers will inevitably be killed and wounded; [on the other hand], if you lead your troops away from YÃ¼an, [the troops of] YÃ¼an will certainly pursue after your honor. If your honor does the former, then you will lose [the benefit] of the covenant concerning Hsien-yang; if you do the latter, you may suffer misfortune because of this strong place, YÃ¼an. For your honor there is no plan as good as that of making a covenant regarding its surrender, enfeoffing its Administrator, thus causing 17b him to stop here and defend it, and leading away its militia and soldiers, taking them westwards. [Then] all the cities which have not yet fallen, when they hear the news [of what has happened], will rival each other 54KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 207 B.C. in opening their gates and awaiting your honor. 1A: 17b [Thus] your honor will have nothing to worry about in marching straight ahead." The Lord of P'ei Aug./Sept. replied, "Good." In the seventh month the Administrator of Nan-yang, [LÃ¼] Yi, surrendered, and [the Lord of P'ei] appointed him as Marquis of Yin; he [also] appointed Ch'en K'uei [to the income of] a thousand families. He led the troops westward and all [places] yielded [to him]. When he came to Tan-shui,1 1 Kao-tsu was marching southwestward to avoid the Han-ku Pass. the Marquis of Kao-wu, Sai, and the Marquis of Jang,2 2 The present text has Hsiang ; Wei Chao (197-273/4) says that in Nan-yang there was a hsien by the name of Jang , whereas Hsiang Hsien is far from Nan-yang, where Kao-tsu met the Marquis of this place; hence the name should be written Jang. Wang Ling, surrendered. He 18a turned back and attacked Hu-yang. He met Mei HsÃ¼an, a detached general of the Baronet of P'o, [Wu Jui]; with him they both attacked Hsi5 and Chih5, and both [places] surrendered. [The soldiers were ordered], wherever they went, not to be rude nor to pillage, [so that] the people of Ch'in were delighted. [The Lord of P'ei] sent Ning Ch'ang, a man [originally] of Weih, as a messenger to [the state of] Ch'in. In this month Chang Han and his whole army surrendered to Hsiang YÃ¼, and [Hsiang] YÃ¼ made him the King of Yung.3 3 For this incident cf. 31: 16; Mh II, 271-2. Shen Yang of Hsia-ch'iu subjugated [the region] south of the [Yellow] River. Sept./Oct. In the eighth month, the Lord of P'ei attacked the Wu Pass, and entered [the state of] Ch'in. The Chancellor of Ch'in, Chao Kao, was afraid, so he killed the Second Emperor and sent men [to the Lord of P'ei], desiring to make an agreement to divide [with him] the kingship of Kuan-chung; [but] the Oct./Nov. Lord of P'ei would not consent to it. In the ninth 55KAO-TSU, Second Emperor Yr. III 1A: 18a month, Chao Kao set up Tzu-ying, the son of the 207 B.C. Second Emperor's older brother, as King of Ch'in. 18b Tzu-ying executed Chao Kao and exterminated [his family].1 1 For this event, cf. Mh II, 216 f. He sent a general leading troops to resist [the Lord of P'ei] at the Yao Pass. The Lord of P'ei wanted to attack them, but Chang Liang said [to him], "The troops of Ch'in are still strong. They cannot yet be lightly esteemed. I would prefer that you would first send men to display flags and pennons on the mountain top in greater [number than before], in order to make [the enemy] suspect there are troops [with each flag], and send Li Yi-chi and Lu Chia to go and [attempt to] persuade the Ch'in generals [to surrender], luring them with [promises of] gain."2 2 In the SC, Chang Liang is made to give this advice before Kao-tsu captures the Wu Pass, not the Yao Pass, cf. Mh II, 351. The Ch'in generals really wished to be in peaceable relations [with the Lord of P'ei] and the Lord of P'ei wanted to agree. [But] Chang Liang said, "This [reply means that] only the generals wish to rebel. I fear that their officers and soldiers will not follow them. It is best to take advantage of [the fact that they are] half-hearted and attack them." [So] the Lord of P'ei sent troops around the Yao Pass, crossing over Mt. K'uai, and attacked the Ch'in troops, routing them completely south of Lan-t'ien. Thereupon he reached Lan-t'ien, and again fought [at a place] north of it, [where] the Ch'in troops were severely defeated. Kao-tsu In the first year [of the Emperor Kao-tsu of the Yr. I Han dynasty3 3 Kao-tsu later claimed to have begun his reign when he entered Kuan-chung and overthrew the Ch'in dynasty, although at that time he was merely the Lord of P'ei and was not actually enthroned as Emperor until the fifth year afterwards. The HS is following this later numbering of the years. ], in the winter, the tenth month, Nov./Dec. 56KAO-TSU, Year I 207 B.C. 19a there was a conjunction of the five planets1 1 For the real date of this conjunction, cf. Appendix I. in [the 1A: 18b 19b constellation] Tung-ching and the Lord of P'ei reached Pa-shang. The King of Ch'in, Tzu-ying, in a plain chariot with white horses, with his seal-cord tied about his neck,2 2 The Chan-kuo-ts'e (iii cent. B.C.) ch. V, sub Ch'u, King Ching-hsiang, says, "Marquis Ling of Ts'ai [542-529 B.C.] ... did not pay attention to his state, not knowing that his son, Fa, was just then receiving orders from the spiritual kings [i.e., the ancestors] that he [the Marquis] must tie himself up with vermillion silk and present himself [to the ancestors]." Shen Ch'in-han remarks, "After this event, a captive was always presented in this manner." The biography of Liu Shou-kuang in the History of the Five Dynasties says, "The King of Chin came to T'ai-yuan dragging Liu Jen-kung by his seal-cord, and offered him in the ancestral temple." The cord around King Tzu-ying's neck was thus a sign of surrender. Today on the Chinese stage a prisoner is indicated by a cord around his neck. having sealed up [for presentation to the Lord of P'ei] the imperial seals, the insignia and the credentials,3 3 Wei Chao (197-273/4) writes, "The `insignia' are for generals to lead out troops. The `credentials' are for internuncios to hold." The Shuo-wen (100) says that the former character means "a witness ". Szu-ma Cheng (fl. 713-742) says, "According to the Han [dynastic] regulations, [the insignia] were made of bamboo, six inches long. They were divided and matched together." The Han-Chiu Yi, ch. I, p. 1b (written by Wei Hung, fl. 25-57; the same passage is found in the Han-kuan Yi, II, 13a, b), says: "The Emperor's six seals are all of white jade with a knob [made in the shape of] a hornless dragon or tiger. Their inscriptions read: `The Seal of the Emperor's Command,' The Emperor's [Own] Seal,' `The Emperor's Witnessing Seal,' `The Seal of the Son of Heaven's Command,' `The Son of Heaven's [Own] Seal,' `The Son of Heaven's Witnessing Seal,' six seals in all . The `Seal of the Emperor's Command was used for all miscellaneous matters. `The Emperor's [Own] Seal' was used for correspondence with the vassal kings. The `Emperor's Witnessing Seal' was used in mobilizing troops. In summoning the great officials, there was used the `Seal of the Emperor's Command.' In tablets for installing [officials or kings] and for matters [concerning] foreign states, the `Son of Heaven's [Own] Seal' was used. In serving Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, the `Son of Heaven's Witnessing Seal' was used. All [documents] are sealed with Wu-tu brown mortar and a blue cloth bag with plain white lining [covers them]. The two ends are without a crack [and are] a tablet one foot [long, (a phrase denoting an imperial edict, according to Li Hsien, 651-684, in HHS, Mem. 47: 10b)]. In the middle it was tied and inscribed. The Emperor's girdle and seal cord have a yellow ground [and are adorned in] six colors." This passage seems to refer to the same sort of ancient stationery as that described by Stein in Serindia, vol. IV, pl. XXI. surrendered beside Chih-tao. 57KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 19b Some of the generals1 1 The SC So-yin (by Szu-ma Cheng, fl. 713-742) quotes the Ch'u-Han Ch'un-ch'iu (197 B.C.) as saying, "Fan K'uai begged for permission to kill him." said that the King of Ch'in 207 B.C. should be executed, [but] the Lord of P'ei replied, "When at first King Huai sent me [on this expedition], it was certainly because I am able to be generous and indulgent. Moreover, when a man has already surrendered, it would be inauspicious to 20a kill him." So he gave him into the charge of his officials. Thereupon [the Lord of P'ei] went west and entered Hsien-yang. He wanted to stop in the palace and rest [his soldiers] in the [palace] hostels, [but] Fan K'uai and Chang Liang2 2 HS 40: 4a says that Fan K'uai admonished him but he would not listen; then Chang Liang added his arguments and he acceded. admonished him [not to do so], so he sealed up the depositories and treasuries for the Ch'in [dynasty's] important treasures and valuable objects,3 3 The Hsi-ching Tsa-chi (vi cent.) ch. 3, says, "When Kao-tsu first entered the palace at Hsien-yang, he went all around the storehouses and treasuries, and the gold, jade, rarities, and treasures could not be enumerated. It is said that [among] its extraordinary and strange rarities there was a blue jade five-branched lamp, seven feet and five inches [ca. 6 ft. Eng. measure] high, made [in the shape of] coiled hornless dragons holding lamps in their mouths. When the lamps are lighted, the scales all move [(turned by the heat?). Its light] is bright and luminous like the assembled stars and fills the room. "Also there were twelve seated men cast in bronze, all of them three feet [27 in. Eng. meas.] high, arranged on a mat. Each one held a lute or a reed organ. All had sewed on them variegated colored silk [clothes] exactly like live men. Below the mat there were two bronze tubes. The upper end was several feet high and protruded behind the mat. One of these pipes was empty; in one of the pipes there was a rope as large as a finger. One man was made to blow the empty pipe and one man to make a knot with the rope. Then the group all made music just like real musicians. "There was a lute six feet [54 in. Eng. meas.] long with 13 strings and 26 marks for the cords, each adorned with seven jewels. It was engraved with the words, `The music of [the precious stone] Fan and YÃ¼.' [Cf. Tso-chuan, Dk. Ting, yr. V, Legge, p. 760.] "[There was] a jade flute with two tubes two feet and three inches long, with six holes. When it is blown, one sees numerous carriages, with horses, mountains, and forests in succession. It was engraved with the words, `The flute of bright flowers.' ... "There was a square mirror four feet [3 ft. Eng. meas.] wide and five feet nine inches tall, with the recto and verso sides both shining. When a man [standing] upright comes and reflects himself in it, then his image appears upside down. When he comes with his hand covering his heart, then he sees his bowels, his stomach, and his five viscera one by one without hindrance. If a person has a sickness within himself, and he covers his heart and reflects himself in it, then he can tell where his sickness is. Moreover, if a woman has evil intentions, then her gall is enlarged and her heart moves. The First Emperor of Ch'in used to use it to reflect the women of his harem. If [anyone's] gall was enlarged or her heart moved, he killed her. Kao-tsu sealed and closed them all up in order to await Hsiang YÃ¼. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ took them all [away] to the east; it is unknown where they were after that." returned, and encamped 58KAO-TSU, Year I 207 B.C. at Pa-shang. Hsiao Ho gathered up completely 1A: 20a from the courts of the Lieutenant Chancellor of Ch'in the charts, the registers, the documents, and the writings.1 1 This very important sentence is not in the SC ch. 8, but is in SC 53: 2a. These maps seem to have been preserved in Later Han times; they are mentioned in 28Aiii: 7a, sub Ch'ang-kuang. Dec./Jan. In the eleventh month [the Lord of P'ei] summoned 206 B.C. the eminent and distinguished people from the prefectures and said [to them], "Fathers and Elders, you have suffered long enough from the cruel laws of the Ch'in [dynasty]: those who spoke ill or criticized [the government] have been cruelly executed with their relatives, those who talked in private2 2 Lit. "talk in pairs," i.e., plot against the government. Ying Shao says, "The laws of Ch'in forbade any gatherings of the people." have been publicly executed3 3 was a regular punishmentâit was "public execution"; quartering of the body after execution was called , and was considered a still more severe punishment. Cf., ch. 5, n. 6.4 and Han-lÃ¼ K'ao, ch. II, 17b. in the marketplace. I and the nobles have made a covenant that he who first enters through the passes will be king in [the region inside the passes], [therefore] I ought to be king in Kuan-chung. I am merely going to agree with you, Fathers and Elders, upon [a code of] laws 20b in three articles: he who kills anyone will be put to death; he who wounds anyone or robs [will be punished] according to his offence; as to the remainder, I am repealing and doing away with all the laws of the Ch'in [dynasty]. You, the officials 59KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 20b and people, should all be quiet and undisturbed as 206 B.C. previously. All that I have come for is to deliver you, Elders, from harm. I do not have [any intention of] exploiting or tyrannizing [over you]. Do not be afraid. Moreover, the reason that I have encamped at Pa-shang is merely that I am awaiting the arrival of the nobles in order to make an agreement [with them]." Then he sent people to go with the Ch'in officials to the prefectures and district cities to make known and proclaim this [matter]. The people of Ch'in were greatly rejoiced and vied [with each other] in bringing cattle, sheep, wine, and food, offering them for the enjoyment of the soldiers of the army. [But] the Lord of P'ei refused to accept them, saying, "In the granaries there is much grain; I do not wish to be a burden upon the people." [Then] the people were even more glad, and only feared lest the Lord of P'ei should not become king of Ch'in. Someone advised the Lord of P'ei, saying, "[The region of] Ch'in is ten times as rich as [the rest of] the world; by its geographical configuration it is strong. Now I have heard that Chang Han has surrendered to Hsiang YÃ¼ and that [Hsiang] YÃ¼ has entitled him King of Yung, to be king over Kuan-chung. He will forthwith come [here], and I am afraid that you, O Lord of P'ei, will not succeed in keeping this [territory]. You might hasten to send [troops1 1 The Southern ed. (possibly x-xii cent.) and the SC add at this point. ] to guard the Han-ku Pass. Do not admit the army 21a of the nobles, and levy some soldiers from Kuan-chung in order to add to your [own army] and resist them." The Lord of P'ei assented to his plan and followed it. Consequently, [when] in the twelfth month Hsiang Jan./Feb. YÃ¼, leading the troops of the nobles, really wished to 60KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. go westward through the Pass, the gates of the Bar- 1A: 21a rier were closed, and he heard that the Lord of P'ei had already subjugated Kuan-chung. [Thereupon Hsiang] YÃ¼ was greatly enraged and sent Ch'ing Pu and others to attack and break through the Han-ku Pass.1 1 The Yi-wen Lei-chi (by Ou-yang HsÃ¼n, 557-641) quotes the Ch'u-Han Ch'un-ch'iu (197 B.C.) as follows: "The Lord of P'ei went west thru the Wu Pass and stopped at Pa. Master Chieh advised him to send a general to defend the Han-ku Pass and not admit King Hsiang. His General-in-chief, the Second Father [Fan Tseng], came to the Barrier, [but] was not permitted to enter. He was enraged, and said, `Does the Lord of P'ei intend to rebel?' Then he ordered [each] person to bring a bundle of firewood, wishing to burn the gates of the Barrier. Then the gates of the Barrier were opened." Thereupon he reached Hsi4.2 2 The Sung Ch'i ed. (xi or xii cent.) reports that the Southern ed. omits the . A Junior Major of the Lord of P'ei, Ts'ao Wu-shang, upon hearing that [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was angry and wanted to attack the Lord of P'ei, sent men to speak to [Hsiang] YÃ¼ as follows: "The Lord of P'ei wants to be king of Kuan-chung. He has ordered Tzu-ying to be his chancellor. All the jewels and valuables [of Ch'in] have been taken [by him]." [Ts'ao Wu-shang, by this message,] was seeking [for a means] by which he could ask for a fief [from Hsiang YÃ¼]. His Second Father, Fan Tseng, advised [Hsiang] YÃ¼, saying, "When the Lord of P'ei was east of the mountains,3 3 . There was no commandery by this name; here and later (1A: 29a) it is used as a common noun, not a proper name. he was greedy for money and loved women. Now I have heard that since he entered the passes, he has not taken any precious things nor granted favors to any women. These [facts] show that his designs are 21b great. I [formerly] sent men to look at his emanation,4 4 This word refers to the emanation supposed to rise from a person who will become distinguished, presaging his future. The "dragon" is the emblem of the emperor; "five colors," instead of only one, presages an especially brilliant future, because they are identified with the five points of the compass. and it was all that of a dragon; it is of all colors. This is the emanation of a Son of Heaven. 61KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 21b You should hasten to attack him and not lose [this 206 B.C. opportunity]." Thereupon [Hsiang YÃ¼] feasted his soldiers [in preparation for] joining battle on the morrow. At this time [Hsiang] YÃ¼'s troops [numbered] four hundred thousand and were asserted to be a million, [while] the Lord of P'ei's troops [numbered] a hundred thousand and were asserted to be two hundred thousandâhis strength was not equal [to that of Hsiang YÃ¼]. It happened that the Junior Administrator, Hsiang Po, who was the youngest brother of [Hsiang] YÃ¼'s father, had been a constant friend of Chang Liang. In the night he galloped fast [to the Lord of P'ei's camp] to see Chang Liang and told him all the facts [about the situation]. He wanted [Chang Liang] to go away with him and not merely to die with [the Lord of P'ei. But Chang] Liang replied, "I am accompanying the Lord of P'ei in the service of the King of Hanh; I must inform him [of this danger]. To abandon him and go away would be disloyal." So he, together with Hsiang Po, interviewed the Lord of P'ei. The Lord of P'ei agreed to contract a marriage [in the family of Hsiang] Po, and said [to him], "[Since] I have entered the passes, I have not dared to take the slightest hair.1 1 Referring to his action regarding the palace. Cf. 1A: 20a. I have made a register of the officials and people and have sealed the courts and treasuries, awaiting [the arrival] of the General. The reason I guarded the Pass was to prevent [the entrance of] bandits. Day and night I have been hoping that the General would come; 62KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. how could I have dared to rebel [against him]? I 1A: 21b wish that you, [Hsiang] Po, would make clear [to Hsiang YÃ¼] that I would not dare to revolt against his beneficence." Hsiang Po promised to do so. The same night, as he left to return [to his camp], he warned the Lord of P'ei, saying, "Tomorrow you yourself absolutely must come early to make an apology." Hsiang Po returned [to his camp] and told [Hsiang] YÃ¼ all that the Lord of P'ei had said, taking the opportunity [to add], "If the Lord of P'ei had not first crushed the troops of Kuan-chung, 22a how could you, sir, have been able to enter? Moreover, when a man has done you great service, it would not be auspicious to attack him. It is better to take this opportunity and make friends with him." [Hsiang] YÃ¼ promised to do so. The next day the Lord of P'ei, followed by a hundred-odd cavalrymen, went to see [Hsiang] YÃ¼ at Hung-men, and made his apologies, saying, "Your servant has joined his efforts with yours, General, in attacking [the state of] Ch'in. You, General, have fought north of the [Yellow] River; your servant has fought south of the [Yellow] River. [Your servant] did not himself think that he could first go through the passes and be able to break [the power of] Ch'in, and meet you, General, again [at this place]. Now some evil-[minded] person has been talking [about me] and has brought about a disagreement between you, General, and your servant." [Hsiang] YÃ¼ replied, "This is what your, the Lord of P'ei's, Junior Major, Ts'ao Wu-shang, has said. Otherwise how could [I], Chi, have fallen into1 1 The Ching-yu ed. (1034), the Ch'ien-tao ed. (1171), the Wang ed. (1546) all read ; we have emended it to with the Southern Academy ed. (1530), the Fukien ed. (1549), the SC ch. 7 &amp; 8, the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084), and the Ch'ienHan-chi (ii cent.) this situation?" Thereupon [Hsiang] YÃ¼ retained the Lord of P'ei to banquet him. 63KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 22a Fan Tseng several times threw glances at [Hsiang] 206 B.C. YÃ¼ [urging him] to attack the Lord of P'ei, [but Hsiang] YÃ¼ did not respond. [So] Fan Tseng arose 22b and went out. He spoke to Hsiang Chuang, saying, "Our lord is not hard-hearted [enough] in character. Do you enter in order to dance a sword-dance, and take the opportunity to attack the Lord of P'ei and kill him. Otherwise you and yours will presently become his captives." [Hsiang] Chuang entered and drank a health [to the guest]. When the toast had been drunk, he said, "In our camp there is nothing to use [as entertainment]; I crave permission to dance a sword-dance." Thereupon he drew his sword and danced. [But] Hsiang Po also arose and danced, always protecting and covering the Lord of P'ei with his own body. When Fan K'uai heard that the situation was critical, he came right in, very angry.1 1 The SC (Mh, II, 279) states that he resolved to share the fate of Kao-tsu and forced his way in, striking down the guards in doing so. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ admired his [strength and courage] and therefore granted him [a cup of] wine. Thereupon [Fan] K'uai reproached and reprimanded [Hsiang] YÃ¼. After some moments, the Lord of P'ei arose and went to the toilet. He beckoned to Fan K'uai and went out. Leaving his chariot and his official retinue, he mounted alone, with Fan K'uai, Chin Ch'iang, the Lord of T'eng, [Hsia-hou Ying],2 2 The Lord of T'eng was with Kao-tsu in two other narrow escapes: after the battle of P'eng-ch'eng and in his escape from Ch'eng-kao. and Chi Ch'eng3 3 The SC names Chi Hsin instead. The SC So-yin (by Szu-ma Cheng) says that the HS reads Chi T'ung (the son of the Chi Ch'eng). following on foot, and fled to his army by unfrequented paths, ordering Chang Liang to stay and make apologies to [Hsiang] 64KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. YÃ¼. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ asked where the Lord of P'ei was, 1A: 22b and [Chang Liang] replied, "He learned that you, General, had the intention of reprimanding him 23a so he has left and gone by a short-cut to his army. Hence he has had your servant present you with [these] jade circlets."1 1 A pi was a circular piece of flat jade with a hole in the center, considered at the time as a very precious gift. They were made in pairs. Cf. B. Laufer, Jade, pp. 86f, 157f. The K'ang-hsi Dictionary says that the pi was circular outside (to represent heaven) and square inside (to represent earth), but Laufer mentions only those with circular holes. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ received them. [Then Chang Liang] also offered to Fan Tseng a large jade wine ladle, [but Fan] Tseng got angry; he struck at the wine-ladle [presented to] him, arose, and said, "We and ours are now already captives of the Lord of P'ei." Several days after the Lord of P'ei had returned [to his camp, Hsiang] YÃ¼ led his troops west, massacred [the people of] Hsien-yang, killed Tzu-ying, the king of Ch'in who had surrendered, and burnt the palaces and courts of the Ch'in [emperor]. Nothing of what he passed by was left without injury or destruction, [so that] the people of Ch'in were gravely disappointed in their hopes. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ sent men to return and report to King Huai [that he had conquered Kuan-chung and should be allowed to do as he liked about its rule, but] King Huai replied, "[Let it be done] according to the covenant." [So Hsiang] YÃ¼ held a grudge against King Huai because he had not been willing to order [Hsiang YÃ¼] to go west through the passes together with the Lord of P'ei, but [had sent him] north to rescue [the state of] Chao, [thus coming too] late [to reap the benefit of] the covenant [made with the generals of] the empire [concerning the 65KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 23a kingship of Kuan-chung]. So he said, "King Huai 206 B.C. is merely one whom my family has set up. He has not [achieved] any merit or glory.1 1 Cf. Mh 356, n. 1. How did he get sole authority over the covenant? Those who really subjugated the world were the generals and myself, Chi." In the spring, in the first month,2 2 Cf. Appendix II to this chapter. in feigned 26b respect, he gave King Huai [the title], the Emperor Feb./Mar. Yi; [but] in reality he did not avail himself of [the Emperor's] orders.3 3 In issuing orders he did not even pretend to legitimize them by using the Emperor's name; he issued orders in his own name. In the second month4 4 The SC reads "in the first month"; the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien adopts the reading of the HS. The Official ed. (1739) omits this date and notes that in the Academy ed. (1124) the words "second month" are interpolated; following the Sung Ch'i edition (ca. xii cent.) they are excised. [Hsiang] Mar./Apr. YÃ¼ set himself up as the King Lord Protector5 5 Pa was the title taken by or given to the outstanding feudal chiefs in the time of the later Chou dynasty. The Pa or Lord Protector was the dictator over or the leader of the nobles, often really taking the authority of the Chou dynasty's kings. Hsiang YÃ¼ thus chose for himself a title signifying that he was the leader or dictator of the kings. of Western Ch'u, ruling over nine commanderies in the region of [the former feudal states,] Liang and Ch'u,6 6 The ancient feudal state of Ch'u was, in the latter part of the Chou dynasty, roughly the region of the Yangtze valley below the gorges and the eastern seaboard as far north as Shantung. In the SC, chap. 129, we find a description of the various regions of China in terms of the popular divisions of the feudal states. "North of the Huai [river], the P'ei, the Ch'en, the Ju-nan, and the Nan Commanderiesâthese are Western Ch'u . . . East of P'eng-ch'eng, the Tung-hai, Wu, and Kuang-lingâthese are Eastern Ch'u . . . Heng-shan, Chiu-chiang, Chiang-nan, YÃ¼-chang, and Ch'ang-shaâ these are Southern Ch'u." (SC 129: 10a, b.) Meng K'ang (pro. ca. 180-260) says that Southern Ch'u centered around Chiang-ling (where was the capital of ancient Ch'u); Eastern Ch'u centered around Wu (a former feudal state with its capital at the modern Soochow, Kiangsu); and Western Ch'u centered around P'eng-ch'eng in northern Kiangsu. Hsiang YÃ¼ wanted to make P'eng-ch'eng his capital, hence he called himself the King of Western Ch'u. The nine commanderies taken by Hsiang YÃ¼ have been identified by Wang Hsien-ch'ien as being nine of the thirty-six commanderies into which the Ch'in dynasty had divided the country. Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755) previously reached the same conclusions. They are as follows: (1) the Ch'u Commandery (the Ch'in dynasty, after its conquest of Ch'u, separated off from this very large state five commanderies, viz., Chiu-chiang, Ch'ang-sha, Tung-hai, the Szu River Commandery, and Hsieh, retaining the rest as the commandery of Ch'u. Cf. Mh IV, 416). Hsiang YÃ¼'s capital, P'eng-ch'eng, was in this commandery, according to HS ch. 28; it also included the Han kingdom of Huai-yang. (2) The Szu-shui Commandery (it was later called the P'ei Commandery), (3) the Hsieh Commandery, in Shantung; in 187 B.C. it was called the kingdom of Lu , (4) the Tung-hai Commandery, which was also called the T'an Commandery; the Lin-huai Commandery of Han times, was included in this and the Szu-shui Commanderies; the kingdom of Kuang-ling was also included in this commandery, (5) the Ch'ien-chung Commandery; this region was organized by Ch'in out of the Wu , and the Chiang-nan Commanderies of Ch'u; cf. Mh II, 87 for this event, also Mh, 133, n. 1, 34Â°; but Ch'ang-sha was evidently not included in it at the time, since Hsiang YÃ¼ had made the Emperor Yi its suzerain with his capital at Ch'en1 (cf. 1A: 30a). After his assassination, Ch'ang-sha probably reverted to Hsiang YÃ¼, altho nothing is said about it in the histories; perhaps that was the motive for the assassination, (6) the K'uai-chi Commandery; the Tan-yang Commandery belonged to it; the commanderies of Chang and Wu were divided from it in Ch'u and Han times; (7) the Nan-yang Commandery; this was the region where the ancient states of Hanh, Liang, and Ch'u met; it included the cities, Yuan, ShÃª, Sui and Teng , (8) the Tang Commandery, which later became the kingdom of Liang in modern Honan; it included also the later Chi-yin , Ch'eng-liu and Shan-yang commanderies, and (9) the Tung Commandery; this commandery had been organized by Ch'in out of twenty cities of the state of Weih in modern Kiangsu, cf. Mh IV, 212. with his capital at P'eng-ch'eng. He 27a 66KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. went contrary to the covenant [about making the 1A: 27a conqueror of Kuan-chung its king] and changed [the Lord of P'ei's kingdom], setting up the Lord of P'ei as the King of Hans, to rule over forty-one prefectures of Pa, Shu, and Han-chung, with his capital at Nan-cheng.1 1 Kao-tsu was thus practically banished to southwestern Shensi and Szechuan, outside of central China. Kuan-chung was divided into three parts, and [over it] were set the three generals of [the former dynasty of] Ch'in: Chang Han became King of Yong with his capital at Fei-ch'iu; 67KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 27a Szu-ma Hsin became King of Sai with his capital at 206 B.C. YÃ¼eh-yang; Tung Yi became King of Ti with his capital at Kao-nu. The Ch'u general, Shen Yang, [who was formerly of] Hsia-ch'iu, became the King of Honan with his capital at Lo-yang. The general of [the state of] Chao, Szu-ma Ang, became King of Yin with his capital at Chao-ko. The Baronet of Tang-yang, Ying Pu, became King of Chiu-chiang with his capital at Liu5. King Huai's Pillar of State, 27b Kung Ao, became the King of Lin-chiang with his capital at Chiang-ling. The Baronet of P'o, Wu Jui, became King of Heng-shan with his capital at Chu. T'ien An, the grandson of the former King of [the feudal state of] Ch'i, [T'ien] Chien, became King of Chi-pei. The King of Weih, [Wei] Pao, was shifted and made the King of Western Weih with his capital at P'ing-yang. The King of Yen, Han Kuang, was [also] shifted and made the King of Liao-tung. The general of [the state of] Yen, Tsang Tu, became King of Yen, with his capital at Chi4. The King of Ch'i, T'ien Fu, was [likewise] shifted and made the King of Chiao-tung. The general of Ch'i, T'ien Tu, became King of Ch'i with his capital at Lin-tzu. The King of Chao, [Chao] Hsieh, was shifted and made the King of Tai. The Chancellor of Chao, Chang Erh, was made King of Ch'ang-shan. The King of Hans held a grudge against [Hsiang] YÃ¼ because he had gone contrary to the covenant, and [so] wanted to attack him, [but] his Lieutenant 28a Chancellor, Hsiao Ho, admonished him, so he desisted. In the summer, the fourth month, the May/June nobles were discharged at Hsi4,1 1 Chavannes, following Yen Shih-ku, translates this sentence as "they left the colors." Cf. Mh II, 358, and n. 1. Here he is very probably wrong. Ku Yen-wu (1613-1682) the founder of modern Chinese philology, says that this interpretation "does not make sense" of the phrase. It is true that Hsi is sometimes used with the meaning, "flag," but Suz-ma Cheng in a note to SC 7: 19b says that it was the name of a river, and that Hsi-hsia was quite the same sort of expression as HsÃ¼-hsia and Lo-hsia . Cf. p. 310, n. 3.3. As to Yen Shih-ku's remark (which Chavannes quotes) that Hsiang YÃ¼ had already left Hsi4, it is true that Hsiang YÃ¼ had come west of the Hsi River to Hung-men, where he met Kao-tsu, and then to Hsien-yang, where he burnt the palaces, but the nobles probably returned to the place where they had first encamped in order to take formal leave of each other. Formal announcement was made that their warfare was completed and each went to his kingdom. Our translation of this phrase is not however certain; Takigawa Kame-ta-ro, in his recent edition of the SC, agrees with Yen Shih-ku. Chang Mou-ch'ung (prob. xx cent.) quotes the Shuo-wen, "A hsi is a section of the army." and each went 68KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. to his own state. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ sent thirty thousand 1A: 28a soldiers to follow the King of Hans.1 1 Contrast Kao-tsu's former army of a hundred thousand. He evidently had to swallow much. Many tens of thousands of the people of Ch'u and of the followers of the nobles admired and followed him. From Tu he went south and entered [the gorge of] 28b Li. Chang Liang [then] asked for permission to leave and return to [the state of] Hanh; the King of Hans accompanied him [back] to Pao-chung. Thereupon he advised the King of Hans to burn utterly the suspended roads2 2 They were called "Cloud-bridges ." Cf. Mh II, 358, n. 3. in order to guard against stealthy [attacks by the] troops of the nobles and also in order to show Hsiang YÃ¼ that he had no intentions of [returning] eastwards [to compete with him]. When the King of Han had arrived at Nan-cheng, his generals, together with the officers and soldiers, all sang Ch'i songs, [which showed that they were] thinking of returning to the east,3 3 The Shuo-wen 3A: 8a says an Ou is a song of Ch'i, and Yen Shih-ku explains, "It means that they sing together (ch'i). Or it is said that it is a song of the region of Ch'i." The SC does not have the word ou. In the Sung dynastic history (section on music) there is a famous Han song (with the direction: to be sung with cymbals), which interestingly illustrates this passage: "The Wu mountain [Szechuan] is high, High and great. The Huai River [Kiangsu] is deep, And difficult to reach. "I want to return to the east. The broken bridges have not been rebuiltâ What I could collect would not rise high. To cross the watersâhow can they be bridged, Swelling and whirling? On the brink of the river I look afar, And my tears fall, dampening my garments. A man of distant lands, "My thoughts are of returning, But what can I do?" Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) thinks that the above song was probably written by one of Kao-tsu's generals or officers whose home was on the Huai River. and many escaped on the way and returned [home]. Han Hsin, who was Commissary Chief Commandant, also escaped and went off. [But] Hsiao Ho went after 69KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 28b him and brought him back. Thereupon he recom- 206 B.C. mended him to the King of Han, saying, "If you really wish to contest [for the control of] the world [the emperorship], except for [Han] Hsin, there is no one else who can plan for you." Thereupon the King of Han fasted and purified himself, erected an altar on a level place, and installed1 1 Cf. HS 100A: 2b and n. 2.9, which fixes the meaning of this word. [Han] Hsin as General-in-chief. [Then] he asked him about what plans and stratagems [he would suggest]. [Han] Hsin replied, "Hsiang YÃ¼ acted contrary to the covenant and made you, sir King, king at Nancheng. This is a banishment.2 2 Ju Shun says that the Ch'in rulers had banished criminals to Szechuan and Hans. SC 93: 1b and HS 33: 6b puts this speech into the mouth of Hanw Hsin, an entirely different person. Your officials and soldiers 29a are all people from east of the mountains; day and night they are longing and hoping to return [home]. If you use this [weapon] when it is sharp, you can thereby achieve great results; [but] when 70KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. the country has already [become] stable and the 1A:20a people are all themselves seeking quietude, you cannot employ it again. It is better to decide upon a plan to [press] eastwards." Thereupon he presented a plan by which [Hsiang] YÃ¼ could be outwitted and the three [states into which] Ch'in [had been divided] could easily be reunited [and taken possession of]. The King of Han was greatly delighted. Thereupon he followed [Han] Hsin's plan. He arranged and disposed his generals, leaving Hsiao Ho to collect the revenue from Pa and Shu and provision the army.1 1 After the Southern Academy ed. (1528), the Fukien ed. (1549), and the Official ed. (1739) have . June/July In the fifth month,2 2 The SC (Mh II, 360) says the "eighth" month, but that date does not correspond with Han Hsin's advice to Kao-tsu to take advantage of his soldiers' homesickness. the King of Han, leading his troops by way of Ku-tao, came out [of Hans] and made a surprise attack on [the state of] Yung. The King of Yung, [Chang] Han, came to meet [him] and attacked [the troops of] Hans at Ch'ents'ang. The troops of Yung were defeated and fled back [to their base]. They fought [again] at Haochih, [where they were] again severely defeated and fled to Fei-ch'iu. Thereupon the King of Han subjugated the region of Yung; he went east to Hsien-yang; he led troops to besiege the King of Yung at Fei-ch'iu and sent his generals to seize the [neighboring] regions.3 3 The SC mentions definitely the two commanderies of Lung-hsi and Pei-ti as being overrun (cf. Mh II, 361; in the SC text, instead of the "Shang" commandery we should probably read "two" , a common copyist's error). When T'ien Jung heard that [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had removed the King of Ch'i, [T'ien] Fu, to Chiao-tung 29b and set up T'ien Tu as King of Ch'i, he was very 71KAO-TSU, Year I 1A: 29b angry, and, with the troops of Ch'i, he met and 206 B.C. attacked T'ien Tu. [T'ien] Tu fled and submitted1 1 At this point SC ch. 8 says that T'ien Tu was killed (cf. Mh II, 360); but the HS 31: 3b and 31: 18b both say that he submitted to Ch'u; in chap. 16 his submission is likewise impliedâhere the HS has corrected the SC. himself to [the state of Western] Ch'u. In the sixth July/Aug. month, T'ien Jung killed T'ien Fu and set himself up as King of Ch'i. At that time, P'eng YÃ¼eh was at ChÃ¼-yeh with a band of over ten thousand men. He had no overlord, [so T'ien] Jung gave to [P'eng] YÃ¼eh the seal of a general, and ordered him therefore to raise a revolt in the region of Liang. [P'eng] YÃ¼eh attacked and killed the King of Chi-pei, [T'ien] An. [T'ien] Jung then united [and took possession of] the territory comprising the three [states made out of the former state of] Ch'i.2 2 I.e., Ch'i, Chi-pei, and Chiao-tung. The King of Yen, Han Kuang, also was unwilling to be removed to Liao-tung; in the autumn, the Sept. eighth month, Tsang Tu killed Han Kuang and took possession of his territory. The King of Sai, [Szu-ma] Hsin, and the King of Ti, [Tung] Yi, both submitted to [the King of] Hans.3 3 In the SC 16: 16b and in the HS 13: 5a this event is said to have happened in the eighth month (cf. Mh III, 75, n. b &amp; c), and in the next month commanderies were made out of these kingdoms; but in SC chap. 8 the event is dated in the next year (Mh II, 362). Hsiang Liang had previously set up a Prince [who was] a descendant of [the former kings of] Hanh, [Han] Ch'eng, as King of Hanh and Chang Liang as the Minister of the Masses in Hanh. [Hsiang] YÃ¼, considering that [Chang] Liang had followed the King of Hans, and that the King of Hanh, [Han] Ch'eng, had moreover not achieved anything, therefore did not send him, [Han Ch'eng], back to his state, [but took him] with himself to P'eng-ch'eng and killed 72KAO-TSU, Year I 206 B.C. him. When he heard that the King of Han, had 1A: 29b reunited [and taken possession of] Kuan-chung and that [the states of] Ch'i and Liang had rebelled against him, [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was very angry. He thereupon made the former prefect in Wu, Cheng Ch'ang, the King of Hanh, [with orders] to oppose [the state of] Hans. He ordered the Lord of Hsiao, Chio, to attack P'eng YÃ¼eh, [but P'eng] YÃ¼eh defeated Chio's troops. At that time, Chang Liang 30a was traveling about1 1 Su Lin (fl. 196-227) says that he was travelling about to pacify his people. Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) says he was "overrunning" the territory and Yen Shih-ku approves this explanation. the regions of Hanh; he sent [Hsiang] YÃ¼ a letter, saying, "[The state of] Hans wants to secure Kuan-chung; it will act according to the covenant, and then will stop [its conquests] and not presume to go farther eastwards." For that reason [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had no thoughts of going westwards, but went northwards to attack [the state of] Ch'i. Oct. In the ninth month, the King of Hans sent his generals Hsieh Ou and Wang Hsi out [by way of] the Wu pass, using the troops of Wang Ling, and [ordering them] to go by way of Nan-yang to get the T'ai-kung and the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼, [who were] at P'ei.2 2 At that time, Wang Ling had several thousand men at Nan-yang and surrendered to Kao-tsu. Cf. 40:17b. [But Hsiang] YÃ¼ heard of it and dispatched troops to oppose them at Yang-chia, [so that] they could not [go] forward. Yr. II In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, Nov. Hsiang YÃ¼ sent the King of Chiu-chiang, [Ch'ing] Pu, to kill the Emperor Yi at Ch'en1. Ch'en YÃ¼ also held a grudge against [Hsiang] YÃ¼, [because] he alone was not made a king; [so] he borrowed from T'ien Jung auxiliary troops to attack Chang Erh, the King of Ch'ang-shan. [Chang] Erh 73KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 30a was defeated; he fled and submitted himself to [the 206 B.C. King of] Hans, [and] the King of Hans treated him well. Ch'en YÃ¼ welcomed the King of Tai, [Chao] Hsieh, back to Chao, [and Chao] Hsieh set up [Ch'en] YÃ¼ as King of Tai. Chang Liang returned by unfrequented paths from Hanh to Hans, and the King of Hans made him Ch'eng-hsin Marquis. The King of Han went to Shan, pacifying and comforting the elders of the region outside the pass.1 1 Kuan-wai , the region east and outside of the Han-ku Pass, i.e., in the present Honan. The King of Ho-nan, 30b Shen Yang, submitted [to him, so] he established the commandery of Ho-nan.2 2 Cf. Mh II, 535, no. 10. SC 16: 17b says that this event happened in the eleventh (the next) month. He [then] had the Grand Commandant in Hanh, Hanw Hsin, attack [the state of] Hanh, and the King of Hanh, Cheng Ch'ang, submitted. In the eleventh month he set up the Dec. [former] Grand Commandant in Hanh, Hanw Hsin, as King of Hanh. [Then] the King of Hans turned round, returned [to Kuan-chung, and established] his capital at YÃ¼eh-yang. He sent his generals to overrun territory and they captured the Lung-hsi [Commandery] by assault. Upon those who submitted with ten thousand persons or with one commandery, he conferred [the income of] ten thousand families. He repaired the Barrier3 3 Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768) says that this was the portion of the former barrier at the northern border of the Ho-shang Commandery (the same as the later Tso-p'ing-yi cf. Glossary), between the territory of the Huns and that of the Chinese. Previously this region had belonged to the King of Sai; when his territory was taken, the barrier was repaired. Cf. 94A: 5b. Upon the appearance of disorder in China, the Huns had probably invaded, hence this barrier was needed. of the Ho-shang 74KAO-TSU, Year II 206 B.C. [Commandery]. Regarding the pastures,1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "[A place where] fowl or animals are reared is called a pasture . When a pasture has a wall it is called an enclosure . [Places] where [things] are planted are called gardens means to cultivate." enclos- 1A: 30b ures, gardens, and ponds of the former Ch'in [dynasty], he ordered that the common people were permitted to [make] cultivated fields of them. 205 B.C. In the spring, the first month, [Hsiang] YÃ¼ Feb. attacked T'ien Jung at Ch'eng-yang. [T'ien] Jung was defeated and fled to P'ing-yÃ¼an and the people of P'ing-yÃ¼an killed him. All of [the state of] Ch'i [then] submitted to Ch'u, [whereupon the forces of] Ch'u burnt their outer and inner walls. [Thereupon] the people of Ch'i again rebelled against [Ch'u]. [The King of Han's] generals took the Pei-ti [Commandery] by assault, and captured Chang P'ing, the younger brother of [Chang Han], the King of Yung. [The King of Han proclaimed] an amnesty for Mar. criminals.2 2 A general amnesty, together with temporary exemptions from taxes, was usually ordered at the accession of a new emperorâit is now done with that connotation. The change in the gods of the land and grains was only made at the beginning of a new dynasty (not always then). Cf. Mh II, 363 for this custom. In the second month, on [the day] Mar. 5 kuei-wei, [the King of Han] ordered the people to do away with the Ch'in [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains and establish the Han [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains. He showed his virtue and bounty and granted aristocratic ranks to the people. Because the people of Shu and Hans had been heavily burdened in furnishing the armies with supplies, he exempted them from the land tax and from contributions in kind for [a period of] two 31a years. For the soldiers of Kuan-chung who were 75KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 31a with the armies he exempted their families [from 205 B.C. taxes] for one year. Those among the people who were fifty years old and over, who had cultivated personalities,1 1 Shen Ch'in-han remarks that "[people of] cultivated personalities" later became a technical term denoting certain persons who had been recommended to the central government (as possessing this quality), just as did the terms, "filially pious and incorrupt" and "accomplished talent." and who were able to lead the multitude and do good, he elevated to the position of San-laoâ one in each district. One of the district San-lao was selected to be the prefectural San-lao, who was to serve as a consultant with the Prefect, the Assistant [Prefect], and the Chief of Police. [The San-lao] were exempted from forced labor and garrison service, and in the tenth month were to be granted wine and meat. In the third month, the King of Hans crossed the Apr. [Yellow] River from Lin-chin. The King of Weib, [Wei] Pao, submitted, and, leading his troops, followed [the King of Han. The King of Han] subdued Ho-nei, captured the King of Yin, [Szu-ma] Ang, and established the Ho-nei Commandery. When he came to Hsiu-wu, Ch'en P'ing escaped from Ch'u and came to submit himself. The King of Han talked with him, liked him, and so made him his Chariot-companion [with the duty of] supervising the generals. [Going] southwards, [the King of Han] crossed [the Yellow River] at the ford of P'ing-yin, and came to Lo-yang. [There] the San-lao of Hsin-ch'eng, the Great Excellency Tung, stopped the King of Han and advised him, saying, "Your servant has heard that "He who accords with virtue will shine, [But] he who goes contrary to virtue will be destroyed. When troops are ordered out without a just cause, The affair will therefore fail. 31b 76KAO-TSU, Year II 205 B.C. Hence it is said: 1A: 31b "Make clear that he is a wrong-doerâ Your enemy can thereupon be subdued.1 1 The six lines above are each of four characters and rime in couplets. Hsiang YÃ¼ has acted in an inhuman [fashion]; he has banished and murdered his lordâhe is the [greatest] wrong-doer in the world. Moreover "He who is benevolent needs use no braves, He who is righteous needs use no force. All those in your armies should wear plain garments2 2 Mourning clothes. [in mourning] for [Emperor Yi] in order to announce [your purpose],3 3 Liu Pin (1022-1088) says that the is a gloss. and the nobles will for this reason march eastwards to chastize [Hsiang YÃ¼. Then] no one within the four seas4 4 I. e., no one in the world. will fail to admire your virtue. The foregoing is the procedure [used by] the three kings."5 5 The "three kings" have been variously identified: Yen Shih-ku says they are the great rulers of the three dynasties, Hsia, Yin, and Chou; the phrase plainly means that this practise was followed by the model rulers of ancient times. This speech and Kao-tsu's action indicates that Kao-tsu was reversing the First Emperor's anti-Confucian policy; hence it is very significant. The King of Han replied, "Good. Except for you, O master, I should have heard nothing [of the kind]." Thereupon the King of Han proclaimed a mourning for the Emperor Yi; he uncovered his arm and wailed loudly; [the whole army] mourned and lamented for three days. He sent messengers to inform the nobles, saying, "All the world together set up the Emperor Yi, and, facing north,6 6 The emperor, on his throne, faces south; hence his subjects face north. it served him. Now Hsiang YÃ¼ has 77KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 31b banished and murdered the Emperor Yi in Chiang- 205 B.C. nan. It was a treasonable and inhuman [action]. We Ourselves have proclaimed a mourning for him; [Our] troops are all wearing plain garments.1 1 The SC says instead, "The nobles all wore plain garments," which makes Chavannes end the proclamation here. We have sent forth the troops of Kuan-chung, and collected warriors from the three Ho [Commanderies] to sail southwards down the Yangtze and Han [Rivers].2 2 No campaign along these rivers is recorded in the SC or HS. Probably this phrase merely records his hopesâthese rivers led into the state of Ch'u. The Comment to the Shui-ching (by Li Tao-yÃ¼an, d. 527) 17:22a however tells of the establishment of the Ch'ang-sha and Ch'ien-chung Commanderies in this year, implying a campaign along these rivers. We are willing to follow you, nobles and 32a kings, to attack the one in Ch'u who has murdered the Emperor Yi." In the summer, the fourth month, T'ien Jung's May younger brother, [T'ien] Heng, succeeded in collecting several tens of thousands of men and set up [T'ien] Jung's son, [T'ien] Kuang, as King of Ch'i. Altho [Hsiang] YÃ¼ heard that [the army of] Hans was coming eastwards, since he had [already] attacked [the state of] Ch'i, he wished to complete crushing it and afterwards to attack Hanh. For this reason the King of Hans succeeded in compelling the troops of five nobles3 3 The commentators have discussed variously who these five were. Chavannes's list, which is that of Yen Shih-ku (Mh II, 297, n. 3) is probably wrong. Chang Erh had fled from his kingdom; nowhere is he said to have had troops. Shen Yang had surrendered and his domain had been made into a commandery; hence he could not have been considered a noble. Cheng Ch'ang had also surrendered, and his kingdom had been given to Han Hsin, hence he was not among these nobles. Thus there are left only two of Chavannes's list. The best discussion is probably that of Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755). He writes that Hans had by this time already completely subjugated the three states of Kuan-chung, viz., Yung, Ti, and Sai, and had made commanderies out of them, so that none of their former kings could be counted among the nobles, even tho in the succeeding passage these kings are still given their former titles. Cf. p. 81, n. 5. HS 13: 5a also states that these commanderies were established in the eighth month of Kao-tsu's first year. HS 16: 26a implies the same. The biography of King Pao of Weih (SC 90: 2a, HS 33: 1b) testifies that he was one of these five. HS 13: 7b testifies that another was Hanw Hsin, the King of Hanh. HS 32: 7a and SC 92: 10b inform us that Ch'en YÃ¼, the minister of the state of Chao, was a third (he had sent troops). The two others were the state of Ch'i (whose troops are said in SC 92: 4b to have joined in the attack) and Yin. On 1A: 31a it is said that Yin had also been made into a commandery, but that is an anticipation of what happened a month later. HS 16: 23b says, "Yen Tse-ch'ih ... was sent as the chancellor of Yin to attack Hsiang Chi," hence the state of Yin, with Szu-ma Ang as King, was not ended until his death in battle this month (cf. 1A: 33b). Or, instead of Ch'i, it might less probably have been the state of Heng-shan. Wu Jui, the King of Heng-shan, had been demoted from Po to Heng-shan, which was a worse position, hence he bore a grudge against Hsiang YÃ¼. Tung Chiao-tseng (1750-1822) however suggests that "five nobles" is here merely a way of referring to "all China," just as the similar phrase in HS 31: 29a. [to follow him] and went eastwards 33a 78KAO-TSU, Year II 205 B.C. to chastize [the state of] Ch'u. When he 1A: 33a came to Wai-huang, P'eng YÃ¼eh came with thirty thousand men to follow Hans. The King of Hans installed him as the Chancellor of State in Weih, and ordered him to subjugate the region of Liang. Thereupon the King of Han entered P'eng-ch'eng, took [Hsiang] YÃ¼'s Beauties and his valuables, and held a great banquet. When [Hsiang] YÃ¼ heard of it, he ordered his general to attack [the state of] Ch'i, and himself, with thirty thousand picked soldiers, [went] by way of Lu out of Hu-ling to Hsiao. At dawn he attacked the army of Hans and fought a great battle1 1 The Academy ed. (1124) reads "was severely defeated" instead of "fought a great battle" . The Official ed. follows the Sung Ch'i ed. (ca. xii cent.) in correcting to read the latter. at P'eng-ch'eng and east of Ling-pi.2 2 HS 31: 11a-12a makes plain what happened: "[Hsiang] YÃ¼ came by way of Hsiao and at dawn attacked the army of Hans and drove it eastwards to P'eng-ch'eng. By noon he had severely crushed the army of Hans. The army of Hans all fled and were forced to the Ku and Szu Rivers; [then] the army of Hans all fled south to the mountains. [The army of] Ch'u still pursued and attacked it to the east of Ling-pi on the bank of the Sui River." 79KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 33a On the Sui River he completely routed the army of 205 B.C. Hans and killed so many officers and soldiers that because of it the Sui River did not flow.1 1 Because it was blocked with corpses as the troops tried to cross it. They were fleeing northwestward. He surrounded the King of Han with three lines [of soldiers. But] a great wind arose from the northwest, breaking trees and blowing away houses, blowing up sand and gravel, so that the day was dark. The army of Ch'u [fell into] great disorder and the King of Han succeeded in escaping with several tens 33b of cavalrymen. He went by P'ei and sent people to seek his family, but his family2 2 Chu Tzu-wen (before 1198) suggested that the repetition of "his family" and of "the King of Hans" is due to dittography. had also already fled and he did not meet them. On the road, the King of Han happened upon Hsiao-hui and the [Princess] YÃ¼an of Lu,3 3 His two children by the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼, here called by their later titles. He had also had other children by concubines. and carried them along in his chariot. [But] the cavalrymen of Ch'u pursued the King of Han. The King of Han got excited and pushed the two children so that they fell out, [whereupon] the Lord of T'eng, [Hsia-hou Ying], got down and gathered them into the chariot. Thus they succeeded in escaping.4 4 The SC says that the children fell out three times and the Lord of T'eng, Hsia-hou Ying, picked them up, until at last he remonstrated with Kao-tsu. Cf. Mh II, 300. The HS version, that they fell out only once, seems far more probable, for they were being pursued. For a further detail of that escape, cf. Glossary, sub Ting Ku. Shen Yi-chi was accompanying T'ai-kung and the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼, [who were fleeing] by unfrequented paths; instead [of escaping] they met the army of Ch'u. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ constantly placed them in the midst of his army, and held them as hostages. When the nobles saw that Hans had been defeated, they all fled. The [former] King of Sai, 80KAO-TSU, Year II 205 B.C. [Szu-ma] Hsin, and the [former] King of Ti, [Tung] 1A: 33b Yi, surrendered to Ch'u. The King of Yin, [Szu-ma] Ang, died. The older brother of the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼, the Marquis of Chou-lÃ¼, [LÃ¼ Tse], was in charge of troops encamped at Hsia-yi. The King of Han went to him,1 1 Wang Nien-sun says that the word , which is in the present text, is an interpolation; the Ching-yu ed. (1035) and the SC ch. 8 are without it. It has been omitted in the translation. collected a few officers and soldiers, and encamped them at Tang. The King of Han went westward, passing across the region of Liang to YÃ¼. He said to the internuncio, Sui Ho, "If you, sir, would be able to persuade the King of Chiu-chiang, [Ch'ing] Pu, and lead him to mobilize his troops in rebellion against [the state of] Ch'u, King Hsiang [YÃ¼] would have to be detained in attacking him; if you could succeed in detaining him for several months, I would be quite certain of 34a obtaining the empire." [So] Sui Ho went to persuade [Ch'ing] Pu and really made him rebel against [the state of] Ch'u. June In the fifth month, the King of Han encamped at Jung-yang. Hsiao Ho sent forth from Kuan-chung to go to the army all the old and weak and those not yet enregistered.2 2 Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) tells that in ancient times (before the Han period) a youth was enrolled in his 20th year and tilled for three years, when he would have stores for one year and was hence conscripted into the army in his 23rd year. Ju Shu says that by law a youth was enrolled in his 23rd year as a person following his hereditary occupation and each one followed his father in learning his hereditary occupation. If he was less than six feet two inches tall, [4 ft. 8 in. Eng. meas.], he was excused on account of his defect. The Han-chiu-yi (written by Wei Hung, fl. 25-57), pt. II, 5b, says that people in their 23rd year serve first as regular soldiers , after a year they serve as guards , and after another year as skilled soldiers or cavalrymen. They were trained in archery, driving, riding, galloping, fighting, and tactics. In his 56th year a soldier was superannuated on account of age, excused from service, relegated to the ranks of the ordinary people, and went back to his farm and village. Hsiao Ho, in sending the "old" and "unregistered," was sending those over 56 and under 23 to Kao-tsu. Cf. also 5: 3b. Han Hsin also collected troops and joined with the King of Han. Thus [the King] of Han's] troops were renewed and greatly restored. They fought with [the troops of] Ch'u south of Jung-yang, between Ching and So, and routed 81KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 34a them.1 1 The SC ch. 8 (Mh II, 367) puts this battle in the sixth month, after the naming of the heir apparent; the HS however is in this section following SC ch. 7 (Mh II, 301f), in which no monthly datings are given; this order is preferable. They built a walled road2 2 SC 6: 14a (Mh II, 139 &amp; n. 4) tells that the First Emperor built a similar walled road from Hsien-yang (his capital) to the Kan-ch'Ã¼an Palace, and Ying Shao comments, "It says that on the outside of a road for galloping he built walls [so that when] the Son of Heaven rode in between them, people outside would not see him." Kao-tsu thus guarded the road to the granary by building walls on each side of it. Ying Shao comments on the present passage, "He feared that the enemy would seize his baggage-train, so he built walls like a street or narrow lane." connecting with 205 B.C. the [Yellow] River in order to get grain from the Ao Granary. The King of Weih, [Wei] Pao, asked permission to return home in order to see his sick parent;3 3 His mother, according to Yen Shih-ku. Cf. 33: 1b. when he had arrived, he closed the ford at the [Yellow] River and rebelled in favor of Ch'u. In the sixth month, the King of Han returned to June/July YÃ¼eh-yang. On [the day] jen-wu, he named the Heir-apparent July 1 and proclaimed an amnesty to criminals; he ordered the members of the noble houses who were in attendance at Kuan-chung all to gather at YÃ¼eh-yang as a guard. He led water to flood Fei-ch'iu;4 4 Where Chang Han, the King of Yung, was being besieged. Cf. 1A: 29a. Fei-ch'iu surrendered, 34b Chang Han committed suicide, and the province of Yung was subjugated, some eighty odd prefectures. He [thereupon] established the commanderies of Ho-shang, Wei-nan, Chung-ti, Lung-hsi, and Shang.5 5 The SC records the establishment of these commanderies at the beginning of Kao-tsu's second year; he had captured the territory before the end of the siege of Fei-ch'iu. The HS mentions them all together at this place for convenience's sake. He ordered the officials in charge of the sacrifices to make offerings to Heaven, to Earth, to the Four Directions, to the Lords on High, to the Hills, and to the Streamsâat the [proper] time 82KAO-TSU, Year II 205 B.C. to sacrifice [regularly] to them. He caused the 1A: 34b troops in Kuan-chung to take arms and mount the Barrier at the boundary [for its defence]. In Kuan-chung there was a great famine; a hu of rice [or hulled millet cost] ten thousand cash [and] people ate each other. [The King of Han] ordered the people to go to Shu and Hans to eat. Aug./Sept. In the autumn, the eighth month, the King of Han went to Jung-yang and said to Li Yi-chi, "With a kindly tongue go and persuade the King of Weih, [Wei] Pao; if you are able to make him submit, I will appoint you, Master [Li, with the income of] ten thousand families in Weih." [Li] Yi-chi went, [but Wei] Pao did not listen to him. [So] the King of Han made Han Hsin Junior Lieutenant Chancellor [and ordered him], together with Ts'ao Ts'an and Kuan Ying, all to attack [the state of] Weih. When [Li] Yi-chi returned, the King of Han asked him who was the General-in-chief of Weih. He replied, "Po Chih." The King answered, "This [man's] mouth still smells of [mother's] milk! He cannot resist Han Hsin. Who is his general of cavalry?" He replied, "Feng Ching." [The King] answered, "This man is 35a the son of the Ch'in general, Feng Wu-ts'Ãª. Although he is capable, he is not able to resist Kuan Ying. Who is his general of foot-soldiers?" He replied, "Hsiang T'o." [The King] answered, "He is not able to resist Ts'ao Ts'an. I have nothing at all to Sept./Oct. worry about." In the ninth month [Han] Hsin and the others captured [Wei] Pao; he was ordered to be sent to Jung-yang. The region of Weih was subjugated and the commanderies of Ho-tung, T'ai-yÃ¼an, and Shang-tang were established. [Han] Hsin sent men [to the King of Han] asking 83KAO-TSU, Year II 1A: 35a for thirty thousand soldiers, wishing with them 205 B.C. [to go] northwards to take [the states of] Yen and Chao, eastwards to attack [the state of] Ch'i, and southwards to cut the roads by which provisions were brought to the Ch'u [army]. The King of Han gave them [to him]. In the third year, in the winter, the tenth month, III Han Hsin and Chang Erh went eastwards, subjugated Nov./Dec. Ching-hsing, and attacked [the state of] Chao. They beheaded Ch'en YÃ¼ and captured the King of Chao, [Chao] Hsieh. [Then] the commanderies of Ch'angshan and Tai were established. On [the day] chia-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, Dec. 20 there was an eclipse of the sun.1 1 For eclipses, cf. App. IV. In the eleventh Dec./Jan. month, on [the day] kuei-mao, the last day of the 204 B.C. month, there was an eclipse of the sun. Since Sui Ho had persuaded Ch'ing Pu [to rebel], [Ch'ing] Pu set his troops in motion and attacked [the state of] Ch'u. Ch'u sent Hsiang Sheng and Lung ChÃ¼ to attack [Ch'ing] Pu. [Ch'ing] Pu fought [with them, but] did not defeat them. In the twelfth month, [Ch'ing] Pu, with Sui Ho, by unfrequented Jan./Feb. paths, returned to Hans. The King of 35b Han gave him a part of his own troops and, together with him, he collected troops and reached Ch'eng-kao. Hsiang YÃ¼ several times invaded and captured the walled road of Han [with the result that] the army of Han lacked food. [The King of Han] schemed with Li Yi-chi to enfeeble the power of Ch'u. [Li] Yi-chi wanted to set up the descendants of the six [ancient feudal] states in order to establish factions; the King of Han had seals engraved and was going to send [Li] Yi-chi to set them up, when he asked Chang Liang about it. Chang Liang brought forward 84KAO-TSU, Year III 204 B.C. eight objections.1 1 They are enumerated in ch. 40: 6a-7a. The King of Han stopped 1A: 35b eating and spit out what he had in his mouth, saying [to Li Yi-chi], "Stupid bookworm! You've almost spoiled your daddy's business." [Then] he ordered the seals to be quickly melted down. He also asked Ch'en P'ing [what to do], and followed his plan. He gave [Ch'en] P'ing forty thousand catties of [real] gold in order in Ch'u to separate the lord from his followers. May/June In the summer, the fourth month, Hsiang YÃ¼ besieged the [King of2 2 Wang Nien-sun says that the word has dropped out of this sentence; without it, the meaning is not clear. Li Shan (649-689), in the Wen-hsÃ¼an 14: 18b, quotes this sentence without this word. But in the Wen-hsÃ¼an 47: 11b, he quotes it with this word, so that in the other quotation this word must have later been deleted. Where this passage is quoted in the Han-chi 3: 14a and in the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 10: 7b, the word is used. ] Hans at Jung-yang, and the King of Hans begged for peace, [offering] to cut off [the region] west of Jung-yang as [the country of] Hans [leaving the rest to Hsiang YÃ¼. But] his Second Father, [Fan Tseng], urged Hsiang YÃ¼ to hasten and attack Jung-yang. The King of Han was worried over [that possibility, but] since Ch'en P'ing's [plan to bring about] a change and a separation [between the lord and his followers in Ch'u] had already succeeded, [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was, as a result, suspicious of his Second Father, [Fan Tseng]. His Second Father was [therefore] very angry, so went away, June/July became ill, and died. In the fifth month, General Chi Hsin said, "The situation has become urgent. Your servant begs [for permission] to deceive [the army of] Ch'u [so that] you can thereby escape in the 36a interval." Therefore Ch'en P'ing at night sent out more than two thousand women by the east gate.3 3 In the SC it is said that they were armed. [The troops of] Ch'u thereupon attacked them from all sides. Now Chi Hsin had mounted the King's chariot, with its yellow canopy and plumes on the 85KAO-TSU, Year III 1A: 36a left,1 1 According to Li Fei (prob. iii cent.) and Ts'ai Yung (133192), the emperor's chariot had a yellow silk lining to its roof, and the "plumes" were a bunch of feathers or of yak tail hair attached to the left end of the yoke at the end of the chariot tongue or attached to the left outer horse of the quadriga. Ying Shao says that the "plumes" were made of pheasant feathers and put onto the bit of the left outside horse, but Yen Shih-ku says he is wrong. This passage, together with the foregoing comments, is the locus classicus for the description of the ancient imperial chariot. and said: "Our food is gone. The King of 204 B.C. Han submits to Ch'u." [The soldiers of] Ch'u all called out, "Long live the King," and went to the east of the city to look at [the pretended King of Han]. Because of that, the King of Han succeeded in going out of the western gate with several tens of cavalrymen and fled. He had ordered the Grandee Secretary Chou Ho, Wei Pao, and his excellency Ts'ung to defend Jung-yang. When [Hsiang] YÃ¼ saw Chi Hsin, he asked where the King of Han was. [Chi Hsin] replied, "He has already gone away." [Hsiang] YÃ¼ [thereupon] burnt [Chi] Hsin to death. Meanwhile Chou Ho and his excellency Ts'ung said to each other, "It is difficult to defend a city together with a king who has made his state rebel." Hence they killed Wei Pao. When the King of Han went out of Jung-yang, he went to Ch'eng-kao, [and] from Ch'eng-kao he entered the [Han-ku] pass. He collected troops, wanting to return eastwards, but Master YÃ¼an advised the King of Han, saying, "Hans and Ch'u 36b have opposed each other at Jung-yang for several years, and Hans has continually been exhausted. I wish that your Majesty would go out by the Wu pass.2 2 This route would carry him to the south of Kuan-chung; he had been east of it. [Then] King Hsiang [YÃ¼] would have to lead [away] his troops and hasten southwards. Your 86KAO-TSU, Year III 204 B.C. Majesty would be deeply entrenched and [remain 1A: 36b on the defensive], so you would permit [the region] between Jung-yang and Ch'eng-kao temporarily to secure a rest. You would send Han Hsin and others to take, piece by piece, [the state of] Chao in the region north of the [Yellow] River, and make an alliance with [the states of] Yen and Ch'i. Your majesty will thereupon [be able to] return to Jung-yang. If you do this, then [the state of] Ch'u must be prepared at many places, and its strength will be divided. When Hans has secured a rest, and fights with [Ch'u] again, the rout [of Ch'u] will be certain." The King of Han followed his plan and led out his army between YÃ¼an and ShÃª; he marched and collected soldiers with Ch'ing Pu. When [Hsiang] YÃ¼ heard that the King of Han was at YÃ¼an, he really led his troops southwards. [But] the King of Han was firmly entrenched, and did not fight with him. In that month, P'eng YÃ¼eh crossed the Sui [River], fought with Hsiang Sheng and the Lord of Hsieh at Hsia-p'ei, routed [their armies], and killed the Lord of Hsieh. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had the old gentleman Chung defend Ch'eng-kao and himself went east to attack P'eng YÃ¼eh. The King of Han led his troops north, attacked and routed the old gentleman Chung, and again encamped at Ch'eng-kao. July/Aug. By the sixth month, [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had already routed P'eng YÃ¼eh and made him flee. When he heard that [the King of] Han had again encamped at Ch'eng-kao, he thereupon led his troops west, took the city of Jung-yang by storm, and captured Chou Ho alive. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ said to [Chou] Ho: "Be my general and I will make your honor First [Ranking] General and will appoint you [with the income of] thirty thousand families." [But] Chou Ho reviled him and said: "If you do not forthwith 87KAO-TSU, Year III 1A: 36b submit to Hans, you may now [consider yourself] its 204 B.C. captive. You are not a match for the King of Han." 37a [Hsiang] YÃ¼ boiled Chou Ho [alive] and also killed his excellency Ts'ung. Moreover he captured the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin. Thereupon he besieged Ch'eng-kao. The King of Hans fled; alone, with the Lord of T'eng, [Hsia-hou Ying], sharing his chariot, he came out of Ch'eng-kao by the Jade Gate, went northwards, crossed the [Yellow] River, and spent the night at Hsiao-hsiu-wu. By calling himself a messenger, at dawn he [managed to] gallop into the entrenchments of Chang Erh and Han Hsin and took from them [the command of] their army. Then he sent Chang Erh northwards to collect troops in the region of Chao. In the seventh month, there was a bushy comet in Aug/Sept. the [constellation] Ta-chio.1 1 This comet was supposed to be an inauspicious sign. It is listed as no. 15 in John Williams, Observations of Comets, London, 1871. When the King of Hans got the army of Han Hsin, he became powerful again. In the eighth Sept./Oct. month he approached the [Yellow] River, and, going southwards, he encamped at Hsiao-hsiu-wu, intending to engage in battle again. [But] the Gentleman-of-the-Palace Cheng Chung advised him to stop, that he, the King of Han, should build high his ramparts, deepen his moats, and not fight [any battles]. The King of Han followed this strategy. He sent [out] Lu Wan and Liu Chia, leading twenty thousand soldiers and several hundred 37b cavalry. They crossed [the Yellow River] at the Pai-ma ford, entered the territory of Ch'u, assisted P'eng YÃ¼eh to burn the accumulated stores of Ch'u, again attacked and routed the army of Ch'u west of the suburb of Yen, and attacked and captured Sui-yang and Wai-huang, seventeen cities [in all]. In the ninth month, [Hsiang] YÃ¼ said to his Commander-in-chief, Oct./Nov. 88KAO-TSU, Year III 204 B.C. Ts'ao Chiu, the Marquis of Hai-ch'un, 1A: 37b "Cautiously defend Ch'eng-kao. If the King of Han wishes to provoke a battle, be careful not to engage in a battle with him. Only do not allow him to go eastwards. In fifteen days I shall certainly have subjugated the region of Liang and will again come to you, general." [Hsiang] YÃ¼ led his troops eastwards and attacked P'eng YÃ¼eh. The King of Han sent Li Yi-chi to advise the King of Ch'i, T'ien Kuang, to cease defending himself with his troops and make peace with Hans. IV In the fourth year, in the winter, the tenth month, Nov./Dec. Han Hsin, following the plan of K'uai T'ung, made a surprise attack upon and routed [the army of] Ch'i. The King of Ch'i [thereupon] boiled Master Li [Yi-chi alive] and fled east to Kao-mi. When Hsiang YÃ¼ heard that Han Hsin had routed [the army of] Ch'i and moreover wanted to attack Ch'u, he sent Lung ChÃ¼ to save Ch'i. [As Hsiang YÃ¼ had] predicted, [the army of] Hans [tried] several times to provoke a battle at Ch'eng-kao, but the army of Ch'u would not come out. [Then the King of Hans] sent people to insult [the army and its generals. After] several days, the Commander-in-chief, [Ts'ao] Chiu, was angry and 38a crossed the Szu River with his troops. When the officers and soldiers were half-way across, [the army of] Hans attacked them and severely routed the army of Ch'u. [The King of Han then] took all that the state of Ch'u had of gold, jewels, goods, and riches. The Commander-in-chief, [Ts'ao] Chiu and his Chief Official,1 1 The text here is ; the second word should probably be to conform to usage elsewhere in the HS. [Szu-ma] Hsin, both cut their own throats on the Szu River. The King of Hans led his troops across the [Yellow] River and again took Ch'eng-kao, encamping at Kuang-wu 89KAO-TSU, Year IV 1A: 38a and going to the Ao Granary for food. 204 B.C. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had subjugated some ten odd cities of the region of Liang when he heard that the Marquis of Hai-ch'un, [Ts'ao Chiu's, army] had been routed. Thereupon he led his troops back. The army of Hans was just then besieging Chung-li Mo [at a place] east of Jung-yang; when it heard that [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had arrived, it all fled to the precipitous and difficult [terrain at Kuang-wu.] [Hsiang] YÃ¼ also encamped at Kuang-wu; [his army] and [that of] Hans watched each other; the strong men were suffering from [constant] military service, the old and weak were exhausted in transporting food. The King of Han and [Hsiang] YÃ¼ had an interview on the border of the stream in the gully1 1 Reading for at the suggestion of Ho Ch'uo (16611722) and Chou Shou-ch'ang. The T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan, ch. 69, quoting this line from HS ch. 31, writes the former character. Cf. Glossary sub "Kuang-wu". [between the two cities of] Kuang-wu, and talked [together. Hsiang] YÃ¼ wanted to fight a duel single-handed with the King of Han. [But] the King of Han rebuked [Hsiang] YÃ¼ by enumerating his faults, saying, "When at first I received orders 38b together with you, YÃ¼, King Huai said, `Whoever first subjugates Kuan-chung will be made its king. You, YÃ¼, outraged this covenant and made me king of Shu and Hansâthis was your first crime. You, YÃ¼, murdered by a false authorization the high minister2 2 Wen Ying (fl. ca. 196-220) says that was at that time an honorable appellation, analogous to -tzu. Yen Shih-ku (581-645) approves. Kao-tsu is here referring to the murder of Sung Yi, who was the first ranking general in King Hsiang's army. Cf. 13a, 14b. who had command of the army, and exalted yourselfâthis was your second crime. After you, YÃ¼, had rescued [the state of] Chao, you ought to have returned to report [to King Huai]; 90KAO-TSU, Year IV 204 B.C. on the contrary, without authorization, you seized 1A: 38b the troops of the nobles and went through the [Han-ku] Passâthis was your third crime. King Huai had engaged his word that when [the troops] entered [the region of] Ch'in there would be no violence or plundering; [but] you, YÃ¼, burnt the palaces and courts of Ch'in, dug up the tomb of the First Emperor,1 1 As a severe punishment to the First Emperor. and took for your own his riches2 2 Those sealed up by Kao-tsu in the palaces and courts as well as those in the tomb. Cf. 1A: 20b. âthis was your fourth crime. In violence you also murdered the King of Ch'in, Tzu-ying, who had surrenderedâthis was your fifth crime. By treachery yoÃ¹ buried in a trench at Hsin-an two hundred thousand young men of Ch'in and gave kingdoms to their generals3 3 For this incident cf. Mh II, 272-3. Hsiang YÃ¼ had treacherously murdered a Ch'in army which had surrendered, numbering more than 200,000 men, saving only its three generals, Chang Han, Szu-ma Hsin, and Tung Yi, alive, who were made Kings of Yung, Sai, and Ti, respectively. âthis was your sixth crime. You have everywhere made the generals kings of good regions and removed and expelled their former lords,4 4 Such as Tsang Tu, the general of Yen, T'ien Tu, the general of Ch'i, Chang Erh, the minister of Chao, and others who were made kings of their states, displacing the former kings. Cf. 1A: 27a &amp; b. making ministers and subjects to strive, rebel, and commit treasonâthis was your seventh crime. You drove out and expelled the Emperor Yi from P'eng-ch'eng, making it your own capital. You took by force the territory of the King of Hanh,5 5 Cf. HS 1A: 29b. Chavannes forgot the incident noted in that passage (which is in the SC, cf. Mh II, 293), so wrongly suggests emending Hanh to Weiw. Cf. Mh II, 376, n. 1. Chang Liang, Kao-tsu's follower, had been a minister of King Ch'eng of Hanh, hence Hsiang YÃ¼'s mistreatment and murder of King Ch'eng would touch Kao-tsu closely. and reigned over Liang and Ch'u at the same time, giving too much [of the conquered territory] to yourselfâthis was your 91KAO-TSU, Year IV 1A: 38b eighth crime. You sent men to assassinate the Em- 204 B.C. peror Yi secretly in Chiang-nanâthis was your ninth crime. Verily, in your own character as a subject, you have murdered your lord, murdered those who had1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that is here a superfluous interpolation and dittography; SC 8: 25a has this sentence without this character. already surrendered, in your government you 39a have been unjust, and as administrator of the covenant you have been faithless. [Such deeds are what] the world cannot endure; [they constitute] treason and inhuman conduct2 2 The name of the most serious crime in the Chinese code. âthis is your tenth crime. I, with my righteous soldiers,3 3 Cf. Mh II, 376, n. 2. am an associate of the nobles in punishing a merciless brigand. I should send an ex-convict to fight with you, sirâwhy should I then suffer the trouble of [fighting] a duel with you, sir?" [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was very angry, shot a hidden crossbow, and hit the King of Han. The King of Han was wounded in the breast, but he grasped his foot and said, "This caitiff has hit me in the toe."4 4 He had the presence of mind to dissimulate the seriousness of his wound in order to avoid frightening his troops. The King of Han suffered from his wound and lay on his bed, [but] Chang Liang strongly begged the King of Han to arise, go about among the army and allay [their disquietude] in order to quiet the officers and soldiers and not permit [the army of] Ch'u to take advantage of it to gain a victory. The King of Han went out and visited the army, [but] he suffered greatly, and consequently rode into Ch'eng-kao. In the eleventh month, Han Hsin and Kuan Ying Dec./Jan. attacked and routed the army of Ch'u and killed the 203 B.C. Ch'u general, Lung ChÃ¼. They pursued it to Ch'eng-yang and captured the King of Ch'i, [T'ien] Kuang. The minister of Ch'i, T'ien Heng, set himself 92KAO-TSU, Year IV 203 B.C. up as King of Ch'i and fled to P'eng YÃ¼eh. 1A: 39a Hans set up Chang Erh as King of Chao. When the King of Han's illness was abated, he went west through the [Han-ku] Pass [and came] to YÃ¼eh-yang, [where he] visited and conversed with the elders, and gave them a feast. He exposed on a post in the market-place of YÃ¼eh-yang the head of the former King of Sai, [Szu-ma] Hsin.1 1 He had committed suicide at the Szu River; his head was exposed at YÃ¼eh-yang because it was his former capital and he had traitorously gone over to Hsiang YÃ¼ after surrendering to Kao-tsu. He stayed [there] four days [and then] went back to his army. It remained encamped at Kuang-wu, [so that] soldiers more and more came out from Kuan-chung, while, [on the other hand] P'eng YÃ¼eh and T'ien Heng2 2 The name of T'ien Heng is also in the SC; after being driven out by Hans he would hardly be helping Hans by harassing Ch'u, yet on the page before he is said to have fled to P'eng YÃ¼eh, who was only an ally, not a subject of Hans. Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755) and Wang Hsien-ch'ien hence think that "T'ien Heng" is an interpolation. It may however be genuine. were in the region of Liang, going back and forth and harassing the troops of Ch'u, cutting off their food supplies. When Han Hsin had routed [the forces of] Ch'i, he 39b sent men to say [to the King of Han], "[The state of] Ch'i is a neighbor of [the state of] Ch'u. My authority is slight; if you do not make me king temporarily, I fear that I may not be able to tranquillize Ch'i." The King of Han was angry and wished to attack him, [but] Chang Liang said, "It is better to accede to [his request] and to set him up [as king,] thus causing him to defend [Ch'i] for his own sake." In the spring, the second month, [the Mar./Apr. King of Han] sent Chang Liang with a seal to establish Han Hsin as King of Ch'i. In the autumn, the seventh month, he set up Aug./Sept. Ch'ing Pu as King of Huai-nan. In the eighth Sept./Oct. 93KAO-TSU, Year IV. 1A: 39b month the poll-tax (suan) was levied for the first time.1 1 Ju Shun writes that the comment in the Han-Chiu-yi (written supposedly by Wei Hung, fl. 25-57) says, "People from their fifteenth to their fifty-sixth year were required to pay the capitation tax. Each person [paid] 120 cash as one poll-tax, for the care of the arsenal, the soldiers, the chariots, and the horses." Cf. Mh III, 541 n. 6. But cf. Glossary, sub Poll-tax. 203 B.C. People of the northern Mo and of Yen come, bringing intrepid cavalry2 2 Lit. "owl cavalry." to assist Hans. The King of Han issued an order that the officials should provide shrouds, coverlets, coffins, and encoffining for all the soldiers in the army who were so unfortunate as to die, and send them back to their homes. In all directions, [people's] hearts turned to him. Hsiang YÃ¼ himself knew that he had little support and that his food supply was at an end. Han Hsin was again advancing his troops to attack Ch'u,3 3 For details of the situation, cf. SC chap. 95 or HS chap. 41; the Glossary, sub Han Hsin. and 40a [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was worried about him. Hans sent Lu Chia to talk to [Hsiang] YÃ¼ and beg for the T'ai-kung,4 4 Kao-tsu's father, whom Hsiang YÃ¼ was holding as a hostage, together with his wife. The HS says nothing about his mother, although the SC mentions her (but this mention is probably a mistake. Cf. p. 124 n. 1; Mh II, 313). but [Hsiang] YÃ¼ did not listen [to him]. Hans again sent his excellency Hou to talk to [Hsiang] YÃ¼. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ then made a treaty [with Hans] to divide the world5 5 The Chinese thought of their country as comprising the (known) world and the Emperor regularly spoke of his territory as "the world" . in half, making the boundary at the Hung-kou,â[the territory] west of it to be Hans's and that east of it to be Ch'u's. In the ninth Oct./Nov. month [Hsiang YÃ¼] sent back the T'ai-kung and the 94KAO-TSU, Year IV 203 B.C. Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼. The army all shouted, "Long 1A: 40a life." Thereupon [the King of Han] appointed his excellency Hou as the P'ing-kuo General.1 1 Lit. "The general who brings peace to the country." The Official ed. (1739), the SC 7: 28b and the Han-chi (ii cent.) write "baronet" ; Wang Hsien-ch'ien and the old texts write instead "general" . For Kao-tsu's tribute to his excellency Hou, which is taken from the Chu-Han Ch'un-ch'iu (197 B.C.), cf. Mh II, 313. [Hsiang] YÃ¼ withdrew [his army] and returned to the east. The King of Han wanted to return to the west, [but] Chang Liang and Ch'en P'ing admonished him, saying, "Now Hans has the larger half of the world and the nobles are all its adherents, [whereas] the troops of Ch'u are exhausted and their food is 40b gone. This is the time when Heaven will destroy it. If you do not profit by this opportunity and take [the kingdom of Ch'u], [you will be in the situation when] it is said: `By rearing a tiger one brings misfortune upon himself.' " The King of Han followed [their counsel].2 2 Kao-tsu's action in attacking Hsiang YÃ¼ just after he had made a treaty of peace with him does, of course, involve a breach of that treaty. But in ancient China, as in modern Europe, treaties were little respected unless keeping them was plainly to the advantage of both parties. Hsiang YÃ¼ had showed himself as little scrupulous in keeping his word as any of the leaders in his time. Cf. p. 64. In his refusal to abide by the covenant requiring him to award Kuan-chung to Kao-tsu (cf. p. 66), and in his slaughter of a surrendered army (cf. p. 90, n. 3), he had shown himself quite unscrupulous, so that he had no real claim upon Kao-tsu that might require him to keep his agreement. Kao-tsu was merely requiting Hsiang YÃ¼ with the sort of treatment he had received from him. 95 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter I THE ANNALS OF [EMPEROR] KAO-[TSU] PART II1 1 In the second part of this chapter more than half of the material in the HS is not to be found in the SC ch. 7 &amp; 8. It looks as if Pan Ku, when he used the SC for his source, made a practise of condensing that material while preserving its essential features, and then added what important new material he had gathered, especially from the imperial edicts and from memorials to the throne. In the first few pages, the HS is here excerpting its material from SC chap. 7, which gives a fuller account than SC chap. 8; a little later it turns to SC chap. 8. Cf. Mh II, 313ff. In the fifth year, in the winter, the tenth month, V the King of Han pursued Hsiang YÃ¼ to [a place] Nov. south of Yang-chia. [There] he stopped and encamped. He had arranged for a meeting with the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, and with the Chancellor of State in Weih, [P'eng] YÃ¼eh, to attack Ch'u; [but even] when he reached Ku-ling, they did not meet him. [The army of] Ch'u attacked the army of Hans and severely routed it. [So] the King of Han again went into entrenchments, digging deep his moat, and held himself on the defensive. He said to Chang Liang, "The nobles do not follow [me], what can I do?" [Chang] Liang replied, "Altho the troops of Ch'u are almost routed, you have not yet distributed to [your followers] any territory; it is really quite natural that they did not come. If your Majesty is able to share the world 1b with them, you can get them to come immediately. The establishment of [Han] Hsin as King of Ch'i was not your Majesty's design; [Han] Hsin is moreover not yet sure of his position. P'eng YÃ¼eh originally subjugated the region of Liang; at first your 96KAO-TSU, Year V 203 B.C. Majesty installed [P'eng] YÃ¼eh as Chancellor of State 1B: 1b on account of Wei Pao; now [Wei] Pao is dead and [P'eng] YÃ¼eh hopes to be king, but your Majesty did not decide [to appoint him] in good time. If now you will take [the region] north of Sui-yang to Ku-ch'eng and make P'eng YÃ¼eh king of it all, and give the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, [the region] from the east of Ch'en2 to the oceanâ[Han] Hsin's home is in Ch'u; he wants to obtain again his home townâ if you can give up these territories and promise them to these two men, making each one fight for his own [interests], then Ch'u will easily be defeated." Thereupon the King of Han dispatched a messenger to cause Han Hsin and P'eng YÃ¼eh to come. Both came, leading their troops. Dec. In the eleventh month, Liu Chia entered the region of Ch'u and besieged Shou-ch'un. Hans also sent someone to tempt the Commander-in-chief of Ch'u, Chou Yin. [Chou] Yin rebelled against Ch'u; with [forces from] Shu, he [captured and] massacred [the inhabitants of] Liu5, raised the troops of [the kingdom of] Chiu-chiang, and welcomed [back] Ch'ing Pu; they marched together and massacred [the inhabitants of] Ch'eng-fu. In the train of1 1 The Fukien ed. (1549) follows the SC chap. 8 (Mh II, 378) in reading "Sui Ho" instead of "in the train of" . But chap. 7 of the SC, in telling of this event (cf. Mh II, 315) reads "in the train of." Sui Ho was Kao-tsu's Internuncio, not at all a military man; nowhere else is he said to have taken part in any fighting. HS 31: 22b likewise reads "in the train of"; 35: 1b, in recounting this incident has the same meaning. The word H0 in the SC ch. 8 must therefore be an interpolation. Liu Chia they all joined forces. 2a In the twelfth month they surrounded [Hsiang] Dec./Jan. YÃ¼'s [camp] at Kai-hsia. In the night [Hsiang] YÃ¼ 202 B.C. heard the army of Hans on all sides singing the songs of Ch'u,2 2 These songs were a stratagem on Kao-tsu's part, to induce homesickness in Hsiang YÃ¼'s soldiers as well as to deceive him about the extent of the rebellion against him. and thought that [the King of Han] had 97KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 2a gained all the territory of Ch'u, [so Hsiang] YÃ¼ fled 202 B.C. with several hundred horsemen. Because of this fact, his army was severely defeated. Kuan Ying pursued and beheaded [Hsiang] YÃ¼ at Tung-ch'eng.1 1 The HS is following the account in the SC chap. 8; but the SC says "killed" instead of "beheaded" (cf. Mh II, 379). Hsiang YÃ¼ committed suicide after being wounded more than ten times and being cornered; then Wang Yi, a cavalryman, cut off his head, and there was a fight among some of Kao-tsu's generals and soldiers over his body and the reward for it. Cf. Mh II, 320. For the splendid account of his final stand, parting speeches, and death, cf. Mh II, 316-320, also HS ch. 31; Glossary, sub Hsiang Chi. [Thereafter] the territory of Ch'u was all subjugated, only [the state of] Lu2 2 Hsiang YÃ¼ had been made a Duke of Lu (cf. 1A: 13b) and had spent some time there (cf. 1A: 33a). would not submit. The King of Han led the troops of the empire3 3 Lit. "of the world" , indicating that he was now master of the then known world, China. [against it], intending to massacre its [inhabitants]. Because it was a state which had guarded itself faithfully and was [known for its] proper conduct and sense of human relationships,4 4 This curious statement, worthy of a Confucian historian, is taken from SC 7: 33a. Cf. Mh II, 321; HS 88: 3a. [the King of Han had] the head of [Hsiang] YÃ¼ held up and shown to the elders [of Lu]; then Lu surrendered. Because King Huai had originally appointed [Hsiang] YÃ¼ as the Duke of Lu, and because when he died Lu was still firmly defended for him, [the King of Han had Hsiang] YÃ¼ therefore buried at Ku-ch'eng [with the title of]5 5 Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) says that, since the SC and chap. 31 of the HS add "with the title of" at this point, the word should be in the text here too. 98KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. a Duke of Lu. The King of Han proclaimed a 1B: 2a 2b mourning ceremony1 1 Reading with the official ed. (1739) instead of the present . The two words here seem practically interchangeable. for him. He wept and lamented, then left. He appointed Hsiang Po and others, [altogether] four [of Hsiang YÃ¼'s kindred], as marquises, granting them the [imperial] surname, Liu.2 2 Hsiang Po was the person who defended Kao-tsu when he was in danger of assassination at Hung-men. Cf. 1A: 22. These four marquises were: Liu Chan (Hsiang Po), Marquis of She-yang; Liu T'o, Marquis of P'ing-kao; Liu Hsiang, Marquis of T'ao-an; the fourth is not listed in HS chap. 18, (p. 10b, 33a, and 58a, which furnish the preceding three names) nor elsewhere; the SC merely gives his name as the Marquis of HsÃ¼an-wu ; cf. Mh II, 322. The granting of the imperial surname, Liu, was an especial honor. All the people who had been captured [and kept] in Ch'u were [allowed] to return [home]. The King of Han returned to Ting-t'ao, rode into the entrenchments of the King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, and took away his army.3 3 Kao-tsu was uncertain of the loyalty of Han Hsin. The King of Lin-chiang, Kung Ao, whom Hsiang YÃ¼ had originally set up, had previously died; his son [Kung] Wei had been set up [by Hsiang YÃ¼] in succession as king, [so] he did not surrender. [The King of Han] sent Lu Wan and Liu Chia to attack him; Jan./Feb. they captured [Kung] Wei. In the spring, the first month, [the King of Han] posthumously honored his older brother [Liu] Po, entitling him Marquis Wu-ai. 99KAO-TSU, Year V 1A: 2b An order was given, saying, "The region of Ch'u 202 B.C. has already been subjugated, [but] the Emperor Yi had no heirs; We wish to be solicitous for the people of Ch'u and fix upon a king for them. The King of Ch'i, [Han] Hsin, is well versed in the customs of Ch'uâlet [his kingdom] be changed and [let] him be established as the King of Ch'u, ruling over [the region] north of the Huai [River], with his capital at Hsia-p'ei. The Chancellor of State at Weih, the Chien-ch'eng Marquis, P'eng YÃ¼eh, has toiled diligently for the people of Weih; he has humbled and abased himself to his soldiers and officers. Often with a few [followers] he has attacked a more numerous [force]; several times he has routed the army of Ch'u. Let him be made king over the former territory of Weih, with the title, `The King of Liang.' His capital shall be at Ting-t'ao." [The order] also said, "The troops have not had rest for eight years. All the people have suffered severely.1 1 Wang Nien-sun explains that is here a meaningless auxiliary word. Cf. 4: 19b. Now [my efforts in settling the control] of the world have been brought to completion. Let an amnesty [be proclaimed] throughout the world [for all crimes] below [those deserving] capital punishment." Thereupon the nobles sent up a petition to [the 3a King of Han], saying: "The King of Ch'u, Han Hsin, the King of Hanb, [Hanw] Hsin, the King of Huai-nan, Ying Pu, the King of Liang, P'eng YÃ¼eh, the former King of Heng-shan, Wu Jui, the King of Chao, Chang Ao, and the King of Yen, Tsang Tu, risking death and making repeated obeisances,2 2 . In the time of the Ch'in dynasty the phrase "blindly risking the commission of a crime worthy of capital punishment" (cf. Mh II, 126) was used in a memorial to the emperor. Chou Shou-ch'ang tells that the former Han dynasty followed the Ch'in customs, so continued the use of this phrase, merely altering its words slightly, as in the text. When Wang Mang came to the throne, he loved to follow ancient practises, so he had officials use the phrase , "I bow my head to the earth," which is found in the Book of History. His courtiers however thought this phrase was not sufficiently humble, so wrote . "I bow my head to the earth, making repeated obeisances," (found in Mencius V, II, vii, 4; Legge, p. 386.) Liu Chao (fl. first half of the vi. cent A.D.) in his comment on chap. 11 of the HHS, quotes a memorial of Ts'ai Yung (133-192), written when he was on frontier duty, which begins, "Your servant Yung, bowing his head to the earth and making repeated obeisances, memorializes Your Majesty the Emperor " and ends, "Your servant, knocking his head on the earth as one who is worthy of capital punishment, bowing his head to the earth and making repeated obeisances, brings [this matter] to your hearing ." Thus the Later Han dynasty combined the phraseology introduced by Wang Mang with that used earlier. The memorial in the text uses all the stock phraseology of address to an emperor except the word, "Emperor." This memorial is not in the SC, altho Kao-tsu's reply is quoted there; the mention of the names of the kings presenting it leads us to think that it is genuine. say 100KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. to your Majesty the great King:1 1 Lit. "the steps below [the throne of] the great king." The Emperor is often addressed as , which phrase is equivalent to the European "Your Majesty," but is much more humble. In times past 1B: 3a the Ch'in [dynasty] acted contrary to principle and the world punished it. You, great King, were the first to capture the King of Ch'in and subjugate Kuan-chungâyour achievements have been the greatest in the world. You have preserved the perishing and given repose to those in danger; you have rescued those who were ruined and have continued broken [lines of descent] in order to tranquillize all the people. Your achievements are abundant and your virtue is great. You have moreover granted favors to the vassal kings who have merit, enabling them to succeed in setting up their gods of the soil and grains.2 2 I.e., to establish their own state and dynasty. Cf. H. Maspero, La Chine antique, pp. 167-171. The division of the land has already been settled, but positions and titles are 101KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 3a [still] confounded with one another, without the 202 B.C. [proper] division of the superior [from] the inferior, so that the manifestation of your, the great King's, merits and virtue is not proclaimed to later generations. 3b Risking death and making repeated obeisances, we offer to our superior the honorable title of Emperor." The King of Hans replied, "I, a person of little virtue,1 1 The term regularily used for himself by the Emperor or by a king, when speaking to his subjects. It may usually be translated merely "I." Here it seems to have a special significance. have heard that [the title of] emperor should be possessed by a man eminent in talent and virtue. An empty name without [possessing] its reality should not be adopted. Now you, vassal kings, have all highly exalted me, a person of little virtue. How could I therefore occupy [such a position]?" The vassal kings all said, "You, great King, arose from small [beginnings]; you destroyed the seditious [dynasty of] Ch'in; your majesty stirs everything within the seas;2 2 I.e., everyone in the (Chinese) world. moreover, starting from a secluded and mean region, from Han-chung, you acted out your majesty and virtue, executing the unrighteous, setting up the meritorious, tranquillizing and establishing the empire. Meritorious officials all received territory and the income of towns; you did not appropriate them for yourself. Your virtue, great King, has been bestowed [even to the borders of] the four seas. We, vassal kings, [find our speech] inadequate to express it. For you to take the position of Emperor would be most appropriate. We hope that you, great King, will favor the world [by doing so]." The King of Han replied, "Since the vassal kings would be favored [by it] and since they consider it to be an advantage to [all] the people in the world, it 102KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. may be done."1 1 The SC tells that Kao-tsu declined the title for the customary three times before accepting. Cf. Mh, II, 380. 1B: 3b Thereupon the vassal kings and "your servant, the Grand Commandant and Marquis of Ch'ang-an, [Lu] Wan, and others, [altogether] three hundred persons, together with the Erudit and the Chi-szu Baronet, Shu-sun T'ung, carefully selected a favorable Feb./Mar. day." In the second month, on [the day] chia-wu,2 2 The HS has corrected the SC here. Cf. Mh, II, 381, n. 1. Feb. 28 they presented to their superior the honorable title [of Emperor] and the King of Han ascended the imperial throne upon the northern bank of the river 4a Szu.3 3 This is not the River Szu in Honan, but the one in Shantung. Cf. Mh II, 381, n. 2. SC ch. 99, HS 43: 14b tell that Kao-tsu ascended the throne at Ting-t'ao, which is on this river Szu. LÃ¼ Shen (prob. fl. dur. 265-330) says, "Formerly after [the Emperor Kao-]tsu of the Han [dynasty] had subjugated the world, he ascended the imperial throne at Ting-t'ao on the northern bank of the Szu River." The Queen was honored and called, "The Empress"; the Heir-apparent was called "The Imperial Heir-apparent"; the deceased old dame, [the Emperor's mother], was posthumously honored and called "The Chao-ling Lady." An imperial edict4 4 Ju Shun says, "From the time of the Ch'in and Han [dynasties] on, only the Son of Heaven alone employed [the word ]." It was also used by an Empress Dowager, cf. 11: 1b, 98: 10b. read: "The former King of Heng-shan, Wu Jui, together with his two sons and his older brother's son, followed by the troops of the many YÃ¼eh,5 5 The SC writes where the HS writes . These words were interchangeable. rendered very signal service in assisting the nobles in punishing the tyrannous Ch'in [dynasty]; the nobles set him up as King, [but] Hsiang YÃ¼ took away his territory by force, 103KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 4a calling him [merely] the Baronet of P'o. Let the 202 B.C. Baronet of P'o, [Wu] Jui, be established as King of Ch'ang-sha, [ruling over] Ch'ang-sha, YÃ¼-chang,1 1 YÃ¼-chang is later said to belong to the kingdom of Huai-nan; HS chap. 34 says it belonged to Ying Puâthe inclusion of this name here may be a copyist's addition. the Hsiang Commandery, Kuei-lin, and Nan-hai."2 2 Hsiang, Kuei-lin, and Nan-hai belonged at that time to Chao T'o, who, four years after this edict (196 B.C.) was confirmed by Kao-tsu as King Wu of Nan-yÃ¼eh (cf. 1B: 19a and SC chap. 113); hence the appointment of Wu Jui as king of these three regions was largely an empty gesture. The troops of Min-yÃ¼eh had come in the train of Wu Jui, hence he is made overlord of Nan-yÃ¼eh! His kingdom was really confined to Ch'ang-sha. It also said, "The ex-king of [Min-] YÃ¼eh, [Tsou] Wu-chu, for a generation has been perpetuating the ancestral sacrifices of YÃ¼eh; the Ch'in [dynasty] took away his territory by force, [so that] his gods of the soils and grains did not get any blood or food.3 3 Yen Shih-ku says, "In sacrifice blood and raw food are preferred." When the nobles were chastizing the Ch'in [dynasty, Tsou] Wu-chu himself led the troops of Min-chung to assist in destroying the Ch'in [dynasty]; [but] 4b Hsiang YÃ¼ set him aside and did not set him up [as king]. Now we make him King of Min-yÃ¼eh, ruling over the territory of Min-chung. Let them not neglect their charges." The Emperor thereupon went west4 4 He had taken the throne at Ting-t'ao, which is in the present Shantung. and established his capital at Lo-yang. In the summer, the fifth month, the troops were all disbanded and May/June returned to their homes. An imperial edict said, "The members of the noble families5 5 Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) shows that the were the of the nobles, the offshoots of the noble families. This phrase is also used in 1A: 34a, which fixes its meaning. in Kuan-chung 104KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. are exempted [from service and taxes] for 1B: 4b twelve years; those who have already returned [home are exempted for] half [that period].1 1 The SC adds that they were also to receive a year's supplies . As to the people who formerly had collected to take refuge in the mountains and marshes,2 2 Brigands and outlaws. whose names and numbers have not been enregisteredâthe world has now been pacified, [hence] We order that each return to his prefecture and resume his former noble rank, his fields, and his habitation. The officials, using civil laws, should teach and instruct [these people]; let it be published abroad3 3 Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) says that was anciently written for . that there is to be no beating nor shaming [of them]. As to those people who because of famine or hunger have themselves sold their persons to be slaves or slave-girls,4 4 This passage shows that there were private slaves in addition to those enslaved to the government as a punishment. let them all be freed and become common people. As to the officers and soldiers in the army who have been pardoned, those who have been without crime, but are without any noble rank, and those who have not 5a attained [the rank of] Grandee, We grant them all the noble rank of Grandee. To all those who formerly [had the rank] of Grandee and upward, We grant a noble rank one step [higher]. Let it be ordered that all those who have [the noble rank of] Seventh [Rank] Grandee and upward are to be given the revenue of estates;5 5 Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) says that according to the regulations of the Ch'in dynasty, marquises (the highest rank in the aristocratic hierarchy) had been given the revenue of estates. Now the seventh rank and upward are so honored. Cf. Glossary, sub Marquis. all those below [the noble rank of] Seventh [Rank] Grandee will themselves be personally 105KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 5a exempted [from public service] and their households 202 B.C. will not be required to do public service." It also said, "[The noble ranks] of Seventh [Rank] Grandee and Public Chariot and above are all high ranks. Among the members of the noble houses1 1 Cf. p. 103, n. 5. This passage especially indicates the correct meaning of this phrase, showing that they were distinct from the other soldiers. and those who have returned from the army are very many with high noble ranks; I have several times ordered the officials to give fields and habitations to them first, and that whatever they rightfully ask of the 5b officials should be promptly given them. There are some people with [high] noble titles as lords of men2 2 Yen Shih-ku explains, "If their noble ranks were high and they had kingdoms or estates, they themselves acted as lords to their people, hence it says, `Some who were lords of men.' " whom the Emperor has honored, performed the ceremonies, and set up a long time ago, [but] about whom the officials have unexpectedly not yet reached a decisionâthis is utterly unspeakable. As to those among the people of Ch'in who in former days were ennobled [with the ranks] of Universal Grandee and upwards, a Chief and an Assistant3 3 The heads of government bureaux were entitled Chiefs , their assistants were called Assistants . Prefects and their assistants were also called chiefs and assistants, respectively. Cf. Mh II, Appendix I. Two personages with the same rank greet each other with a long bow without any prostration, according to Ying Shao. should respect them as their equals. Now I do not think lightly of [these] noble ranks, why should the officials alone take them thus? Moreover, according to the law, those who have some achievement and have rendered meritorious service should be given fields and habitations; [yet] at present many of the small officials who have never been with the army have been satisfied, but those who have [military] merit have nevertheless received nothing. For a [Commandery] Administrator, a [Commandery] 106KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. Commandant, or a Chief Official to act contrary to 1B: 5b public interest and for the interests of private persons is a kind of teaching and instruction that is extremely bad. Let it be ordered that the officials should treat the holders of high noble ranks properly [in order to] conform to my wishes. Moreover there will be an inspection and examination; if there are [found] any who have not acted in accordance with my edict, they will be heavily sentenced." The Emperor held a feast in the Southern Palace 6a at Lo-yang. The Emperor said, "Marquises and generals, do not dare to hide anything from Us. Express all your feelings. What was the reason that I have obtained the empire? What was the reason that the house of Hsiang [YÃ¼] lost the empire?" Kao Ch'i1 1 The words "Kao Ch'i" may be an interpolation. Cf. Glossary, sub voce. and Wang Ling replied, "Your Majesty treats people cavalierly and is rude to them, [whereas] Hsiang YÃ¼ was kind and respected people; yet when your Majesty sent people to attack a city or overrun a region, you thereupon gave them whatever 6b they submitted, sharing your advantages with the world. Hsiang YÃ¼ was jealous of the capable and envious of the able; he [sought to] injure whoever had accomplished anything worth while and was suspicious of those who were capable. When people were victorious in battle he did not give them any glory; when they obtained some territory, he did not give others any advantage [of it]. The foregoing is the reason that he lost the empire." The Emperor said, "You sirs, know a part, but you do not know the whole. Now, in revolving plans in the tent and in making a victory certain at a distance of a thousand li, I am not as good as [Chang] Tzu-fang.2 2 The use of Chang Liang's style by the emperor (who usually uses a person's given name) was an extremely courteous form of address. In pacifying a state, in soothing the people, in supplying pay and provisions 107KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 6b and never permitting the communications for food 202 B.C. to be cut, I am not as good as Hsiao Ho. In uniting a crowd of a million [men], in being sure of victory in battle, and in taking whatever [place] one attacks,1 1 The Southern ed. (ca. x-xii cent.), the SC, the Han-chi (ii cent.), and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) read, "in being sure of obtaining the victory in battle and being sure of taking and getting booty from whatever [place] one attacks." I am not as good as Han Hsin. [These] three are all outstanding men. I was able to make use of themâ that is the reason I took the world. Hsiang YÃ¼ had one Fan Tseng, but he could not make use of him2 2 Cf. Mh II, p. 303f, HS 1A: 35b. âthat was the reason he became my captive." The crowd of officials were glad to acquiesce. Originally T'ien Heng had gone over to P'eng YÃ¼eh. When Hsiang YÃ¼ had already been destroyed, [T'ien] Heng was afraid of being executed, [so] with his clients and guests he fled into the sea. The Emperor was afraid that if he stayed long he would create trouble, [so] sent a messenger to grant [T'ien] Heng amnesty, saying, "If [T'ien] Heng [and his party] come [and surrender], the great [person in his company will be made] a king and the lesser [persons] marquises. If [he and his following] do not come, I will immediately send out troops and punish [him and his followers] with death." [T'ien] Heng was dismayed, [so], riding a [four-horse] post-carriage,3 3 Ju Shun comments, "According to the Code, [a carriage with] four horses having long limbs is a chih-chuan ("post carriage"); with four horses having medium limbs it is a ch'ih-chuan ("galloping carriage"); with four horses having short limbs it is a sheng-chuan ("riding carriage"); with one or two horses it is a yao-chuan ("small carriage"). One who is in haste rides a sheng-chuan." The Shuo-wen explains as "post-carriage." Cf. also 12: n. 9.3. he went to Lo-yang. When he was [still] thirty li away, he committed 71 108KAO-TSU, Year V 202 B.C. suicide. The Emperor admired his faithfulness and 1B: 7a wept for him. He sent out two thousand soldiers to bury him with the rites of a king. A banished man, Lou Ching, begged for an interview and said to the Emperor, "Your Majesty has taken the empire differently from [the way the] Chou [dynasty did],1 1 According to the Book of History, the Chou dynasty took the empire without a serious struggle; Kao-tsu had to fight for his position. Cf. HS 43: 10b-11b. [so that] your capital in Lo-yang is not advantageous. It is better to enter the passes and occupy the stronghold of the Ch'in [dynasty]." The Emperor asked Chang Liang about it. [Chang] Liang therefore urged the Emperor [likewise]. On that day [the Emperor] mounted the imperial chariot and went westwards to fix his capital at Ch'ang-an. He installed Lou Ching as the Fungch'un Baronet and granted him the [imperial] surname, Liu. June 26. In the sixth month, on the day jen-ch'en, a general amnesty for the world [was proclaimed]. July/Aug. In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of Yen, Tsang Tu, revolted.2 2 On this date, cf. Mh II, 384, n. 5. HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh (lived 148209) in the Ch'ien-han-chi, following SC 16: 29, dates this rebellion in the eighth month. The SC ch. 8 (Mh II, 384) mistakenly dates it in the tenth month. Tsang Tu had been set up as king by Hsiang YÃ¼ and moreover was guilty of murdering the previous king of Yen, so, fearing punishment, he revolted first. The Emperor, himself [acting as] general, marched against him. In the Sept./Oct. ninth month he captured [Tsang] Tu. An imperial edict [ordered] the vassal kings to look for a meritorious person to be made king of Yen. "The King of Ching, your servant, [Han] Hsin," and others, ten [in all], all replied, "The merits of the Grand Commadent and Marquis of Ch'ang-an, Lu Wan, are the greatest 109KAO-TSU, Year V 1B: 7a [of all]. We beg you to make him King of Yen." 202 B.C. 7b [The Emperor] sent his Lieutenent Chancellor [Fan] K'uai with troops to subjugate the region of Tai.1 1 The SC (Mh II, 384) tells that Tsang Tu had conquered Tai after revolting. The HS leaves this statement out and so leaves Fan K'uai's expedition motiveless. Li Chi rebelled; the Emperor personally [led the the army to] attack him and routed his [army]. Li Chi had been a general of Hsiang YÃ¼; when [Hsiang] YÃ¼ was defeated, Li Chi was the magistrate of Ch'en2. He had submitted [to Kao-tsu] and the Emperor had made him a Marquis in the Ying-ch'uan [Commandery]. When the Emperor had arrived at Lo-yang, he had summoned the whole of the marquises that were enregistered, hence Li Chi had been afraid and had rebelled. In the intercalary ninth month, [the Emperor] removed the members of noble families to Kuan-chung. Oct./Nov. He repaired the Ch'ang-lo Palace. In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, the Emperor ordered the prefectural cities and towns VI of the empire to build themselves city walls.2 2 The First Emperor had destroyed the inner and outer walls of cities (Mh II, 165); Kao-tsu allowed them to be rebuilt. But this edict was probably merely legalizing what had been done previously, for we hear of fortified cities before this time, even in Ch'in times; cf. 1A: 16b. Nov./Dec. A man gave information that the King of Ch'u, [Han] Hsin, was planning to revolt. The Emperor asked those around him [about it]; those around him vied [with each other], wanting to attack [Han 8a Hsin. But the Emperor] utilized the stratagem [suggested by] Ch'en P'ing. So he feigned to make a trip to YÃ¼n-meng. In the twelfth month he assembled the nobles at Ch'en2, and the King of 201 B.C. Ch'u, [Han] Hsin, went to pay his respects. Thereupon Jan./Feb. 110KAO-TSU, Year VI 201 B.C. [the Emperor] arrested him.1 1 For this stratagem, cf. Mh II, 386, n. 3. A vassal must visit the emperor when he arrives in the vassal's territory; in this way Kao-tsu was able to capture Han Hsin without a battle. 1B: 8a An imperial edict read, "Since the world has been at peace, eminent and distinguished persons who have merit have been appointed marquises. I am but newly seated [on the throne, hence] have not been able to plan a complete [reward for] their meritorious actions. They themselves have lived with the army for nine years, [so that] whether because they are not yet accustomed to the laws and ordinances, or because they formerly violated the law, [those who have committed] great [crimes] have been killed or mutilated. I pity them greatly. Let there be an amnesty granted to all the world."2 2 The SC merely says (Mh II, 386) that on the same day that Han Hsin was arrested a general amnesty was proclaimed; the HS quotes the proclamation, but leaves out its date. T'ien K'en congratulated the Emperor, saying, "[Your Majesty's plans are] very good. Your Majesty has taken Han Hsin and also rules from [the region of] Ch'in. Ch'in is a country with an excellent geographical situation. It is girdled by the [Yellow] River, with mountains as barriers, separated [from the rest of the world] along a thousand li [of border] with a million lance-bearersâ[the strength of] Ch'in is proportionate to double3 3 Reading to mean , as in Analects XII, ix, 3 and the . This sentence is far from clear; Chavannes translates quite differently. that of a hundred 8b [enemy]. Its geographical situation is convenient and favorable; when it sends down its troops [from the passes] upon the nobles, it is like [a person] on top of a high building upsetting water into a tile gutter. 111KAO-TSU, Year VI 1B: 8b Now Ch'i in the east has the richness of Lang-ya and 201 B.C. Chi-mo; in the south are the fastnesses of Mount T'ai; in the west are the obstacles on the Muddy River; on the north it has the advantages of the P'o Sea. Its territory is two thousand li square and it has a million lance-bearers. It is marked off and separated [from the rest of the world] along more than a thousand li [of boundaryâthe strength of] Ch'i is proportionate to double1 1 Cf. p. 110, n. 3. that of ten [enemy]. These are [then] an eastern and a western Ch'in.2 2 I.e., Ch'i on the east is similar to Ch'in on the west. 9a Only your own son or your own brother may be sent to be king over Ch'i." The Emperor replied, "Good." He gave him [the equivalent of] five hundred catties of gold.3 3 Gifts of this sort are sometimes said to be of and sometimes of , "real gold." For the distinction, cf. p. 175, n. 2. Silver was not coined until 125 B.C. (Cf. HS 24B: 12b in the comment.) HS chap. 24B: 3b says, "When the Ch'in ]dynasty] united the world, its money was of two sorts: actual gold made into yi [Meng K'ang, prob. ca. 180-260, says a yi was 20 ounces weight] was called the superior [kind of] money, and copper cash made like the Chou [dynasty] cash. [On them] is the inscription, `Half ounce'; their weight is the same as the inscription. But pearls, jade, tortoise-shells, cowries, silver, tin, and the like were used for vessels, ornaments, and valuable treasures, not made into currency." Page 1b of the same chapter says, "Actual gold an inch square weighs a catty . Cash are round with square holes; their weight is in terms of shu [1/24 of an ounce, cf. ch. IV, App. I]." The Emperor returned to Lo-yang and pardoned Han Hsin, appointing him as Marquis of Huai-yin. On the day chia-shen4 4 HS 16: 4b to 9b records ten appointments on this date, including that of Ts'ao Ts'an. [the Emperor] first split the 9b tallies and appointed his meritorious subjects, Feb. 13 Ts'ao Ts'an and others, as marquises. An imperial edict said, "Ch'i is an anciently 112KAO-TSU, Year VI 201 B.C. founded state; but now it [has been broken into] 1B: 9b commanderies [with their] prefectures. Let it again become [a state with] a nobility. General Liu Chia has several times performed great deeds; select him and some other persons who are large-hearted and kind, cultivated and pure, to rule over regions Feb./Mar. in Ch'i and Ching." In the spring, the Mar. 7 first month, on the day ping-wu, the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin, and others memorialized [the throne], begging that Liu Chia be made King of Ching, [ruling over] the fifty-three prefectures of the former Tung-yang Commandery, the Chang Commandery, and the Wu Commandery, and that [the Emperor] set up his younger brother the Wen-hsin Baronet, [Liu] Chiao, as King of Ch'u, [ruling over] the thirty-six prefectures of the Tang Commandery, the Hsieh 10a Commandery, and the T'an Commandery. On [the Mar. 13 day] jen-tzu [the Emperor] set up his older brother, the Yi-hsin Marquis, [Liu] Hsi, as King of Tai, [ruling over] the fifty-three prefectures of the YÃ¼n-chung, the Yen-men, and the Tai Commanderies. He set up his son, [Liu] Fei, as King of Ch'i, [ruling] over the seventy-three prefectures of the Chiao-tung, the Chiao-si, the Lin-tzu, the Chi-pei, the Po-yang, and the Ch'eng-yang1 1 Of the preceding commanderies, Tung-yang, Chang, Wu, T'an, Chiao-tung, Chiao-hsi, Lin-tzu, Chi-pei, Po-yang, and Ch'eng-yang were not among the thirty-six commanderies of Ch'in times. They were created in the period of Ch'u and Han, after the downfall of the Ch'in dynasty. commanderies. [The Emperor] made the kingdom of Hanh out of the thirty-one prefectures of the T'ai-yÃ¼an Commandery, and removed the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin, [to it], with his capital at Chin-yang.2 2 The kingdom of Hanh had been in Honan; it was now moved to a new region, in Shansi. In this way a possibly rebellious noble was moved out of central China to the northern border. 113KAO-TSU, Year VI 1B: 10a When the Emperor had already appointed [to 201 B.C. noble positions] twenty1 1 The present text says "thirty"; but the Han-chi says "twenty"; HS 40: 7b and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) say the same; in the table in HS chap. 16, twenty-seven appointments are recorded before the first month of Kao-tsu's sixth yearâthe character is plainly a copyist's error for . odd men of great merit, the rest disputed over their [respective] merits, for 10b which enfeoffments had not yet been made. When the Emperor was in the Southern Palace, from above on the double passageway,2 2 The "double passageways" were covered eleva d passageways between the various palaces. The T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-Lan, ch. 181, p. 4b says that between the Northern and Southern Palaces there was a distance of 7 li; in between there was a "double passageway" with three lanes: the central one for the Emperor and the other two for the high officials. Cf. Glossary. he saw the generals often talking together privately. He asked Chang Liang [about it, and Chang] Liang said, "Your Majesty conquered the world together with these people. Now you are already the Son of Heaven, and those whom you have enfeoffed are all your old friends and those whom you love, while those whom you have punished with death were all enemies you have made in your life-time, against whom you held a grudge. Now the army officers are counting up those who have merits and think that the world is insufficient to enfeoff them all, so they fear that for a [trifling] fault they might meet with the punishment of death. Hence they meet and plan to rebel." The Emperor replied, "What can I do for that?" [Chang] Liang replied, "Take the persons whom your Majesty has always disliked, figuring out the one whom all your courtiers know [you dislike] the very most, and enfeoff him first in order to show your courtiers [that you really mean them well]." In the 114KAO-TSU, Year VI 201 B.C. Apr./May third month the Emperor held a feast and enfeoffed 1B: 10b YÃ¼ng Ch'ih. Thereupon he urged his Lieutenant Chancellor [Hsiao Ho] to hasten and determine the merits [of the officers] and make the [due] appointments. When the feast was over, the courtiers were all glad and said, "Even Yung Ch'ih [has been made] a marquis; we have no cause at all for anxiety." The Emperor returned to YÃ¼eh-yang. Once every five days he would pay homage to the T'ai-kung [his father]. The Household Steward of the T'ai-kung admonished the T'ai-kung, saying, "Heaven has not two suns; the land has not two sovereigns. Although the Emperor is your son, he is the lord of men. Although you, the T'ai-kung, are his father, you are his subject. Why should you be the cause of the lord of men making obeisance before one who 11a is his subject? In this way, his majesty and authority are then not exhibited." Afterwards when the Emperor [came to pay] homage, the T'ai-kung, holding a broom, welcomed him at the door and walked backwards.1 1 These actions: holding a broom, welcoming him at the door, and walking backwards, indicated that T'ai-kung was acting as a subject, paying respect to the Emperor. SC 74: 3a tells that when Tsou Yen "went to Yen, King Chao of Yen, holding a broom, ran before him [to clear the way]." In the Chuang-tzu it is said that "The duty of disciples is to shake [their master's] skirts and sweep his mat." The Emperor was greatly startled. He descended2 2 The Emperor probably descended from his seat in his chariot and lifted up T'ai-kung, who was bending down, sweeping the path where the Emperor was to tread. and supported the T'ai-kung. The T'ai-kung said, "The Emperor is the lord of men, why should you overturn the principles of the world on my account?" On that account the Emperor in his heart approved the words of the Household Steward and granted him five hundred catties of actual gold. 115KAO-TSU, Year VI 1B: 11a In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] ping- 201 B.C. June/July wu, an imperial edict said, "Of all the close relationships, July 5 none is closer than that of father and son. Therefore when a father possesses the world he hands it down to his son, and when a son possesses the world his dignity reverts to his fatherâthis is the highest perfection of human principles. In former days the world was in great disturbance, armed troops arose everywhere, and all the people suffered calamities. We Ourself wore armor, wielded a pointed [weapon], and Ourself led Our officers and soldiers, braving danger and difficulty in order to put down the tyrannous and rebellious. We have set up a nobility, ended the war, and given the people rest, [so that] the world [is enjoying] a great peace. This is all [due to] the teaching and instruction of the T'ai-kung [Our father]. The kings, the marquises, the generals, the many ministers, and the Grandees have already honored Us [with the title of] Emperor; but the T'ai-kung has not yet had any title. Now We present to and honor the T'ai-kung with the title of the Grand Emperor." In the autumn, the ninth month, the Huns besieged 11b the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin, at Ma-yi, and Oct./Nov. [Hanw] Hsin surrendered to the Huns. In the seventh year, in the winter, the tenth VII month, the Emperor in person acting as general Nov./Dec. attacked the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin, at T'ung-ti, and beheaded his general.1 1 HS 33: 7b says that this general's name was Wang Hsi . For this event, cf. that passage. [But Hanw] Hsin escaped and fled to the Huns. Together with2 2 Chu Tzu-wen (before 1198) argues that in this passage and in the parallel sentence in the biography of Hanw Hsin, the word , which has been translated "together with," is not in the original text, because it does not make sense to say that these generals, together with their king, set up another person as king and then collected their king's troops for this new king. It is quite true that if we retain the word translated "together with," Hanw Hsin cannot be included in the subject of the sentence regarding the collection of the scattered troops. Chu Tzu-wen thinks that after Hanw Hsin had fled, his troops caused trouble, not knowing where their king was. His generals thereupon set up another king and gathered up the troops, then made a league with the Huns to resist the forces of Hans. He may be right; Wang Hsien-ch'ien agrees with him. However, on the principle that, other things being equal, a more difficult reading is to be preferred, the word translated "together with" has been retained in the translation, understanding that the construction is merely a loose one. Then Hanw Hsin, from his refuge with the Huns, gave his consent and aid in setting up Chao Li as king, but remained there, allowing the two generals to collect his scattered troops. 116KAO-TSU, Year VII 201 B.C. his generals, Man-ch'iu Ch'en and Wang Huang, 1B: 11b they together set up a descendant of the former king of Chao, Chao Li, as King [of Chao], collected the scattered troops of [Hanw] Hsin [for him], and, together with the Huns, they resisted [the forces of] the Hans [dynasty].1 1 In the time of the Chou dynasty, the state of Chao had occupied the region to which Hanw Hsin had been appointed. Kao-tsu had also appointed Chang Ao as King of Chao, but had given him only part of the territory of the former kingdom of Chao, dividing it with the new kingdom of Hanh. Now that Hanw Hsin had been driven out of this region, a scion of the former Chao kings was set up in his place, making two kings of Chao, with different territories, a rebellious and a legitimate kingdom. Possibly Chao Li had indifferent success as king, for on 1B: 16b a Chao Li is mentioned as a general of Ch'en Hsi, but this may have been a different person. The Emperor, [starting] from Chin-yang, fought a succession of battles and took advantage of his victories to pursue the 12a defeated. He went to Lou-fan, [where] he met with a severe cold spell, [so that] two or three out of every ten officers and soldiers lost fingers [or toes]. Thereupon he went to P'ing-ch'eng, [where] he was besieged by the Huns for seven days. He used the secret plan of Ch'en P'ing and succeeded in getting out.2 2 The SC ch. 110 says that he heavily bribed the Yen-chih , who was the Empress, the wife of the Shan-yÃ¼, the Hun emperor; HS 40: 16b says, "His plan is secret, the world has not succeeded in hearing [what it was]." But Huan T'an (prob. died 29 A.D.) in his Hsin-lun, writes, "Someone said, `Ch'en P'ing dissolved the siege at P'ing-ch'eng for Kao-tsu, but it is said that this affair is secret, that the world has not succeeded in hearing [what it was]. He used workmanship that was marvellous and surpassingly good, hence it was kept hidden and not transmitted. Have you been able, by considering the circumstances, to understand this affair?' I answered him [thus]: This stratagem was on the contrary shabby, mean, awkward, and evil, hence it was hidden and not reported. When Kao-tsu had been besieged for seven days, Ch'en P'ing went and pursuaded the Yen-chih. The Yen-chih spoke to the Shan-yÃ¼ and [Kao-tsu] was let out. From this we can know what he used to persuade her. At that time Ch'en P'ing must have said, `The Han [Emperor] has such fine and beautiful women that no one in the world can express [the beauty] of their forms and countenances. Now he is seriously distressed and has already sent a fast messenger to get and bring them, intending to present them to the Shan-yÃ¼. When the Shan-yÃ¼ sees these women, he will certainly love and desire them greatly. If he loves and desires them, then you, the Yen-chih, will daily be [more and more] separated from him and [will see him] infrequently. It is better to take advantage of the fact that [these women] have not yet arrived and order that the Han [Emperor] should be allowed to escape and go. If he is gone, he will not bring [these] women here.' The Yen-chih was a woman who had a jealous disposition, which necessarily made her all the more hate [that such things should happen], so she mixed in [the affair and the Han Emperor was allowed] to go. This explanation is simple and necessary. When [this stratagem] was employed, [Ch'en P'ing] wanted to make [people think that it was] a supernatural marvel, hence it was kept hidden and secret and not divulged. Liu Tzu-chÃ¼n [Liu Hsin, d. 23 B.C.] heard of my saying and at once called it good." P'ei Yin (fl. 465-472) adds the further detail that Ch'en P'ing had some painters first paint pictures of these women. [Then] he ordered Fan K'uai to 117KAO-TSU, Year VII 1B: 12a stay in order to subjugate the region of Tai. In 201 B.C. the twelfth month the Emperor returned. He 200 B.C. passed through Chao but did not treat the King of Jan. Chao courteously.1 1 This was Chang Ao, not Chao Li. This slight almost cost Kao-tsu his life. Cf. 1B: 13a and the Glossary, sub Chang Ao. In this month the Huns attacked Tai, and the King of Tai, [Liu] Hsi, abandoned his state and of his own accord returned to Lo-yang.2 2 The SC (Mh II, 393) reports this event in the next (eighth) year; its Table puts it in the ninth year, probably because of the confusion about the day. Cf. n. 3. He was forgiven and made Marquis of Ho-yang. On [the Feb. 15 day] hsin-mao3 3 According to Chavannes' calendar (T'oung Pao, vol. VII, p. 24) and that in VariÃ©tÃ©s Sinologiques vol. 29, there could have been no hsin-mao day in the twelfth month of Kao-tsu's seventh year. Chavannes' calendar puts such a day in the twelfth months of the eighth and ninth years; VariÃ©tÃ©s Sinologiques vol. 29 allows such a day only in the twelfth month of the ninth year. In view of the length of time required for Liu Hsi to travel to Lo-yang and have his successor appointed, it seems probable that this appointment occurred in the following (the first) month. The tenth day of the first month of Kao-tsu's seventh yearâFeb. 15, 200 B.C.âwas a hsin-mao day; this appointment was probably made on that date. But the next sentence mentions "the spring," which means the first month: either the HS believed that the appointment was made in the twelfth month (not noticing that then "hsin-mao" must be a mistake) or the historian is completing his account of a sequence of events that began in the twelfth month before he mentions another month, therefore omitting to say "first month" because he had trespassed into it. [the Emperor] made his son, [Liu] 118KAO-TSU, Year VII 200 B.C. Ju-yi, King of Tai. 1B: 12a In the spring [the Emperor] ordered that when a Gentleman-of-the-Palace commits a crime [deserving] a more [severe punishment] than that of shaving the whiskers,1 1 Since all punishments involved some mutilation, the lightest sentence was that of cutting off the beard. It carried a two year sentence of penal servitude. Cf. 8: 24b. [the officials] should ask [the throne's 12b consent to the sentence], and that people who had sons born to them should be exempted from public service Feb./Mar. for two years. In the second month he went to Ch'ang-an. Hsiao Ho was building the Wei-yang Palace, and was erecting the Eastern Portal, the Northern Portal, the Front Hall, the Arsenal, and the Great Granary. The Emperor saw their greatness and elegance and was very angry. He said to [Hsiao] Ho, "The world is full of tumultuous cries; I have toiled and suffered for many years; my success or failure cannot yet be knownâwhy are you building these palaces and halls beyond measure?" [Hsiao] Ho replied, "The world is not just yet subjugatedâfor that reason we should take this opportunity to complete the palaces and halls. Moreover the Son of Heaven has the four seas [and all within them] for his household. Without2 2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that the word is redundant; the SC and the Han-chi do not have it; it is a dittography for the next occurrence of this word. great and elegant [buildings], you will not [be able to display] your authority and majesty. We should not moreover let it be that later generations should find anything to be despized." The Emperor was delighted, removed from YÃ¼eh-yang, and established his capital at Ch'ang-an. He established the office3 3 We read for the of the text at the suggestion of Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813); the Official ed. (1739) also reads thus. of the Superintendency over the Imperial 119KAO-TSU, Year VII 1B: 12b House to arrange the precedence among his 200 B.C. nine [classes of] relatives. In the summer, the 13a fourth month, he went to Lo-yang. May In his eighth year, in the winter, the Emperor VIII went east to attack Hanw Hsin's1 1 The SC in this passage and the HS in the preceding and following passages mentions Hanw Hsin; the word "Wang" has evidently dropped out here. remaining Winter robbers2 2 The orthodox historian calls the army of a rebel, "robbers." at Tung-yÃ¼an. On his return, he went thru [the state of] Chao. The Chancellor of Chao, Kuan Kao, and others [felt] humiliated [because] the Emperor did not extend any courtesy to their King, [and so] secretly plotted, wishing to assassinate the Emperor. The Emperor was going to pass the night [at a certain place, but] his spirit was moved, so he asked what the name of the prefecture was. He was answered, "Po-jen." The Emperor said, "A po-jen is a person harassed by someone."3 3 He is making a play on words. The name of the city, Po-jen , sounds the same as the words , which mean "a harassed person." This association saved him from assassination. He went away and did not spend the night [there]. In the eleventh month [the Emperor] ordered Nov./Dec. that the officers and soldiers who had died when with the army should be put in provisional coffins and returned to their [home] prefectures; their prefectures should supply their shrouds, their coverlets, their [permanent] coffins, their burials, their [mortuary] furnishings, and should sacrifice [to them] a ram and a pig. The chief officials should supervise their funerals. In the twelfth month [the Emperor] went from Dec./Jan. Tung-yÃ¼an to [the capital]. In the spring, the third 199 B.C. month, he went to Lo-yang. He ordered that the Mar./Apr. 120KAO-TSU, Year VIII 199 B.C. officials and soldiers who went with the army to 1B: 13a P'ing-ch'eng,1 1 Cf. 1B: 12a. At P'ing-ch'eng Kao-tsu was besieged at a neighboring walled hill. those who defended the city and the walled towns, should all be exempt from public service for life. Those whose noble rank was not above that of Public Chariot shall not be allowed to wear the Hat of the House of Liu. Merchants are not to be permitted to wear brocade, embroidery, 13b flowered silk, crape linen, fine linen, sackcloth, or wool, carry weapons, or ride a quadriga or a horse.2 2 Hu San-hsing (1230-1287) defines as "with woven ornaments." Hu San-hsing defines as "with pricked designs in all five colors." Yen Shih-ku defines as "ornamented silk, the same as the present flowered silk." Fine satin is also called by this name. Wang Hsien-ch'ien defines as "crape linen made out of Pueraria phaseoloÃ¯des." Yen Shih-ku defines as "fine linen made out of Pueraria phaseoloÃ¯des." Yen Shih-ku defines as "woven fibres of Sida or hemp abutilon, Boehmeria nivea or Urtica nivea, made into cloth and coarse." Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) says that is defined in the Shuo-wen as a "fish-net." He says the word here should be , which he defines as "a cloth made of hair [imported from] the western [nomads of central Asia or Mongolia by the name of the] Hu." Yen Shih-ku says it is "woven hair, like the present rugs and the mat used by the Emperor in worshipping Shang-ti." This sumptuary law has become famous. The indication of a person's position in society by his clothing was a common practice of the time. The word denoted not only a coarse woolen cloth, but also "clothes of the common people." The Emperor Ching ordered his officials to wear certain kinds of clothes and certain decorations on their carriages to indicate their rank. Cf. 5: 8a. The Shang-shu Ta-chuan (supposed to have been recited by Master Fu, who was 99 years old in 179-157 B.C.; the passage translated below is referred to in the HHS, Treatise 29: 2a, written by Ssu-ma Piao, prob. ca. 240-304, and in HHS 49: 5b, by Fan Yeh, 398-445) ch. 1, p. 2, says, "The ancient Emperors [referring to the time of Yao] had to [know how to] command the people. Those people who were able to respect their elders and take pity upon orphans, who knew what to take and what to reject, what to be attracted to and what to yield [to others] and who could perform their parts with all their might [were allowed to ask for] a commandment from their prince. If they secured the commandment, then only could they obtain [the privilege of] riding in an ornamented carriage with a pair of horses or wear a pair of embroidered brocade [collars]. Those who did not secure [the prince's] commandment did not get to wear [such clothes] nor get to ride [in such carriages]. If they did ride [in such carriages] or wear [such clothes], they were fined. Common people had wooden carriages with a single horse and wore linen or plain silk." (Another ed. puts this passage in ch. 2, p. 27b.) While the above passage is probably rationalizing on the basis of Han practises, it shows that the sentiment underlying such sumptuary distinctions was ancient. The Li-chi gives detailed rules for a gentleman's clothing (cf. ch. x, xxxvi, Couvreur's trans. I, 620-2, II, 587-90; Legge, I, 449ff: II, 395f). 121KAO-TSU, Year VIII 1B: 13b In the autumn, the eighth month, there was a 199 B.C. Aug./Sept. pardon granted to those officials who had committed crimes [but] had not yet been detected. In the ninth month, [the Emperor] went from Sept./Oct. Lo-yang to [the capital]. The King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Liang, [P'eng YÃ¼eh], the King of Chao, [Chang Ao], and the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], all accompanied him. In the ninth year, in the winter, the tenth month, IX the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Nov./Dec. Liang, [P'eng YÃ¼eh], the King of Chao, [Chang Ao], and the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], came to court at the Wei-yang Palace [to pay their homage. The Emperor] held a feast in the Front Hall. The Emperor held up a jade wine-cup1 1 Ying Shao says, "It is a ceremonial utensil for drinking wine. Anciently they were made of a horn and held four sheng ." [Shen Ch'in-han says he was mistaken, anciently they held three sheng.] Han Fei-tzu 13: 7a, sect. 34 says, "Now if you have a jade wine-cup (chih) [worth] a thousand [catties] of gold, and it is open through, without a base, can it hold water?" Thus the chih was a vessel for pouring, with a base. The Po-ku T'u-lu has pictures of four of these chih dating from Han times. One (seemingly typical) is said to be 2.5 inches high, with a rounded square mouth, 3.9 inches in its longest diameter and 3.1 inches in its shorter diameter, weighing 12Â½ ounces, and holding 9/100 of a wine-ladle (tou). and drank a toast to the health of the Grand Emperor, saying, "At first you, sire, continually thought of me, your servant, as a good-for-nothing, one who could not apply himself to any professional occupation,2 2 Cf. 1A: 3a. who was not as industrious as [my brother] Chung. Now who has achieved the more, I or Chung?" The many courtiers in the Hall all called out, 14a 122KAO-TSU, Year IX 199 B.C. "Long life," They laughed loudly and made merry. 1B: 14a Dec./Jan. In the eleventh month [the Emperor] removed to 198 B.C. Kuan-chung five great clans of Ch'i and Ch'u: the Chao clan, the Chu clan, the Ching clan, the Huai clan, and the T'ien clan, and gave them the advantage of its fields and dwellings.1 1 This transportation was at the advice of Lou Ching, to fill up the land, and to prevent their rebelling. They were the kingly clans of the feudal states, Ch'i, Ch'u, Yen, Chao, Hanh, and Weih. Cf. HS 43: 13b. More than 100,000 people were thus moved. Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says that the word should here be given the ancient pronounciation for chu5. Jan./Feb. In the twelfth month he went to Lo-yang. The rebellious conspiracy of Kuan Kao and his accomplices were discovered. [Kuan] Kao and his accomplices were arrested and captured;2 2 Liu Pin (1022-1088) distinguished these words: tai is directly going after and taking a man who does not run away ; pu is searching for and seizing a man who has run away . Or tai is simply calling a person by name and summoning him; pu is to tie and bind him . the King of Chao, [Chang] Ao, was also captured and put in prison. An imperial edict [was issued to the effect that] anyone who dared to follow the king would be punished by [death and] the extermination of his three [sets of] relatives. [The king's] Gentlemen-ofthe-Palace, T'ien Shu, Meng Shu, and others, ten persons [in all], themselves shaved their heads, put on iron collars,3 3 This action consisted in giving themselves the treatment criminals and slaves received, in order to enable them to go to prison with their king. Cf. p. 118, n. 1. Chi Pu, a general of Hsiang YÃ¼, was hunted, after Hsiang YÃ¼ was killed. A price was on his head. He similarily shaved his head, put an iron collar around his neck, and sold himself into slavery in order to escape. Cf. HS 37: 1. made themselves slaves of the king's household, and followed the king to prison. The king did not really know of [Kuan Kao's] 123KAO-TSU, Year IX 1B: 14a conspiracy. In the spring, the first month, [the 198 B.C. Feb./Mar. Emperor] dismissed the King of Chao, [Chang] Ao, and made him the Marquis of HsÃ¼an-p'ing. He moved the King of Tai, [Liu] Ju-yi, to be the King of Chao, ruling over the state of Chao. Those 14b who, before [the day] ping-yin, had committed Mar. 11 crimes not serious enough [to deserve] the punishment of an irrevokable death sentence were all pardoned. In the second month [the Emperor] went Mar./Apr. from Lo-yang to [the capital]. [He esteemed as] capable [men] the ten courtiers of Chao, T'ien Shu, Meng Shu, and the others, summoned them to an interview, and conversed with them. None of the courtiers in the Han court were able to surpass the best1 1 Lit. "surpass their right." Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says, "Anciently the right was considered the more honorable," contrary to the practice in the Ch'ing court. The Han dynasty regularly esteemed the right the more honorable. Cf. Mh II, 415, n. 1. But such was not always the case in ancient times. Liu Pin (1022-1088) said, "Those who are at peace and at home consider the left more honorable, whereas those who are at war consider the right more honorable. Honoring the right was a custom of the time of the Warring Kingdoms (iii &amp; iv cent. B.C.)." Wu Jen-chieh (ca. 1137-1199) said, "[The statement], `Those who use weapons honor the right,' comes from the book of [the philosopher] Lao-tzu [sect. 31]. Anciently in inauspicious matters the right was esteemed; weapons are inauspicious instruments and so the right was esteemed, probably because they were treated with inauspicious ceremonies. In the Li-chi it says, `In riding in a prince's chariot we dare not leave the left [place] empty,' and the commentator says that in a carriage the left is considered more honorable. In a traveling carriage the left is more honorable, [whereas] in a war chariot the right is more honorable. The Prince of Weih left his chariot and rode a horse, emptying the left [place in the chariot], and himself invited Hou Sheng [to occupy that place]; hence at the time of the Warring Kingdoms at times the left was esteemed. The Li-Chi, chap. 35, in discussing carriages and war chariots, says, `In the army the left is esteemed.' In the Tso-chuan it says, `Han ChÃ¼eh acting as charioteer took his place in the middle,' and the commentator Tu [YÃ¼, 222284] said, `Except for the commander-in-chief, the charioteer always was in the center [place in the chariot], the general was on the left.' [Hence we] know that according to the proprieties of the war chariot, only the prince and the commander-in-chief esteemed the right. Among the rest of the generals the left was esteemed. Yen Shih-ku, in a comment on chap. 14, wrote, `The Han [dynasty] followed the principles of court procedure of the highest antiquity in honoring the right; hence those officials who were serving the nobles who held office were called "left officials." ' According to the saying of Szu Wei, `Now we divide the land and establish officials for it; this is to "left" it,' then the name of `left officials' was already in use in the Ch'un-ch'iu period (722-486 B.C.)" Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755 A.D.) said, "Chung Hui was the `left' chancellor of T'ang, Yi-yin as `right' chancellor preceded him; Ch'ing Feng was the `left' chancellor of Ch'i, Ts'ui Shu as `right' chancellor preceded him, not necessarily in accordance with military etiquette. In their military etiquette only the people of Ch'u esteemed the left; hence `the king rode with the left cohorts.' [Tso-chuan, Legge, p. 319.] In the state of Lu [the most cultured in ancient China] the position in the center of the army was left vacant and Chi [the chancellor] commanded from the left divisionâthen accordingly in Lu the left was also esteemedâ it is difficult to explain away these contradictory facts. Probably in matters of precedence, those who esteemed the right were the more numerous." In popular usage today, the right is the more esteemed. [efforts] of these men. The Emperor was delighted 124KAO-TSU, Year IX 198 B.C. and appointed every one of them as Administrators 1B: 14b of commanderies or Chancellors of the nobles. In the summer, the sixth month, on [the day] Aug. 7 yi-wei, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. X In the tenth year, in the winter, the tenth month, Nov./Dec. the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing Pu], the King of Yen, [Lu Wan], the King of Ching, [Liu Chia], the King of Liang, [P'eng YÃ¼eh], the King of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], the King of Ch'i, [Liu Fei], and the King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu Ch'eng], came to court [to render their 197 B.C. homage.] May/June In the summer, the fifth month, the Grand 15a Emperor1 1 The present text reads, "the Grand Empress' , who would be Kao-tsu's mother. But this reading is certainly wrong. On 1B: 4a Kao-tsu's mother is spoken of as "deceased" and is given a posthumous title. Ju Shun quotes the comment in the Han-chiu-yi (supposedly by Wei Hung, fl. dur. 25-57) as saying, "The mother of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] died in the time of the wars at [a place] north of Hsiao-huang; later a funerary temple [for her] was made at Hsiao-huang." When Kao-tsu's father was given the title, "the Grand Emperor," his mother should also have been given a title, if she were living; and since the historian quotes the edict granting the title, the title would have been mentioned; its absence is proof that she was dead. The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 12: 4a, written by one of China's keenest historians, reads, "In the fifth month the Grand Emperor died at the YÃ¼eh-yang palace; in the seventh month on [the day] kuei-mao, the Grand Emperor was buried at Wan-nien." The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien Kao-yi 1:3a (also by Szu-ma Kuang) says, "The Han-chi [4:2b] in the fifth month has not the word hou and in the seventh month has not the word `died.' " We have adopted this reading and omit these two characters. On the other hand, the SC (Mh II, 393) writes, "In the spring and summer nothing happened," from which it might be inferred that the SC puts both the death and the burial of Kao-tsu's father in the seventh month. SCHC 7:65; 8:48, 60 (Mh II, 313, 365, 377) say that Hsiang YÃ¼ returned to the King of Hans his father, his mother, his wife and children. But earlier, after the battle at P'eng-ch'eng, it says merely that he sent to seek for his father and his wife, and that these two were captured by Hsiang YÃ¼ (Mh II, 300, 301). Chao Yi (1727-1814), in his Nien-erh Shih Ta-chi 1:13b, 14a, argues that it is not exact to explain "father, mother, wife, and children" as merely a general term for "family." Kao-tsu's father had a concubine in addition to the wife who was Kao-tsu's mother, and Kao-tsu had children by concubines in addition to the two by his wife, so that Kao-tsu's step-mother and his children by concubines were among those captured and returned by Hsiang YÃ¼. Yen Shih-ku quotes the San-fu Huang-t'u (probably written iii to vi cent.) as saying (at present this passage is a note to 6: 4b), "Kao-tsu first lived in YÃ¼eh-yang, hence the Grand Emperor also [lived] at YÃ¼eh-yang. In the tenth year, the Grand Emperor died and was buried on the plain north [of that place] and there was established the town of Wan-nien." The HHS, Mem. 23: 10a says, Kuang-wu "travelled east and passed Hsiao-huang, where is the park and mound of the Emperor Kao-[tsu]'s mother, the Empress Chao-ling." Hence Kao-tsu's father and mother were not buried together, as they would undoubtedly have been if they had died at the same place or in close succession. died; in the autumn, the seventh month, 125KAO-TSU, Year X 1B: 15a on [the day] kuei-mao, he was buried at Wan-nien. 197 B.C. Aug. 9 [The Emperor] pardoned those imprisoned at YÃ¼eh-yang 15b whose crimes were less than1 1 The Official ed. (1739) writes for , and Sung Ch'i says the former should be corrected to the latter. those [deserving] death. In the eighth month he ordered the vassal Aug./Sept. kings all to set up temples to the Grand Emperor at the capitals of their states.2 2 These were temples to the Han dynastic house. Since a goodly number of the kings were already members of the Liu family and eventually all of them were to be members of that house, this act was quite appropriate, altho Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) says that it was "the beginning of impropriety," and that Wei HsÃ¼an-ch'eng and Kung YÃ¼ (q.v. in Glossary) first detected its wrongfulness. In the ninth month, the Chancellor of State in Sept./Oct. Tai, Ch'en Hsi, revolted. The Emperor said, "[Ch'en] Hsi has acted as my envoy; he has had my entire confidence. I have been anxious about the region of Tai, hence I appointed [Ch'en] Hsi to be a marquis, and, as Chancellor of State, to guard Tai; but now with Wang Huang and others he has 126KAO-TSU, Year X 197 B.C. seized and ravaged the region of Tai. The officials 1B: 15b and people [of Tai] have committed no crime; those who can leave [Ch'en] Hsi and [Wang] Huang and come to return [to their allegiance to me] will all be pardoned." The Emperor reached Han-tan from the east. [Then] the Emperor was delighted and said, "[Ch'en] Hsi did not come south and hold Han-tan, in order to1 1 Sung Ch'i (998-1061) says, "The old text [before vi cent.] writes for . The Han-shu K'an-wu [1034] has changed it in accordance with the SC. Moreover the Chang River is not to the north." bar [the passage up] the river Chang. I know that he is really incapable of doing anything." The Chancellor of Chao, Chou Ch'ang, memorialized [the throne to the effect that] of the twenty-five cities of Ch'ang-shan,2 2 HS 28 Ai: 53a enumerates only 18 prefectures in the Ch'ang-shan commandery; the territory of Ch'ang-shan was evidently later curtailed. twenty cities had been lost. He begged that the Administrator and [Commandary] Commandant be sentenced to death. The Emperor said, "Have the Administrator and [Commandery] Commandant rebelled?" and was answered, "No." The Emperor [then] said, "Their strength was inadequate; they have committed no crime." The Emperor ordered Chou Ch'ang to select some 16a of the valiant gentlemen of Chao who could be commissioned as generals. He reported back, and [the Emperor] interviewed four men. The Emperor treated them with contempt and scolded them, saying, "You striplings, have you the stuff to be generals?" The four men blushed for shame, and all fell prostrate to the earth. The Emperor 127KAO-TSU, Year X 1B: 16a appointed for each [the income of] a thousand 197 B.C. families and made them generals. His close associates remonstrated with him, saying, "From [the time that you] entered Shu and Hans and [made an expedition] to punish [the state of] Ch'u, you have never yet [given] indiscriminate [rewards].1 1 Lit. "acted universally"; i.e., rewards had always been given for some particular reason. For what deeds do you now appoint these [people]?" The Emperor replied, "This is not anything that you understand. Ch'en Hsi has rebelled, and the regions of Chao and Tai are all in [Ch'en] Hsi's possession. I used a feathered call-to-arms to summon the empire's troops, but none have yet arrived. Now I can only count on the troops in Han-tan alone. Why should I be parsimonious about [the income of] four thousand families and not use it to console the young men of Chao?" They all replied, "You are right." He also sought whether Yo Yi had any descendants [living], found his grandson, [Yo] Shu, and enfeoffed him at Yo-hsiang, entitling him the Hua-ch'eng Baronet. [The Emperor] asked about2 2 The SC has "heard," instead of the HS "asked about." the generals of [Ch'en] Hsi, [and found that] they were all former merchants. The Emperor said, "Then I know how to deal with them." So he bribed the generals of 16b [Ch'en] Hsi with much gold, and many of [Ch'en] Hsi's generals surrendered. In the eleventh year, in the winter, the Emperor XI was at Han-tan. A general of [Ch'en] Hsi, Hou Winter Ch'ang, scouted about, leading more than ten thousand men. Wang Huang, leading more than a thousand cavalry, encamped at Ch'Ã¼-ni. Chang Ch'un, leading more than ten thousand foot-soldiers, 128KAO-TSU, Year XI 197 B.C. crossed the [Yellow] River to attack Liao-ch'eng; a 1B: 16b general of the Han [dynasty], Kuo Meng, together with a general of [the state of] Ch'i, attacked [Chang Ch'un] and routed his [troops] severely. The Grand Commandant1 1 He was given this title only for this campaign. , Chou P'o, went by way of the T'ai-yÃ¼an [Commandery], entered and subjugated the region of Tai. He went to Ma-yi, [but] Ma-yi would not submit, [so] he attacked and massacred its [people]. A general of [Ch'en] Hsi, Chao Li, was defending Tung-yÃ¼an. Kao-tsu attacked it, [but] did not take it. [Some of] the soldiers [of the town] cursed him. The Emperor became angry, and, when the city surrendered, those soldiers who had cursed him were beheaded.2 2 The SC tells that only those who had cursed and insulted him were executed. Cf. Mh II, 395. Those prefectures which had been firmly defended and did not surrender to the rebellious robbers,3 3 Cf. p. 119, n. 2. were exempted from the land tax and capitation taxes for three 196 B.C. years. Feb./Mar. In the spring, the first month, the Marquis of Huai-yin, Han Hsin, plotted a revolt at Ch'ang-an. He was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.4 4 He was accused of rebellion by a man of his suite whose brother had offended him and feared he would be executed. The Empress nee LÃ¼ (in the absence of Kao-tsu) tricked Han Hsin into coming to the court and had him executed in the palace. Cf. HS 34: 13a; Glossary, sub Han Hsin. General Ch'ai Wu beheaded the King of Hanh, [Hanw] Hsin, at Ts'an-ho. The Emperor returned to Lo-yang. An imperial edict said, "The territory 17a of Tai is north of [that of] Ch'ang-shan, and borders on [the regions of] the barbarians.5 5 Lit. "the Yi and Ti." The SC, dealing with the time of the legendary emperor Shun, speaks of the Yi as the eastern barbarians (Mh I, 68 &amp; n. 1), but the SC in chap. 116 and the HS in chap. 95 uses this same word to refer to the barbarians in the west and south (including the peoples of the Tarim basin). The word became a general term for barbarians, altho earlier it was restricted to those in the east. Ti was the word used in early times to refer to the barbarians to the north of China (Mh I, 68 &amp; n. 1). Consequently, 129KAO-TSU, Year XI 1B: 17a [the state of] Chao has [to control this territory] from 196 B.C. south of the mountains.1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says, "Formerly when [Liu] Ju-yi was king of Tai and Chang Ao was king of Chao, each had their own [territory] as their state. But after [Chang] Ao was removed, [Liu] Ju-yi was moved to be king of Chao and then also governed the region of Tai. Moreover Ch'en Hsi, as the Chancellor of State in Tai, was ordered to superintend the borders of both Tai and Chao. When [Ch'en] Hsi rebelled, Chou Ch'ang was the Chancellor of [Liu] Ju-yi's state, but Ch'ang-shan lost twenty cities, [showing that] the state of Chao could not care for all [that territory]. Hence Chao and Tai were again divided to be two states." It is far away [from its administrative headquarters], frequently pillaged [by] the Hu, and has difficulty in being a state. We will take a bit of the territory of the T'ai-yÃ¼an [Commandery] south of the mountains and augment [with it the region] belonging to Tai.2 2 In the earlier part of the HS, T'ai-yÃ¼an is said to have 31 prefectures; 28 Bi: 38b however mentions only 18. [The part of] Tai west of YÃ¼n-chung shall become the YÃ¼n-chung Commandery. Thus Tai will be suffering less from border raids. You, kings, chancellors of states, marquises, and officials who [have the rank of] two thousand piculs, should select someone who can be made King of Tai." The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, the Chancellor of State [Hsiao] Ho, and others, [altogether] thirty-three persons, unanimously replied, "Your son, [Liu] Heng, is capable, wise, gentle, and good. We beg that he be made King of Tai, with his capital at Chin-yang."3 3 It had been the capital of Hanw Hsin's Shansi state of Hanh. HS 4: 1b states that Liu Heng's capital was at Chung-tu, so evidently he too, like Hanw Hsin, moved his capital away from Chin-yang. A general amnesty for all the world [was proclaimed]. In the second month, an imperial edict said, Mar./Apr. "[We] wish very much to lessen the poll-taxes, [but] now the offerings [made to Us] have no regulations, [so that] the officials sometimes make 130KAO-TSU, Year XI 196 B.C. the poll-tax heavy in order to use it for offerings 1B: 17a [to Us], and for the vassal kings [this tax] is even heavier, [with the result that] the people suffer from it. Henceforth the vassal kings and marquises shall regularly pay court and make offerings [to Us, 17b the Emperor], in the tenth month,1 1 Ch'u Shao-sun (fl. 47-7 B.C.) in his supplement to SC 58: 8b, writes, "When the vassal kings come to court and appear before the Son of Heaven, [according to] the regulations of the Han [dynasty], each one must attend only four audiences. When they first come they attend a semiformal reception . At dawn on the first day of the first month they bring the formal congratulations of the New Year at the regular audience, offering furs [or leather ] and presenting jade circlets and jade to offer New Year's congratulations, which was a formal audience. The third day after, a feast was given for the kings and they were granted gold, cash, and valuables. The second day after they again attended a semi-formal audience, took their leave, and departed. The whole stay [of the nobles] at Ch'ang-an was no more than twenty days. The semi-formal audiences were semi-formal banquets , audiences in the forbidden apartments ; the drinking was in the inner apartments , where people who were not eunuchs were not allowed to enter." This practice then began with Kao-tsu; he celebrated the tenth month as New Year's; in the time of the Emperor Wu, New Year's day was changed to the first month; the court reception was possibly continued in the tenth month, another was added in the first month. and each commandery shall [make an offering] in accordance with2 2 Wang Nien-sun shows by the citation of parallel passages that here means . the total number of its people; each person per year [shall be taxed] sixty-three cash in order to provide for the expense of making offerings [to the Emperor]." [The edict]3 3 The following part of this edict is translated in G. MargouliÃ¨s, Le Kou-wen Chinois, p. 49f. This is one of the edicts leading up to the establishment of the examination system. also said, "Verily [We] have heard that no [true] king was greater than [King] Wen of the Chou [dynasty] and no Lord Protector was greater than [Duke] Huan of Ch'iâboth needed capable men in order to make a name for themselves.4 4 King Wen had Chiang Tzu-ya as his chancellor, and Duke Huan had Kuan-chung as his. At present in the world there are capable men who are wise and able; why should only men of ancient times [be capable]? The trouble is that the ruler of men does not meet them. By what means 131KAO-TSU, Year XI 1B: 17b could a gentleman have access [to me]? Now I, 196 B.C. by the spiritual power of Heaven,1 1 This phrase is more than a conventional expression of gratitude; it implies the theory that the Han dynasty attained the throne by supernatural means, which helped it greatly in continuing on the throne. Cf. HS 100A: 8b, 9a. [and by my] capable gentlemen and high officials have subjugated and possess the empire and have made it one family. I wish it to be enduring, that generation after generation should worship at my ancestral temple without cessation. Capable persons have already shared with me in its pacification. Should it be that [any capable persons] are not to share together with me in its comfort and its benefits? If there are any capable gentlemen or sirs who are willing to follow and be friends with me, I can make them honorable and illustrious. Let [the foregoing] be published to [all] the world, to make plain Our intention. Let the Grandee Secretary2 2 According to Shen Ch'in-han, in Kao-tsu's time there was not yet a Master of Writing, hence all edicts and ordinances were drafted by the Secretaries, who transmitted them outside the palace; the Grandee Secretary was the chief of the Secretaries, hence he directly transmitted the edict to the Chancellor of State. [Chao] Yao3 3 The text writes, "[Chou] Ch'ang," but that name is mistaken, for at this time Chou Ch'ang was Chancellor of Chao. According to HS 19B: 3a, the Grandee Secretary at this time was Chao Yao. He had been Secretary of the Tallies and Imperial Seals and was appointed Grandee Secretary in 197. In 188, when Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ took the throne, he was dismissed. His biography is in HS ch. 42. transmit it to the Chancellor of State; let the Chancellor of State [Hsiao Ho], the Marquis of Tso, transmit 18a it to the vassal kings; the Palace Secretary for Administrating the Laws shall transmit it to the Commandery Administrators. If any [among their people] have an excellent4 4 Reading instead of the present with a quotation of this passage in a comment by Li Shan (649-689) on the preface to Wang Yung's Ch'Ã¼-shui Shih in the Wen-hsÃ¼an. In addition to the fact that this reading restores the parallelism of the sentence, there is ample evidence given by Ch'ien Ta-hsin that , and were interchanged. Yen Shih-ku, who commented on the whole HS, does not remark on this character; evidently in his time the true reading was still understood. reputation and manifest 132KAO-TSU, Year XI 196 B.C. virtue, [the officials] must personally urge [them to 1B: 18a 18b come], provide them with a quadriga, and send them to go to the courts of the Chancellor of State to have written down their accomplishments, their appearance,1 1 Reading with Liu Pin (1022-1088) and others for the in the text. and their age.2 2 The Ku-wen-yÃ¼an 10: 3b (a collection of literature made in T'ang or Sung times) tells that Tung Chung-shu (ii cent. B.C.) sent a letter to the secretary of Kung-sun Hung (the Lieutenant Chancellor in 128-123 B.C.) saying, "I wish that you, sir marquis, would open wide the road [opened by] the Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho for the purpose of] seeking for capable men, and would keep narrow the gate for their selection and presentation [to the Emperor]." Hence Hsiao Ho probably urged and approved of the edict in the text. The task of selecting capable and able officials was the duty of the Chancellor, so that the persons recommended by the various magistrates went to him. In HS chap. 58, p. 6a we find the statement, Kung-sun Hung "opened the Tung-ko [a small eastern hall in the palace] for the reception of capable men." Hsieh HsÃ¼an said to Chu YÃ¼n (in HS 67: 7a), "Stay a while longer at the Tung-ko in order to interview the strange gentlemen [sent up] from all quarters." In this passage we find the earliest stage of the Chinese examination system. If there are [such ones] and [any official] does not report them, when [this fact] becomes known, he shall be dismissed. Those who are aged, infirm, or ill should not be sent." Apr./May In the third month, the King of Liang, P'eng YÃ¼eh, plotted a rebellion. He was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.3 3 The SC tells that P'eng YÃ¼eh was first transferred to Shu after it was heard that he planned to revolt; when he planned to revolt a second time, he was exterminated. Cf. Mh II, 395. The imperial edict said, "Do you select [some persons] who can be made the King of Liang and the King of Huai-yang." The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, the Chancellor of State [Hsiao] Ho, and others begged [the Emperor] 133KAO-TSU, Year XI 1B: 18b to establish his son, [Liu] K'uei, as the King of Liang, 196 B.C. and his son, [Liu] Yu, as the King of Huai-yang. [The Emperor] reduced considerably the Tung Commandery and added a part of it to [the state of] Liang. He [also] reduced considerably1 1 Ch'ien Ta-hsin (1728-1804) remarks that the Tung and the Ying-ch'uan Commanderies were not disestablished; parts of them were merely given to Liang and to Huai-yang. the Ying-ch'uan Commandery and added a part of it to [the state of] Huai-yang. In the summer, the fourth month, [the Emperor] 19a went from Lo-yang to [the capital]. He ordered that May/June the people of Feng who had been moved to Kuan-chung should all be exempted [from taxes and service] for life.2 2 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) tells that Kao-tsu's father was homesick and wanted to return home to Feng, but Kao-tsu built another city with its walls, its official residences, its markets, and its wards like those of Feng, calling it Hsin-feng, lit. "the New Feng," and moved the people of Feng to fill it up. Yen Shih-ku says this was "the old city of Hsin-feng." It is natural that Kao-tsu should have given special privileges to people from his home town. A similar exemption was granted to the old Feng, cf 1B: 20b. In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "According June/July to the customs of the people of [Nan-] YÃ¼eh, they like to attack each other. At a previous time, the Ch'in [dynasty] moved people from the central prefectures3 3 I.e., the Chinese, the people of the Yellow and Yangtze river basins, which was then China proper. The SC (Mh II, 168) says that the First Emperor sent inveterate vagabonds, parasites, and shop-keepers to conquer the territory of Lu-liang (present Kuang-tung), and made out of it the commanderies of Kuei-lin, Hsiang, and Nan-hai. to the three commanderies of the southern quarter, and sent them to live intermixed with the many [tribes of] the YÃ¼eh. It happened that when the world punished the Ch'in [dynasty], 134KAO-TSU, Year XI 196 B.C. the [Commandery] Commandant of Nan-hai, [Chao] 1B: 19a T'o, was living in the southern quarter and ruling it as its chieftain. He has made an excellent arrangement [of his government, so that] the people from the central prefectures have hence not diminished [in number] and the custom of the people of YÃ¼eh to attack each other is progressively ceasing. For all [the foregoing, the region] is in debt to his ability. Now We establish [Chao] T'o as King of Nan-yÃ¼eh and commission Lu Chia to transmit his kingly seal and [its] cord." [Chao] T'o made obeisance [to the Emperor's edict] and acknowledged himself as [Kao-tsu's] subject. July/Aug. In the sixth month [the Emperor] ordered that the officers and soldiers who had followed him into Shu, Hans, and Kuan-chung should all be exempted [from taxes and military service] for life.1 1 Kao-tsu had previously granted other favors to his old soldiers. In 202 B.C. (1B: 4b) the members of the noble houses in Kuan-chung were exempted for twelve years and the soldiers were granted honorary titles and they and their households exempted from public service (no period specified). Officers were given a step in rank and high officers were granted pensions. In 200 B.C. (1B: 13a) those who were besieged with him in P'ing-ch'eng, on his ill-fated campaign against the Huns, were given life-long exemption from public service. Soldiers killed in battle were to be sent home and buried at public expense. Now (196 B.C.) those soldiers who had been with him thru his whole victorious campaign from the time he started as a mere King of Hans and who helped him to conquer Kuan-chung were given life-long exemption. In 195 B.C. (1B: 22b) their descendants were also granted exemption. These last two grants seem to have been made in order to forestall possible rebellions and to tie their interests to those of the house of Liu. Aug./Sept. In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of Huai-nan, [Ch'ing] Pu, revolted. The Emperor 135KAO-TSU, Year XI 1B: 19a asked the generals [for a plan of campaign]. The 196 B.C. Lord of Teng [Hsia-hou Ying] said that the former Chief Administrator of Ch'u, his excellency 19b Hsieh, had formed a plan, and the Emperor saw1 1 The Southern Academy ed. (1528), the Fukien ed. (1549), and the Official ed. (1739) read instead of the text's , thereby making the passage say that the Emperor "summoned" himâa statement more in accordance with Chinese ideas of propriety. I have retained the more difficult reading. his excellency. His excellency Hsieh told about [Ch'ing] Pu's circumstances, and the Emperor approved his [plan] and appointed his excellency Hsieh [to the income of] a thousand families. [The Emperor next issued] an edict that the kings and the Chancellor of State should select [someone] who could be made King of Huai-nan. His subjects [the kings and chancellors] begged that he make his son, [Liu] Ch'ang, its king. The Emperor thereupon mobilized as the Imperial Heir-apparent's Guard, chariots and cavalry from the Shang commandery, from the Pei-ti [Commandery], and from the Lung-hsi [Commandery], skilled soldiers from Pa and Shu, together with thirty thousand of the soldiers [belonging to] the Palace Military Commander, and had them encamp at Pa-shang. [Ch'ing] Pu really [did] as his excellency Hsieh had said: he went eastwards, attacked and killed the King of Ching, Liu Chia, seized his troops, crossed the Huai [River], and attacked [the state of] Ch'u.2 2 Ch'ing Pu started from his capital at the present Shou-hsien on the Huai River in northern Anhui and struck at Kao-tsu's cousin, whose capital was at the present Wu-hsien (Soochow) in southern Kiangsu, then went north to attack the Emperor's brother, whose capital was at the present T'ung-hsien (Suchow) in northern Kiangsu. Liu Chiao fled north into the present Shantung. Ch'ing Pu fled from Kao-tsu south thru Anhui, probably past his capital, and was routed near the present Chao Hu in central Anhui. He turned west, was again routed in central western Anhui on the Pi River, and fled towards Ch'ang-sha in Hunan. He was caught and killed at P'o-yang in Kiangsi. The 136KAO-TSU, Year XI 196 B.C. King of Ch'u, [Liu] Chiao, fled to Hsieh. The 1B: 19b Emperor granted a pardon to [everyone in] the world except [those guilty of] capital crimes, and ordered them all to enlist in the army. He summoned the troops of the nobles, and, with the Emperor in person acting as general, attacked [Ch'ing] Pu. XIII In his twelfth year, in the winter, the tenth Nov./Dec. month, the Emperor routed [the army of Ch'ing] Pu at Kuei-chui. [Ch'ing] Pu fled. [The Emperor] ordered a detached general to pursue him. The Emperor, on his return, passed thru P'ei,1 1 It was Kao-tsu's home. and stopped to make a feast in the palace at P'ei. He summoned all his friends, elders and young people, to attend2 2 Lit. "to assist at the feast." the feast. He sent out for the children 20a of P'ei, secured a hundred and twenty persons, and taught them some songs. At the height of the drinking, the Emperor struck a five-stringed lute,3 3 Ying Shao says, "Its shape is like a sÃª [ch'in is written in the text, but it is a mistake for sÃª. The SC Cheng-yi (737) quotes this remark with sÃª] with a large head. It is strung with strings and they are struck with a bamboo [plectrum]." Yen Shih-ku adds that it has a narrow neck. and himself sang as follows:4 4 This poem became after his death a ritual chant, sung and danced in the imperial ancestral temple by young people from P'ei. Cf. Mh III, 234. This song has become famous. Parker says it is "among the most remarkable specimens of genuine ancient poetry." In addition to Chavannes' translation (Mh I, clxi and II, 397), this poem has been translated by E. H. Parker in the New China Review, I (1919), p. 630, and in E. von Zach, Ãbersetzungen aus dem Wen HsÃ¼an, p. 74. It was written out in seal character by Ts'ai Yung (133-192) and engraved on a stone tablet at the Ko-feng-t'ai (lit. "the Terrace [where Kao-tsu] sang [about] the wind") and is still preserved at P'ei. "A great wind raged And the clouds flew and rose. When my authority had been imposed upon [all] within the [four] seas, 137KAO-TSU, Year XII 1B: 20a I returned to my native village. 196 B.C. How may I secure valiant men To defend the four quarters [of my empire]?" He ordered all the children to reiterate it in concert; then the Emperor arose and danced. In sadness of mind and grieving in spirit many tears rolled down [his cheeks], and he said to the elders of P'ei, "The wanderer is saddened in his native village. Altho I [make] my capital in Kuan-chung, after my life is over, my spirit will rejoice1 1 The Official ed. (1739) reads "its home," and quotes a remark of Sung Ch'i that it should read lo ; the SC inverts to read lo-. as it thinks of P'ei. Moreover, [beginning] from [the humble rank of] the Lord of P'ei, We have punished with extermination the tyrannous and rebellious [dynasty of Ch'in] and thereafter possessed the empire. Let2 2 According to the Feng-su T'ung-yi (written by Ying Shao), was an expletive in the region of Ch'u; that may be its meaning here. But this word is used constantly as a sign of the imperative mood, especially at the beginning of a phrase in edicts, so that it seems to be straining the passage to give it any other meaning here. P'ei become Our private town.3 3 Lit. "the town that provides hot water for washing the hair." On such estates the lords paid no taxes to the Emperor; revenues from them went for the private expenses of the lord. Cf. Mh I, 287, n. 1, ad fin. [We] exempt its people from generation to generation, not [requiring] them to provide anything [for the public treasury]." The elders, the matrons, and his old friends at P'ei [spent their time for] days rejoicing and drinking, extremely pleased and telling of [his] former [doings] in order to laugh and rejoice. [After] more than ten days, the Emperor wished to leave, [but] the elders of P'ei insistently begged him [to stay].4 4 The SC adds the words "[they begged] Kao-tsu to stay." The 138KAO-TSU, Year XII 196 B.C. Emperor said, "My people are quite numerous; you, 1B: 20a Elders, are not able to provide [for them]." Thereupon 20b he departed. Those who were in P'ei emptied the city and all came to the west of the town to make offerings.1 1 Ju Shun says, "They presented cattle and wine" to their departing guest. The Emperor stopped and stayed [there], and banqueted them in a tent for three days. The elders of P'ei all knocked their heads to the ground [before Kao-tsu] and said, "P'ei has happily obtained exemption, but Feng has not obtained itâif only your Majesty would take pity upon it!" The Emperor replied, "Feng is where I was born and raised; I could never forget it. But I [cannot exempt it] because it formerly revolted against me for the sake of Yung Ch'ih [and gave its allegiance] to Weih."2 2 Cf. 1A: 10b, 11a, 12a, and 1B: 10b. The elders of P'ei insistently begged him, so he also exempted Feng like P'ei. The detached general of the Han [dynasty] attacked the army of [Ch'ing] Pu north and south of the River Pi,3 3 At the suggestion of Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755) we read for the Chao in the text. The Chao River was in the Ling-liang Commandery (present Kuangsi), a place which does not fit in with the preceding and following locations. The Pi River was in the Chiu-chiang Commandery; the two characters look alike and could easily have been exchanged. This emendation makes Ch'ing Pu's course logical. Cf. p. 135, n. 2. Ku Tsu-yÃ¼ (ca. 1631-1693) says however that the "Chao Shui" was the Chao Hu of the T'ai-hu (between Chekiang and Kiangsu), with which Wang Hsien-ch'ien agrees. His interpretation does not require any emendation of the text and may be correct. and at both places routed it severely. [Then] he caught up with and decapitated [Ch'ing] Pu at P'o-yang. Chou P'o subjugated Tai and beheaded Ch'en Hsi at Tang-ch'eng. 139KAO-TSU, Year XII 1B: 20b An imperial edict said, "Wu was an anciently 196 B.C. established state. In the past, the King of Ching [Liu Chia] has also had its territory. Now that he has died without issue, We wish again to establish a king of Wu. Let it be discussed who is able [to occupy this position]." The King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu] Ch'en,1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "Some of the present texts have after the `Ch'en' [making it read, `Your subject, [Wu] Jui']; the popular copies have corruptly interpolated it." and others said, "The Marquis of 21a P'ei, [Liu] P'i, is dignified and sincere; we beg that you establish him as King of Wu." When he had already been installed [as King], the Emperor summoned him and said to [Liu] P'i, "Your appearance has the look of a rebel." So he patted him on the back and said, "If, [within] the coming fifty years, the Han [dynasty] has a revolt in the southeast, would it be you? The world is however [now subservient to] one house and is all one family; you must be careful not to rebel." [Liu] P'i knocked his head on the ground and said, "I would not dare [to do so]."2 2 Kao-tsu did have an uncanny ability to size up a person's character, and this statement may be merely logical reasoning on his part, but it looks like a prophecy post factum. Ying Shao says, "Kao-tsu was wise in planning [for the future]. `The look of a rebel' could even be known. That there would be a revolt in the southeast and to be capable of fixing upon `fifty years' is [however] what [only] a diviner would know." Thus even he does not think that Kao-tsu could have on the spur of the moment known the future except thru a previous divination. In 154 B.C. Liu P'i did lead a rebellion of six kingdoms, was defeated, trapped, killed, and his kingdom abolished. Cf. HS 5: 4a; ch. 35; Glossary, sub Liu P'i. In the eleventh month, [the Emperor] travelled Dec./Jan. from Huai-nan and returned [to the capital]. He 195 B.C. passed thru Lu and sacrificed to Confucius, offering him a suevotaurilia.3 3 In this sacrifice, Kao-tsu seems to have been following the same policy that he followed in ennobling Yo Yi's descendant (cf. 1B: 16a)âto conciliate his people by honoring their heroes. This was probably the first time Confucius had been sacrificed to by anyone outside his own descendants. Cf. J. K. Shryock, The State Cult of Confucius, ch. VI. This passage is very likely unhistorical, for (1) there were no other imperial sacrifices to Confucius until 29 A.D., when the Emperor Kuang-wu merely sent a minister to sacrifice, and Kao-tsu's precedent, if he really sacrificed in person, would have been followed by his successors, and (2) this tradition that Kao-tsu sacrificed to Confucius is based on a passage in SC ch. 47 which contains some other rather doubtful statements (cf. ibid. p. 95), while Kao-tsu's Annals in SC ch. 8 omit this tradition. Kao-tsu's wound (cf. 1B: 32b) might not have troubled him seriously at this time; he did not die until almost half a year later. Cf. Duyvendak in Jour. of Am. Or. Soc'y, Sept. 1935, 55: 333-6. 140KAO-TSU, Year XII 195 B.C. Jan./Feb. In the twelfth month an imperial edict said, "The 1B: 21a [First] Emperor of the Ch'in [dynasty], King Yin of Ch'u [Ch'en ShÃª], King An-hsi of Weih, King Min of Ch'i, and King Tao-hsiang of Chao, all have had their lines of descent cut off, being without issue. Let there be twenty families as the grave-keepers of the First Emperor of Ch'in; [for] each of [these kings of] Ch'u, of Weih, and of Ch'i, [let there be] ten families; [for] each of [the king of] Chao and the Prince of Weih, Wu-chi, [let there be] five families. We order that [these families] should watch with care the tumuli [to the care of which they have been assigned] and that they should be exempted and not made to give any other service."1 1 The care of the tomb involved the making of regular offerings to the spirits of the deceased as well as cleaning the mound, etc. Such offerings were expensive, hence the provision of a number of families and their exemption from other taxesâthe amount they would otherwise pay as rent or taxes was to go for the provision of offerings, etc. In ordering these sacrifices Kao-tsu was following his general policy of conciliating his people in order to prevent further rebellions. A general of Ch'en Hsi who had surrendered told that when [Ch'en] Hsi rebelled, the King of Yen, Lu Wan, had sent men to the place where [Ch'en] Hsi was, to plot secretly. When the Emperor sent the Marquis of Pi-yang, Shen Yi-chi, to go to escort 141KAO-TSU, Year XII 1B: 21a [Lu] Wan [to the capital, Lu] Wan feigned sickness, 195 B.C. [so that Shen] Yi-chi reported that there were signs that [Lu] Wan had rebelled. In the spring, the second month, [the Emperor] sent Fan K'uai and Mar./Apr. Chou P'o, with troops, to attack [Lu] Wan. The imperial edict said, "The King of Yen, [Lu] Wan, was an old friend of mine, and I loved him like a son. 21b When I heard that he had plotted with Ch'en Hsi, I thought there was no such thing, hence I sent an envoy to escort [Lu] Wan [to the capital. But Lu] Wan feigned sickness and did not come, [so that] it is evident he has planned to rebel. The officials and people of Yen have committed no crime. I grant to each of its officials who have the rank of six hundred piculs and above, one step [in noble rank]; to those who have been [in revolt] with [Lu] Wan [but] leave him and come to return [to their allegiance to me], I will grant pardon and also add one step in noble rank." An edict [ordered that] the vassal kings should discuss who should be made King of Yen. The King of Ch'ang-sha, [Wu] Ch'en, and others begged that [the Emperor] establish his son [Liu] Chien as King of Yen. An imperial edict said, "The Marquis of Nan-wu, Chih, is also a descendent of YÃ¼eh; We establish him as King of Nan-hai." In the third month an imperial edict said, "I Apr./May have been made the Son of Heaven, and as Emperor have now possessed the world for twelve years until 22a the present. Together with the brave officers and talented grandees of the empire I have subjugated the empire; together we have pacified and reunited it. Among those [of my followers] who have distinguished themselves, I have established the best as kings, the next [best] as marquises, and the least have moreover been given the income of towns. 142KAO-TSU, Year XII 195 B.C. Moreover some of the relatives of my important 1B: 22a subjects have become marquises. All have been themselves authorized to establish their officials and levy taxes. Their daughters have become1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien thinks that the character , which now follows the phrase , should precede it. We have followed his suggestion. There is probably some mistake in the text at this point. Princesses. The marquises who have the income of 22b towns all wear seals; we have granted them large residences. The officials [of the rank of] two thousand piculs We moved to Ch'ang-an to receive small residences. Those who went to Shu and Hans and subjugated the three [parts of the state of] Ch'in are all exempted [from taxes and services] from generation to generation. Towards the worthy officers and meritorious officials of the empire I may be said not to have been ungrateful. Let those who unrighteously rebel against the Son of Heaven and arbitrarily raise troops be punished by the united military forces of the empire and be executed. Let this be published and announced to the world to let it clearly understand Our intention." When the Emperor was fighting against [Ch'ing] Pu, he had been wounded by a stray arrow; as he was traveling along he became ill. When his illness became severe the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ called a good physican. When the physician entered and saw him, the Emperor asked the physician, "Can my sickness be healed?" The physician replied, "It can be healed."2 2 The Sung Ch'i ed. tells that the old text (before vii cent.) and the YÃ¼eh ed. (ca. xi-xii cent.) omit the reply of the physician. The Ching-yu ed. (1034) also omits it. The physician's reply is found in SC 8: 35b and is needed for the narrative. Thereupon the Emperor scolded him, [using] disrespectful [language], "I took possession of the world as a humble citizen wielding a sword3 3 Lit. "[wearing] clothes of [plain] cloth, and wielding a three foot [sword]." Common persons were compelled to wear plain cloth; three feet was the common length of a two-edged sword. The SC has here the word , "sword"; the HS has omitted it in condensing. Yen Shih-ku tells that the vulgar copies have this word. Three ancient Chinese feet was about 27 inches long, English measure. âwas not this [achievement by] the Decree 143KAO-TSU, Year XII 1B: 22b of Heaven? My fate is then with Heaven; altho 195 B.C. Pien Ch'io [were here], what use could he be?" Therefore he did not let him treat his sickness, but granted him fifty catties of actual gold and dismissed him. The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ asked, "After your Majesty's 23a decease,1 1 Lit. "after the `hundred years' "; previously in speaking of his decease, Kao-tsu had said, "after my `ten-thousand years,' " cf. 1B: 20a. when the Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho] has died,2 2 Here there is used the word at present often tabooed: . whom should I order to take his place?" The Emperor said, "Ts'ao Ts'an can [be chosen.]" She [then] asked who next, and he replied, "Wang Ling can [be chosen]. However he is a little stupid, [so] Ch'en P'ing can [be chosen] to assist him. Ch'en P'ing has superabundent intelligence, but he would find it difficult to bear the responsibility alone. Chou P'o is dignified and sincere, [but] he is not very polished; yet the one who will assure the peace of the house of Liu must be [Chou] P'o. He could be made Grand Commandant." The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ again asked who next, and the Emperor replied, "After that you3 3 Kao-tsu uses the pronoun nai . Shen Ch'in-han says that "originally nai was the pronoun used by a husband in speaking to his wife," quoting the Hsi-ching Tsa-chi (vi cent.). Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that it is merely a word of familiar address. too will not know [things]." Lu Wan with several thousand men stayed at the foot of the Barrier, waiting, if by good chance the Emperor's sickness should become better, to come in 144KAO-TSU, Year XII 195 B.C. person to beg for pardon. [But] in the summer, the 1B: 23a June 1 fourth month, on [the day] chia-ch'en, the Emperor died in the Ch'ang-lo Palace.1 1 The Han-chiu-yi written by Wei Hung (fl. 25-57), says, "When the Emperor Kao-[tsu] died, on the third day, the first clothes were put on the corpse in his room below the window. There was made of chestnut wood a spirit tablet, eight inches long, square in front and round behind, a foot in circumference, which was placed in the window, facing outwards from inside [the room]. Silk floss was spread out as a screen. In front of it were four sticks of white wood as thick as a finger and three feet long, bound with white fur, set in the four directions in the window with the spirit tablet in their center. On the seventh day the corpse was completely clothed, put into the coffin, and sacrificed to in the window, [using] pap made of glutinous millet and sheep tongues. When he had already been buried, the spirit tablet was taken up, enclosed in a wooden cover, and kept in the great hall of the temple, in a niche in the western wall." When Lu Wan heard of it, he thereupon fled to the Huns. The Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ plotted with Shen Yi-chi, saying, "The generals together with the Emperor formerly came from families enregistered as common people; when they faced north2 2 Since the throne always faces south, courtiers always face north. as courtiers, in their hearts they have always felt dissatisfied, and 23b now they [will] nevertheless [have to] serve the young lord [his son]. If they are not all completely exterminated together with their families, the empire will not be at peace." For this reason [the Empress] did not [announce the death and] proclaim a mourning. Someone heard of it and spoke to Li Shang. [Li] Shang saw Shen Yi-chi and said [to him], "I have heard that the Emperor has already been dead for four days, and that [the Empress] has not proclaimed any mourning and wishes to kill the generals. If [the situation] is really like this, the empire is certainly in danger. Ch'en P'ing and Kuan Ying, 145KAO-TSU, Year XII 1B: 23b leading a hundred thousand [men], defend Jung- 195 B.C. yang; Fan K'uai and Chou P'o, leading two hundred 24a thousand [men], are subjugating Yen and Taiâ when these1 1 The Fukien ed. (1549) writes ; the SC, the Han-chi (ii cent.) &amp; other HS texts write . [people] hear that the Emperor has died and the generals have all been killed, they will certainly turn about face with their troops in order to attack Kuan-chung. With the great ministers revolting inside [the passes] and the generals turning against [the dynasty] outside [the passes], it could await its destruction on tiptoe."2 2 I.e., destruction would come in a moment. Shen Yi-chi 24b entered and told these [words to the Empress]. So on [the day] ting-wei [the Empress] proclaimed a June 4 mourning and granted a general amnesty to the world. In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-yin, [the June 23 Emperor] was buried in the Ch'ang Tomb. When [the coffin] had been put in place, the imperial heir-apparent and the courtiers all returned and went to the temple of the Grand Emperor.3 3 The ancestral temple of the imperial family. The courtiers said, "The Emperor arose from humble [beginnings]; he established order in a troubled generation, and turned it back to the right [path]. He pacified and subjugated the world, and became the Grand Founder4 4 . The word became his temple name; cf. 5:2b. of the Han [dynasty]. His achievements were very great.5 5 ; this word is made his title. We offer him the high title of Kao-huang-ti."6 6 , lit. "the Great Emperor." This is his posthumous name. He is usually known as Han Kao-tsu, from the name of the dynasty and words taken partly from his posthumous title and partly from the phrase in note 4. 146KAO-TSU In his early life, Kao-tsu did not cultivate literary 1B: 24b studies, but by nature he was intelligent and penetrating. He liked to make plans and was able to listen [to others]. From a superintendent of a gate or a man exiled to the frontier1 1 Referring to Li Yi-chi and Lou Ching. Cf. 1A: 15b; 1B: 7a. [upwards, anyone] who came to see him [was treated] as an old [friend]. At the beginning [of his reign] he conformed to the people's wishes when he made an agreement [with them] in three articles;2 2 Regarding legal punishments. Cf. 1A: 20a, b. when the empire had been subjugated, he commanded Hsiao Ho to set in order the [criminal] laws and orders,3 3 Cf. HS ch. 23; Glossary sub Hsiao Ho. The following clauses are taken from SC 130:28. Han Hsin to set forth the military methods,4 4 HS 30: 60a lists "Han Hsin, in three chapters" among the books on war and strategy. 30: 65a reads, "When the Han [dynasty] arose, Chang Liang and Han Hsin arranged and ordered its military methods." Chang Ts'ang to fix the calendar and measures,5 5 Ju Shun interprets this phrase as referring to the calendar and to weights and measures; Yen Shih-ku says the second part of this phrase refers to the standard models [for weights and measures]. Cf. 42: 5a. Shu-sun T'ung to establish the rites and etiquette,6 6 He fixed the etiquette and laws of the Han ancestral temple and to some extent the general etiquette and laws of the Han dynasty. Cf. Glossary sub Shu-sun T'ung; Hu Shih's account in Jour. N. C. Br. R. A. S. 60: 24-5. and Lu Chia to compose 25a the Hsin-yÃ¼. With his meritorious followers he split tallies and made oaths, with red writing and an iron certificate, a golden box and a stone chest, and kept them in the ancestral temple.7 7 The foregoing items are used in connection with the ceremonies of enfeoffing nobles. Cf. Glossary, sub Marquis. Altho daily no leisure was afforded him, his designs and plans were vast and far-reaching. In eulogy we say,8 8 This stock phrase "in eulogy" introduces a summary by the author. The practise of introducing an opinion by the historian, as distinguished from the recital of facts, began with the Tso-chuan, which uses the phrase for that purpose. The SC uses the phrase and the HS uses each marks a summary and expression of personal opinion. The practise of introducing a quotation into the historian's summary is copied from the SC, which frequently does that, one famous quotation extending over many pages. In `Spring and Autumn' [times], the historian of [the state of] Chin, Ts'ai 147KAO-TSU 1B: 25a Mo, said, "When the T'ao and T'ang family1 1 The ancient distinction between the clan name and the family name is kept in the following passage in the textâfamily names changed from time to time, since they were based on incidental historical events, such as the possession of a particular fief; clan names were inherited and did not change. But in Han times that distinction was lost. Pan Ku seems to have known that distinction and to have realized that in his time it was no longer pertinent. Szu-ma Ch'ien does not even seem to know of this distinction, and confuses the two. had lost its power, among its descendants there was a Liu Lei who learned to train dragons.2 2 Ying Shao says that he not only made them obey his will but also nourished and reared them. This passage is also quoted in the SC (Mh I, 168). He served K'ung-chia. The Fan family were his descendants." Moreover the Grandee Fan Hsientzu also said, "My ancestors before [the time of] YÃ¼ [Shun] were surnamed T'ao and T'ang; in the [time of the] Hsia [dynasty], they were surnamed YÃ¼-lung; in [the time of] the Shang [dynasty], they were surnamed Shih-wei; in [the time of] the Chou 25b [dynasty], they were surnamed T'ang and Tu; when [the state of] Chin became the lord of China's oaths,3 3 This literary phrase refers to Duke Wen of Chin (reigned 636-628 B.C.), who became Lord Protector, the professed leader of the Chinese feudal states. The word here translated China is . they were surnamed Fan. A [member of the] Fan [family] was the Supreme Judge of Chin. In the time of Duke Wen of Lu, [the family] fled to Ch'in.4 4 Yen Shih-ku, basing his account on the Tso-chuan, says that in 621 B.C. Duke Hsiang of Chin died and Szu Hui with Hsien-mieh travelled to the state of Ch'in where they went to meet the Prince Yung , intending to make him the heir of Chin. In 620 B.C., using a Ch'in army, they brought Yung into Chin. But when HsÃ¼an-tzu of Chao set up Duke Ling and fought with the Ch'in army, defeating it at K'u-shou , Hsien-mieh fled to Ch'in and Szu Hui followed him. Cf. Legge, Tso-chuan, p. 2435, 24616. Later they returned to Chin. Those [of the Fan family] who remained [in Ch'in] became 148KAO-TSU the Liu family."1 1 Yen Shih-ku continues that in 614 B.C. some people of Chin got Shou-yÃ¼ of Weih to pretend to revolt against Weih, and lured Szu Hui to welcome him. The state of Ch'in returned to him his wife and children. The rest of his family remained in Ch'in, but, since they had no official rank or fief, they took again the family name previously used by Liu Lui. The sentence in the text about the family again taking the Liu surname is quoted from the Tso-chuan, Duke Lu, 13th year (Legge's translation, vol. I, p. 264, par. 2). On that sentence Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768) quotes a remark of K'ung Ying-ta (574648) in his Tso-chuan Su, doubting the authenticity of this sentence in the Tso-chuan. Szu Hui's family attained no prominence in the state of Ch'in in his lifetime nor did they later do anything worthy of remark. Hence there was no reason for the Tso-chuan to notice their surname. Moreover, the sentence about their surname does not fit in with the subject matter of the preceding or following. He thinks it was not originally in the Tso-chuan, but was added by some scholar when the Han dynasty arose, as a means of gaining their favor. In the time of the Han Emperor Ming (58-75 A.D.), Chia K'uei petitioned the throne saying, "The five classics offer no proof or prophecy showing that the Liu family is the descendant of Yao; only Tso has any definite statement." The sentence about the Liu family was probably added to the Tso-chuan however before the time of Chia K'uei; in 78 B.C. Kuei Hung (HS 75: 1b) memorialized the throne, saying, "The house of Han carries on the line of Yao," so that in his time the Tso-chuan may have already contained this sentence. Later Liu Hsiang (76-6 B.C.) praised Kao-tsu saying that he had "descended from the Emperor T'ang [Yao]," and Wang Mang (ruled 6-23 A.D.) called the Han dynasty "the descendants of Yao." Pan Piao himself in his Wang-ming-lun (cf. HS 100A: 10b) said, "[They are the] descendants of the Emperor Yao." This spurious geneology had great political importance. Cf. HS 100A: 7a-11a. Liu Hsiang said, "In the time 1B: 25b of the Contending States, [a member of] the Liu family from Ch'in was made prisoner of war by Weih.2 2 Wen Yin (fl. ca. 196-220) said that when, in the time of the Six States (468-246 B.C.), the state of Ch'in made an expedition against Weih, a Mr. Liu was with the army and was captured by Weih, so that the family was thus made to live in Weih. When [the state of] Ch'in destroyed [the 26a state of] Weih,3 3 The state of Weih was destroyed by Ch'in in 225 B.C., but Yen Shih-ku thinks that this sentence refers to the time when King Chao of Ch'in (306-266 B.C.) made an expedition against Weih and the King of Weih left the city of An-yi and moved eastwards to Ta-liang, calling his state Liang. Liu Ch'ang (1019-1068) thinks Yen Shih-ku is mistaken. [the family] moved to Ta-liang 149KAO-TSU 1B: 26a and dwelt at Feng. Hence Chou Fu said to Yung Ch'ih,1 1 Cf. 1A: 11a. `Feng was formerly a colony of Liang.' Thus the eulogy of Kao-tsu said,2 2 These six lines are of four words each and rime. `The line of descent of the Han Emperor Is traced from the Emperor T'ang [Yao]. Coming on down to the Chou [dynasty], In [the state of] Ch'in it became the Liu [family]. It crossed into Weih and went eastwards. Thereupon [its head] became the Lord of Feng.' "3 3 . This is the first occurrence of this title in the book. It seems as if someone had thought that since Kao-tsu was at first known as "the Lord of P'ei," his grandfather must have been known as "the Lord of" at least the town he lived in. Cf. p. 40, n. 1. The Lord of Feng was indeed the Grand Emperor's father. The period since his moving [to Feng] had been brief, [for] there are few mounds or graves [of the family] at Feng. When Kao-tsu took the throne, he established officials for the worship [of his ancestors], so there were shamans from Ch'in, Chin, Liang, and Ching.4 4 The four regions in which Kao-tsu's supposed ancestors had lived. The Fan family had held office in Chin, hence Chin shamans were necessary to worship their ancestral spirits; a branch of Fan Hui's descendants were supposed to have remained in Ch'in, where they took the surname Liu, so that Ch'in shamans were needed for them; the Liu family went to Weih (which was also called Liang, from the name of its capital city), hence Liang shamans were needed; later the family moved to Feng, which was in Ching (Ch'u), so that Ching shamans were also needed. The principle was that ghosts need the sort of worship peculiar to the region where they lived and were buried. For generations the 150KAO-TSU worship of Heaven and Earth has been accompanied 1B: 26a by the worship [of these ancestors].1 1 The ancestors were taken as the surrogate or representative of Heaven or as those who introduce the worshipers to Heaven and so are worshiped simultaneously with Heaven. Cf. "The Works of HsÃ¼ntze," chap. xix, 20; H. H. Dubs, "HsÃ¼ntze," p. 114. How could [these facts] be untrustworthy? From the foregoing [accounts] we infer that the Han [dynasty] succeeded to the fortunes of Yao; its virtues and the happiness recompensing it are already great. The cutting in two of the snake,2 2 Cf. 1A: 6b, 7a. the auspicious omens which appeared,3 3 The wonderful sights, the physiognomization, and the emanation. Cf. 1A: 3b, 5b, 7b. the banners and pennons which emphasized [the color] red4 4 Cf. 1A: 9b. in harmony with the virtue of fire,5 5 Cf. p. 35, n. 2. This last sentence condenses Pan Piao's essay on "The Discussion of the Destiny of Kings," found in HS 100A: 8a-11b. were responses which came of their own accord, [thereby showing that Kao-tsu] secured the [dynastic] rule from Heaven. 151 Appendix I THE CONJUNCTION OF THE FIVE PLANETS IN TUNG-CHING HS 1A: 18b reads, "In the first year, in the winter, the tenth month [Nov. 14-Dec. 12, 207 B.C.] there was a conjunction of the five planets in [the constellation] Tung-ching." Dr. J. K. Fotheringham of Oxford has very kindly calculated this conjunction. According to his results, this conjunction cannot have been correctly recorded for 207 B.C., inasmuch as at that time, although the planets were within about 41Â° of longitude of each other, "Mercury and Jupiter were on one side of the sun, visible as morning stars, and Venus, Mars, and Saturn were on the other side, visible as evening stars." In 206 B.C., Mars was far away from Jupiter. The date of closest approach for these planets was on May 30, 205 B.C., when the planetary longitudes were as follows: Mercury and Jupiter at 88.3Â° right ascension, Saturn at 90.7Â°, Mars at 98.4Â°, and Venus at 111.3Â°. The total range in right ascension was thus 23Â°. But at that time all the planets were not in the constellation Tung-ching. The right ascensions of the stars in that constellation are calculated for 205 B.C. by Dr. Fotheringham as follows: ? Gemini as 62.8Â°, ? as 64.9Â°, ? as 67.3Â°, ? as 67.8Â°, ? as 70.5Â°, ? as 73.3Â° and ? as 77.7Â°. Tung-ching is however stated by Chinese authorities to contain 33 Chinese degrees, which is about 32.5Â° in European measurement. The next constellation in the Chinese zodiac is Kuei , whose constituent stars ranged at that date from 95.3Â° to 98.8Â° R.A. This constellation is said to contain 4 Chinese degrees (about 3.9Â° in our measurement). Hence "it is clear from this that the space between one asterism in the list of zodiacal constellations and the next was reckoned to the preceding asterism. At least this was so with" Tung-ching. Then Tung-ching extended from 62.8Â° to 95.3Â° R.A. Even so, on May 30th, Mars was in Kuei and Venus in the next constellation, Liu. Dr. Fotheringham has however calculated that on May 16th, 205 B.C., when Mercury was first opposite the first star in Tung-ching, being at 62.8Â°, the other planets were located as follows: Jupiter at 85.0Â°, Mars at 88.8Â°, Saturn at 88.9Â°, and Venus at 95.9Â°. They were thus spread over 33.1Â° of longitude. The first four planets were in Tung-ching, and Venus was just over in Kuei. Venus had last been seen in Tung-ching 152CHAPTER I on May 14th, two evenings previous. But Kuei is usually mentioned together with Tung-ching in the HS; the two were grouped together as the constellation Shun-shou (lit., "the head of the quail"). Chinese astronomers thus had no difficulty in giving "the conjunction the benefit of any doubt." We may then take the middle of May 205 B.C. as the date of this conjunction. How did this conjunction get dated in November 207 B.C. in the HS? That date was the result of a misunderstanding on the part of the author. The earliest extant statement about this conjunction is found in the SC 37: 40a, "When the Han dynasty triumphed, the five planets appeared in conjunction in [the constellation] Tung-ching." [Cf. Mh III, 407. Chavannes adds a note that this conjunction happened in 200 B.C., on the authority of Ssu-ma Cheng's So-yin. But the So-yin gives that date, not to this conjunction, but to the event mentioned next, the siege of Kao-tsu at P'ing-ch'eng, for the note comes after the sentence recounting the siege. Elsewhere the SC (Mh. II, 389, 390) gives this date for the siege.] The date when "the Han dynasty triumphed" may be variously given. Kao-tsu dated his accession from the time he received the surrender of Tsu-ying in November 207 B.C., but Hsiang YÃ¼ was not killed until January 202 B.C., and Kao-tsu did not ascend the throne as emperor until Feb. 22, 202 B.C. It might also be said that the triumph occurred when Kao-tsu returned from Han and conquered the three Ch'in successor statesâJune 206 B.C. He however first actually assumed imperial prerogatives when he did away with the Ch'in dynasty's gods of the land and grains and substituted his ownâon March 5, 205 B.C. About the time of the conjunction in May 205 B.C., Kao-tsu did triumph over Hsiang YÃ¼, when he entered P'eng-ch'eng, Hsiang YÃ¼'s capital, but he was severely defeated immediately afterwards. Perhaps this conjunction actually helped to keep up his courage after that defeat (cf. 1A: 33b). It was thus quite natural that Kao-tsu's assumption of imperial prerogatives in March 205 should have been linked with the conjunction in May, and that the conjunction should have been said to have happened when the Han dynasty triumphed. The astrological interpretation of this conjunction also assisted in bringing about the statement in the HS. The ancient Chinese allocated the various regions of the sky to various states, just as was the case in the ancient Mediterranean world. According to Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C.-83 A.D.), Shun-shou, which includes Tung-ching and Kuei, was allocated to Ch'in. Since Kao-tsu had possessed himself of this territory, it is natural that the conjunction should have been interpreted 153APPENDIX I with reference to his dynasty. Ying Shao remarks that this conjunction indicated that a new emperor of a new dynasty would conquer by his righteousness. Because of this astrological interpretation, when the exact date of the conjunction had been forgotten, it was natural to have put this conjunction at the beginning of the Han dynasty's reign. Liu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) wrote, "When the Han [dynasty] entered [the region of] Ch'in, the five planets appeared in conjunction in [the constellation] Tung-ching." In SC 89: 9b (repeated in HS 23: 6b, 7a) we find a further detail: "The old gentleman Kan said, `When the King of Han [Kao-tsu] entered the pass [Oct. 207 B.C.], the five planets appeared in conjunction in [the constellation] Tung-ching. Tung-ching is the portion [of the heavens allocated to] Ch'in. Whoever reached [that place] first should have been made its king.' " With the foregoing statement before him, it is quite natural that Pan Ku should have written as he did and dated this conjunction at the official beginning of the Han dynasty in November 207 B.C. He evidently had no exact record of the conjunction except the foregoing passages and was not sorry, in his record, to glorify the dynasty under which he was writing. [Reproduced by permission from the Jour. A. O. S., Sept. 1935, vol. 55, pp. 310-3.] 154 Appendix II THE HAN DYNASTY'S EARLIER CALENDAR In ancient times, several calendars were used in China. Months were always counted from new moon to new moon, a month occupying the time of a lunation, but the year did not always begin at the same period. For astronomical purposes, months were numbered by the twelve horary characters, beginning with the month which normally contains the winter solstice. The calendar anciently used in the feudal state of Chin, said to be that of the legendary Hsia dynasty, put the first month in the third astronomical month. The Yin calendar, used in the state of Sung, began the year one month earlier, putting New Year's day in the second astronomical month. The royal calendar of the Chou dynasty began the year one month earlier, New Year's day coming in the first astronomical month. (Cf. H. Maspero, La Chine antique, pp. 222-223.) The Ch'in dynasty put New Year's day one month farther forward, into the twelfth astronomical month. The early Han rulers continued this practise, until, in 104 B.C., the Han Emperor Wu put New Year's day back to the period it occupied in the Hsia calendar, in the third astronomical month, where it stayed (with unimportant exceptions) until the time of the Chinese Republic. (For a fuller account, cf. Havret, in the T'oung Pao, vol. 8, p. 399.) The SC and HS were both written after the Han calendar reform in 104 B.C., but they record events occurring at a time when the year began three months earlier than at the time they were writing. Which calendar did they use? What names did they give to the months, those in use in later Han or in Ch'in times? The true answer to the above questions is a very peculiar one: the Ch'in dynasty kept the same names (numbers) for the months as those used in Hsia (and later Han) times, but merely shifted the date of New Year's day and the attendant official ceremonies. That is, the Ch'in dynasty made New Year's day occur in the month which they called the "tenth" month, so that the month which they called the "first month" was the fourth in order from the beginning of the official year! The Han Emperor Wu merely restored New Year's day to the beginning of what he and his predecessors had been calling the "first" month, but which month had not previously begun the year. The existence of such an anomalous calendar as one beginning with the "tenth" month is so unnatural that only quite conclusive evidence 155APPENDIX II should make us accept it. This evidence is even more important because Yen Shih-ku (581-645 A.D.), the outstanding commentator on the HS, contradicts our viewâhe said that the Ch'in dynasty had really called the month with which their year began the "first" month, and numbered the months consecutively beginning with that one; and that the authors of the SC and HS had changed the names of the months to correspond to the different names given them in Han times after the calendrical reform. The evidence for the contrary view is presented below: I. In the first place, there is ample evidence from the SC, HS, and other documents to show that in Ch'in and early Han times the year did actually begin with what the historians called the "tenth" month and that the "first" month was the fourth in the order of the months. Since exactly three months are reckoned to a season, the Ch'in calendar then made the year begin with the first month of autumn and made the "first" month begin the spring season. The pertinent points in the following passages are accordingly: the order of the months in the year, the seasons at which certain months come, and the month and season in which official ceremonies occurred. Italics are mine. a. In chap. 5 of the SC we read (cf. Mh. II, 91): "In the 48th year of King Chao-hsiang, in the tenth month, [the state of] Hanh offered [to Ch'in the city of] YÃ¼an-yung. The army of Ch'in was divided into three armies. . . . In the first month, the troops were disbanded." Note that in the same year, the "first" month comes after the "tenth" month. b. In the monthly tables of the SC (chap. 16; cf. Mh III, 59) during the second year of the Second Emperor, the months are enumerated beginning with the tenth month, next the eleventh and twelfth months, and then only the first month. It is here called the , for was tabooed, since it was the personal name of the First Emperor. c. In chap. 8 of the SC (cf. Mh II, 393) we read, "In the tenth month of the tenth year [of Kao-tsu], Ch'ing Pu, King of Huai-nan, P'eng YÃ¼eh, King of Liang, Lu Wan, King of Yen, Liu Chia, King of Ching, Liu Chiao, King of Ch'u, Liu Fei, King of Ch'i, Wu Jei, King of Ch'ang-sha, all came to court at the Ch'ang-lo Palace. In the spring and summer, nothing [of note] happened. In the seventh month, the Grand Emperor died at the Yo-yang Palace." The great court reception at the beginning of the official year then occurred in the tenth month, which was in winter, for spring came afterwards. d. In the HS, 4: 15b f, we read, "In the spring of the fifteenth year, a yellow dragon appeared at Ch'eng-chi. The Emperor issued an edict ordering a discussion of a sacrifice in the suburbs. . . . In the fourth month, in the summer, the emperor visited Yung and then first sacrificed to the 156CHAPTER I Five Emperors." Since the SC says that in ancient times the sacrifice to the Five Emperors was always made in the summer, the fourth month came in summer; hence the first month came in the spring. e. In HS 6: 6b we read, "In the fourth year [of the period YÃ¼an-kuang (131 B.C.)] Tou-yin, the Marquis of Wei-chi, who had committed a crime, was executed publicly. In the spring, the third month, on the day yi-mao, the Lieutenant Chancellor [T'ien] Fen died." But the SC 107: 12b, says, "On the last days of the twelfth month, [the Marquis of Wei-chi] was sentenced to be publicly executed in the market-place in Wei-ch'eng. In that spring the Marquis of Wu-an [the chancellor] died of illness." Then the execution occurred before the spring, according to the HS, and in the twelfth month, according to the SC; the death occurred in the spring and in the third month. f. In SC 16: 9b, 10a, b, 12a we read, "[In the first year of the state of Hans], in the first month, Hsiang Yu divided Kuan-chung. . . . The second month was the beginning of the [reign of] the King of Hans, the former Lord of P'ei. . . . In the third month he made Nan-cheng his capital." Now in 22: 1b we read, "In the first year of the Emperor Kao-tsu, in the Spring, the Lord of P'ei became the King of Hans and went to Nan-ch'eng." Thus the first, second, and third months came in spring. g. In chap. 25 of the SC, the explanation of the twelve musical tubes begins with the tenth month (cf. Mh III, 303), "Among the sonorous tubes, [it, i.e. the tenth month, corresponds to] the Yin-chung." The explanation proceeds month by month, and ends with the ninth month (cf. ibid. 313), "Among the musical tubes, [it, i.e. the ninth month, corresponds to] the Wu-yi." Thus the order of the tubes follows that of the official year, from the tenth to the ninth month. h. In HS 90: 7b, 8a, b we read, "When Wang Wen-shu . . . became the administrator of Ho-nei, . . . by the end of the twelfth month, in all the commandery there was not a thief to make any dogs bark. Those few [thieves] whom he did not catch and who fled to neighboring commanderies, he pursued. Meanwhile spring had come. [Wang] Wen-shu stamped his feet and sighed, `Alas! If the winter months should be prolonged one more month, it would be sufficient [for my task].' . . . The Emperor considered him an able [person] and promoted him to be Palace Military Commander." Now according to HS 19B: 18b, he was appointed Palace Military Commander in 119 B.C., 15 years before the reform of the calendar. In his time, the twelfth month came in winter. i. In the Book of Rites, chap. 17, p. 4a we find the following, "In the third month of autumn . . , it was [ordered] that the nobles should unify their practises and customs and that [the officials of] all the 157APPENDIX II districts [should come] to receive [instructions for their government] at [the grand reception] on the first day of the month in the coming year." The commentary tells us that this passage refers to Ch'in practises. Since the great court reception was held on New Year's day, that festival came in winter. j. In the HS 1B: 17a we read, "In the eleventh year . . . the second month, an imperial edict said, . . . `The vassal kings and marquises shall regularily pay court and make offerings in the tenth month." The reference is again to the grand court reception on New Year's day, here stated to occur in the tenth month. k. In HS 4: 6b we read, In the third month of the first year, "an edict said, `Now it is the time of spring, when [nature is] harmonious, and the plants and trees are all growing, when things all have means of enjoying themselves." Then the third month was in spring. But cf. p. 236, n. 4. l. In HS 6:26a we read, In the first year of the period YÃ¼an-feng (110 B.C.) "an imperial edict read, `Let the tenth month [begin] the first year of the [period] YÃ¼an-feng.' " Hence the year began with the tenth month. (Altho the word `begin' is not actually in the text, the passage plainly implies it.) m. In chap. 15 of the SC we read, "In the thirty-seventh year, in the tenth month, on the day kuei-ch'ou [Nov. 1, 211 B.C.], the First Emperor went out on a trip. [cf. Mh II, 184] . . . [In the seventh month] . . . on the ping-yin day, the First Emperor died in the P'in terrace at Sha-ch'iu . . . In the ninth month the First Emperor was buried in Mt. Li" (cf. ibid. 193). In Chap. 15 of the SC (Chavannes did not translate this passage), it reads, "The first year of the Second Emperor. In the tenth month, on the day wu-yin [an edict was issued ordering] a general freeing of criminals. In the eleventh month, he made the Rabbit park. In the twelfth month, he went to the O-fang Palace. In the ninth month of that year the commanderies and districts all rebelled." Thus the historians began a year with the tenth month and ended it with the ninth month. There are many such passages. n. In the HS 4: 9a (cf. Mh II, 461), we read, "In the eleventh month [of the second year], on the day kuei-mao [Jan. 2, 180 B.C.] the last day of the month, there was an eclipse [Oppolzer's no. 2447]. The imperial edict read: . . . `Since on the last day of the eleventh month there was an eclipseâa reproach that was seen in the heavensâhow great must the calamity be!' " In this passage too events in the tenth month are recorded as preceding this one and events in the first month follow it. o. The SC 96: 5a (HS 42: 5a), tells that when Chang Ts'ang was 158CHAPTER I Lieutenant Chancellor, he advised that because Kao-tsu arrived at Pa-shang (cf. HS 1A: 19b) in the tenth month, and was consequently considered to have overthrown the Ch'in dynasty in that month, the date of New Year's day should not be changed from the date set by the Ch'in dynasty. Thus the conquest of Ch'in was commemorated by continuing New Year's day on the date of his conquest. In the same chapter we read, "It was ordered that all the kings and marquises should always appear at court and make presentations in the tenth month." The same statement appears in SC chap. 99 and HS chap. 43. Hence the early Han tenth month was the same as the Ch'in tenth month. An interesting confirmation is found in the HHS, chap. 14, where it says that on the first day of each month and at the beginning of the year a great court was held at which presents and congratulations were received (from the nobles); the officials (however) congratulated (with presents) in the first month. In chap. 16 of the HHS it says "The reason that of all the first days of the months, only on the first day of the tenth month did they follow the former custom, was because in that month Kao-tsu subjugated the Ch'in dynasty and began the first year of his reign." p. In the SC and the HS (before 104 B.C.) the intercalary month is always called the "later ninth month" . (Since twelve lunations do not make quite a solar year, every two or three years an extra, intercalary month was added). After the calendrical reform in 104 B.C., the intercalary month was inserted at various times of the year to keep the seasons occurring in the proper months. The only adequate reason for the intercalary month always previously coming after the ninth month is that thus it was put at the end of the year. II. The foregoing passages amply prove that in Ch'in and early Han times the year began with what was later called the "tenth" month. But did the historians change the names of the months, as Yen Shih-ku said they did? We have already had evidence that such was not the case: passages j, k, l, and o quote imperial edicts which fix the months in the same seasons as those they later occurred in. The cyclical characters in passages e, m, and n enable us to check the dates; for, with a sixty day cycle, the same characters would not reappear in a month that came three months later. There is also the evidence furnished by the following passages: q. In HS 6:31b we read, "In the fifth month, in the summer, [in the first year of the (period) T'ai-ch'u (104 B.C.)], the calendar was corrected, making the first month begin the year." If the months had previously been numbered from the beginning of the official year, the record should have been different, something like the following: 159APPENDIX II The calendar was corrected, making the fourth month the first month. The wording of the HS shows that previously the "first" month did not begin the year. r. The great scholar Chia Yi, who lived 200-168 B.C. (before the calendrical reform) wrote a poem which is reproduced in his biography in the SC chap. 84 and HS chap. 48. In that poem the word for summer occurs in the rime, so that the historian could not have changed it, and it is coupled with the cyclical characters for the day: "In the year Shan-o in the fourth month, in the first month of summer, on the day keng-tzu, when the sun was setting, an owl perched in my house." The naming of the year as the fourth in the twelve year cycle enables us to identify it as 174 B.C. If the months were numbered beginning with the astronomical twelfth month (in which New Year's day then occurred), the fourth month would have been the first month of spring, not summer. The cyclical character also enables us to identify the month, for we know the cyclical character for the day of the calendrical reform, 19 years later, and a simple calculation (cf. Chinese Social and Political Science Review, vol. 18, p. 166) enables us to determine the characters for the days of each month in the year the poem refers to. The day keng-tzu could not have come in the fourth month after New Year's day of that year; but it could have come in the seventh month after New Year's day, which Chia Yi called the "fourth" month. Then the "fourth" month occurred in summer and contemporary writers numbered the month in which New Year's day came as the "tenth" month. s. Liu An, King of Huai-nan, committed suicide in 123-2 B.C., before the reform of the calendar. In his chapter on astronomy he writes (I confess that I do not altogether understand the passage), "The cycle of the universe begins with the first month which is the third astronomical month when the sun and moon have both entered five degrees into the [constellation] Ying-shih [?, ? Pegasus]." Here he says plainly that the "first" month is the third astronomical month, not the twelfth astronomical month, with which the Ch'in and early Han dynasty began the year. t. In the same book he tells that Mercury appears near the constellations Andromeda and Aries at the spring equinox in the second month, near Gemini and Cancer at the summer solstice in the fifth month, near Virgo at the autumn equinox in the eighth month, and near Sagitarious and Capricornus at the winter solstice in the eleventh month. Elsewhere in the book he gives the positions of the sun among the constellations for the twelve months of the year. Allowing for the precession of the equinoxes, those positions are the same as for the months called by 160CHAPTER I the same names in Ch'ing times, altho the book was written before the calendar reform. u. A stone inscription known as found on a hill near Han-tan, has inscribed on it the date ping-yin in the eighth month of the twenty-second year of the kingdom of Chao (B.C. 158). This is a contemporary record made before the correction of the calendar. If the months had been counted beginning with New Year's day, the eighth month could not have contained a ping-yin day at all. There is thus ample proof that the Ch'in and early Han dynasties used a curious calendar in which New Year's day and the official celebrations connected therewith came in what they called the "tenth" month, and that the reform in 104 B.C. did not change the names of the months, but merely shifted the date for New Year's day, altho a court celebration was continued to be held on the first days of the tenth month, because that date commemorated the founding of the dynasty. Hence the SC and the HS use the same names for the months as those used in Ch'in and Han times, which were the same as those in use in the time their authors wrote. The foregoing evidence has been mostly collected by Wang Yin-chih (1766-1834; Giles no. 2252); his famous reply to Yen Shih-ku is transcribed in Wang Hsien-ch'ien's Ch'ien-Han-shu Pu-chu, chap. 1, pt. A, pp. 23-26. Wang Hsien-ch'ien himself added material; further significant material is found in a paper by Chen Chin-sien, "The Anomalous Calendars of the Ch'in and Han Dynasties" in the Chinese Social and Political Science Review for July 1934, vol. 18, p. 157 ff. 161 Appendix III THE METHOD USED IN CHECKING RECORDED ECLIPSES For the checking of the eclipses recorded in Chinese records with astronomical computations there is the monumental Canon der Finsternisse, by Th. von Oppolzer, published in Vienna, in 1887, in which are calculated all the eclipses from 1208 B.C. to A.D. 2161. This book of tables gives the day, hour, and minute when eclipses occurred, the longitude of the sun at the time of the conjunction, and charts the paths of the central eclipses. Since and during Oppolzer's time, improvements in astronomical computations have shown that his calculations may be slightly in error. In the case of some Chinese eclipses, corrections of Oppolzer may be found in F. K. Ginzel, Spezieller Kanon der Sonnenund Mondfinsternisse fÃ¼r das LÃ¤ndergebiet der klassischen Altertumswis-senschaften und den Zeitraum von 900 vor Chr. bis 600 nach Chr., Berlin, 1899. Ginzel has again been corrected. The most recent work is P. V. Neugebauer, Astronomische Chronologie, Berlin, 1929. For Han times, Oppolzer is correct to within about half an hour.1 1 In my computations of Han eclipses by Neugebauer's method I have found Oppolzer's times for eclipses in error by varying amounts, from less than a minute to a maximum of 36 minutes. As no one since Oppolzer has produced a set of tables and charts covering Chinese territory, so that his book is the only one convenient to use, and as so little correction of his results is necessary, we may take Oppolzer's calculations as being as reliable now as ever, except at regions near the limit of visibility and when great exactness is necessary. Oppolzer charts only the paths of umbral (i.e., total, annular, and annular-total) eclipses (more exactly, only central eclipses). In most cases, the Chinese however observed the sun as only partially eclipsed. The region in which an umbral eclipse may be viewed as partial extends in all directions from the umbral path. Oppolzer did not calculate this area. We have allowed, on Oppolzer's charts, 15/16 to 1 inch at right angles to the path of an umbral eclipse and ? of an inch from the ends in the direction of that path, as the area in which an umbral eclipse may be seen as partial, remembering however that when we approach those limits, we may need to make allowance for Oppolzer's errors and also that the region of partiality may extend for much greater distances.2 2 To determine approximately the region in which an umbral eclipse may be seen as partial, I transferred the plotted charts for some 35 recent eclipses from the nautical almanacs to polar coordinates, like those used by Oppolzer in his charts, and measured the areas of partial visibility. These eclipses belonged to 26 different saros series and included all the umbral eclipses of the 19 years preceding 1938, in order to include all the saros series now running which produce umbral eclipses. While this is only a small proportion of the 152 saros series in Oppolzer's Kanon, the uniformity of results makes them probably typical. The areas of visibility for 23 of these eclipses were conchoid and for 12 were cylindrical. The curves for the areas in which an umbral eclipse is viewed as partial are of two sorts: cylindrical and conchoid. In those cases in which the moon's umbra reaches regions in the vicinity of the earth's equator, the limits of partial visibility for the eclipse are roughly parallel to the umbral path, so that the area of visibility swept by the moon's penumbra forms a sausage-shaped curve. I shall call such eclipses "cylindrical" in default of a better term. When the moon's umbra comes closer to the poles, its penumbra reaches beyond the northern (or southern) limits to which the sun is visible, so that the eclipse is visible only as far north (or south) as the sun is visible and the northern (or southern) border of the area of partial visibility is cut off. Then the area of visibility assumes a shell-like shape. I shall call such eclipses "conchoid." In the balance of this discussion, for simplicity's sake, I shall consider only the northern hemisphere, in which China is located. These results however apply equally well to the southern hemisphere, with directions reversed. Conchoid curves are obtained for those eclipses in which the moon's penumbra reaches the northern limits to which the sun is visible; such eclipses are those near the ends of a saros or exeligmos series. Cylindrical curves are obtained for those eclipses in which the penumbra does not reach that far north. This limit depends, of course, upon the season of the year: at the summer solstice, the sun reaches "north" as far as the polar circle on the opposite side of the globe; at the winter solstice, it reaches only to the polar circle on this side; at the equinoxes, it reaches to the poles; in between, the northern limits of the sun depend upon the date in the year. For cylindrical eclipses, the area of partial visibility, as measured on charts similar to and of the same dimensions as those of Oppolzer, extended for a distance of 15/16 to 2 inches at right angles to the path of umbral eclipse, with a mode of 1Â¼ inches, and also extended from ? to 1 inch in the same direction as and beyond the ends of that path. For conchoid eclipses, outside the polar regions, that area extended from 1 to 2? inches at right angles to the path of the umbral eclipse and from ? to 1 inch from the ends in the direction of that path. Within the polar regions, greater variations occurred. The area of visibility sometimes extended only for ? of an inch at right angles to the path of centrality or only 1/16 inch from the ends in the direction of the path. Since however China does not extend that far north, we may neglect these limits. The area of visibility reaches its greatest size when the line joining the ends of the umbral path lies north and south and the convex side of that path faces west; then the eclipse is visible for a distance of 1Â½ to 2 inches south from the umbral path (except near the ends), for 1Â½ to 1Â¾ inches westwards from the ends of that path, and from 1/16 to Â½ inch in the direction opposite to south from the ends of that path (which direction may also be south but across the pole). In proportion as the umbral path is tilted away from a general east and west direction, these unusual conditions are likely to be realized. 162CHAPTER I More than one-third of the total number of solar eclipsesâabout 35.3 per centâare nowhere umbral. These "partial eclipses" should be distinguished from umbral eclipses which are viewed from some points as 163APPENDIX III partial. Since in partial eclipses the moon's umbra does not touch the earth, Oppolzer has not indicated them on his charts. Yet they figure among the eclipses recorded in Chinese history. Astronomical chronology has sometimes neglected partial eclipses; J. Fr. Schroeter's Spezieller Kanon der zentralen Sonnen- und Mondfinsternisse, Kristiania, 1923, which claims to chart all eclipses visible in Europe from 600 to 1800 A.D., omits partial eclipses entirely, even though many such were visible within that region. Such eclipses are sometimes quite conspicuous, sometimes being visible even from the polar circle as far south as five degrees to the other side of the equator, so that historians have recorded them. In dealing with these partial eclipses, we are aided by certain empirical principles, known to the Greeks, but not much used in modern times. Eclipses recur at intervals of 6585.3 days (18 years and 10 or 11 days), which period is called a saros. At intervals of three saroi, 19,756 days (approximately 54 years 1 month), called by Ptolemy an exeligmos, solar eclipses recur at approximately the same place. If the eclipses occurring at intervals of an exeligmos are plotted on a map, it will be found that they form a series which has certain definite characteristics. Such a series invariably begins with a run of partial eclipses visible in the neighborhood of one of the earth's poles, followed by a long run of umbral eclipses, which gradually shift to the other pole of the earth, and ends with a run of partial eclipses.3 3 The data upon which this part of the discussion is based will be found in the papers of Dr. Alexander Pogo in Popular Astronomy, vol. 43, 1935. A solar exeligmos series covers a period of from 1244 to 1532 years or 23 to 28 exeligmoi, with an initial and terminal run of 2 to 8 exeligmoi during which only partial eclipses occur. If the noon points of the umbral eclipses are plotted for such a series, the resulting curves4 4 For such curves, cf. Neugebauer, Astronomische Chronologie, I, p. 24; Pogo, Popular Astronomy, Jan. 1935; W. Hartner, "Das Datum der Shih-ching-finsternisse," T'oungpao, 1935, diagram, p. 202-3. show periods of shifting and periods of quietude, in the latter of which the curve usually describes a loop. In periods of shifting, the noon points during a period of 6 exeligmoi may shift as much as 180 degrees of longitude and 90 degrees of latitude; whereas, in a period of quiescence, at a node, the noon points during as much as 8 exeligmoi may be located within an area of 60Â° of longitude and 30Â° of latitude or less. Since partial eclipses are those in which the moon's umbra (or its prolongation) passes over one of the earth's poles, and since successive eclipses in the same exeligmos series are located close to each other, it is possible to determine definitely that a partial solar eclipse was not visible 164CHAPTER I in China by counting backwards or forwards by exeligmoi to the first umbral eclipse. If that umbral eclipse was visible in the south polar regions, the partial eclipse cannot have been visible in China. In this manner half of the partial eclipses may be disposed of. A simpler method of discovering whether a partial eclipse is visible in China is by noting Oppolzer's calculated value of ? for that eclipse. If it is negative and between -1.0 and -1.6, the eclipse was partial and visible only in the southern hemisphere. By the above methods the regions of visibility for about five-sixths of all eclipses may be approximated without calculation. If the nearest umbral eclipse in the same exeligmos series was visible near the north pole, we cannot say with any certainty by this method whether the partial eclipses in that series were visible in China. Less than one-third of such partial eclipses are visible there, since only the eclipse at one of the three saroi in an exeligmos can usually be visible in China, and since the farther partial eclipses are from the nearest umbral eclipse in the same exeligmos series, the more they tend to move northwards, outside of Chinese latitudes. Because of the shifting in longitude shown by some series, a determination of the approximate circumstances of a partial eclipse from umbral eclipses in the same exeligmos series is not reliable. The visibility of partial eclipses in the northern hemisphere and of umbral eclipses that lie near the limits of visibility must be calculated. For that purpose the method used in Neugebauer, Astronomische Chronologie, has been used. A useful preliminary step is to use the elements given by Oppolzer with Neugebauer's tables as the latter directs (Op. cit. I, p. 103). In this way little more than a mere inspection of Neugebauer's tables is necessary. But the results thus obtained are only approximate, and are useful only to eliminate eclipses that are plainly invisible in China. In all cases where exact results are required, the computation should be carried through as directed by Neugebauer. The elements given in Oppolzer furnish a useful check upon such computations. 165 Appendix IV THE ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR KAO-TSU During this period of twelve (or fifteen) years, only three eclipses are recorded. We discuss them in chronological order. i. In the third year of Kao-tsu's reign, the tenth month, on the day chia-hsÃ¼, a solar eclipse is recorded (1A: 35a). This date was, according to P. Hoang, Concordance des chronologies nÃ©omÃ©niques, chinoise et europÃ©enne, ("VariÃ©tÃ©s sinologiques," no. 29), Shanghai, 1910, (which is used for dates throughout), December 20, 205 B.C. For that date Oppolzer calculated his solar eclipse no. 2387. It was merely partial; calculation according to the method in P. V. Neugebauer, Astronomische Chronologie (which is used for such calculations throughout), shows that the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.51 (the diameter of the sun being 1.00) at Ch'ang-an at 10:44 a.m., local time. HS 27 Cb: 13a adds, "It was 20 degrees in [the constellation] Tou," whose stars were then in R.A. 241.1Â° to 253.3Â°. The sun was in long. 266.0Â° = 265.6Â° R.A.1 1 Since Chinese astronomical data were always referred to the equator, not the ecliptic, celestial positions must be reduced to right ascension for purposes of comparison. There is thus good agreement in both the date and location of the sun. ii. In the third year, the eleventh month, the day kuei-mao, the last day of the month, a second solar eclipse is listed (1A: 35a). HS 27 Cb: 13a adds, "It was three degrees in [the constellation] HsÃ¼, whose two stars, ? Equulei and ? Aquarii, were then in R.A. 291.1Â° and 293.2Â°. This date was Jan. 18, 204 B.C., but there was no eclipse on that date, for Oppolzer gives none. The Han-chi (written by HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh, lived 148-209) records the preceding and the next eclipse (2: 11b, 4: 2a), copying the recording in the HS, but omits this one, which, in view of the fact that the Han-chi takes its material mostly from the HS, makes it look as though this eclipse was not in the text of the HS during the second century A.D. If so, it was interpolated both into chapters 1 and 27. In view of the fact that HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh noted all the other eclipses that are in the HS for the first half century of the Han period, even the one only found in HS ch. 27 (cf. ch. 4, App. IV, vi), it is difficult to explain otherwise his omission of this eclipse. During the seven years between the proceeding recorded eclipse and the next one, there occurred 14 solar eclipses, of which only one was 166CHAPTER I visible in China.1 1 Besides those whose location Oppolzer charts, the following three partial eclipses were invisible because they belong to initial (i.) or terminal (t.) runs in exeligmos series whose nearest umbral eclipse was located near the south pole: no. 2389 (i.); no. 2390 (t.); and no. 2398 (t.). In addition two partial eclipses were visible in the northern hemisphere, both of which were invisible in China: (1) no. 2388, on May 17, 204 B.C.; calculation shows that this eclipse was invisible; (2) no. 2397, on Mar. 4, 200 B.C.; calculation shows that at lat. 40Â°N it was visible only in the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. Oppolzer numbers this one 2396, and dates it on Oct. 8, 201 B.C., which was in the sixth year, eighth month, on the last day, kuei-wei (if Hoang's calendar is one day in error). Oppolzer calculates the sun in long. 191.6Â° = 190.7Â° R.A. The magnitude of this eclipse was calculated for Ch'ang-an and was found to have reached only 0.02, at 7:44 a.m. local time, so that it was practically invisible there; at the present Pei-p'ing its magnitude however reached 0.28 at 8:26 a.m., local time, so that this eclipse might have been reported from the east. Oppolzer's solar eclipse no. 2400, on Aug. 18, 199 B.C. seemed also visible in China, but calculation showed that it was invisible in any part of China and even in the present Canton. The eclipse of 201 B.C. might have been the one intended by this recording, although it is not easy to explain the discrepancy of the cyclical day. The SC does not record any of the three eclipses that the HS lists in the reign of Kao-tsu. Pan Ku thus inserted them into the account of events given in the SC from some other source. Some astronomer who edited the list of eclipses thus used by Pan Ku might have given an illegibly dated eclipse the next possible date for an eclipse after the first and legibly dated solar eclipse. But two solar eclipses at successive new moons can happen only when two small eclipses occur in different (northern and southern) hemispheres. Since however the Han-chi does not have this eclipse, it seems more likely that some person of the third or later centuries interpolated this eclipse for a time when he knew that an eclipse might have happened, in order to emphasize the gravity of the period. In June/July of this year, Kao-tsu barely escaped with his life from the siege of Jung-yang. The location in the heavens given for this eclipse does not agree with anything we can calculate. It must have been calculated from the date of the year given to this eclipse, for it is about 28 Chinese degrees after the preceding one. iii. In the ninth year, the sixth month, on the day yi-wei, the last day of the month, a third solar eclipse is recorded (1B: 14b). This date was Aug. 7, 198 B.C.; Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2402 for that date. HS 27 Cb: 13a adds, "It was 13 degrees in [the constellation] Chang," whose stars then ranged from 118.6Â° to 133Â° R.A. Oppolzer calculates the sun as at long. 129.4Â° = 131.9Â° R.A. There is thus a very close checking between observation and calculation here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">167 CHAPTERS II and III INTRODUCTION These two chapters give an account of the chief events during the time that the government was in control of the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼, the wife of Emperor Kao-tsu. Chapter II treats of the period when her son, Emperor Hsiao-hui, was on the throne and chapter III of the period after his death when she openly took control. These chapters, like chapter I, are largely based on the corresponding chapter in the SC, chapter IX. Pan Ku, however, added some new material; he seems to have had available a collection of imperial edicts and possibly an official annalistic chronicle, upon which he drew. The SC puts this material into one chapter; Pan Ku divides it into two because there were two rulers. Pan Ku furthermore has transferred into his "Memoirs" the more sensational stories given in the SC, seemingly because he felt that these accounts concerned the private lives of the actors, rather than their public acts. Thus he has left in these "Annals" only the bare mention of Liu Ju-yi's death and that of Liu Yu, and has said nothing about the Empress's treatment of the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i. Concerning the attempted assassination of Liu Fei, he mentions only its administrative result. He gives those accounts in full in his "Memoir of the Imperial Relatives by Marriage" and the "Memoir of the Five Kings who were Sons of Kao-tsu." Thus Pan Ku seems to have conceived of the "Annals" as chronicles properly devoted to the official acts of the ruler and the important events of the reign, rather than as an attempt to give in full an account of the period. Such an account must be gathered from the mine of material in the remainder of this encyclopedic history. This period of fifteen years constituted a period of rest and recuperation after the fighting and destruction preceding the reign of Kao-tsu and the civil war during it. The only serious conflict was an internal one, which did not come to a head until the very end of the period. Kao-tsu had eliminated all his important feudal kings except those of his own family, so that during this period there were no revolts, such as had plagued him. Peace was made with the only important external enemy, the Huns, and it was cemented by sending a girl of the imperial family 168CHAPTERS II &amp; III to be a bride of the Hun emperor, the Shan-yÃ¼. There was only one warâwith the state of Nan-yÃ¼eh, located at the present Canton; but the mountains proved such a barrier that the war was confined to border forays, and the Chinese generals did not even try to cross the mountains. Thus the people secured a rest, the population could increase, and the country became prosperous. The Chancellor of State, Hsiao Ho, who had administered Kao-tsu's empire, died in the second year of this period. He nominated Kao-tsu's greatest fighter, Ts'ao Ts'an, as his successor, thus emphasizing the tradition that since the empire had been conquered by Kao-tsu's personal followers, it should be ruled by them. This tradition was followed as long as any capable followers of Kao-tsu remained alive and was the factor that prevented the overturn of the state. Liu Ying, known as Emperor Hsiao-hui, proved a kindly but weak young man. He was only in his sixteenth year when he came to the throne, and the real power went to his mother, then entitled the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼. She had taken an active part in the conquest of the empire, had suffered severely in that contest, and had gathered around her a faction, chiefly composed of members of the LÃ¼ family (including two of her older brothers who had been generals of Kao-tsu and had been ennobled by him as marquises) and of her relatives by marriage, especially the valiant Fan K'uai, who had married her younger sister, the able and determined LÃ¼ HsÃ¼. This faction ennabled the Empress Dowager to enthrone her son, although he was not the oldest nor the favorite son of Kao-tsu. The oldest son was Liu Fei, who had been made King of Ch'i, the most important part of the empire next to Kuan-chung. But Liu Fei was not the son of Kao-tsu's wife, and so could be passed over. Since the Empress Dowager had only barely succeeded in enthroning her son, she felt driven to cultivate the interests of the people in order to bolster up her power. Hence, although she committed grave crimes, she proved a good ruler. She could not afford the unpopularity of misrule and was too intelligent to indulge in it. She lightened the taxes and removed some of the severe punishments that had been inherited from the Ch'in dynasty, repealing, for example, the Ch'in law against the possession of proscribed books. She allowed the commutation of punishments, even of capital punishment, for money payment, which, in those days of severe and harsh punishments, was a lightening of penalties rather than an invitation to the wealthy to commit crime. The most serious crimes were not commuted. But she came into conflict with her son the Emperor when she attempted 169INTRODUCTION to take vengeance upon her rival. She imprisoned closely in the Palace the favorites of her husband, especially the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i, who had almost succeeded in displacing her as Empress. The Empress Dowager wanted a keener revenge, but dared do nothing more as long as the Lady's son was alive. This ten-year-old boy, Liu Ju-yi, Kao-tsu's favorite child, had been made King of Chao with a capable and brave Chancellor to guard him. When this Chancellor would not send the boy to the capital, the Empress Dowager removed the Chancellor and had the boy brought. But he was a favorite of the Emperor too, so the sixteen year old Emperor met his half-brother at a village ten miles from the capital and carefully conducted him to his own apartments, where he guarded him by always keeping him by his side. After several months, one morning early the Emperor went out hunting, leaving Ju-yi sleeping. The Empress Dowager immediately had her step-son poisoned. The Emperor could do nothing to his own mother, not even for murder. Then the Empress Dowager had the dead boy's mother, the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i, terribly mutilated and thrown out into the gully through which ran the sewer, naming her "the Human Swine." She took her son to see her mutilated rival; he did not recognize the poor lady; when an attendant informed him of her identity, the Emperor wept himself into a nervous breakdown. For a year he could not leave his bed. When he recovered, he sent this message to his mother: "Your deed was utterly inhuman. I am your son, so I cannot again govern the country." Then he gave himself over to drinking, to women, and to pleasure. The next year Liu Fei came to court. At a family dinner the Emperor seated Fei above himself, as befitted the oldest brother. The Empress Dowager became angry and ordered two goblets of poisoned wine for Fei. Then she commanded him to drink a toast. But the Emperor took one of the goblets to drink; without a descendant on the throne the Empress Dowager would have been helpless; she hastily arose and upset her son's goblet. Then Fei took alarm and left. He feared for his life, but found that the Empress Dowager had merely acted in a fit of anger; so he made his peace with her by presenting her daughter, Kao-tsu's oldest child, the Princess YÃ¼an of Lu, with a commandery and appointing this step-sister as his Queen Dowager. Emperor Hui died in the seventh year of his rule. The Empress Dowager had married him to the daughter of Princess YÃ¼an. Such a union was quite proper, since the girl had a surname different from that of her husband. But she had no child. The Emperor had however had a son by a lady of his harem; the Empress Dowager named this babe 170CHAPTERS II &amp; III the son of the Empress and killed his mother. The babe was made Heir-apparent and was enthroned as Emperor. Since he was her grandson, and the Empress was her granddaughter, the Empress Dowager herself boldly took the Emperor's place in court and issued imperial decrees and edicts in her own name. Then she strengthened her position by appointing four of her nephews from the LÃ¼ family as kings, and, to forestall trouble over the succession, if anything should happen to the babe, she took six babes of the LÃ¼ family and named them marquises, asserting that they were children of Emperor Hui. This action brought her into conflict with one of the established practises of the dynasty, which was after her death to prove stronger than she. Kao-tsu had gathered his immediate followers and made them swear a solemn oath in a ceremony in which a white horse had been killed and the lips of each had been smeared with the blood. This oath was to the effect that no one except members of the imperial Liu family should be made king and no one should be made marquis except for deeds of valor. Kao-tsu had taken this step when he was plagued by the rebellions of those vassal kings not members of the imperial clan; but he had himself violated this oath in the appointment of his boyhood and close friend, Lu Wan, as King of Yen. The Empress Dowager's important officials had all been followers of Kao-tsu and had taken this oath; yet they respected her ability and recognized that she had materially assisted in winning the empire, so that she also was one of the followers of Kao-tsu; these facts and the power of the LÃ¼ faction kept the officials from making any overt move against her. The Senior Lieutenant Chancellor, Wang Ling, protested in private, but he was promoted to an advisory post which left him powerless. The Empress Dowager thus succeeded in establishing herself firmly in control. She had a committee of the high officials and nobles arrange the precedence of the nobles in the court, thus increasing the prestige of her faction. In 184 B.C. the child emperor learned of his real mother. Boy-like he boasted, "The Empress could have killed my mother and pass me as her son. I am not yet grown up, but when I am grown up, I will change things." Such a threat to the Empress Dowager's power could not be tolerated; the child was pronounced insane, imprisoned to death in the palace prison, and the ministers were ordered to suggest his successor. They knew that he was the only natural son of Emperor Hui; in seeming deference to the Empress Dowager but in real unwillingness to be a party to her action they replied merely that they accepted her orders. She then selected one of the six babes she had previously named 171INTRODUCTION as marquises and sons of Emperor Hui and appointed him Emperor. The ministers said nothing; this appointment was not their work; they consequently felt free to overturn it later. In order to consolidate her power, the Empress Dowager had married some of Kao-tsu's sons to girls of her family, the LÃ¼. One of them, Yu, did not love his wife and favored a concubine; he was slandered to the Empress Dowager as having said that after her death he would attack the LÃ¼ family. She summoned him to the capital and starved him to death in his lodgings. Another son, K'uei, was so oppressed by his wife, a LÃ¼ girl, who poisoned his beloved concubine, that he committed suicide. A third, Chien, died; the Empress Dowager sent to have his son killed and end his kingdom. There were left now only two out of the eight sons of Kao-tsu, only three of whom had died a natural death. The Empress Dowager knew she could not live much longer; to perpetuate her clan's power she appointed her two nephews, LÃ¼ Ch'an and LÃ¼ Lu, the first as Chancellor of State, in charge of the civil government, and the second as First Ranking General, in charge of the military. To placate the Liu faction, she appointed its head, Liu Tse, a venerable cousin of Kao-tsu, as King of Lang-ya, and gave royal posthumous titles to Kao-tsu's mother, older brother, and older sister. Thus she prepared for the inevitable. In March/April 181, as the Empress Dowager was returning to the capital from a religious ceremony in the suburbs, she was bitten in the side by a dog, which immediately disappeared. When she was brought back to the Palace, the diviner brought the response, "It is the ghost of Ju-yi, become an evil spirit." The wound probably became infected; she died on August 18. By a testamentary edict she made grants to the nobles, generals, and officials, leaving the government in charge of her two nephews. Revolution arose immediately. There had been much criticism of the Empress Dowager; one portent after another had been noted. Twelve days after the death of Liu Yu there had been an eclipse total at the capital, and the Empress Dowager was said to have declared, "This is on my account." Those of Kao-tsu's personal followers, such as the famous Lu Chia, who had been unable to stomach the Empress Dowager's rule and had retired to their estates, returned to the capital to readjust matters. The Lieutenant Chancellor Ch'en P'ing and the Grand Commandant Chou P'o were both old friends of Lu Chia. They had all been companions of Kao-tsu and had taken the oath. They were ready to eliminate the LÃ¼ faction, for they owed their positions to having been followers of Kao-tsu even more than to the favor of the Empress Dowager. 172CHAPTERS II &amp; III They were actively aided by the Liu faction, composed of the Liu family and its adherents. Overt action was taken by the King of Ch'i, who was the eldest son of Liu Fei, the eldest son of Kao-tsu. He mobilized his army and tricked Liu Tse into aiding him. Kuan Ying, one of Kao-tsu's best generals, was sent against the rebels; but Kuan Ying had also taken the oath. He went half-way and encamped, sending word to the King of Ch'i that he would later join him. Thus the LÃ¼ power crumbled. Kao-tsu's followers in the capital meanwhile conspired to overthrow the LÃ¼, with Chou P'o and Ch'en P'ing at their head. They had a friend of LÃ¼ Lu point out to him that the appointment of nine kings from the Liu family and three kings from the LÃ¼ family had been quite legal, since it had been done after deliberation by the high officials and with the concurrence of the kingsâthat thus the imperial power was not absolute, but was limited by the consent of the high ministers and the highest nobles. He was told that if the LÃ¼ promptly surrendered their power and retired to their estates, they would not be molested; but if not, they would be suspected of rebellion and proceeded against. LÃ¼ Lu saw the correctness of this reasoning and agreed, but he had to submit the matter to his clan, and so action was postponed. On September 26 the defection of Kuan Ying was reported to LÃ¼ Ch'an. The bureaucracy was so honeycombed with conspirators that word of this news was immediately taken to Chou P'o. LÃ¼ Lu was promptly tricked into giving up control of the army; the troops unanimously declared for the Liu faction, and LÃ¼ Ch'an, seemingly the only able man among the LÃ¼ faction, was killed. The next day the whole LÃ¼ clan was massacred. Thus the power of the Empress Dowager collapsed like a house of cards within six weeks after her death. Then the high officials and heads of the Liu clan met and chose as the next emperor the oldest surviving son of Kao-tsu, whose reputation and that of his wife's family were better than that of the King of Ch'i. In this manner the first threat to the House of Liu from members of clans allied by marriage was removed by the action of Kao-tsu's loyal followers. The House of Liu was securely fixed on the throne and its continuation secured. It is interesting that this House was finally overthrown by another clan whose power likewise came from intermarriage with the royal house. 173 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter II THE SECOND [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [Emperor Hsiao-]Hui1 1 The SC includes the events of this emperor's reign in its chapter devoted to the Empress LÃ¼, whereas the HS pursues the more logical course of giving each emperor a separate chapter. Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768), referring to this difference, says of the HS, "In rectitude and in [its] principles it is most correct." Emperor Hsiao-hui was the Heir-apparent of [Emperor] Kao-tsu. His mother was called the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼.2 2 For names of persons, places, and official titles, cf. the "Glossary of Names". When Emperor [Hsiao-hui] was in his fifth 206 B.C. year, Kao-tsu first became King of Hans. In [Kao-tsu's] second year [the future Emperor Hsiao-hui] was 205 B.C. established as Heir-apparent; in the twelfth year, 195 B.C. the fourth month, Kao-tsu died. June 15 5 HS 1 B; 23a. In the fifth month, on [the day] ping-yin,3 3 This date was June 23, 195 B.C., 22 days after his predecessor's death, the same day as that on which his predecessor was buried. the Heir-apparent June 23 took the imperial throne. He honored the Empress, entitling her, the Empress Dowager. He granted to the common people one step in noble rank.4 4 At the accession of an emperor, favors were generously bestowed. This was not the first time, as Shen Ch'in-han thought, that aristocratic ranks were given to the common people, for they had previously been bestowed in 206 B.C. Cf. 1A: 30b. These ranks were probably awarded to the heads of families. In 262 B.C., when Chao ShÃªng received his territory, according to the Chan-kuo Ts`e (iii cent. B.C.), section on Chao, chap. 21, he granted to all the officials an increase of three steps in rank and to the common people who could gather together, to each family he granted six catties of gold. (But SC 43: 35a, in repeating this story, tells that he granted to the officials and people three steps in rank and to the officials and people who were able to maintain peace among themselves six catties of gold. Cf. Mh V, 118.) Kao-tsu had given to all his soldiers at least the fifth rank (cf. 1B: 5a). The first rank was Official Patrician , cf. Mh II, 528, 1Â°; Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, p. 62. 174HSIAO-HUI 195 B.C. The Gentlemen-of-the-Household and the Gentle- 2:1a men-of-the-Palace [who had served] six full years [were granted] three steps in noble rank; [those who had served] four years [were granted] two steps. The Gentlemen-outside-the-Household [who had served] six full years [were granted] two steps. 1b Gentlemen-of-the-Household who had not [served] a full year [were granted] one step. Gentlemen-outside-the-Household who had not [served] two full 2a years were granted ten thousand cash.1 1 Very possibly the edict went on to award proportionate advancements in rank for other periods of service. At this time, according to this edict, 10,000 cash is counted as worth less than one step in rank, whereas in 18 B.C. a step in rank could be purchased for 1000 cash. Cf. HS 10: 10a. Enunchs2 2 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) says that these eunuchs were hun-szu , door-keepers and eunuchs. The Chou-li (Biot. trans. I, 150-153) tells that the hun-jen were doorkeepers and the szu-jen were eunuchs in charge of the imperial women. Cf. 19A: 16b, 17a. and Masters of the Food [were treated] the same as Gentlemen-of-the-Palace.3 3 In view of the high dignity of these two officials and of the fact that they served in the inner apartments, Su YÃ¼ (fl. 1913) suggests that the words, "Gentlemen-of-the-Palace, lang-chung" should be interchanged and we should read, "Gentlemen-of-theHousehold, chung-lang." Palace Internuncios, Guards, Spear-bearers, Men of War, and Grooms [were treated] the same as Gentlemen-outside-the-Household. The Heir-apparent's [Chariot-]driver and his Chariot-companion were granted the aristocratic rank of Fifth [Rank] Grandee; the members of his suite [who had served] five full years were given two steps. There were granted to those who had provided for the [imperial] burial ceremonies and [had positions ranking as] two thousand piculs, twenty thousand cash; [to those who had positions ranking as] six hundred piculs and over, ten thousand [cash]; to [those who had positions ranking as] five hundred piculs, two 175HSIAO-HUI 2:2a hundred piculs, and under, [down] to the Accessory 195 B.C. Officials, five thousand [cash]. Of those who had superintended digging [the late Emperor's] grave,1 1 Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) and Ju Shun (fl. dur. 221-265) say that means to open up the earth for a tomb. The Official ed. (1739) emends shang to t'u ; but Chang Chao (d. 1745) says that the Academy ed. (1124) and Sung Ch'i's ed. (xi or xii cent.) read shang. He says that Fu Ch'ien's and Ju Shun's comments show that the text originally read t'u. Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) however argues that probably at that time there was a current expression using shang. the generals [were granted the equivalent2 2 Mr. Cheng (fl. dur. 265-317) says that means . Cf. p. 111, n. 3. Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) remarks, "This speaks of . . . the equivalent of gold. In later [passages], whenever it says huang-chin , [it means] actual gold. When it does not say huang, it means cash. HS ch. 24 says that a catty of actual gold was worth 10,000 cash." Then a gift of huang-chin means actual gold, whereas a gift of chin means so many times 10,000 cash. Yen Shih-ku (581-645) agrees with the foregoing interpretation, but Liu Pin (10221088) says, "I say that whenever any book says so much chin, one chin is 10,000 cash; when there is [made] a grant of so many catties of chin, it is entirely of [actual] gold." We have adopted the earlier interpretation. of] forty [catties] of gold, [those who had the rank of] two 2b thousand piculs [were granted the equivalent of] twenty [catties of] gold, [those who had the rank of] six hundred piculs and above [were granted the equivalent of] six [catties of] gold, those [who had the rank of] five hundred piculs and less, down to the Accessory Officials [were granted the equivalent of] two [catties of] gold. [The Emperor] reduced the tax on arable ground and revived it [at the rate of] one part in fifteen.3 3 Teng Chan (fl. ca. 208) writes, "In the beginning, the Han dynasty taxed [at the rate of] one-fifteenth [cf. 24A: 9b], less than the Chou [dynasty's] tax of one-tenth; in the mean time [the land tax] had been abolished, now it was revived." Those who had the aristocratic rank of Fifth [Rank] 176HSIAO-HUI 195 B.C. Grandee, and officials [ranking as] six hundred piculs 2:2b and above, together with those who had served the [young] emperor so that he knew their names, if they had committed crimes, and should justly be shackled like robbers, they were all to be put in honorable detention.1 1 The shackles were boards which held together the hands and feet of prisoners. Ju Shun says, " means that they should be treated leniently and should be merely made to live in the residences of Division Heads and not enter the goal." Shen Ch'in-han however says, "This `honorable detention' is the T'ang [dynastic] Code's , it does not mean that they do not have to go to prison." According to 23: 19b, in 145 B. C., Emperor Ching ordered that people over the eightieth and under the eighth year of age, together with pregnant women, blind musicians, and dwarfs, who must be held for criminal examination, should also be given "honorable detention." In 97 A. D. Emperor Ho established a special office for the criminal examination of Lieutenant Chancellors and high ministers. In a note to 23: 19b, Yen Shih-ku interprets "honorable detention" as "without the boards that hold together [a criminal's] hands and his feet ." Those of [the aristocratic 3a rank of] Superior Accomplished and above,2 2 Superior Accomplished was the second rank in the honorary hierarchy, next to the lowest; the fifteenth rank (from the bottom) was called the Somewhat Superior Accomplished and the sixteenth the Greatly Superior Accomplished ; Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) thinks the sixteenth rank is meant here; Yen Shih-ku (581-645) thinks the second rank is meant. together with the great-grandsons3 3 Chang Yen says that are descendants of marquises or kings of the imperial house. is pronounced, according to Yen Shih-ku, jen1-sun, the first word being pronounced jen2 . Chin Shao (fl. 275) says that it is the great-grandson of the greatgreat-grandson, i.e., the eighth generation of descent (counting the person from whom descent is counted as the first generation). In HS 12: 10a, however, Liu Yin is said to have been made King of Liang because he was a jen1-sun of a great-great-grandson of King Hsiao of Liang whereas 14: 12a and 47: 11a both say he was a great-grandson of a great-great-grandson of King Hsiao. HS 12:2b speaks of the appointment of Emperor HsÃ¼an's jen1-sun and 99 A: 19b says plainly that they were his great-grandsons. The ancestry of Liu Hsin in 15 A: 5a confirms this statement. Yen Shih-ku says that in every instance the HS means great-grandson by jen-sun. The term is also used in HS 94 A: 32b. According to the Erh-ya (written before Han times, added to in Han times), the jen2-sun is however the eighth generation in descent. Yen Shih-ku thinks that because the pronunciation of these two words jen is similar, the two phrases jen-sun mean the same. But others disagree. Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) says that jen1-sun is the sixth generation. Li Fei (prob. iii cent.) says it was the fourth generation. of marquises or kings belonging to the imperial house by male or female descent who had committed crimes and should justly [suffer] mutilating punishment, together 177HSIAO-HUI 2:3a with those who should justly be made 195 B.C. to [build] the fortifications or [patrol from] the break of day or pound [rice], were all to have their whiskers shaved and be made to [cut] firewood for the spirits or [prepare] pure rice.1 1 The five "mutilating punishments" were: tatooing on the face, amputation of the nose, amputation of the feet, castration, and capital punishment. The punishment of [building] the fortifications or [patrolling from] the break of day consisted, according to Ying Shao, in "rising early in the morning and patrolling or building the fortifications. . . . It was a four year punishment." Cf. Chavannes, Documents chinois decouverts, p. 63. According to Ying Shao, "Females were not employed in outside work, but were made to pound [the husks off of] rice. It was a four year punishment." Cf. Chavannes, ibid. For the punishment of shaving the whiskers, cf. p. 118, n. 1. Ying Shao tells that the punishment of "spiritual firewood" consisted in "gathering firewood for the ancestral temple. . . . It was a three year punishment." Ying Shao also says, "Sitting and selecting rice to make it pure white [for use in offerings at the ancestral temple] is [preparing] pure rice . It is a three year punishment." Evidently it was for women, just as "spiritual firewood" was for men. The Han-chiu-yi, written by Wei Hung (fl. 25-57) B: 9b contains the following: "All who have committed crimes, if male, have their heads shaved, wear an iron collar, and are made to [work on] the fortifications in the morningâto [work on] the fortifications or [patrol] from the break of day is to build the fortifications. Females are made to poundâto pound is to prepare [unhulled] rice; both serve for five years; those who are not mutilated [serve] four years. [Cutting] firewood for the spirits is for three years. Of those who [are sentenced to cut] firewood for the spirits, the males cut down the firewood and twigs on the mountains for the sacrifices to the spirits and divinities; the females who are [sentenced] to [make] pure rice, pick over the rice for the sacrifices; both serve for three years. When the punishment is to work as a robber guard, the robber guard, if male, stands on guard; if female, she works. As a robber guard, both serve for two years. Males are [also] made to serve in frontier garrisons at hard labor and females are made to do labor in the official buildings; both serve for one year." Common people who are in their seventieth year or over or not fully ten years old, who had committed crimes and should justly [suffer] mutilating punishment, were not to be mutilated.2 2 Mutilating punishments (cf. above) all involved some bodily mutilation; the aged and children were not to be punished thus. Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C. to A.D. 83) in a note on the Chou-li 35: 33a, Autumn, Chang-lu, says, "Not to be mutilated says nevertheless that they should be held and work for three years, [but] not to have their bodies damaged." The Han-chi (ii cent.) misunderstands the text and says they should "escape" punishment. Stein found in the desert tablets indicating that certain persons were sentenced to forced labor and escaped mutilation. Cf. Chavannes, Documents chinois, p. 63. 3b 178HSIAO-HUI 195 B.C. [The edict] also said, "Officials [exist] for the sake of 2:3b governing the people. If [the officials] are able to fulfil their [duties in] government, then the people [can] rely upon them. Hence [We] make their salaries large, the reason for doing which is [for the sake of] the people. Now the fathers and mothers, the wives and children, and the other members of the families1 1 Yen Shih-ku says "The are, besides father, mother, and wives, [those persons] like older and younger brothers, together with the older and younger brothers' children." of officials who have [the rank] of six hundred piculs or above, together with the former officials who have in the past worn the seal of a General or of a Chief Commandant2 2 According to HS 5: 6a, only in 148 B.C. was the title of Chief Commandant used for the previous Commandery Commandant. In the SC, Chief Commandant is found used of a Ch'in dynasty high military official as early as 207 B.C. (cf. Mh II, 273), and it is used in the HS under the date of 167 B.C. (cf. 4: 15a) as well as here. Possibly these early uses are anachronisms. Cf. Mh II, 524, xxv. More probably Chief Commandant was the title of an army officer lower than a General and higher than a Colonel, as well as being the title of a regular official in the commandery hierarchy. and have led troops, or have worn the seal of an official [with the rank of] two thousand piculsâtheir families shall pay only the military tax and shall not be required to pay any other [taxes]." [The Emperor] ordered the commanderies and the vassal kings to establish temples to Kao-[tsu].3 3 Previously the vassal kings had been ordered to establish temples to Kao-tsu's father (1B: 15b). Now the Han dynasty was attempting to unify the empire by giving it a common religion. The commanderies and kingdoms likewise established temples for the other emperors of the dynasty; we hear of a temple to the Emperor Wen in Lin-chiang; cf. 5: 6a. I In the first year,4 4 Years are counted from the first New Year's day after the emperor takes his throne. The remainder of the preceding year is counted as still belonging to his predecessor. Cf. 9: n. 1.1. in the winter, the twelfth 194 B.C. month, King Yin of Chao, [Liu] Ju-yi, died.5 5 He was poisoned by his step-mother. The HS relegates this story to the "Memoir of the Imperial Relatives by Marriage," 97 A: 4a, and is here content to chronicle the bare fact of his death. Cf. Mh II, 409 f. The HS does not seem to have any fixed practise about referring to persons by their names or by their posthumous titles, sometimes using one and sometimes the other. In this translation, a posthumous name (such as Yin) will be preceded by the title of the person's rank (such as King); a personal name (such as Ju-yi) will be preceded by the person's surname. 179HSIAO-HUI, Year I 2:3b [The Emperor ordered1 1 Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) argues that this sentence should be preceded by the word ling , just as in the similar passage in 1B: 12a. For the meaning of ling, cf. 8: n. 11.2. Yen Shih-ku's comment contains this word, showing that it was in his text. The T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983), "Feng-chien," section 1, quotes this imperial order but without the ling. The old ed. (prob. Sung period) of the Pei-t'ang Shu-ts'ao (ca. 618), "Feng-chio," last section, quotes this order with the ling, although Ch'en YÃ¼-mo's ed. (1600) deletes it. that] when the common 194 B.C. Jan. people commit crime, they are to be allowed to purchase thirty steps in noble rank in order to avoid capital punishment.2 2 Ying Shao writes, "Each step cost 2000 cash, [so that capital punishment could be ransomed by paying] altogether 60,000 cash, like the present ransoming of crime by paying 30 bolts of fine close-woven silk." Possibly this value for noble ranks was only for the purpose of ransoming crime, for in the previous year a single step was worth more than 10,000 cash. Cf. p. 174, n. 1; also 10: n. 10. 2. Or else Ying Shao is guessing. This order does not allow the actual purchase of aristocratic ranks, but merely the commutation of capital punishment for a large money payment. He granted to the common 4a people noble ranks, in each household one step [in rank]. In the spring, the first month, the city wall of Feb. Ch'ang-an was [partly] built.3 3 Hu San-hsing (1230-1287) says, "The Han [dynasty] made its capital at Ch'ang-an. Altho Hsiao Ho had built the palaces and halls there, there had not yet been leisure to build a city wall. Emperor [Hui] began building it, and it was only finished in his fifth year [190 B.C.]." The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) says, "At first the northeast quarter of the wall was built." It is interesting that the edict allowing the building of city walls was issued in 202 B.C. (cf. 1B: 7b), but the city wall of the capital was not begun until 194 B.C. HS 16: 62a says that the Privy Treasurer Yang-ch'eng Yen built the Ch'ang-lo and Wei-yang palaces and the Ch'ang-an city wall. In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, II King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei2], came to court [to Nov./Dec. pay his respects]. He presented the Ch'eng-yang Commandery to be added to the estate of the Princess YÃ¼an of Lu, and honored the Princess, appointing 180HSIAO-HUI, Year II 192 B.C. 193 B.C. her as his Queen Dowager.1 1 She was the step-sister of King Tao-hui, and was older than he. The Empress Dowager LÃ¼ had tried to poison her step-son, King Tao-hui. His Prefect of the Capital had advised him to placate her by presenting some territory and this title to her daughter, the Princess YÃ¼an. Since a Dowager practically controls her son, King Tao-hui was thus putting himself and his property largely under the control of the Empress Dowager LÃ¼'s daughter as well as flattering her. According to 32: 9a, b, "In 187 B.C., the Dowager Queen YÃ¼an of Lu died and the sixth year after the Marquis of HsÃ¼an-p'ing, [Chang] Ao, [her husband], also died. The Empress Dowager [nee] LÃ¼ made the son of [Chang] Ao, [Chang] Yen, the King of Lu, [instead of merely making him a marquis], because his mother had been a Dowager Queen [of Ch'i]." The account of these intrigues is given in the SC (cf. Mh II, 411) and in HS 38: 1b, hence the HS does not feel it necessary to do more here than merely mention its administrative result. According to later Chinese conceptions, it was quite improper for a king to make his half-sister his Queen Dowager, for that meant he was treating her as his mother, whereas she was of the same generation as he. Emperor Hsiao-hui was married by his mother to the daughter of his own full sister (cf. 2: 5a), which is also improper, according to those conceptions, for this girl was also of a different generation (cf. Mh II, 413, n. 1). But in ancient times, while a man normally married only girls of the same generation as himself, it was the custom among the highest classes of the nobility to marry also one niece, who was the daughter of one's oldest maternal first cousin, and hence was of the generation following that of her husband. Cf. Granet, Chinese Civilization, p. 339. The rule of generations was regularly disregarded in the Han period; Emperors HsÃ¼an and Ch'eng both married cousins of a different generation than they, so that King Tao-hui's appointment of his older half-sister as his mother may have also been in accord with the conceptions of his time, altho it was out of accord with conceptions current later. 2:4a 4b In the spring, the first month, on [the day] kuei-yu, Feb. 20 there were two dragons seen at Lan-ling in the well of a common citizen.2 2 The text writes ; Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) says the words should be interchanged, to read as they are written in the Han-chi (ii cent.). HS 27 Ca: 16a writes, "There were two dragons seen at Lan-ling, in the T'ing-tung hamlet, in the [family] well of Wan Ling." On the evening of [the day] Feb. 22 yi-hai, they disappeared. In the Lung-hsi [Commandery] Summer there was an earthquake.3 3 HS 27 Ca: 9a says it crushed more than 400 people. In the summer there was a drought. The Marquis of Ho-yang, [Liu] Chung, died. In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-wei, Aug. 16 the Chancellor of State, [Hsiao] Ho, died. III In the third year, in the spring, there were sent 181HSIAO-HUI, Year III 2:4b from [the region] within six hundred li of Ch'ang-an, 192 B.C. 192 B.C. 146,000 [persons], male and female, to build the city Spring wall of Ch'ang-an. In thirty days they were dismissed.1 1 Mr. Cheng (fl. dur. 265-317) says they finished one side of the city wall. A girl of the imperial house was made a Princess and given in marriage to the Shan-yÃ¼ of the Huns. In the summer, the fifth month, [the Emperor] June made the Baronet of Min-yÃ¼eh, [Tsou] Yao, the King of Tung-hai.2 2 In 1B: 4a, b, Tsou Wu-chu is made King of Min-yÃ¼eh. In the sixth month, from the [states of] the vassal 5a kings and marquises, 20,000 criminals and retainers July were sent to build the city wall of Ch'ang-an.3 3 Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) remarks, "The distances of the vassal kingdoms [from the capital] were different, hence beforehand in the sixth month, these [people] were mobilized, causing each [group] to arrive at the [appointed] time. The building of the city wall was done in the spring, the first month, as previously." In the autumn, the seventh month, there was a Aug. visitation [of fire] in the [imperial] stables at the capital.4 4 The text uses . The Shuo-wen (ca. 100) defines it as , "a fire [started by] Heaven." HS 27A: 6b writes, "A fire [started by] human agencies is called a fire; a fire [started by] natural [or spiritual] means is called a visitation. , ." Fires, floods, droughts, and sickness are now all called visitations . Etymologically this word means "fire." The San-fu Huang-t'u (iii to vi cent.) says, "The stables at the capital were the places where the emperor's carriages and horses [were kept]." The King of Nan-yÃ¼eh, Chao T'o, pronounced himself a subject [of the Emperor] and presented tribute.5 5 He had been enfeoffed by Kao-tsu; now that Kao-tsu was dead, he renewed his allegiance to the new emperor. He revolted soon after the death of Hsiao-hui. Cf. 95: 10a, b. In the fourth year, in the winter, the tenth month, IV 182HSIAO-HUI, Year IV 192 B.C. Nov. 10 on [the day] jen-yin, [the Emperor] established the 2:5a 191 B.C. Empress nee Chang [as Empress].1 1 For Liu Hsiang's reaction, cf. 27 A: 10b. Jan./Feb. In the spring, the first month, common people who were filially pious, fraternally respectful and [diligent] cultivators of the fields were recommended and their persons exempted [from taxes and forced service]. Apr. 1 In the third month, on [the day] chia-tzu, the Emperor was capped and [an amnesty was granted] to the world.2 2 Hsiao-hui was then in his twentieth year. Capping was a ceremony performed when a youth came of age. Wang Ming-sheng (1722-1797) notes that in 141 B.C. the boy who became Emperor Wu was capped in his 16th year; in 77 B.C. Emperor Chao was capped in his 18th year; HS 11: 1b records that Emperor Ai was capped in his 17th year; according to 12: 10a Emperor P'ing died in his 14th year and was capped when being dressed for burial. Wang Ming-sheng adds, "In ancient times emperors and nobles were all capped in their 12th year. After they had been capped they begot children. At the beginning of the Han [period] the classics were lost and incomplete, and there was no plain passage about the rites for the capping of the Son of Heaven, hence [that ceremony] had no definite time." However, after the classics were recovered, the Han emperors seem to have been just as irregular as formerly in performing this ceremony. Probably in Han times there was no definite age for capping the heirs apparent. In reducing the laws and orders which annoyed the officials and people, there was abrogated the criminal law against possessing books.3 3 The criminal law now abrogated was the famous decree of the Ch'in First Emperor which ordered that anyone concealing books should be executed together with his three sets of relatives. There was a visitation [of fire] in the Wild Goose Terrace in the Ch'ang-lo Palace. In Yi-yang it rained 5b blood.4 4 HS 27 Bb: 10b says that this event happened in the second year. In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the Aug. 10 day] yi-hai,5 5 This date is Aug. 10, 191 B.C., but 27 A: 10b, in narrating this event, dates it in the tenth month, which is impossible because there was no yi-hai day in that month; the Han-chi (ii cent.) puts it in the third month. there was a visitation [of fire] in the Ice Chamber of the Wei-yang Palace. On [the day] Aug. 11 ping-tzu, there was a visitation [of fire] in the Weaving Chamber. V In the fifth year, in the winter, the tenth month, 183HSIAO-HUI, Year V 2:5b it thundered. The peach and plum [trees] flowered 191 B.C. Nov./Dec. and the jujubes [produced] fruit.1 1 HS 27: Bb 1a says that laxity is punished by an unseasonably long warm spell at which time there may be plant anomalies. 190 B.C. In the spring, the first month, there were again Feb./Mar. sent from [the region] within six hundred li of Ch'ang-an 145,000 men and women to build the city wall of Ch'ang-an. In thirty days they were dismissed. In the summer there was a great drought.2 2 HS 27 Ba: 23b says that the water in the Yangtze and Yellow rivers was low and the gorges and valleys were dry. In Summer the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] chi-ch'ou, Sept. 24 the Chancellor of State, [Ts'ao] Ts'an, died.3 3 There was no chi-ch'ou day in that month. There was such a day in the 8th month of the preceding year and in the 7th and 9th months of the same year. His biographies in SC ch. 54 and HS ch. 39 do not date his death. HS 39: 12b says, "[Ts'ao] Ts'an was Chancellor of State to the third year and died." Hsiao Ho, the previous Chancellor of State, died in Hsiao-hui's second year (2: 4b), whereupon Ts'ao Ts'an was installed; three years later would be the fifth year; so that the year is corroborated. SC 22: 5a (Mh III, 189) notes the death of Ts'ao Ts'an in the 8th month on the day yi-ch'ou, which would give a date possible in the 8th month, viz. Sept. 24, 190 B.C. Chavannes (T'oung Pao, vol. 7, p. 525) approves this reading. The error of transcription involved in writing for is quite likely. In the ninth month, the city wall of Ch'ang-an Oct./Nov. was completed. [The Emperor] granted aristocratic ranks to the people, to each household one step.4 4 Yen Shih-ku remarks, "The head of the family received it." In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, VI on [the day] hsin-ch'ou,5 5 There was no hsin-ch'ou day in that month; SC 22: 5a (Mh III, 189) notes this death in the seventh month of the sixth year, the hsin-ch'ou day of which was Aug. 25, 189 B.C. I find no evidence that this was anything but a natural death. His son succeeded him; the Empress Dowager after his death merely took away some of his territory. the King of Ch'i, [Liu] Aug. 25, Fei2, died. 189. It was ordered that the people were to be allowed to sell6 6 The Official ed. (1739) writes "purchase " for the text's "sell ." noble ranks. Girls who were in their fifteenth 6a 184HSIAO-HUI, Year VI 190 B.C. Nov./Dec. year and over, up to their thirtieth [year] and who 2:6a 190 were not married were [ordered to pay as a tax] five [times the] poll-tax.1 1 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) writes, "The Kuo-yÃ¼ (iii cent. B.C.) [says], `The King of YÃ¼eh, Kou-chien, ordered that if in his state a girl was in her seventeenth year and unmarried, her parents had committed a crime, for he wished that his people would multiply abundantly.' According to the Han Code, each person paid one poll-taxâa poll-tax was 120 cash; only merchants with male or female slaves [paid] two poll-taxes. Now they were caused [to pay] five [times] the poll-tax, it was a punishment for crime." Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) however says, "A poll-tax is 127 [cash]." Liu Pin (1022-1088) remarks, "I say that `girls [being taxed] five [times] the poll-tax' does not however [imply] that they were punished all at once with this [amount]. From 15 to 30 there are five stages [of five years each]. Each stage added one poll-tax." The amount of the poll-tax in the above statements, about 120 cash, seems to have been the amount to which this tax was stabilized at the close of the Former Han and during the Later Han period; S. Kato, "A Study on the Suan-fu, the Poll-tax of the Han Dynasty," in Mem. of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko, No. 1 (1926), 51-68, comes to the conclusion that this poll-tax was 190 cash under Emperor Wu; the evidence that it was 40 cash under Emperor Wen is not of the best. 189 B.C. In the summer, the sixth month, the Marquis of July Wu-yang, [Fan] K'uai, died.2 2 The death of a mere noble is not usually mentioned in the Imperial Annals. But Fan K'uai's wife was the younger sister of the Empress Dowager, and he belonged to her faction, that of the LÃ¼ family. Hence his death was a piece of good fortune for the Liu family. The Western Market of Ch'ang-an was built and the Ao Granary was repaired. VII In the seventh year, in the winter, the tenth Nov./Dec. month, chariots, cavalry,3 3 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says, "Chariots are usually those who have been sentenced to military service and take arms, like the present frontier garrison chariots . Cavalry are usually horses which have been kept, together with the persons [who have kept them], who have been ordered to be sent [away] and sentenced to cavalry service, like the present horses for war and their [former] owners who care for them. ." and skilled soldiers were sent to go to Jung-yang, led by the Grand Commandant,4 4 According to ch. 19 and his biography, he did not secure this title until the time of Emperor Wen. Sept. 29, Kuan Ying. 192 In the spring, the first month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, 185HSIAO-HUI, Year VII 2:6a the first day of the month, there was an 188 B.C. eclipse of the sun.1 1 For eclipses, cf. App. I. In the summer, the fifth month, 188 B.C. on [the day] ting-mao, there was an eclipse of the sun July 17 and it was total.2 2 According to Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831), the Hsi-Ching Tsa-chi (prob. vi cent.) says, "In the seventh year of Emperor Hui, in the summer, it thundered and there was an earthquake. Several thousand of the great trees on the Southern Mountains [near the capital] were all on fire, but [the fire] did not reach below them; on several tens of mou of land the grass was all scorched and yellow. More than a hundred days afterwards, people went there and got one set of dragon bones and two sets of alligator bones [fossils?]." Emperor Hui was in his twenty-third year when he died and he was buried 23 days after his death. In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] mou-yin, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Sept. 26 Palace. In the ninth month, on [the day] hsin-ch'ou, he was buried at the An Tomb. Oct. 19 In eulogy we say:3 3 Cf. p. 146, n. 8. [Emperor] Hsiao-hui, in his 6b family, cultivated the love of his relatives; in the state, he honored his Ruling Chancellors. He loved [King] Tao-[hui] of Ch'i, [Liu Fei2], and [King] Yin of Chao, [Liu Ju-yi], most dearly.4 4 These two boys were his half-brothers. He tried to protect the second by always keeping him with himself; the Empress Dowager had to wait to kill Ju-yi until Hsiao-hui was out shooting and Ju-yi was sleeping alone. When the Empress Dowager tried to poison Liu Fei by giving him two cups of poison at a feast, Hsiao-hui took one cup; the Empress Dowager upset it and thus revealed her plan. These stories are told in the SC and in HS 97A: 4a; 38: 1b. Cf. Mh II, 409 ff. His kindness and his sense of respect were both deep indeed. When he heard the admonition of Shu-sun T'ung, he was greatly dismayed.5 5 HS 43: 17a, b, 18a says, "When they were building the double passageways [which seem to have been elevated roofed passageways, cf. p. 113, n. 2] just south of the arsenal [which was near the Wei-yang Palace], as [Shu-sun] T'ung was reporting to [the Emperor] on business, he took the opportunity to ask for a word in private and said, `Why does your Majesty yourself build this double passageway? The robes and hat of Emperor Kao-[tsu, which are preserved in] the funerary chamber [at his tomb], are carried monthly [in procession] to the Temple of Kao-[tsu]. Why should his descendants climb up and travel above the [sacred] road of the ancestral temple?' Emperor Hui was dismayed and replied, `I shall quickly destroy it.' [But Shu-sun] T'ung said, `The lord of men can manifest no faults. Now it is already made and the people all know about it. I hope that your Majesty will make the Second Temple north of the Wei [River, by the tomb of Kao-tsu], and that [Kao-tsu's] robes and hat will be carried monthly [in procession] to it, thus increasing and broadening the fundamental [conception] of filial piety [underlying] the ancestral temple.' Then the Emperor promulgated an imperial edict that the [high] officials should erect the Second Temple." The point was that a gallery of the "double passageways" (q. v. in Glossary) was carried above the sacred road. When he accepted the 186HSIAO-HUI response of the Chancellor of State Ts'ao [Ts'an], he 2:6b was glad at heart.1 1 When the famous Chancellor of State, Hsiao Ho, died, he recommended Ts'ao Ts'an as his successor, even though there had been jealousy between the two. HS 39: 11b ff. says, "When [Ts'ao] Ts'an took the place of [Hsiao] Ho as Chancellor of State, in all matters there was no change or alteration; he entirely followed the agreements and regulations of [Hsiao] Ho." But he gave himself to drinking day and night. When anyone would come to talk with him, he would give them to drink before they could get started, and give them more drink whenever they showed any signs of re-opening the subject, so that they went away drunk without having had a chance to speak. His subordinates in the office behind his residence likewise fell to drinking and singing and shouting daily. Someone invited him to visit this office, but when he visited it, he too took wine, sat down, and drank, singing and shouting louder than they! He shielded those who had committed small crimes, so that there was no business done in his office. Emperor Hui was much younger than Ts'ao Ts'an, so when he wondered at his Chancellor's behavior, he sent Ts'ao Ts'an's son to remonstrate with him. But Ts'ao Ts'an became angry and had his son beaten 200 stripes for doing so. "When the time came [for him to go] to court, [the Emperor] reproved [Ts'ao] Ts'an, saying, `What sort of treatment have you given [your son], K'u? Formerly I sent him to remonstrate with you, sir.' [Ts'ao] Ts'an doffed his hat, begged [the Emperor's] pardon, and said, `When your Majesty yourself considers the deeds of the Sage Hero [Kao-tsu], how do you compare with Emperor Kao-[tsu]?' Emperor [Hsiao-hui] replied, `But how would We dare to hope [to compare Ourself with] the late Emperor?' [Ts'ao] Ts'an said, `When your Majesty considers me, [Ts'ao] Ts'an, which [of us] is the more capable, I or Hsiao Ho?' The Emperor replied, `You, sir, do not appear to be his equal.' [Ts'ao] Ts'an replied, `What your Majesty says is right. [Since] moreover Emperor Kao-[tsu] and Hsiao Ho have subjugated the world and the laws and ordinances have all been made plain, is it not right that your Majesty [sits] with unruffled garments and with folded hands while I, [Ts'ao] Ts'an, and my colleagues [merely] guard our charges, following in the way [of Kao-tsu and Hsiao Ho, taking care that we] make no slips?' Emperor Hui replied, `Good. You, sir, need not say anything more about it.' " Ts'ao Ts'an was a devotee of Lao-tzu's doctrine that the best government is the one that governs least (cf. Tao-te-ching, ch. 60, 80); he tried to give the people a relief from the overexacting government that characterized the Ch`in dynasty with its numerous laws and the period of Kao-tsu with its continual wars. He may be called a [most] generous and kindly ruler. He happened [upon a time when the state was ruled by] the Empress Dowager 187HSIAO-HUI 2:6b [nÃ©e] LÃ¼, who damaged and injured his perfect virtue.1 1 The historian is thinking of the murder of the Emperor's beloved half-brother, Liu Ju-yi, and the terrible revenge wreaked upon Ju-yi's mother, the Lady nÃ©e Ch'i, by the Dowager Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼. When the Emperor's mother called him to see his mutilated step-mother, he did not recognize her; when he was informed who she was, he wept abundantly and became ill for more than a year (possibly he had a "nervous breakdown"), and sent people to say to his mother, the Empress Dowager, "This is an inhuman deed. I am your son, [but, because of you] I am not able to rule the empire [rightly]." Then he gave himself up to drinking and debauchery and did not pay any attention to government. Cf. Mh II, 410. This story is told in 97A: 4b; it was perhaps the worst deed of the Empress Dowager. It was sad indeed. 7a 188 CHAPTER II Appendix THE ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR HUI i. During these seven years, two eclipses were recorded. In the seventh year, the first month, on the day hsin-ch'ou, the first day of the month, the first of these eclipses is recorded (2: 6a). This date corresponds to Feb. 21, 188 B.C. HS 27 Cb: 13a adds, "It was 13 degrees in [the constellation] Wei1"' whose stars were then in R.A. 299Â°-305Â°. The Han-chi (5: 14b) gives the cyclical day as hsin-yu, which was not the first day of that month. There was no eclipse on that date, for Oppolzer lists none. Of the 22 eclipses in the 10 years since the last previously recorded eclipse in 198 B.C. and the 4 months before the next eclipse, only 4 were visible in China.1 1 Besides those whose location Oppolzer charts, the following 3 partial eclipses were invisible because they belong to initial (i.) or terminal (t.) runs in an exeligmos series whose nearest umbral eclipse was located near the south pole: no. 2412 (t.); no. 2415 (i.); and no. 2422 (i.). In addition four partial eclipses were visible in the northern hemisphere, three of which were calculated and found invisible in the China of that date: no. 2405, no. 2413, and no. 2423. The other partial eclipse, no. 2414, on Oct. 9, 193 B. C. (24 days after a hsin-ch'ou day) was just invisible in Ch'ang-an, but visible at points north and west at sunset. In this period five umbral eclipses were visible or seemingly visible in China: (1) no. 2404, on July 26, 197 B.C., 12 days before a hsin-ch'ou day, sun in long. 118.8Â°, visible in north China; (2) no. 2408, on June 6, 195 B.C., 52 days before such a day, sun in long. 70.4Â°; (3) no. 2410, on May 26, 194 B.C., 2 days after such a day, sun in long. 60.3Â°; (4) no. 2417, on Sept. 29, 192 B.C., 41 days before such a day, sun in long. 182.1Â° = 181.9Â° R.A.; (5), no. 2420, on Mar. 14, 190 B.C.; the magnitude of this eclipse was calculated and it was found invisible in China, visible only in western and central Siberia. The fourth umbral eclipse, that of Sept. 29, 192 B.C., was very likely the one referred to in the text. This eclipse was not recorded in the SC, which was Pan Ku's chief source, so that he must have copied it from some list of eclipses. If that list was partly illegible, it is natural that Pan Ku or an editor of the list of eclipses might have misplaced this eclipse, especially as two eclipses coming close together might be understood to predict the Emperor's death. Thus this eclipse was put about one eclipse season before the next eclipse. Then the hsin-ch'ou of the text is an error for hsin-yu (a quite natural mistake), and Hoang's 189APPENDIX calendar is one day in error. Hsin-yu may indeed have been the original reading in the HS Annals, for the Han-chi today has that reading, although hsin-yu was not the first day of the month in which the eclipse is dated. HS 27 Cb: 16a says that this eclipse was on the same month and day as that of Feb. 15, 2 B.C., so that ch. 27 certainly read hsin-ch'ou. Conflation of the day in the Annals with that in ch. 27 probably came later. If we adopt this assumption, the eclipse happened in the third year, the ninth month, the first day. The location of the eclipse in the heavens is however greatly in error. ii. In the seventh year, the fifth month, on the day ting-mao, a second eclipse, which is said in the "Annals" to have been total, is recorded (2: 6a). This date was July 17, 188 B.C., on which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2425. He charts the path of totality as passing through Ning-hsia, northern Shensi, a little north of K'ai-feng, and the present Shanghai. Calculation shows that at Ch'ang-an the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.92 (sun's diameter = 1.00), at 3:12 p.m., local time. Hence the statement of the text in the "Annals" that the eclipse was total must have been taken from reports of places outside the capital. HS ch. 27 however says it was "almost total." HS 27 Cb: 13a adds that the eclipse was "in the beginning of [the constellation], the Seven Stars," whose stars ?2 and ? Hydrae were then in 114.6Â° and 114.8Â° R.A. respectively. The longitude calculated for the sun is 110.1Â° = 111.8Â° R.A. HS ch. 27 dates the eclipse on the day before the last day of the month. Hoang's calendar dates it on the last day of the month, whereas Chavannes' calendar (T'oung pao, VII, p. 25, cf. also p. 520) is a day in error in the other direction. 191 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter III THE THIRD [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of the Empress of Kao-[Tsu] The Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ of [Emperor] Kao-[tsu] gave 1a, 1b birth to Emperor Hui and assisted Kao-tsu in subjugating the empire. Her father and two older brothers1 1 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says, "Her father was the old gentleman LÃ¼, the Marquis of Lin-szu; her brothers were [LÃ¼] Tse, the Marquis of Chou-lÃ¼, and [LÃ¼] Shih-chih, the Chien-ch'eng Marquis." For names of persons, places, and official titles, cf. Glossary. were enfeoffed by Kao-tsu as marquises. When Emperor Hui took the throne, he honored the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ by making her Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager had made the daughter of the Emperor [Hui's] older sister, the Princess YÃ¼an of Lu, the Empress, [but] she had no issue. [So the Empress Dowager] took the son of a Beauty from the [imperial] harem, pronounced him [the son of the Empress] and made him Heir-apparent.2 2 Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) says," [means] to name him as a son born to the Empress." HS 27 A: 10b says, "The Empress had no issue, [but] a Beauty in the [imperial] harem had a male [child]. The Empress Dowager had the Empress name him [as her son] and killed his mother. After Emperor Hui had died and his heir had been established [as Emperor, he spoke] some resentful words, [so] the Empress Dowager dismissed him [cf. 3: 3b], and replaced him, establishing a scion of the LÃ¼ family, [LÃ¼] Hung, as the Young Emperor." The similar phrasing used in recounting the killing of a son and his mother, a concubine, which happened after King Ling of Yen died (cf. 38: 3b), proves that the first Young Emperor was the son of Emperor Hui. When Emperor Hui died, the Heir-apparent was made Emperor.3 3 In other cases, the day of an emperor's accession is given. Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) thinks that the reason that date is not given here is because the Empress Dowager's actions were tantamount to herself ascending the throne, and because the child did not himself rule, but was soon after degraded and imprisoned. He was young, [hence] the Empress 2a 192THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU Dowager appeared in court and pronounced [that 3:2a she issued] the [imperial] decrees.1 1 Ever since, when an Empress has assumed the Emperor's power, her act has been called by this phrase, so that it has become an idiom. The SC says at this point, "In the first year all the proclamations and decrees emanated from the Empress Dowager." Yen Shih-ku says, "The words of the Son of Heaven are called (1) `decrees ' and (2) `edicts .' `Decrees' means that they are commands for decreeing and regulating . [These] were not what an Empress Dowager is permitted to pronounce. Now the Empress Dowager [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ appeared in court and performed the duties of the Son of Heaven, making decisions about the many [affairs of the governmental] mechanism, hence she styled [her orders imperial] decrees and edicts." An empress could issue edicts, but the issuing of decrees was the sole prerogative of the Emperor. Cf. T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan, ch. 593, for a quotation from the Han Chih-tu (by Hu Kuang, 91-172) enumerating the four kinds of imperial orders. Cf. Mh II, 126, n. 2; 99 A: 4a. A general amnesty [was granted] to the world. Moreover she established [some] sons of her older brothers, LÃ¼ T'ai, [LÃ¼] Ch'an, [LÃ¼] Lu, and [LÃ¼] T'ai's son, [LÃ¼] T'ung, four persons [in all], as kings. She enfeoffed six persons of the LÃ¼ [clan] as marquises.2 2 These four appointments were not all made at the same time. LÃ¼ T'ai was enfeoffed as King in 186, LÃ¼ Ch'an in 182, LÃ¼ Lu and LÃ¼ Tung in 180. According to SC ch. 9 (Mh II, 417), in the first year the Empress Dowager appointed LÃ¼ P'ing as Marquis of Fu-liu and LÃ¼ Chung, the son of LÃ¼ Shih-chih, as the Marquis of P'ei; in the fourth year (Mh II, 418), she appointed LÃ¼ T'a as Marquis of YÃ¼ (cf. 16: 65a), LÃ¼ Keng-shih, her nephew, as Marquis of T'eng, and LÃ¼ Fen, another nephew, as Marquis of LÃ¼-ch'eng; in the eighth year (Mh II, 425), she appointed LÃ¼ Chuang, a younger son of LÃ¼ T'ai, as Marquis of T'ung-p'ingâthese are the six marquises referred to. In addition there were other marquisates in her family: LÃ¼ Lu became Marquis of Hu-ling, later succeeding LÃ¼ Shih-chih as Chien-ch'eng Marquis; in 184, LÃ¼ HsÃ¼, the younger sister of the Dowager Empress, was ennobled as the Marquis of Lin-kuang. The HS evidently did not count women in the enumeration of the six marquises. An account is in the "Memoir of the Relatives [of the 97A: 4b, 5a Imperial House] by Marriage." I In the first year, in the spring, the first month, an 187 B.C. imperial edict said, "At a previous time Emperor Feb./Mar. Hsiao-hui said that he wanted to abolish the punishment of [death together with] the three [sets of] 193THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year I 3:2a relatives1 1 Cf. Glossary, sub Three Sets. and the ordinance against monstrous talk- 187 B.C. ing,2 2 This law was probably directed against lese-majesty and libellious complaint against the government, such as charging it with tyranny or talk that would start a rebellion. This crime was again abolished in 178 B.C. Cf. 4: 10b. Yen Shih-ku says, "Outrageously erroneous talk is considered `monstrous talking.' " In 78 B.C. Kuei Hung interpreted some omens as implying that a commoner, descended from some ancient prince, would take the throne. Hence he advised the Han dynasty to resign and search for a sage. Ho Kuang, who controlled the government, had Kuei Hung executed for "falsely bringing forward monstrous talk, treason, and inhuman conduct." Cf. 75: 1b, 2a. [but] his deliberations had not yet been concluded when he died. Now We abolish these [punishments]." In the second month she granted noble Mar./Apr. ranks to the common people, one step to each household. For the first time there were established Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and [Diligent] Cultivators of the Soilâ[each official ranking as] two thousand piculs [recommended] one [such] person [for appointment].3 3 Yen Shih-ku says, "She specially appointed as officials [some] Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Diligent Cultivators of the Fields, and honored them [with an official] rank, wishing thereby to encourage the world, ordering that each one should perfect his conduct and devote himself to the fundamental, [agriculture]." Ch'ien Ta-chao points out that those ranking as two thousand piculs were Administrators of commanderies and Chancellors of kingdoms, and says that this passage means that each of these officials were to recommend one person, and that it is impossible that the position of Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Diligent Cultivator of the Soil should be ranked as two thousand piculs. The Filially Pious and the Fraternally Respectful are distinguished in 4: 14b. In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] ping-shen, in the palace of June 11 the King of Chao, there was a visitation [of fire] in the Ts'ung-t'ai.4 4 In 27 A: 10b Liu Hsiang says that this fire occurred because King Yu of Chao, Liu Yu, was to be slandered and imprisoned to death. Cf. 3: 4b. [The Empress Dowager] appointed some sons of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui by [women of] his harem: [LÃ¼] Ch'iang as King of Huai-yang, [LÃ¼] Pu-yi as King of 2b Heng-shan, [LÃ¼] Hung as Marquis of Hsiang-ch'eng, [LÃ¼] Ch'ao as Marquis of Chih, and [LÃ¼] Wu as 194THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year I 187 B.C. Autumn Marquis of Hu-kuan.1 1 HS ch. 13: 19b notes that Ch'iang was made King of Huai-yang on June 6, 187 B.C. Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) says, "The Han commentator [gives] his name as Chang ." Ju Shun (fl. dur. 221-265) tells that HS ch. 18 says, "All were sons of the LÃ¼ family and were made marquises because they were sons of Hsiao-hui," but this statement is not in the present text of that chapter. [LÃ¼] Ch'iang was furthermore never a marquis, but was directly made a king. Possibly this latter saying is displaced, and should be after the last of these supposed sons. HS 13: 21a says of the two of these five who are recorded in the date 180 B.C., "Because he was not [the Emperor Hui's] son he was killed." The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) thinks that all of these five were not really sons of Hsiao-hui because they are not mentioned in HS ch. 14, where are listed the vassals of the Liu surname, but are only mentioned in ch. 13, in which are listed vassals of other surnames and in ch. 18, in which are listed nobles related by marriage to the royal family. SC 9: 10b (Mh II, 432) says of two of these five: "Who had been pronounced the younger brothers of the Young Emperor" (who was a natural son of Hsiao-hui). HS 13: 19b says of Ch'iang and Pu-yi, "The Empress of Kao-[tsu] falsely set him up as a son of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui." The HS thus clearly implies that these five children were not really sons of Hsiao-hui. It records their appointment in the terms in which that appointment was made, but indicates their true descent by listing them in the appropriate tables, and by the statement on 3: 8a. HS 18: 4b also lists another supposed son of the Emperor Hsiao-hui by the name of [LÃ¼] T'ai , who was made Marquis of Ch'ang-p'ing , and who in 181 became King of LÃ¼ . Cf. 13: 20b; SC 17: 12a. SC 9:10 groups him with the other spurious sons, so that he too was a scion of the LÃ¼ family. Cf. p. 209, n. 3. In the autumn, the peach 3:2b and plum [trees] blossomed. II In the second year,2 2 Following the mention of the year, the present text reads, "in the spring," but the next date is also "in the spring, the first month" (3a); since the chapter proceeds chronologically, this word "spring" should be "winter," according to Su YÃ¼ (xx cent.). HS 16: 2a recounts this matter, dating it merely "in the second year of the Empress of Kao-[tsu]." We have deleted "spring," following ch. 16. an imperial edict said, "The Emperor Kao-[tsu] reformed and ordered the world.3 3 This sentence is a loose quotation from Analects XIV, xviii, 2. All those who distinguished themselves received a share of its territory and were made marquises. All the people [are enjoying] great peace; not one but has received of his bountiful virtue. We have been thinking and reflecting [on this matter]. If, down to the distant future, their merits and names have not been made manifest, there will be nothing to honor their great conceptions and exhibit them [for the benefit of] later generations. Now [We] wish to classify and rank the merits of the 195THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year II 3:2b marquises, so as to determine upon their positions 187 B.C. in the court and preserve them in the Temple of Kao[tsu] from generation to generation without end, so that their heirs may each inherit their merits and positions. Let [this matter] be discussed with the marquises, settled, and memorialized [to Us]." [The reply was,] "The Lieutenant Chancellor your 3a subject [Ch'en] P'ing [says that] together with the Marquis of Chiang your subject [Chou] P'o, the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-chou your subject [Li] Shang, the Marquis of Ying-yin your subject [Kuan] Ying, the the Marquis of An-kuo your subject [Wang] Ling, [I have] carefully discussed [this matter].1 1 According to 16: 1b, Kao-tsu had fixed the relative ranking of 18 marquises, including Hsiao Ho and Ts'ao Ts'an; now the Empress Dowager ordered the relative ranking of the others. She was probably planning to win adherents and strengthen her clique thereby. These ranks are recorded in ch. 16. Ch'en P'ing was ranked by this committee as number 47; the other three had previously been ranked as numbers 4, 6, and 9 respectively in order of court precedence. Thus a committee of marquises who had previously been ranked among the first, together with the Lieutenant Chancellor, did the ranking. The marquises have been fortunate [enough] to obtain grants of money for food and to have been appointed to [the income of] towns.2 2 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) says, "The nobles at the four seasons all get grants of money for food." Wen Ying (fl. ca. 196-220) says, "Food is the towns [from the income of which] they live. In the meantime [this phrase] was changed to be called `poll-tax money ,' [cf. p. 184, n. 1], like the present chief officials' salary , which they themselves report as wine-money . It is the land tax [perhaps this last phrase should be, "the (marquises') poll-tax"]. Yen Shih-ku says, "Foodmoney is grants of money for cooking and food was originally `live [from the income] of towns' " Wei Chao (197-273/4) interprets differently: "Cooked food is called ; wine and meat dishes are called ; grain and rice are called . The [marquises'] poll-tax and their [official] salary really constitute their income; at the four seasons they obtain [imperial grants at intervalsâthis is their food money." Shen Ch'in-han (1778-1831) adds, "In the T'ang [period], each [high] official, in addition to his monthly salary, had money for food and fodder. [This practise] probably began with the Han [period]." Your Majesty is increas-your favors to them by fixing their positions in the 196THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year II 187 B.C. court in accordance with their merit. Your subjects 2:3a beg that [this record] be stored in the Temple of Kao-[tsu]." The memorial was allowed. 186 B.C. In the spring, the first month, on ]the day] yi-mao, Feb. 25 there was an earthquake in Ch'iang-tao. In the Wu-tu [Commandery]1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that " March" is superfluous and should be omitted; the former Han dynasty had only a Wu-tu Commandery and Hsien; the later Han dynasty first had a Wu-tu March. a mountain fell down. In the summer, in the sixth month, on the [day] ping-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.2 2 For eclipses, cf. App. I. In the autumn, the seventh July/Aug. month, the King of Heng-shan, [LÃ¼] Pu-yi, died.3 3 The SC at this point adds the statement, "His younger brother, the Marquis of Hsiang-ch'eng, [LÃ¼] Shan [cf. Glossary, sub voce], was made King of Ch'ang-shan and his given name was changed to Yi." Cf. Mh II, 418. HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh's (148-209) Han-chi says the same. Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831) thinks that the above sentence has dropped out of the text of the HS at this point. The "eight shu" cash were put into circulation.4 4 Ying Shao says, "Originally the Ch'in [dynasty] cash were in substance like the cash of the Chou [dynasty]. Their inscription was `Half ounce,' and their weight was the same as the inscription. [These were] the `eight shu' cash. [But a shu is 1/24 of an ounce, (cf. 4: app. I), so that 8 shu is only one-third of an ounce.] Because they were too heavy, the Han [dynasty] changed and coined the `leaf' cash. Today among the people, the `elm leaf' cash are those. The people suffered because they were too light. [So] at this time there were again put into circulation the `eight shu' cash." The HS however mentions the `leaf' cash later. Cf. 3: 4b and p. 199, n. 2. According to the Ku-chin-chu, attributed to Ts'ui Pao and probably written about 300, "The `leaf' cash weigh three shu." But HS 24B: 3b says of cash, "Moreover each at different times may be lighter or heavier; they are not the same [in weight]," so that uniformity had not been secured in coinage. Yeh TÃª-hui (d. 1927) says that of the Ch'in dynasty `half-ounce' cash that have been preserved, the lightest weigh 15/100 of a tael and the heaviest 20/100 of a tael; the `eight shu' cash would then correspond to the lightest Ch'in cash. Cf. p. 111, n. 3; p. 280. 3b In the third year, in the summer, the Yangtze III River [and the Han River]5 5 The words , "the Han River," have dropped out of the present text. Ch'ien Ta-chao reports that they are in the Southern Academy ed. (1528) and the Fukien ed. (1549), and that the Han-chi reads, "The Yangtze River and the Han River overflowed." Chou Shou-ch'ang (1818-1884) reports that Ho Ch'uo collated a small character Sung text (prob. 1178) and says that after "Yangtze River" it had "the Han River." HS 27A: 21b says, "In the third year of the Empress of Kao-tsu, in the summer, in the Han-chung and Nan Commanderies there was high water. The rivers overflowed, carrying away more than 4000 families." Corresponding to the statement on 3: 5a that in the summer of the eighth year the Yangtze and Han Rivers overflowed, 27A: 21b says, "The rivers again overflowed." Hence the earlier passage should mention the Han as well as the Yangtze River. Wang Hsien-ch'ien reports that the Wang ed. (1546) and the Official ed. (1739) have "the Han River" at this point. overflowed, carrying 197THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year III 3:3b away more than four thousand families of common 185 B.C. 185 B.C. people. In the autumn, a star appeared in daytime.1 1 This "star" might have been a nova, a comet, or the planet Venus, which is sometimes visible in daytime. In the fourth year, in the summer, the Young IV Emperor himself knew that he was not the son of the 184 B.C. Empress, and emitted some resentful words, [so] the Summer Empress Dowager shut him up in the Yung-hsiang.2 2 The SC at this point and HS 97A: 5a tell that the Empress Dowager's granddaughter, the Empress, had had no children, so she simulated pregnancy. A child of a concubine was passed off as her son, then the child's mother was killedâthis child then was made the Heir-apparent and became the Young Emperor. When he grew up he said, "How could the Empress Dowager kill my mother and name me [as her son]? I am not yet grown; when I am grown I will do what I will do." The Empress Dowager heard of it and imprisoned him until he died. Cf. Mh II, 418 ff. The imperial edict said,3 3 The SC quotes this edict (with a few verbal changes) as a speech of the Empress Dowager. Cf. Mh II, 419. "Whoever possesses the world and rules all its people covers them like Heaven and supports them like Earth. When the superior has a joyous heart in employing his subjects, the subjects rejoice in serving their superior; when the joy and the rejoicing meet each other, the world is in peace and good order. Now the Emperor has been ill for a long time and has not recovered; consequently [his mind] is lost and wandering, [and he has become] demented and confused; he is not able to succeed as an heir [to his ancestors], to perform [his duty] in the ancestral temples, nor to continue its sacrifices. He is not able to be entrusted with 198THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year IV 184 B.C. the empire. Let it be discussed who should take 3: 3b his place." The ministers all said, "The plans the Empress Dowager [has made] for the world whereby to maintain the [dynasty's] ancestral temples and the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains are very profound. We knock our heads on the ground [in respect] as we accept [your Majesty's] edict."1 1 The Empress Dowager had dismissed the last heir of the Emperor Hui; they tell her they do not know what to do. In June 15 the fifth month, on [the day] ping-ch'en, [the Empress Dowager] made the King of Heng-shan, [LÃ¼] Hung, the Emperor.2 2 HS 27A: 21b adds that in the autumn of this year there was high water in the Yellow River basin. 4a In the fifth year, in the spring, the King of V Nan-yÃ¼eh, Commandant [Chao] T'o, called himself 183 B.C. Emperor Wu of Nan-[yÃ¼eh].3 3 This act constituted a rebellion against the dynasty. Chao T'o was commonly known as " Commandant T'o," even after he had become king and emperor. The SC uses this name as the title of his biography. The use of a title name, like Wu, by a ruler while he was living was contrary to the usual Chinese practise, although many ancient kings used a title while living. According to the SC, before Chao T'o was enfeoffed by Kao-tsu, he had called himself "King Wu of Nan-yÃ¼eh." Now he usurped the Emperor's title and called himself "Emperor Wu of Nan-yÃ¼eh." Wei Chao (197-273/4) understands the text in this sense. Then the word "YÃ¼eh" has dropped out of the text at this point. The Han-chi and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) both have that word. It has been suggested however that he changed the name of his kingdom from Nan-yÃ¼eh to Nan-wu, since there is mentioned a Chih, the Marquis of Nan-wu (cf. 1B: 21b), but there is no evidence to support this conjecture. An emperor would hardly change the name of his state to that borne by an unimportant marquisate. In the autumn, Aug./Sept. the eighth month, the King of Huai-nan, [LÃ¼] Sept./Oct. Ch'iang, died. In the ninth month, [the Empress Dowager] sent cavalry from the Ho-tung and the Shang-tang [Commanderies] to garrison the Pei-ti [Commandery]. VI In the sixth year, in the spring, a star was visible 182 BC. in daytime. In the summer, the fourth month, an May/June amnesty was granted to the world and [the Empress Dowager] ranked the prefect of Ch'ang2-ling 199THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VI 3: 4a at two thousand piculs.1 1 The tomb of Kao-tsu was at Ch'ang-ling; its magistrate was raised to rank with Commandery Administrators. Thus Kao-tsu was honored. In the sixth month a wall 4b was built [around] Ch'ang2-ling. The Huns pillaged July/Aug. Ti-tao and attacked O-yang. The "five fen" cash were put into circulation.2 2 A fen is one tenth of an inch, so that this name would imply that they were one-half inch (0.45 Eng. meas.) in diameter. Ying Shao says that these were the `leaf' cash (cf. p. 196, n. 4). Sung Ch'i (998-1061) says that some other texts write shu for fen, which is an error, for the five-shu cash were not minted until the time of the Emperor Wu. Ch'ien Ta-chao notes that the Southern Academy ed. (1528) and the Fukien ed. (1549) read thus. In the seventh year, in the winter, the twelfth VII month, the Huns pillaged Ti-tao and abducted more 181 B.C. than two thousand people. In the spring, the first Jan./Feb. month, on [the day] ting-ch'ou, the King of Chao, Feb. 21 [Liu] Yu, died from being imprisoned in the princes' lodgings at the capital,3 3 He was the sixth son of Kao-tsu. He had married a lady of the LÃ¼ family, but loved a concubine. His wife slandered him to the Empress Dowager, accusing him of having said that he would attack that family after the death of the Empress Dowager. She sent for him and starved him to death in his lodgings, then buried him as a commoner. Cf. Glossary sub Liu Yu. and on [the day] chi-ch'ou, Mar. 4 the last day of the month, there was an eclipse and it was total. [The Empress Dowager] made the King of Liang, LÃ¼ Ch'an, the Chancellor of State, and the King of Chao, [LÃ¼] Lu, the First [Ranking] General. She established the Marquis of Ying-ling, Liu Tse, as the King of Lang-ya. In the summer, the fifth month, on [the day] hsin-wei, an imperial edict said, "Lady Chao-ling June 14 was the wife of the Grand Emperor. The Wu-ai Marquis, [Liu Po], and Lady HsÃ¼an were the 5a Emperor Kao-[tsu's] older brother and older sister. 200THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VII 181 B.C. Their titles and posthumous names are not adequate 3:5a [to their stations]. Let it be discussed [what] titles [they should be] honored [with." The reply was,] "The Lieutenant Chancellor, your subject, [Ch'en] P'ing, and others beg that you honor the Lady Chao-ling with the title, the Empress Chao-ling, the Wu-ai Marquis with the title King Wu-ai, and Lady HsÃ¼an with the title Queen Chao-ai." July In the sixth month, the King of Chao, [Liu] K'uei, committed suicide.1 1 He was the fifth son of Kao-tsu. He had been married to a grand-niece of the Empress Dowager; his wife surrounded herself with her people, spying upon him so that he could not do what he liked. His queen poisoned the concubine whom he loved, and so, in sorrow for her, he committed suicide. The Empress Dowager thereupon punished him by taking his title from his descendants, so that his ghost could not receive princely worship. Cf. Glossary, sub Liu K'uei. In the autumn, the ninth Oct. month, the King of Yen, [Liu] Chien, died.2 2 Liu Chien was the eighth son of Kao-tsu. He had one son, by a concubine; after his death the Empress Dowager sent men to kill this son, then disestablished his kingdom. The SC and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien date this death in the 9th month; the Han-chi wrongly dates it in the 8th month. By this time, of the eight sons of Kao-tsu, only two were alive: Heng, who later became the Emperor Hsiao-wen, and Ch'ang, King of Huai-nan. Three had died seemingly natural deaths, one was poisoned by the Empress Dowager, one had been starved to death by her, and one was driven by her grandniece to commit suicide. Princess YÃ¼an of Lu, Kao-tsu's daughter and oldest child, had also died. [The state of] Nan-yÃ¼eh invaded and pillaged the [kingdom of] Ch'ang-sha. [The Empress Dowager] sent the Marquis of Lung-lu, [Chou] Tsao, with troops, to attack [the invaders]. VIII In the eighth year, in the spring, the Palace Internuncio 180 B.C. Chang Shih-ch'ing was appointed a marquis. Spring. The officials in the eunuch's offices in the [palace] inner [courts] who were chiefs or assistants were all granted the rank of Kuan-nei Marquis with [the Summer income of] estates, and in the summer, the Yangtze and Han Rivers overflowed, carrying away more than ten thousand families.3 3 HS 27A: 21b says, "In the Han-chung and Nan Commanderies the rivers again ran out [of their banks], carrying away more than 6000 families; in the Nan-yang [Commandery] the Mien River [a tributary of the Han] carried away more than ten thousand families." Evidently the population was much denser in Shensi than along the banks of the Yangtse River, or else events in the Yangtze valley received little notice from the court historians. 201THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 3:5a In the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] 180 B.C. Aug. 18 hsin-szu,1 1 Aug. 18, 180 B.C., which P. Hoang makes the first day of the 8th month; Chavannes (Mh II, 426 &amp; n. 3; T'oung Pao 7: 26) puts an intercalary month in the 7th year instead of in the 8th year, as Hoang does, and dates this death on the last day of the 6th month, making it July 21. We have followed P. Hoang, for his calendar (which in this month seems to be one day in error) requires a smaller number of emendations in the text of the histories. The SC states that while the Empress Dowager was out of the palace she was bit in the side by something that appeared to be like a blue dog and suddenly disappeared. When it was divined about, the diviner's reply was, "It was the King of Chao, [Liu] Ju-yi, [whom she had murdered], become an evil spirit." She fell sick of her wound and died of it four months later. Cf. Mh II, 425; HS 27 Ba: 27b. the Empress Dowager died at the Wei-yang 5b Palace. By her testamentary edict she granted to each of the vassal kings [the equivalent of] a thousand [catties of] gold, to the generals, the chancellors, the marquises, and those of lower [rank], down to the Gentlemen and the officials, to each proportionately. A general amnesty was granted to the world. The First [Ranking] General, [LÃ¼] Lu, and the Chancellor of State, [LÃ¼] Ch'an, had sole command of the troops and controlled the government.2 2 According to the SC and HS 97A: 5a, the Empress Dowager, before her death, had feared a revolution, and so ordered these two nephews to be made First Ranking General and Chancellor of State, respectively, and to reside in the Northern and Southern Armies to guard the capital for her family. Cf. Mh II, 426. They themselves knew [that they were acting] contrary to the covenant [made by] of Emperor Kao[tsu and his associates],3 3 According to the SC, Kao-tsu had made his generals and associates swear an oath made with the most solemn ceremonyâa white horse was sacrificed and its blood smeared on the lips of those who took the oathâto the effect that all the empire should unite to combat those who were kings and did not belong to the Liu (the imperial) family. Cf. Mh II, 414. The Empress Dowager, by naming kings from members of her own family, that of LÃ¼, had compelled the breaking of this oath. and were fearful that they would be executed by the great officials and the vassal 202THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 180 B.C. kings. Hence they plotted sedition. At that time 3:5b the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu] Chang, the son of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei2],1 1 Kao-tsu's oldest son. was at the capital. Because the daughter of [LÃ¼] Lu was his wife, he knew of their plot, so sent people to inform his older brother, the King of Ch'i, [Liu Hsiang], and induce him to mobilize his troops and come westwards.2 2 The SC (Mh II, 429) tells that the King of Ch'i's Chancellor opposed the King. (The Chancellors were appointed by the emperor to watch the vassal kings.) On Sept. 12 the King tried to have his Chancellor assassinated; the Chancellor raised his troops and tried to take the King captive, but the King then killed the Chancellor. [Liu] Chang, with the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, and the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, intended to cooperate from within Sept. [the capital] to execute the LÃ¼ [clan]. The King of Ch'i thereupon mobilized his troops and also tricked the King of Lang-ya, [Liu] Tse, into mobilizing the troops of his kingdom; [the King of Ch'i] united the [troops of Lang-ya with his own troops] and led them westwards.3 3 The "trick" is expounded in SC 52: 3a, b, which reads, "He sent forth all the troops of his state and sent Chu Wu east to trick the King of Lang-ya [Liu Tse], by saying, `The LÃ¼ clan is rebelling and the King of Ch'i, [Liu Hsiang], is mobilizing his troops, wishing to go west and execute [the LÃ¼ clan]. The King of Ch'i considers that his son is young in years, and inexperienced in warlike matters, [so] prefers to entrust his kingdom to you, great King. You, great King, were yourself a general of Emperor Kao-[tsu] and are experienced in warlike matters. The King of Ch'i dares not leave his troops, [so] he sends me, your servant, to beg you, great King, to favor him by coming to Lin-tzu [his capital] to visit the King of Ch'i, plan matters, and lead the troops of Ch'i together with yours westwards to subjugate the rebellion in Kuan-chung.' The King of Lang-ya believed him, thought [his suggestion] right, and galloped west to see the King of Ch'i. The King of Ch'i with Wei P'o and others thereupon detained the King of Lang-ya and sent Chu Wu to mobilize all [the troops] of the kingdom of Lang-ya; then [the King of Ch'i] united [them with his own troops and] led its troops [together with his own]. "When the King of Lang-ya, Liu Tse, saw that he had been deceived and could not return to his kingdom, he said to the King of Ch'i, `King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [your father], was the oldest son of the Emperor Kao-[tsu]; by rights then you, great King, are the heir and the first grandson of Emperor Kao-[tsu]. You ought to be seated [on the throne]. Now the great officials are hesitating in their discussions [concerning the succession] and have not yet reached a decision, while I, Tse, am the oldest of the Liu family. The great officials will of course wait for me, Tse, before coming to a decision in their deliberations. Now you, great King, are detaining me, your servant, uselessly. It would be better to send me through the Pass to deliberate on this matter.' The King of Ch'i thought he was right, so prepared for him the necessities and chariots and sent off the King of Lang-ya. When the King of Lang-ya had gone, [the kingdom of] Ch'i thereupon set in motion its troops, went westwards, and attacked the Chi-nan [Commandery] of the kingdom of LÃ¼." [LÃ¼] Ch'an, [LÃ¼] Lu 203THE EMPRESS OF KAO TSU, Year VIII 3:5b and the others sent the General-in-chief, Kuan Ying, 180 B.C. with troops, to attack him. When [Kuan] Ying reached Jung-yang, he sent people to inform the King of Ch'i that he was going to ally himself with him, waiting until the LÃ¼ clan made a move, and then they would all together execute them. The Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, together with the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, plotted, making use [of the fact that Li] Chi, the son of the Marquis of Ch'Ã¼-chou, Li Shang, was on good terms with [LÃ¼] Lu, and sent people who kidnapped [Li] Shang and ordered [Li] Chi to speak falsely to [LÃ¼] Lu, saying, "Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the Empress [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ together subjugated the world. The establishing of the nine kings from the Liu clan and of the three kings from the LÃ¼ clan was a matter all [done as a result of] deliberation by the great officials; when announcement and information [was made] to the vassal kings, the vassal kings considered it suitable.1 1 I.e., the government was not an absolute monarchy; the emperor acts only with the approval of his important subordinates. Now the Empress Dowager is dead, and the Emperor is young. If your honor 6a does not quickly go [away] to your kingdom and act as a feudatory, but remain here as First [Ranking] General directing your troops, you will be suspected by the great officials and the nobles. Why do you not quickly return your general's seal, turn over your troops to the Grand Commandant, ask the King of 204THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 180 B.C. Liang, [LÃ¼ Ch'an], also to return the Chancellor of 3:6a State's seal, make a solemn oath with the great officials, and then go to your kingdoms? [Then] the troops of Ch'i will certainly be disbanded, the great officials will be at rest, your honor will sleep soundly, and you will rule as king over [a region of] a thousand li. This [act] would be a benefit for ten thousand generations." [LÃ¼] Lu agreed to his plan and sent people to inform [LÃ¼] Ch'an together with the elders of the LÃ¼ [clan]. Some thought it disadvantageous. While they deliberated and hesitated and had not resolved upon anything, [LÃ¼] Lu, who had confidence in [Li] Chi, went out on a trip1 1 The SC says that they went hunting; the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien follows it, while the Han-chi follows the HS. together with him, and passed by [the house of] his paternal aunt, LÃ¼ HsÃ¼. [LÃ¼] HsÃ¼ became angry and said, "You have been made a general, yet you abandon your army. The 6b LÃ¼ clan will now have no [place] to dwell." Then she took out all her pearls, jade, and precious objects, and scattered them around below the [main] hall, saying, "I will not keep them for others [to enjoy]." Sept. 26 In the eighth month, on [the day] keng-shen,2 2 There was no keng-shen day in the eighth month; the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien K'ao-yi, by Ssu-ma Kuang (1019-1036), 1: 5b, says that the text should read, "the ninth month," for although SC 9: 11a (Mh II, 434) also reads "the eighth month keng-shen," yet previously (Mh II, 429) it reads "the eighth month ping-wu," and the days keng-shen and ping-wu cannot be in the same month here. Then this date is Sept. 26, 180 B.C. Chavannes reached the same Julian date (Mh II, 434), but by emending the previous date, not this one. The SC says in addition that it happened "in the morning." It also gives the impression that Ts'ao Cho overheard part of a conversation not intended for his ears. the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao] Cho, who was 205THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 3:6b performing the duties of the Grandee Secretary,1 1 According to 19B: 5b, Ts'ao Cho became Grandee Secretary in 184 B.C. and was dismissed in 180 B.C. In that year an edict commanded the Lieutenant Chancellor of Huai-nan, Chang Ts'ang, to take his place; probably at this time Ts'ao Cho was merely acting for his successor who had been appointed, but had not yet taken up his duties. HS 42: 4b says that he was dismissed after the killing of the LÃ¼ clan, which Wang Hsien-ch'ien thinks is an erroneous statement, because at the time of Liu Heng's arrival in the capital on Nov. 14, Chang Ts'ang is already mentioned as Grandee Secretary (cf. 4: 3a). 180 B.C. visited the Chancellor of State, [LÃ¼] Ch'an, concerning the [yearly] accounts. The Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Chia Shou, had come from Ch'i, [to which he had been sent as] an envoy, and took advantage [of the opportunity] to reprove [LÃ¼] Ch'an, saying, "You, King, have not quickly gone to your kingdom; now even though you should want to go, would it be still possible?" [Then] he described and told [LÃ¼] Ch'an all about Kuan Ying uniting as an accomplice with [the kingdoms of] Ch'i and Ch'u.2 2 The SC (Mh II, 434) adds at this point, "He urged [LÃ¼] Ch'an to hasten into the palace." When the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao] Cho, heard his speech, he galloped3 3 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the Shao ed. (xi or xii cent.) reads for . [off] and informed the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, and the Grand Commandant, Chou P'o. [Chou] P'o wanted to enter [the camp of] the Northern Army, but was not permitted to enter. The Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, Chi T'ung-[chia], was Master of the Credentials, so [Chou P'o] ordered 7a him to [get and] bear a credential which would fraudulently admit4 4 Reading for , as in the passages on p. 7b, at the suggestion of Ch'ien Ta-chao. [Chou] P'o to the Northern Army. [Chou] P'o next ordered Li Chi and the 206THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 180 B.C. Director of Guests, Liu Chieh, to say to [LÃ¼] Lu, 3:7a "The Emperor has sent the Grand Commandant to take charge of the Northern Army. He intends to order your honor to go to your state. Hasten to return your general's seal, resign,1 1 The Sung Ch'i ed. says that the Southern ed. (ca. x-xii cent.) reads for the present and omits the words for "general". and leave. If you do not do so, misfortune will immediately come of it." [LÃ¼] Lu thereupon took off his seal,2 2 The SC (Mh II, 435) adds that LÃ¼ Lu did not think that Li Chi would deceive him. confided it to the Director of Guests, and thus handed his troops over to the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o entered the gate of the Army's [encampment] and issued his orders in the Army, saying, "Those who are for the LÃ¼ clan bare the right [arm]; those who are for the Liu clan bare the left [arm]." In the Army [the soldiers] all bared their left [arms].3 3 This phrase "bare the left arm" has become an idiom. Thereupon [Chou] P'o took control of the Northern Army. However there was still the Southern Army.4 4 Wu Jen-chieh (ca. 1137-1199) writes, "According to ch. 23, [at] the capital there were the encampments of the Southern and Northern Armies. Although the Southern and Northern Armies of Han [times] were called two comparable armies, really the Southern Army was not the equal of the Northern Army. Emperor Kao-[tsu] sent forth 30,000 troops of the Palace Military Commander. When Wang Wen-shu was Palace Military Commander, he begged permission to replace the soldiers who had been lost, and secured several tens of thousands of men. The roster of the Northern Army then must be said to have been large. But when Kai K'uan-jao was Major of the Guard, the soldiers of the guard [the patrol inside the capital, cf. 19 A: 22b; 77: 1a] numbered not more than several thousand men. Hence the military policy of the Han [dynasty] always stressed the Northern Army. When Chou P'o had once entered the Northern Army, LÃ¼ Ch'an and his confederates could only fold their hands and meet death. When the Heir-apparent Li [of Emperor Wu] did not secure help from the Northern Army, he was finally defeated by the Lieutenant Chancellor's troops. [Cf. Glossary sub Liu ChÃ¼]. The general nature of the power of the two armies can thus be seen." Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) adds, "Hu [San-hsing, 1230-1287], in his comment on the [Tzu-chih] T'ung-chien, [says that] according to Pan [Ku's] Table [19A: 22b] the Colonel of the Capital Encampment [cf. Mh II, 521, XVIII, 1Â°] takes charge of [everything] inside the gates of the encampment of the Northern Army. There was also a Palace Military Commander who took charge of patrolling the capital. His subordinates were [the Colonel] of the Capital Encampment, the Pretors of the Waters, and others, both chiefs and assistants. At the time of the Later Han [dynasty], there were first established the Palace Captains at the Northern Army, having charge of the five encampments. The commentator Liu [Chao, (fl. dur. 502-556), in a note to HHS, Tr. 27: 7b] says that formerly there was the Colonel of the Capital Encampment commanding affairs within the encampment of the Northern Army. After the Revival [23-25], the [Colonel of] the Capital Encampment was abolished, [but] there were however established Palace Captains to superintend the five encampments. [Each palace had its encampment]. In addition, according to Pan [K'u's] Table [19 A: 23a], after [the discussion of the Colonel of] the Capital Encampment there [are mentioned] eight Colonels, all of whom were first established by the Emperor Wu. According to my notion, before [the time of] the Emperor Wu, the Northern Army was under the Palace Military Commander, hence he commanded the Chief of the Capital Encampment, his assistants and other officers. "The Southern Army was probably governed by the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards [cf. Glossary sub voce]. According to Pan [Ku's] Table, the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards had charge of the soldiers encamped as a guard to the palace gates. When Chou P'o had entered the Northern Army, `there was still the Southern Army.' So he first sent Ts'ao Cho to inform the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards not to admit LÃ¼ Ch'an at the gate of the [Front] Hall [in the Wei-yang Palace], and afterwards sent the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu Chang], to pursue [LÃ¼] Ch'an and kill him in the official's privy of the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace's quarters in the Wei-yang Palace. According to this [account], we know that the Southern Army was under the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards." 207THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 3:7b The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, sum- 180 B.C. 7b moned the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu] Chang, to assist [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o ordered [Liu] Chang to superintend the gates of the army's [encampment] and ordered the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao Cho], to inform the Commandant of the [Palace] Guards not to admit1 1 Cf. p. 205, n. 4. the Chancellor of State [LÃ¼] Ch'an at the gate of the [Front] Hall.2 2 This Front Hall was the hall of audience in the Wei-yang Palace; the imperial apartments were there. [LÃ¼] Ch'an did not know that [LÃ¼] Lu had already given up the Northern Army, [so] entered the Wei-yang Palace, intending to create a sedition, [but the guards at] 208THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 180 B.C. the gate of the [Front] Hall would not admit him. 3:7b As he walked back and forth irresolutely, the Marquis of P'ing-yang, [Ts'ao Cho], galloped [off] and told the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o still feared that [his party] would not be victorious, [so] dared not yet make a public announcement1 1 The SC writes ; the HS reads the first word as , which Wei Chao (197-273/4) and Teng Chan (fl. ca. 208) interpret as . Cf. Mh II, 436, n. 1. to execute him, but spoke to the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu] Chang, saying, "Hasten into the Palace to guard the Emperor." [Liu] Chang asked [Chou] P'o for a thousand soldiers, and entered the Wei-yang Palace by a side gate. He met [LÃ¼] Ch'an in the court. It was late afternoon.2 2 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the YÃ¼eh ed. (prob. xi or xii cent.) and the Shao ed. (xi or xii cent.) omit . The fact that the sun was declining was probably taken as an approval by Heaven of this destruction. Thereupon he attacked [LÃ¼] Ch'an, and [LÃ¼] Ch'an fled. [There came] a great wind from Heaven and his retinue became panic-stricken, [so that] none of them dared to fight, [with the result that Liu Chang] pursued [LÃ¼] Ch'an and killed him in the privy of the official's house connected with the office of the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace.3 3 Ju Shun (fl. dur. 221-265) says that according to 19 A: 8a the Chief of the Gentleman-at-the-Palace controlled the gates and doors to the Palace in general and the Hall, hence his office was inside the Palace. HS 50: 5b speaks of a "chief in the office of the Gentlemen-of-the-Palace," which Wang Hsien-ch'ien thinks was this place. The Han dynasty's palace as a whole was called a ; within it was the Front Hall , the Forbidden Apartments , the Tung-ko (p. 132, n. 2), the Harem , etc. When [Liu] Chang had killed [LÃ¼] Ch'an, the Emperor ordered an Internuncio, bearing a credential, to congratulate [Liu] Chang.4 4 Yen Shih-ku says that he wanted to make kind inquiries. [Liu] Chang 209THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 3:7b wished to take his credential [from him, but] the 180 B.C. Internuncio was unwilling [to part with it]. Then [Liu] Chang went with him in his carriage. By using his credential [as] a passport [allowing him entrance], he galloped [to the Ch`ang-lo Palace] and beheaded the Commandant of the [Palace] Guard at the Chang-lo [Palace], LÃ¼ Keng-shih. He returned, 8a entered the Northern Army, and reported back to the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o arose, bowed to [Liu] Chang in congratulation, and said, "The only one I was worried about was [LÃ¼] Ch'an. Now that he has been executed the empire has been made stable [again]." On [the day] hsin-yu,1 1 The day after the one in which the preceding events, including the murder of LÃ¼ Ch'an, happened. According to p. 204 n. 2, this was Sept. 27, 180 B.C. they killed2 2 The Official ed. (1739) writes "beheaded " for the in the text. LÃ¼ Lu and Sept. 27 beat to death LÃ¼ HsÃ¼. Dividing themselves into detachments, they arrested all the LÃ¼ clan, male and female, without [making any distinction of] youth or age, and beheaded them all. The great officials and chancellors planned together secretly; because they considered that the Young Emperor and the kings his three younger brothers3 3 This was the second "Young Emperor"; the first one was Hsiao-hui's natural child and had been imprisoned to death by the Empress Dowager in 184 B.C.; the second Young Emperor was LÃ¼ Hung. His three supposed younger brothers were (1) the Marquis of Chih, LÃ¼ Chao, who had succeeded LÃ¼ Heng as King of Heng-shan, (2) the Marquis of Hu-kuan, LÃ¼ Wu, who had become the King of Huai-yang, and (3) the Marquis of Chang-p'ing, LÃ¼ T'ai, who had become King of LÃ¼. (The SC [cf. Mh II, 441] speaks of the King of Liang, but Liang is a mistake for LÃ¼. At that time the King of Liang had been LÃ¼ Ch'an.) The name of the place, LÃ¼, was changed to Chi-ch'uan , so that LÃ¼ T'ai is also called the King of Chi-ch'uan. were all [in reality] 210THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU, Year VIII 180 B.C. not sons of [the Emperor] Hsiao-hui, [the great 3:8a officials and chancellors] together executed them and honored and established Emperor Wen [upon the throne]. An account [of all the foregoing] 40:23 b is in the "Memoir of Chou P'o" and the "[Memoir 38:6a, b of] the Five Kings [who were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]." In eulogy we say: During the times of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], the world had succeeded in putting behind it the sufferings [during the period of] Contending States. Both ruler and subjects sought for effortlessness.1 1 Cf. p. 186 n. 1, ad fin. Hence although Emperor Hui folded his hands2 2 Possibly alluding to Ts'ao Ts'an's phrase, "Your Majesty sits with unruffled garments and folded hands." Cf. p. 186 n. 1, ad fin. Much of this eulogy is taken from the corresponding passage in SCHC 9:37f; cf. Mh II, 442. and the Empress of Kao-[tsu], a female lord, assumed the rule and governed without going out of the doors to her apartments, yet the world was quiet, [mutilating] punishments and [other] penalties were seldom used, the people were busy in sowing and harvesting, and clothing and food multiplied and were abundant. 211 CHAPTER III Appendix THE ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF THE EMPRESS OF KAO-TSU i. Two eclipses are recorded during this period of eight years. In the second year, the sixth month, on the day ping-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, a solar eclipse is recorded (3: 3a). The Han-chi (6: 2a) notes this eclipse in the sixth month without giving any day. The date in the HS corresponds to July 26, 186 B.C., but there was no eclipse at that time. In the seven years from the last total eclipse in the reign of Emperor Hui, in 188 B.C., to the next total eclipse of 181 B.C., 15 eclipses occurred, of which only one was visible in China.1 1 Besides those whose location Oppolzer gives, the following 4 partial eclipses were invisible in China because they belong to initial or terminal runs of exeligmos series whose nearest umbral eclipse was located near the south pole: no. 2430 (i.), no. 2431 (t.), no. 2439 (i.), and no. 2440 (t.). In addition, 4 partial eclipses were visible in the northern hemisphere, but calculation shows that all were invisible in China: no. 2428, on Dec. 31, 187 B.C. was far outside of Chinese territory. No. 2429, on May 28, 186 B.C. was invisible south of 60Â° lat. No. 2437, on Oct. 19, 183 B.C. was visible only as far east as European Russia and western Siberia. No. 2438, on Mar. 15, 182 B.C., was located far outside of Chinese territory. This umbral eclipse is Oppolzer's number 2434, on May 6, 184 B.C., 15 days before a ping-hsÃ¼ day; calculation of its circumstances shows that it merely reached a magnitude of 0.08 in the present Soochow at 8:48 a.m., local time, a magnitude of 0.05 at the present Changsha at 8:08 a.m., and was invisible in northern China, including Ch'ang-an. The explanation of this eclipse recording is not easy. It is possible that the eclipse of 184 B.C. was observed at Wu (present Soochow) or Lin-hsiang (present Changsha). But at both of those places the eclipse was little more than a mere contact. At Wu it began at 8:12 and ended at 9:04, lasting 48 minutes; at Lin-hsiang it lasted from 7:48 to 8:16, only 28 minutes. It was unobservable except by special means, such as watching the reflection of the sun in water or in a mirror in order to reduce its glare. A patient astronomer who knew that the eclipse was expected or some farmer accidentally seeing the sun reflected in a flooded rice-field might have seen the eclipse. The Administrator of the Commandery might have then considered it important and have reported 212CHAPTER III the eclipse to the capital. The cyclical day of the eclipse, ping-tzu, might have been mistaken for ping-hsÃ¼. The whole procedure however involves so many hardly probable events that it seems better to reject this eclipse as unobservable. Then how did this listing of an eclipse come to be made? It is not found in the SC; the SC likewise does not record the total eclipse of 188 B.C., which the HS has recorded correctly. It is possible that some eclipse outside of this period of seven years was mistaken for this one; if so, the order of the listed eclipses has somehow been disarranged. Thus it might have been the eclipse of Sept. 29, 192 B.C.; indeed, if that is the case, we can say that all the eclipses from 194 to 175 B.C. were recorded. There is however no other reason for adopting this date. The juxtaposition of this eclipse in the "Annals" with an earthquake, the death of a pretended child of Emperor Hui, Pu-yi, a flood, and a star seen in daytime (3: 3a, b) make it look as though someone thought that an eclipse was due because of the Empress Dowager's actions, and inserted it into the annals Pan Ku was using to supplement the SC. The latter does not have any of these five calamities, although it elsewhere records the death (with a different month) in its "Tables" (17: 8b). If this listing is an insertion, I do not think that we can blame it upon Pan Ku; the great exactness of the HS's list of eclipses in the latter half of Former Han times and his rejection of the eclipse listed in 157 B.C. just before the death of Emperor Wen (cf. ch. 4: App. III, vi), shows that Pan Ku did not unwarrantly insert eclipses into his History. Possibly some particularly bold government official manufactured this eclipse to express his dislike of the Empress Dowager's rule and reported it. If so, his deed, if detected, would have brought him capital punishment; during the reign of Emperor P'ing, Kung-sun Hung was accused of having falsely reported a lesser calamityâthat a fire had damaged government buildingsâand was imprisoned and executed (cf. 100A: 5b). The report of a calamitous visitation was felt as a reflection upon the government, and was dangerous. Since at that time there was much criticism of the Empress Dowager's actions, some official might however have ventured to memorialize an eclipse. At that time the Han officials did not lack bravery. The foregoing seems the best explanation of this eclipse. ii. In the seventh year, the first month, on the day chi-ch'ou, the last day of the month, a total eclipse is recorded (3: 4b). HS 27 Cb: 13b adds, "It was 9 degrees in [the constellation] Ying-shih [whose stars were then in 319.3Â° and 320.2Â° R.A.], [which constellation] is [taken to represent] the interior of the Palace chambers. At that time the 213APPENDIX Empress of Kao-[tsu] showed aversion from it and said, `This is for me.' The next year it was fulfilled," when the Empress Dowager died in the next year. It was indeed dramatic that the only solar eclipse total in Ch'ang-an for centuries should have come just before the death of the Empress Dowager. Hoang's calendar gives this date as March 4th, 181 B.C., for which Oppolzer lists his solar eclipse no. 2441. Computation of this eclipse shows that it was total in Ch'ang-an at 2:52 p.m., local time, although Oppolzer and Ginzel calculate the umbral path as passing through central China. The SC 9: 7b says, "In daytime it became dark." The sun was in longitude 340.7Â° = 342.3Â° R.A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">214 CHAPTER IV INTRODUCTION Pan Ku, in writing these annals of Emperor Wen's reign, was very conscious of the fact that he was also writing many Treatises and Memoirs which deal with the same period. He wished to avoid undue repetition, so put much of the material dealing with this period into those Treatises and Memoirs that naturally required it. He makes cross-references to the most important of those accounts. These Annals are accordingly not a complete account of the reign, but rather the annalistic background to a much longer history, together with an account of those events that do not fit better into the Treatises or Memoirs. Thus the great raid of the Huns in 166 B.C. is barely mentioned, for a full account is given in the "Memoir on the Huns." For a reader who has an adequate knowledge about the period, such as that to be gained from the Treatises and the Memoirs, this chapter sums up the period very well, since it sets every important event in its chronological relations, even though it does not always point out the significance of each event. This chapter should accordingly be read, not as an attempt at writing a modern history of the period, but for what it was intended to beâ an account of Emperor Wen together with a mention of the important events in the reign, which account is part of a much longer history that treats elsewhere of special subjects and of the important personages mentioned therein. For a partial summary of those events and personages, the reader is referred to the notes and the Glossary. *â*â* The chief source for this chapter was chapter X of the SC, which deals similarily with Emperor Wen's reign. That chapter has not however come down to us without changes. Into it there has been interpolated the eulogy from this chapter of the HS (cf. p. 272, n. 1); other changes may also have been made. Pan Ku however had the original of that chapter. He did not follow it slavishly; some material in it has been transferred to the relevant Treatises in the HS, for example the account of the circumstances leading up to the abrogation of the law considering wives and children as accomplices to a crime (cf. 4: 5b) and to the abolition of mutilating punishments (cf. 4: 14b). In other cases, material 215INTRODUCTION has been added. The SC omits altogether any mention of years Ch'ien IV, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and Hou III, IV, V; the HS chronicles events in each of these years. Some interesting edicts have also been added, as for instance the ones on 4: 7a, b, and on 16b, 17a. Sometimes deliberate corrections have been made in the SC account. The long discussion concerning the appointment of an heir-apparent (4: 5b-6b) is given in the SC as a conversation between the Emperor and his officials; the HS quotes it as an exchange of written memorials and edicts. We know that the imperial court kept in its files duplicates of all imperial edicts, in order to check any forged edicts; cf. Glossary, sub Tou Ying. Pan Ku had access to the imperial records and probably compared the SC versions of these imperial edicts with the copies in the court files. Thus from them he added the statement that this discussion was taken from written, not oral documents. This change thus shows his care and faithfulness to his sources. Pan Ku probably also had available some sort of annals kept at the imperial court, which listed such events as the Emperor's travels in and out of the Palace and also portents, eclipses, drouths, earthquakes, deaths of emperors, empresses, vassal kings, lieutenant chancellors, etc. The material in the HS annals for the years omitted in the SC account can be traced to such annals and to what would be found in the imperial edicts of those years. These palace annals were probably distinct from the source from which was taken the chronological record of officials in part B of chapter 19, for this record and the rest of the HS partly duplicate, usually supplement, and occasionally contradict each other. Pan Ku's chapter on Emperor Wen is thus not a copy of the chapter in the SC, but an independent composition, which took that chapter of the SC as its principal source, copying it verbatim where it did not need correction, because that was the best means of securing an accurate record, just as the SC had previously copied its source material. Sources were not mentioned by either author, for history was not written to credit sources, but to give facts. *â*â* Emperor Wen came to the throne under exceptionally favorable circumstances, for he was chosen for the place by the most influential persons in the empire, who consequently took the responsibility for him. Hsiao-hui, Kao-tsu's heir, together with Hsiao-hui's descendants, had all died; the attempt of the Empress Dowager nÃ©e LÃ¼ to continue her family's influence by enthroning spurious sons of Hsiao-hui had been frustrated by the action of Kao-tsu's immediate followers, who were her 216CHAPTER IV high officials. After the massacre of the LÃ¼ clan, the high officials and the leaders of the imperial clan gathered in conclave at the capital. Liu Chiao, Kao-tsu's sole surviving brother, was old and possibly ill, for he died the next year. He remained in his kingdom of Ch'u. The other leaders of the clan were all there: the wife of Liu Po, Kao-tsu's oldest brother, who was the chief priestess in the ancestral worship, the wife of Liu Chung, Kao-tsu's next oldest brother, and Kao-tsu's cousin, Liu Tse, the oldest active male member of the clan. The choice lay between Liu Hsiang, King of Ch'i, the oldest son of Kao-tsu's oldest son, and Liu Heng, King of Tai, Kao-tsu's oldest living son. The latter was chosen, because his mother's family had not the unpleasant reputation possessed by that of Liu Hsiang. Primogeniture was thus considered as merely an important, but not a necessary requirement for the succession. Liu Heng showed the proper reluctance to accept the throne and was duly installed. He was personally a modest and unaffected young man in his twenty-second year, who had already reigned as King of Tai to the seventeenth year. His character is perhaps best shown in his edicts, which deserve to rank among the greatest official pronouncements of all time. Pan Ku esteemed them highly, for he quoted them extensively. The edict ordering the cessation of prayers for the Emperor's personal happiness (4: 15b), that on the peace with the Huns (4: 17a, b), and the very remarkable testimentary edict (4: 19a-21a) are especially noteworthy. Emperor Wen accepted whole-heartedly the Confucian doctrine that the ruler exists for the welfare of his subjects and put that doctrine into practise. He reduced the taxes and lightened the burdens of the people, economizing in his personal expenses and avoiding any grand displays. One later story is that he even attended court wearing straw sandals! He asked the people for criticism of his rule (in his case this request was sincerely meant) and he sought for capable commoners to assist in the administration. He ordered the various divisions of the empire to recommend their best men to the imperial court, and selected amongst them by a written examination. These recommendations and examinations seem not however to have occurred regularly, but only when there was a special imperial call. Emperor Wen stressed agriculture by his personal example in the sacred field and by his edicts, and was much worried by famine and scarcity, even going so far as to abolish the land tax on cultivated fields (soon revived by his successor). While he was thus personally a Confucian in his belief and government, he was no bigot. He established Erudits for the non-Confucian philosophies; candidates studied these philosophies as well as the Confucian teachings; Chia Yi 217INTRODUCTION was at first the only Confucian Erudit at his court (cf. 36: 32b). Yet as a result of Emperor Wen's personal influence, Confucianism was given such a preponderant influence that the prohibition by Emperor Wu in 141 B.C. of non-Confucian philosophies was a natural consequence. During this reign, the Huns began making serious inroads after having been quiescant during the preceding two short reigns. Kao-tsu had had trouble with them, and had made peace with them, cementing it by sending a princess of the imperial family to be a wife of the Hun emperor, the Shan-yÃ¼. In 177 B.C. the Huns invaded the Chinese borders and occupied Ordos. After the death of Mao-tun, the greatest Shan-yÃ¼, which happened soon after 174 B.C., the Huns, in the winter of 167/6 B.C., made their greatest raid. Hsiao-wen's pacifistic policy of economizing seems to have left him without adequate defense or they found a lightly defended road around his defenses; led by the Shan-yÃ¼, thousands of Hun horsemen came south through the passes in the present eastern Kansuh, down the Chien and Wei River valleys, where they burnt the Hui-chung Palace, and rode to Kan-ch'Ã¼an, in sight of Ch'ang-an. Emperor Wen immediately made strenuous efforts for defence, and the Huns left. In 162 B.C. peace was made with them, but in the winter of 159/8 they raided again. During this period there were thus begun the sporadic invasions by the Huns which were to lead to the military expeditions of Emperor Wu. The only rebellion during this period was that of Liu Hsing-chÃ¼, King of Chi-pei, who believed himself inadequately rewarded for having previously taken the lead in eliminating the power of the LÃ¼ clan. This rebellion was quickly put down. It made Chia Yi realize the danger of vassal kingdoms, and he advised the Emperor to divide up the great fiefs in order to weaken their power. Emperor Wen rejected his advice, but in 164 B.C. he quietly began putting it into effect, dividing up two kingdoms among nine scions of their kingly families. This policy was continued, urged by Chao Ts'o, and led to the rebellion of the Seven States in the next reign. Eventually this policy so enfeebled the power of the imperial clan that Emperor Wu could at one stroke dismiss with impunity half of the marquises who were members of the imperial clan. The superstitious practises which were to deface Emperor Wu's reign likewise began with Emperor Wen. He was doubtless a personally devout man who accepted the universal belief that the gods could be influenced by certain practises. The periodic famines natural to north China were thought to come from the anger of the gods; Emperor Wen, in his efforts to aid his people, was thus drawn into special religious practises for the cultivation of the divine favor upon his people. In 218CHAPTER IV 166 B.C. he increased the sacrifices. Adventurers took advantage of this religious propensity: Kung-sun Ch'en and Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing encouraged him to extend the imperial worship and formulated the new rites required. The latter person led the Emperor into other superstitious practises, making a yellow dragon appear, hiding and dramatically finding a jade cup inscribed, "Prolongued life to the Lord of Men," and also hiding a three-legged cauldron at Fen-yin, which, when found, would appear to be a lost cauldron of the Chou dynasty. He conducted an unsuccessful search for it; it came to light only much later, in 113 B.C., when it made a great stir. He is said to have seen the sun twice at its zenith on the same day, and as a consequence to have induced Emperor Wen to begin again the numbering of the years of his reign. Although Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing's deceits were discovered and he was executed in 164 B.C., the precedent had been set of an emperor favoring those who could bring special favors from the gods or spirits. Emperor Wu brought it to fruition. Emperor Wen's reign was thus a period of beginnings: of the Confucian influence, of trouble with the Huns, of the division of fiefs, and of important imperial superstition. It was the first really long reign in the dynasty and it established many of the practises of the dynasty. It was thus natural that this Emperor should have been posthumously entitled the Great Exemplar of Emperors. Personally Liu Heng was an admirable, though not entirely perfect character. He is generally considered to have been one of the best rulers of China. He showed genuine statesmanship. Thus he ended the desultory war and rebellion of the kingdom of Nan-yÃ¼eh without any fighting: he found in north China the cousins of its ruler, Chao T'o, made large gifts to them and cared splendidly for the tomb of Chao T'o's parents, then, in a tactful letter, he set forth satisfactory boundaries for Nan-yÃ¼eh and told its ruler that there could not be two emperors in the world. Chao T'o promptly changed his own title from that of Emperor to King and acknowledged himself a subject of Emperor Wen. The latter had so arranged matters that by so doing Chao T'o would gain much and lose nothing except an empty title and a tribute which was repaid by gifts from the imperial court. Thus Liu Heng strove by all means to maintain peace. He honestly worked for the best interests of his people and set their advantage above his own. He sought for and accepted even the severest criticism. He discouraged corruption and restrained the severity of his officials, so that capital punishment became a rare thing. He ameliorated the severities of the law, abolishing mutilating punishments and 219INTRODUCTION other unnecessary cruelties. He established old-age pensions. Hence the country became prosperous and there were made the accumulations of wealth and population which enabled Emperor Wu to conquer the surrounding world. Emperor Wen tried to maintain an even-handed justice, even getting his mother's younger brother, Po Chao, who had been responsible for the murder of an imperial attendant, to commit suicide. Yet he does not seem to have punished his own Heir-apparent, Liu Ch'i, when the latter killed his cousin, Liu Hsien, in a drunken dispute over precedence while gambling. While Liu Heng seems to have been a morally admirable, yet slightly weak character, it is only his due that he has been extravagently admired ever since. 221 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] CHAPTER IV THE FOURTH [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [Emperor Hsiao-]Wen Emperor Hsiao-wen was a son of Kao-tsu, neither the oldest nor the youngest. His mother was called the Concubine1 1 She is entitled here a yi . Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) writes, "The Han Ch'ih-lu Ling [prob. written in Han times, now lost] and the Mao-ling-shu [lost before 312] both [say that the yi was] an official in the court, ranking as equivalent to a position of two thousand piculs, in position next below the Favorite Beauty [cf. Glossary sub voce] and above the Eighth [Rank] Ladies [fourth rank concubines]." Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says that yi is merely a complimentary term for `concubine', not an official title, for HS 97A: 2a enumerates the ranks in the imperial harem, but does not mention any rank yi. Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265) says, " is pronounced yi2 and is a common term for the ordinary concubines," on which statement Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) remarks, "At the time of the Six Dynasties [265-618], people called their fathers' concubines yi2, which is this word. But they did not know that had the pronunciation yi2, hence they changed the writing [of the word] to ." Li Tz'u-ming (1829-1894) adds, " meaning concubine has one signification; [the same word] meaning a surname is a different signification. These two significations have the different pronunciations [yi and chi]. [Fu] Tsan's explanation was based upon the official documents of his [own] time; how could he have imaginatively fabricated it?" Ch. 97 also uses yi as a title; the mother of Emperor Ching's heir was at first styled the Yi nÃ©e Wang. For names of persons, places, and official titles, cf. the Glossary. [nÃ©e] Po. In the eleventh 196 B.C. year of Kao-tsu,2 2 Cf. 1B: 17a. Ch'en Hsi was not killed until the end of 196 B.C., in the twelfth year, but Liu Heng was made King of Tai in Feb./Mar. 196 B.C., in the eleventh year. [Emperor Kao-tsu] executed Ch'en Hsi, pacified the region of Tai, and made [his 1b son Heng3 3 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the YÃ¼eh ed. (xi-xii cent.) contains the words , which have been translated in brackets. Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768) says that the Academy ed. (1124) also contains these words, but that the Sung Ch'i ed. (xi or xii cent.) does not. He says that these words are not original, because the annals of an emperor do not use his given name, since it became taboo when he ascended the throne. ] the King of Tai, with his capital at 222HSIAO-WEN 180 B.C. 180 B.C. Chung-tu. In the seventeenth year [of Liu Heng's 4:1b Aug. 18 reign as King of Tai], in the autumn, the Empress of Kao-[tsu] died. The [members of] the LÃ¼ [clan] plotted to make a rebellion, wishing to endanger the Liu clan, [but] the Lieutenant Chancellor, Ch'en P'ing, the Grand Commandant, Chou P'o, the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, Liu Chang, and others together executed them, [then] planned to set up the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, as the next emperor]. A discussion [of the 3:5b-8a foregoing matters] is found in the "Annals of the Empress of Kao-[tsu]" and in the "Memoirs of the 38:3b-6b Five Kings [Who Were Sons of] Kao-[tsu]." The great officials thereupon sent some people to invite the King of Tai to come. His Chief of the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace, Chang Wu,1 1 Chang Wu later became a general against the Huns. Chief of the Gentlemen-atthe-Palace was the title given him after Liu Heng had ascended the throne as Emperor (cf. 4: 4b), but the vassal courts had functionaries with the same titles as those used in the imperial court, so that Chang Wu might possibly have had this title in the state of Tai before he went to the capital. and others discussed [the matter] and all said, "The great officials of the Han [court] were all generals of the time of the deceased Emperor Kao-[tsu], are experienced in military affairs, and [use] many stratagems and deceits. Their intentions [may] not stop with this [proposal]. They feared only the majesty of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the Empress Dowager [nÃ©e] LÃ¼. Now they have executed the [members of the LÃ¼ [clan] and have newly tasted blood2 2 Those bound together by an oath sealed the oath by annointing their lips with the blood of a victim. Cf. Mh II, 414, n. 1; SC ch. 76. The SC ch. 10 writes ch'ieh-hs?eh and the HS writes tieh-hsÃ¼eh . The two phrases have the same meaning. There are however two interpretations of this phrase. (1) Chavannes (Mh II, 414 &amp; n. 1), following Yen Shih-ku, translates the phrase "march in blood." Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says, " should be pronounced tieh, the tieh meaning `to trample on,' " and Ju Shun says, "When, in killing people, a vast amount of blood is shed it is tieh-hsÃ¼eh," so that Yen Shih-ku seemingly has grounds for his statement. (2) Nevertheless Chou Shou-ch'ang (18141884) writes, "In my opinion, tieh is itself the tieh [in the phrase] ch'ieh-tieh . It is used in HS ch. 57 and the commentator says, `It means the noise made by fowl when eating.' Its derived meaning is tieh-hsÃ¼eh, and it is interpreted `to taste with the mouth.' SC ch. 90 says tieh-hsÃ¼eh and the Shih-chi Chi-chieh [written by P'ei Yin, fl. 465-472] quotes Hsu Kuang (352-425) [as saying], `Tieh is also written ch'ieh,' which is sufficient proof that these two characters were originally interchanged. But [which Fu Ch'ien used to give the pronunciation of tieh, and which Yen Shih-ku and Chavannes misunderstood to give the meaning of tieh] has the radical , and HsÃ¼ Shen [fl. 100] interprets it as `trample.' So cannot be written as ." Then tieh-hsÃ¼eh does not mean "to march in blood." Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) approves of Chou Shou-ch'ang's interpretation. in the 223HSIAO-WEN 4:1b capital. They use [this] invitation to you, great 180 B.C. King, as a pretext; in reality they cannot be trusted. We hope that you will announce yourself ill and not go [to the capital], in order to watch their moves." The Palace Military Commander [of Tai], Sung 2a Ch'ang, stepped forward and said, "The opinion of the courtiers is wrong. When the Ch'in [dynasty] lost its control, braves and heroes arose together, each one [of whom] thought he would obtain [the imperial throne]âthey could be counted by the ten thousands. Nevertheless the person who finally mounted the throne of the Son of Heaven was of the Liu clan. [These ambitious people of] the world have given up any hopes [of attaining that throne. The foregoing is] the first point. "The Emperor Kao-[tsu] made kings of his sons and kinsmen. Their territories interlock like the teeth of a dog;1 1 I.e., irregularily interlocking. Cf. Mh II, 445, n. 2. they are what may be called, `being founded on a rock.'2 2 The Chinese figure of speech is quite parallel to the Jewish figure used in the translation. The figure implies that the establishment of the dynasty is as secure as if it were held down by a large mill-stone. Cf. Mh II, 445, n. 3. The world has submitted to their power. [The foregoing is] the second point. "When the Han [dynasty] arose, it did away with the vexatiousness and harshness of the Ch'in [dynasty], reduced [the number of] their laws and ordinances,3 3 Cf. 1A: 20a, b. and showed its virtue and bounty.4 4 A quotation from 1A: 30b, which passage explains it. 224HSIAO-WEN 180 B.C. Everyone is satisfied, and it would be hard to move 4:2a or shake [them from their allegiance to the Han dynasty. The foregoing is] the third point. "Moreover, although, by means of her power, the Empress Dowager [nÃ©e] LÃ¼ established three kings from the LÃ¼ [clan] and arrogated to herself the [imperial] power, [issuing imperial] decrees on her own authority, yet when the Grand Commandant [Chou P'o] by means of one credential entered the Northern Army and once gave a call, the soldiers all bared their left arms1 1 Cf. 3: 7a. [to show that they were] for the Liu clan, rebelled against the LÃ¼ [clan], and finally, for this reason, exterminated [the LÃ¼ clan]. This [triumph] then was bestowed by Heaven, it was not [achieved] by human power. Although the great officials should now wish to do something else [than seat as emperor a scion of the Liu clan], the people would not permit themselves to be used by them; how could their faction [seize] the sole power? Inside [the capital] there are your relatives, [the Marquis of] Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu Chang], and [the Marquis of] Tung-mou, [Liu Hsing-chÃ¼]; outside [the capital they would have to] fear the power of [the kingdoms of] Wu, Ch'u, Huai-nan, Lang-ya, Ch'i, and Tai.2 2 The King of Wu was Liu P'i, a first cousin of Liu Heng; the King of Ch'u was Liu Chiao, his uncle; the King of Huai-nan was Liu Ch`ang, his half-brother; the King of Lang-ya was Liu Tse, a cousin; the King of Ch'i was Liu Hsiang, a nephew; Tai was his own kingdom. Just now of the sons of the Emperor Kao-[tsu], there are only the King of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang] and yourself, great King. You, great King, are moreover the elder [of the two]. Your ability, your sageness, your paternal love, and your filial piety are known all over the world; hence the great officials are following the hopes of the world in desiring to welcome and establish you, great King, [on the imperial throne]. You, great King, should not have any doubts." 225HSIAO-WEN 4:2a The King of Tai reported [the matter] to his Queen 180 B.C. Dowager. They discussed it, [but] hesitated and did not reach a decision. [Then] they divined about it by means of the tortoise-shell. The lines obtained1 1 Ying Shao (fl. ca. 140-206) says, "When a tortoise [is used], [divination] is called ; when stalks of plants [are used], it is called . In divination by the tortoise one uses a rod to make the tortoise-[shell] glow; the lines were exactly transversal." were the `great transversal.' The interpretation was: "The `great transversal' [means] a great change. 2b I [the recipient of the oracle] will be the Heavenly King. [Emperor] Ch'i of the Hsia [dynasty] thereby [likewise] glorified [his ancestors by continuing the dynasty]."2 2 These three lines rime and are each of four characters. They seem to be a passage quoted from an ancient and lost book of divination in which this response is mentioned as having been given to King Ch'i of the Hsia dynasty. That there were other books of divination using the hexagrams besides the ones that have come down to us is shown by a tablet of the first cent. B.C., containing an interpretation of one of the hexagrams, which interpretation is not found in Book of Changes (cf. Chavannes, Documents chinois decouverts par Aurel Stein, p. 25). The last word of the first line should be pronounced kang to complete the rime. Karlgren, Analytic Dictionary, 316, gives the T'ang pronunciation kang. The meaning of the first line is obscure. Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says that the last two characters mean "crosswise." Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) says, "Transversal lines [mean] `there was not a thought but did him homage' [Book of Odes III, I, x, 6, (Legge, p. 463)]. Keng is to change. It says that he should leave [the condition of] a noble and ascend the imperial throne. Before this time, when the Five Emperors ruled the world and [became] aged, they resigned [the throne] to a capable [person]. In the time of [Emperor] Ch'i of the Hsia [dynasty], [the son of the great YÃ¼], for the first time [a father] passed on his title [to his son, Emperor Ch'i], and was moreover able to rule gloriously over the patrimony founded by his deceased lord. Emperor Wen also succeeded to the heritage of his father. It says that he is one like [Emperor] Ch'i." Cf. Mh II, 447, n. 1. Chavannes remarks that in the Tso-chuan, the phrase "the Heavenly King " always refers to the son of Heaven of the Chou dynasty. Cf. Mh II, 447, n. 2. The King of Tai said, "I am of course already a king; how could I again be made a king?" The diviner replied, "By this phrase, `the Heavenly King,' is [meant] however the Son of Heaven." 226HSIAO-WEN 180 B.C. Thereupon the King of Tai then sent Po Chao, the 4:2b younger brother of his Queen Dowager, to see the Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o. [Chou] P'o and the others told him all their reasons for inviting and seating the King [of Tai on the imperial throne.1 1 We have emended to in accordance with the suggestion of Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922), for the SC reads the latter character and Yen Shih-ku uses it in his explanation, so that it was in his text. The reason the great ministers had for selecting Kao-tsu's younger son rather than his eldest grandson, the King of Ch'i, was that they feared the family of the wife of the King of Ch'i would cause such trouble as the LÃ¼ family had caused. Cf. Mh II, 439. Po] Chao returned and reported, "They are indeed trustworthy. There is nothing suspicious." The King of Tai laughingly said to Sung Ch'ang, "It is really as you, sir, said." Then he ordered Sung Ch'ang to be his Chariot Companion, Chang Wu and others, six persons in all, to ride in six `riding chariots,'2 2 Cf. p. 107, n. 3. and went to Ch'ang-an. When he came to Kao-ling, he stopped and sent Sung Ch'ang ahead to Ch'ang-an to observe how things had turned. When [Sung] Ch'ang reached the Wei [River] Bridge, all [the officials, including] the Lieutenant Chancellor and [those ranking] below [him], welcomed [Sung] Ch'ang. He returned and 3a reported; then the King of Tai advanced to the Wei [River] Bridge. [There] the officials bowed and paid their respects to him, calling themselves his subjects. The King of Tai got down [from his carriage] and bowed to them. The Grand Commandant, [Chou] P'o, advanced and said, "I wish to beg for a word in private." Sung Ch'ang replied, "If what you have to say is of public [interest], say it publicly; if what you have to say is of private [concern], a [true] king has no private [interests]." The Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o then knelt and offered the imperial seal [and credentials3 3 The SC and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) at this point adds the word ; later in this passage (p. 4a) the HS also has it; hence it was originally in the text here, according to Wang Hsien-ch'ien. ] of the Son of Heaven. The 227HSIAO-WEN 4:3a King of Tai refused them and said, "Let us go 180 B.C. to the prince's lodge1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "The sojourning quarters at the capital for those at court from commanderies or kingdoms are usually named [the princes' lodges]. This word [means] to arrive, meaning the place to which one comes." Cf. Mh II, 412, n. 1. and discuss this matter." In the intercalary month on [the day] chi-yu,2 2 This was 48 days after the LÃ¼ family had been exterminated. [the Nov. 14 King of Tai, Liu Heng,] entered the prince's lodge of Tai. The courtiers followed him to [the lodge]. They presented [the results of] their discussion, saying, "The Lieutenant Chancellor your subject [Ch'en] P'ing, the Grand Commandant your subject [Chou] P'o, the General-in-chief your subject [Kuan Ying3 3 The text writes at this point Wu. The SC 10: 3b writes Ch'en Wu . Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says this is Ch'ai Wu , for on p. 12a, Ch'ai Wu is said to have been made Commander-in-chief in 177 B.C. In the passage corresponding to p. 12a, the SC and the Han-ti Nien-chi (before 275) both write Ch'en Wu; Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) says that he had two surnames. But Ch'en (or Ch'ai) Wu did not become General-in-chief until three years after this time. LÃ¼ Ch'an had made Kuan Ying General-in-chief and sent him to attack the army of Ch'i; he however revolted against the LÃ¼ family and joined the Liu cabal; cf. 3: 5b. Hence he is the person who had this title at this time and should be mentioned here. Because he was appointed by the LÃ¼ family, who were usurpers, he is not mentioned in the table of officials in 19B: 6b. In the distribution of rewards (cf. 4: 5a, b) "General Kuan Ying" was awarded a territory of 3000 families and the equivalent of 2000 catties of gold. Hence we are fairly safe in following Ch'ien Ta-chao in saying that the HS has made a slip here. ], the Grandee Secretary your subject [Chang] Ts'ang, the Superintendant of the Imperial House your subject [Liu] Ying-[k'o], the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼ 3b your subject [Liu] Chang, the Marquis of Tung-mou your subject [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, and the Director of Guests your subject [Liu] Chieh, making repeated obeisances, say to your Highness the great King: the [Imperial] Sons [LÃ¼] Hung and the others are all not sons of Emperor Hsiao-hui and have no right to have charge of [the worship in] the [imperial] ancestral temples. Your subjects have 228HSIAO-WEN 180 B.C. respectfully begged the Marquise of Yin-an, the 4:3b Queen of King Ch'ing,1 1 The SC So-yin (by Szu-ma Cheng, fl. 713-742) says that Su Ling (fl. 196-227), HsÃ¼ Kuang (352-425) and Wei Chao (197-273/4) think that the Marquise of Yin-an and the Queen of King Ch'ing were different persons; Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) and Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) agree, because the SC, by adding the words "the Marquis" before the name of King Ch'ing makes it plain that they were two persons. Szu-ma Cheng explains that King Ch'ing, Liu Chung, was, at his death, merely a marquis, since he had resigned his kingdom. (Cf. Mh II, 449, n. 2.) Su Ling says that the Marquise of Yin-an was "the wife of Kao-tsu's eldest brother, Liu Po, and the mother of [Liu Hsin, who was] the Marquis of Keng-chieh," and that the Queen of King Ch'ing was "the wife of Kao-tsu's elder brother, Liu Chung." HS 36: 2a also tells that the mother of Liu Hsin, the Marquis of Keng-chieh, was the wife of Liu Po. Ju Shun however identifies this Marquise and the Queen as the same person. He says, "When the Queen of King Ch'ing was appointed as the Marquise of Yin-an, LÃ¼ HsÃ¼ was the Marquise of Lin-kuang and the wife of Hsiao Ho was also the Marquise of Tso. Moreover the Table of marquises of the imperial family [ch. 15] has no Marquis [or Marquise] of Yin-an for this period, so that we can thereby know that she was the Queen of King Ch'ing. In my opinion the chief priestess [in the ancestral sacrifices] at the Han [temple] was the Marquise of Yin-an, the wife of Emperor Kao-[tsu's] older brother." It is however possible that the absence of this marquise's name from the table of marquises is because of her sex; we have followed the majority of the commentators in considering them as two persons. Chavannes disagrees. the King of Lang-ya [Liu Tse], the marquises, and the officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs to discuss [this matter, and we all say]: You, great King, are the son of the Emperor Kao-[tsu] and are the proper [person] to be his successor. We hope that you, great King, will take the throne of the Son of Heaven." The King of Tai replied, "The upholding [of the worship] in the Temple of Emperor Kao-[tsu] and the [imperial] ancestral temples is a weighty matter. 4a I am lacking in ability and am not the person suitable [for this task]. I hope that you will ask the King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao]2 2 Liu Chiao, a younger brother of Kao-tsu, was the then oldest male member of the imperial family. Cf. Mh II, 450, n. 1. He was not mentioned in the memorial asking Liu Heng to take the throne, probably because he was ill and not in the capital. Ho Ch'uo says that this request to consult Liu Chiao is according to the proprieties, for "the Marquise of Yin-an [the wife of Kao-tsu's oldest brother] and the Queen of King Ch'ing [the wife of Kao-tsu's second older brother] were both women and the King of Lang-ya, [Lin Tse], was a distant relative." to consider who is suitable. I personally do not dare to undertake [this task]." 229HSIAO-WEN 4:4a While all the courtiers prostrated themselves and 180 B.C. insistently begged him, the King of Tai, [Liu Heng, then] facing the west, refused thrice, and, when facing the south, refused twice.1 1 Ju Shun says, "Someone says that the seats of guest and host face east and west; the seats of prince and minister face south and north." Hu San-hsing (1230-1287) contradicts the opinion of Ju Shun (which Chavannes adopted, cf. Mh II, 450, n. 2) to the effect that Liu Heng, by turning towards the south, was showing himself more complaisant to his subject's wishes. He says, "Probably when the King entered the prince's lodge of Tai, the courtiers of the Han court followed and came to the King, and he treated them in accordance with the proprieties of guest and host, hence he faced west, and when the courtiers urged him to take a higher position, he refused thrice. The courtiers thereupon supported the King to a seat facing due south, [south is the direction the emperor's throne always faces], and the King again refused twice. Therefore the turning to the south was not what the King could help, but the courtiers, supporting him, made him face south. If we assume that he eagerly seated himself facing the south, would that have been possible?" The Lieutenant Chancellor, [Ch'en] P'ing, and the others all said, "Your subjects have humbly deliberated over this [matter]. You, great King, are the most suitable and capable [person] to receive [charge of] the Temple of Kao-tsu and the [imperial] ancestral temples. Even though the nobles and the people of the world all consider you suitable, we, your servants, who have been planning for the sake of the [dynasty's] ancestral temples and the [dynasty's] gods of the soils and grains, have not dared to be careless. We hope that you, great King, will favor us by listening to your servants. Your servant, respectfully holding the seals and the credentials of the Son of Heaven, making repeated obeisances, presents them [to you]." The King of Tai said, "If the imperial house, the generals, the chancellors, the kings, and the marquises consider that there is no one2 2 Reading for in accordance with the SC and the suggestion of Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832). more suitable than myself, I would not dare to refuse." Thereupon he took the throne of the son of Heaven. 230HSIAO-WEN 180 B.C. The courtiers arranged themselves by him in 4:4a accordance with their rank. They sent the Chief of the Stud, [Hsia-hou] Ying, and the Marquis of Tung-mou, [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, first to clear1 1 According to 38:7a, Liu Hsing-chÃ¼ especially asked to go with Hsia-hou Ying and clear the palace. Ying Shao says, "According to the old code, to whatever place the Son of Heaven is to go and favor by visiting it, there must first be sent the Chief Forerunner [cf. Han-kuan Ta-wen, 3: 11b] to go and investigate, to clear and pacify the [Palace] Hall in order to take precautions against untoward events." According to the SC (cf. Mh II, 440 f), the Young Emperor was still living in the forbidden apartments of the palace, and had to be ejected. He was moved to the apartments of the Privy Treasurer and killed later in the night after Emperor Wen had taken the throne. the 4b palace. [Then] they presented the prescribed equipage for the Son of Heaven2 2 Ju Shun says, "The prescribed equipage is with the Palace Attendants, the [imperial] Chariot Companion, and the [Chief Commandant] Custodian of the [Imperial] Equipages and the Gentlemen driving 36 auxiliary carriages." and went to meet [the new Emperor] at the Prince's Lodge of Tai. The Nov. 14 Emperor, on the same day, at sundown, entered the Wei-yang Palace. That night he installed Sung Ch'ang as General of the Guards, commanding the Southern and Northern Armies, and Chang Wu as Chief of the Gentlemenat-the-Palace. [The Emperor] walked through the [Palace] Halls, [then] returned and seated himself [on the throne] in the Front Hall, and issued an edict, which said, "An imperial edict of decree3 3 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the Ching-te ed. (1004-1005) does not have the words . The SC also does not have them nor the three titles following them. These titles have probably the same significance as the titles in the edict on 1B: 17b, 18a. to the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en P'ing], the Grand Commandant [Chou P'o], and the Grandee Secretary [Chang Ts'ang]. In the interval [since the last legitimate ruler], the LÃ¼ [clan] has been directing affairs, arbitrarily assuming the [imperial] authority, and plotting to commit treason, [thereby] seeking to 231HSIAO-WEN 4:4b endanger the ancestral temples of the Liu clan. 180 B.C. Thanks to the generals, the chancellors, the marquises, the imperial house, and the great ministers, [the LÃ¼ clan] have been executed and have all suffered for their crimes.1 1 Cf. Mh II, 124, n. 1. We have newly ascended the throne. Let there be an amnesty [granted] to the world and let there be granted to the common people one step in [noble] rank and to the women of a hundred households an ox and wine, and [let there be universal] drinking for five days."2 2 It has been debated just who these women were. Yao Ts'a (533-606) thinks that they were the wives of those who were granted ranks. Li Hsien (651-684) thinks they were families of women which had no male members: in those families which had males, the head of the family was given a rank; to those families which had no males, meat and wine were given. But Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831) replies that there would be few families without male members, so that it would be difficult to divide an ox among them. No amount of meat and wine is specified; in SC 28:32b it is said, "To a hundred families, one ox and 10 piculs of wine." Cf. Mh II, 503. Possibly the emperor wanted everyone to enjoy himself, so, as Su Lin (fl. 196-227) said, "To the men were granted noble ranks [Yen Shih-ku explains that the head of the household received the step; 2: 4a says that one step in rank was given to a family] and to the women were granted an ox and wine [for the families to enjoy]." This practise was later common, cf. 6: 27a, 32a, 36a, etc. Cf. Mh II, 452, n. 1. Wen Ying (fl. ca. 196-220) says, "[According to] the Han Code, when three or more people gather to drink wine without [adequate] motive, they shall be fined [the equivalent of] four taels of gold." The Emperor's edict permitting drinking was then an extraordinary privilege. Cf. Mh II, 452, n. 2. The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the Nan ed. (ca. x-xii cent.) and the Chekiang ed. (xi-xii cent.) read instead of . 5a In his first year, in the winter, the tenth month, I on [the day] hsin-hai, the Emperor was presented in Nov. 16 the temple of Kao-[tsu].3 3 This was the second day after the emperor had entered the capital and taken the throne. The presentation in the imperial ancestral temple was an important feature of the coronation. He sent the General of Chariots and Cavalry Po Chao to go to the Empress Dowager at Tai and invite her [to come to the capital]. An imperial edict said, "Formerly LÃ¼ Ch'an set himself up as Chancellor of State, [set up] LÃ¼ Lu 232HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 180 B.C. as First [Ranking] General and unauthorizedly sent 4:5a General Kuan Ying with troops to attack [the army of] Ch'i, wishing to substitute [the LÃ¼ clan] for the Liu clan. [Kuan] Ying remained at Jung-yang and planned in unison with the nobles to execute the LÃ¼ clan. LÃ¼1 1 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the Nan ed. (x-xii cent.) and the Chekiang ed. (xi-xii cent.) omit the surname here. Ch'an wished to do evil things, [but] the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en] P'ing together with the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o and others planned to snatch away the army of [LÃ¼] Ch'an and the others. The Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, 5b [Liu] Chang, was at the head [of the cabal] and first arrested and beheaded [LÃ¼] Ch'an; the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o in person led the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, [Chi] T'ung, who held a credential and bore a [false] imperial edict [ordering Chou P'o] to enter [and take command of] the Northern Army.2 2 For these events, cf. 3: 5b ff. The Director of Guests [Liu] Chieh took away LÃ¼3 3 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the Nan ed. and the Chekiang ed. omit the surname here. Lu's seal. Let there be added to the estate of the Grand Commandant [Chou] P'o ten thousand households and [let him be] granted [the equivalent of] five thousand catties of gold; to the estate of the Lieutenant Chancellor [Ch'en] P'ing and of General [Kuan] Ying each [let there be added] three thousand households and [let them be granted the equivalent of] two thousand catties of gold; to the estates of the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu] Chang, the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, [Chi] T'ung, [and the Marquis of Tung-mou, Liu Hsing-chÃ¼],4 4 The SC at this point adds "of the Marquis of Tung-mou, Liu Hsing-chÃ¼." HS 38: 6b also states that Liu Hsing-chÃ¼ was made the same grant as Liu Chang; those six words seem to have dropped out of the HS text. to each [let there be added] two thousand households and [let them be granted the equivalent of] a 233HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 4:5b thousand catties of gold. Let the Director of Guests 180 B.C. [Liu] Chieh be appointed as the Marquis of Yanghsin and be granted [the equivalent of] a thousand catties of gold." In the twelfth month, [the Emperor] made [Liu] 179 B.C. Sui, the son of King Yu of Chao [Liu Yu], the King Jan./Feb. of Chao. He had shifted the King of Lang-ya, [Liu] Tse, to be the King of Yen.1 1 The SC dates this appointment on Nov. 15, two months previously. Possibly the HS mentions it now because of its importance in connection with the enlarging of Ch'i and Ch'u. Cf. n. 2. The territory that the LÃ¼ clan had taken away from [the kingdoms of] Ch'i and Ch'u was all returned to [those kingdoms].2 2 Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) says, "Liu Tse's kingdom, Lang-ya, was a commandery taken from Ch'i; when LÃ¼ T'ai was made King of LÃ¼ with P'eng-ch'eng as his kingdom, [his territory] was taken from Ch'u. Now the LÃ¼ family had been executed, the kingdom of LÃ¼ ended, and the appointment of [Liu] Tse shifted too, hence this territory was returned to Ch'i and Ch'u, to which it had previously [belonged]." Cf. 38: 6b. [The Emperor] completely abrogated all the statutes and orders for the arresting of wives and children and punishing them with [the criminal].3 3 Cf. Mh II, 454-455. The long edict in the SC accompanying this abrogation has been transferred in the HS to ch. 23. Ying Shao says, " [means] children . According to the Ch'in [dynasty] laws, when a person committed a crime they joined with him [in punishment] his house and family. Now [the Emperor] abrogated this law." Cf. 5: n. 2.1. The practise nevertheless continued; cf. 5: 4a. In the first month the [high] officials begged [the Feb./Mar. Emperor] to name his Heir-apparent soon, so as to honor the ancestral temples. His imperial edict read, "Since We are without virtue, the Lords on High and the gods have not enjoyed Our sacrifices4 4 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the Nan ed. and the Chekiang ed. do not have the character at this point; Wang Hsien-ch'ien adds that these editions are correct, for the SC is also without this character.

Now even if I cannot search through the 6a empire thoroughly for the [most] capable, sage, and virtuous man [to whom I might] resign the empire,5 5 The Emperor was thinking of the example given by Yao and Shun, who each passed over their children and appointed an able person from outside their family as their successor. But cf. Mh II, 455, n. 1. The SC does not have the word , so that this passage appears there as a speech of the Emperor. Probably this passage is taken from an exchange of edicts and memorials. It is then illuminating in that it shows the manner of intercourse between the officials and the emperor. 234HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 179 B.C. yet, to speak of appointing my Heir-apparent before- 4:6a hand is to double my lack of virtue. What shall I say to the empire [in justification of such an act]? Be satisfied [with the present situation]." The [high] officials replied, "To appoint an heir-apparent beforehand is the means whereby to be mindful of the ancestral temples and the gods of the soils and grains and not neglect the empire." The Emperor said, "The King of Ch'u [Liu Chiao] is my youngest uncle; since he is advanced in years, he has seen much of the justice and natural law of the world and has a clear understanding of the constitution of the state. The King of Wu [Liu P'i] is to Us as an older brother.1 1 Liu P'i was actually a cousin of the Emperor. He was the son of Liu Chung, an older brother of Kao-tsu. The King of Huai-nan [Liu Chang] is [Our] younger brother. All of them are embracing virtue. [If one of these three men] were made to reinforce Us, would not that be adequate [provision for upholding the ancestral temples and the gods]? Among the vassal kings, the imperial house, my older and younger brothers [and cousins], and my meritorious subjects, there are many who are capable and also virtuous and just; if you select one who is virtuous to reinforce [Us] in doing what We cannot accomplish, that would be a blessing from the gods of the soils and grains and a [piece of] good fortune for the empire. Now you do not select and present [one of them], but say that [the heir] must be [Our] son, [so that] people will think that We have neglected the capable and virtuous, think only2 2 The Sung Ch'i ed. reports that the YÃ¼eh ed. reads for ; Wang Hsien-ch'ien adds that that edition is wrong, for the SC reads as the text does here. of [Our] 235HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 4:6a sons, which is not the way to care about the empire. 179 B.C. We will certainly not adopt [this procedure]." The [high] officials insistently begged [the Emperor], saying, "In ancient times, when the Yin and Chou [dynasties] possessed their states, good order and peace [reigned], and they both [lasted] for almost a thousand years. [The reason that] none of [the dynasties] who possessed the empire [lasted] as long [as they]1 1 Cf. Mh II, 456, n. 2. is because they used this method. The source [of the practise] of always making one's successor a son is already very distant. Emperor 6b Kao-[tsu], who first pacified the empire and established the nobles, is the Great Founder of emperors. The vassal kings and marquises who first received their kingdoms are also the founders for their kingdoms. Their sons and grandsons will succeed them from generation to generation without end. This is the greatest moral and political principle in the world. Hence Emperor Kao-[tsu] established [this principle] in order that they might [continue] to govern the whole world. Now to pass by one who is suitable to be appointed and select someone else from the nobles or the imperial house is not the will of Emperor Kao-[tsu]. To deliberate over a change [of the heir] is inappropriate. Your son Ch'i2 2 Liu Ch'i was not the eldest son of the Emperor, for his first wife had had three sons, but she and her sons had all died before this time. Cf. Mh II, 496. Liu Ch'i later became the Emperor Ching. SC 10: 7a uses for his given name, because of the taboo on it; the HS mentions the name here and uses the same word again on p. 9a. Yet in the chapter on the Emperor Ching and in its later annals the HS rarely uses this word. Cf. 6: 24a, 8: 13a. Su YÃ¼ (fl. 1913) remarks that in Pan Ku's time the emperor was only distantly related to the emperors of the Former Han period, hence taboos were no longer stressed. The foregoing is typical of the way Szu-ma Ch'ien and Pan Ku regarded the taboo on the personal names of emperors. is your eldest; he is sincere,3 3 The SC and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) write ; the HS and the Han-chi (ii cent.) write the first character of this phrase . liberal, kind, and benevolent. 236HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 179 B.C. We beg that you appoint him as your Heir-appar- 4:6b ent." The Emperor thereupon consented [to do so]. Then he granted one step in noble rank to those people in the empire who would be the successors of their fathers. He appointed General Po Chao as Marquis of Chih. Apr./May In the third month, the [high] officials begged [the Emperor] to appoint the Empress. The Empress Dowager said, "[The Emperor] should make the mother of the Heir-apparent, [the lady] nÃ©e Tou,1 1 In Chou times the Empress was chosen for different reasons; cf. Mh II, 458 &amp; n. 1. the Empress." An imperial edict said, "Just now it is spring, when [nature] is harmonious, and the plants and trees and all living beings have means of enjoying themselves, yet [among] my subjects there are widowers, widows, 7a orphans, and childless, distressed and suffering people, and some at the point of death, but no one goes to look after their suffering. What should those who are the fathers and mothers of the common people2 2 The emperor and officials were supposed to be the fathers and mothers of the people. This phrase is used as early as the Book of History, V, iv, 16 (Legge, p. 333). This edict is merely summarized in the SC. Cf. Mh II, 458. This edict of an emperor the Chinese have considered "truly virtuous" deserves to be contrasted with the legendary reaction of Gautama the Buddha to his "four encounters" (sickness, age, death, and the hermit). Hsiao-wen tried to relieve suffering; Gautama concluded it was inevitable. This edict probably initiated the practise of government loans to poor people. do [about this situation]? Let it be discussed what are the means to aid and lend to them." [The edict] also said, "Unless the aged have silk,3 3 Cotton was not brought to China until later. Silk and linen (including hemp) were used for clothing. they will not be warm; unless they have meat, they will not be well-nourished. Now at the beginning of the year,4 4 This sentence might seem to contradict the conclusion arrived at in 1: App. II. But the emperor is not here thinking of the calendar year, since the edict was issued in the "third month." He is thinking of the seasons, which were thought to begin with the spring. if [We] do not at the right moment send 237HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 4:7a people to visit and ask about [the health of] the 179 B.C. elders and aged, nor make grants of [linen] cloth, [plain] silk, wine, or meat [to these people], in what way can [We] assist the children and grandchildren of the empire in filial piety to care for their relatives? "Now [We] have heard that officials when giving grain to those who should receive gruel1 1 Yen Shih-ku says that is thin congee . sometimes use stale millet. How can this befit the intention of caring for the aged? For all these matters [you should prepare] ordinances." The [high] officials begged that [the Emperor] order that [in the] prefectures and marches2 2 Cf. Glossary, sub Ch'iang-tao. those in their eightieth [year] and above should be granted per person per month one picul of rice, twenty catties of meat, five tou3 3 Cf. App. I. of wine, and that those in their ninetieth [year] and above should also be granted per person two bolts of silk and three catties of silk wadding. For those to whom should be given goods or a grain allowance of gruel or rice, the chief officials4 4 Cf. p. 88, n. 1. [of the prefecture] should supervise it and the Assistant [Prefect] or Chief of Police should transmit it. For those who are not fully ninety 7b [years of age], the Inspector of Fields, the Prefect, or an official should transmit it. The [officials whose positions rank at] two thousand piculs should send their Director of Officials to travel about [inspecting]; those who are unworthy should be beaten.5 5 Wu Jen-chieh (ca. 1137-1199) writes that has two meanings: in addition to its usual meaning "to examine" it is also used to mean "beat" and is interchanged with . This beating was performed without baring the body. HS 76: 7b, col. 8 definitely establishes this meaning. To those who have suffered mutilating punishments together 238HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 179 B.C. with those who have committed crimes [deserving 4:7b the punishment of] shaving the whiskers or more serious [crimes],1 1 Cf. p. 118, n. 1. Those aged who had committed more serious crimes than this were not to receive any pension. The SC (Mh II, 458) states that orphans under their ninth year were also to receive grants. this order should not apply. 8a [In this month] King YÃ¼an of Ch'u, [Liu] Chiao, May/June died. In the fourth month there was an earthquake in Ch'i and Ch'u. Twenty-nine mountains2 2 HS 27Ca: 10a says, "In Ch'i and Ch'u there was an earthquake and mountains fell in 29 places on the same day. All [of them] sent out high water which broke through the sides up or welled up." collapsed on the same day and floods came out from their sides or welled up.3 3 Yen Shih-ku remarks, "To break through the side is ; to well up is ." In the sixth month [the July/Aug. Emperor] ordered that the commanderies and kingdoms should not come [to the capital] to make offerings [of tribute]. He showed his grace to the world and the nobles and the barbarians [of the] four [quarters], both far and near, rejoiced and were agreeable. Then [the Emperor] provided for those meritorious persons who came [with him] from [the kingdom of] Tai. His imperial edict said, "At the time when the great officials had executed the LÃ¼ [clan] and invited Us [to take the throne], We were hesitant and suspicious like a fox.4 4 Yen Shih-ku says, "The fox in his character as an animal is by nature very suspicious. Every time he crosses a river on ice he listens as he crosses. Hence we talk of a suspicious person and call him `as suspicious as a fox.' " Cf. Mh II, 458, n. 2. All [Our officials] stopped Us. Only [Our] Palace Military Commander, Sung Ch'ang, urged Us [to go]. We have therefore5 5 Reading for with the SC, at the suggestion of Su YÃ¼ (xx cent.). He says that these two characters were interchanged. been able to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples. We have already elevated [Sung] Ch'ang to be General of the Guards. Let [Sung] Ch'ang be appointed 239HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 4:8a as Marquis of Chuang-wu" and let the six officials 179 B.C. who came with Us [be elevated] to [the rank of] the nine great ministers.1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that, because of the phrasing, the last clause of this sentence is not given in the original wording of the edict, but is a summary made by the historian. The SC has the same wording. For a list of the "nine great ministers" under the Han dynasty, cf. Mh II, 459, n. 2. [The edict] also said, "The marquises who followed the Emperor Kao-[tsu] into Shu and Han2 2 Cf. 1A: 28a. were sixty-eight persons; for each [one of them let there be] added to their estates three hundred families. [Among] the officials [of positions ranking as worth] two thousand piculs and above who followed the Emperor Kao-[tsu, let there be given to] the Administrator of Ying-ch'uan, Tsun, and others, ten persons [in all], the income of six hundred families; to the Administrator of Huai-yang, Shen-t'u Chia, and others, ten persons [in all, the income of] five hundred families; to the Commandant of the [Palace] Guard, Tsu, and others, ten persons [in all, the income of] four hundred families." [The Emperor] appointed Chao Chien, the maternal uncle of the King of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang], as Marquis of Chou-yang, Szu ChÃ¼n, the maternal uncle of the King of Ch'i [Liu Hsiang], as Marquis of Ching-kuo,3 3 Chavannes explains that because Emperor Wen had given his own maternal uncle, Po Chao, an appointment, he also appointed these other maternal uncles to avoid jealousy. Cf. Mh II, 460, n. 1. In spite of all his care, Liu Hsing-chÃ¼ finally revolted. and 8b Ts'ai Chien, the former Lieutenant Chancellor of the [former kingdom of] Ch'ang-shan, as Marquis of Fan. In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, II the Lieutenant Chancellor, Ch'en P'ing, died.4 4 Ch'ien Ta-chao writes, "In [recording] the death of a Lieutenant Chancellor, the general rule is to record the day but not write his surname. Only for Ch'en P'ing and Kuan Ying the surname is written but the day is not written. For Shen-t'u Chia the day is not recorded. For Ti Fang-chin, both surname and day are written." SC 10: 8a adds that the Marquis of Chiang, Chou P'o, was made Lieutenant Chancellor. An Nov./Dec. 240HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. I 179 B.C. imperial edict said, "We have heard that anciently 4:8b the nobles, for whom there were established more than a thousand states,1 1 SC 10: 8a says instead that they "established their states for more than a thousand years." Cf. Mh II, 460. each [actually] governed his own territory and at the [proper] time paid tribute [to the sovereign. Then] the people were not harassed or made to suffer; the superior and inferiors were content and rejoiced; there was no one who transgressed against2 2 Cf. Mh II, 460, n. 3. virtue. [But] now the marquises mostly live in Ch'ang-an, far from their estates,3 3 Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) says, "The three imperial commanderies [the capital commandery, Tso-p'ing-yi, Yu-fu-feng] were not used for enfeoffing marquises. The nearest estates of the marquises were several hundred li from Ch'ang-an; the distant ones were then a thousand li or several thousand li [away]. Only the Kuan-nei Marquises had the income of towns in Kuan-chung." [so that] their officials and retainers who transport [to them their taxes and provisions] are put to expense and suffering. Moreover the marquises-have thus no means of instructing and teaching their people. Let it be ordered that the marquises are to go to their states. As to [those who are imperial] officials, together with those who are retained [at the court] by an imperial edict, they shall send their heirs-apparent [to their states]."4 4 Chou Shou-ch'ang says, "[According to] the Han [dynastic] Code, the oldest sons of kings and marquises were all called `Heirs-apparent' ; the mothers of the kings were called `Dowager Queens' ; [these titles were] not necessarily [held only by the oldest son and mother] of the Son of Heaven." 178 B.C. In the eleventh month, on [the day] kuei-mao, 9a the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the Jan. 2 sun.5 5 Cf. App. III. The imperial edict said, "We have heard that when Heaven gave birth to the common people, it established princes for them to take care of and govern them. When the lord of men is not virtuous and his dispositions in his government are not equable, Heaven then informs him [of that fact] by a 241HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 4:9a calamitous visitation, in order to forewarn him that 178 B.C. he is not governing [rightly]. Now on the last day of the eleventh month there was an eclipse of the sunâa reproach1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, " should be read as , i.e., `a reproach.' " Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) remarks, "Ever since the Ch'in dynasty no awe had been felt at [events in] the sky; at the time of the Emperor Wen we first hear of this sort of speech." However the Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ was very much worried by a total eclipse; cf. 3: App., ii; Mh II, 423. visible in the skyâwhat visitation could be greater? "We have secured [the position as] guardian of the [imperial] ancestral temples; with a feeble and insignificant person [We] have been entrusted with a place above the educated2 2 Instead of `educated people,' the SC has `million [people]'; may however be a compound noun, meaning merely `people.' and common people and the princes and kings. The good or bad government of the world depends upon Ourself.3 3 The phrase was used by the Emperor of himself; its connotation was not that of praising the Emperor, as in the translation "I, the Unique Man," but "humble. He wants to say that the [Emperor's] own ability is equivalent to that of one person." Po-hu-t'ung (i or iii cent.), A:7b. Even the two or three [persons] administering the government are like my legs and arms. Below Us, [We] have not been able to govern well and nurture the multitude of beings; above [Us, We] have thereby affected the brilliance of the three luminaries.4 4 Yen Shih-ku says, "The three luminaries are the sun, the moon, and the stars." This lack of virtue has been great indeed. "Wherever this order arrives, let all think what are Our faults and errors together with the inadequacies of Our knowledge and discernment. We beg that you will inform and tell Us of it and also present [to Us] those capable and good persons who are foursquare and upright and are able to speak frankly and unflinchingly admonish [Us], so as to correct Our inadequacies. [Let] everyone be therefore diligent in his office and duties. Take care to lessen [the amount of] forced service5 5 Yen Shih-ku says that should be read as . and expense in order to benefit the people. 242HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 178 B.C. "Since We are unable to [spread the influence of 4:9a Our] virtue to distant [regions], with anxiety [We] reflect on the iniquitous conduct of foreigners,1 1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) says that `foreigners' here refers to the Hu and YÃ¼eh peoples, to the northwest and southeast of Central China respectively. 9b against whom, therefore, [We] have made preparations without ceasing. Now although [We] are unable to dismiss the encampments and garrison soldiers at the border, [need We] also be attentive to [Our personal] troops and make Our guard large?2 2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the last clause in this sentence refers to the troops and guard at the capital. Let the army of the General of the Guard3 3 The army at the capital, over which Sung Ch'ang had been appointed. But that army was not altogether disbanded; it is mentioned again on p. 11b. be abolished. Of the horses which the Chief of the Stud has now, [let] there remain just4 4 Yen Shih-ku (581-645) says that means , and that is the same as , which means `a little.' enough; [let] all the remainder be given for the posts and post-horses."5 5 The Kuang-ya (by Chang Yi, fl. 227-233) says that is . Cf. Mh II, 462, n. 4. In the spring, the first month, on [the day] ting-hai,6 6 Shen Ch'in-han notes that the History of the Southern Ch'i Dynasty, ch. 9, p. 27b says that the Emperor Wu of that dynasty (483-494) was advised to and did plow the sacred field on the day ting-hai Feb. 14, 485. Wang Chien (452-489) says that in the classics there is no mention of a hai day. Ho T'ung-chih (449-503) replies, "[Emperor] Wen of the Han [dynasty] used this day to till the sacred [field] and worship the God of Agriculture. Later kings, following his example, used it. There is no further meaning [to the day ting-hai]." For a discussion of the Sacred Field, cf. App. II. Feb. 15 an imperial edict said, "Now agriculture is the foundation of the world. Let the sacred field 10a be opened. We Ourself lead in plowing in order to provide millet and grain offerings for the [imperial] ancestral temple. Those people who are punished [and made to] work in the prefectural offices, together with those who have borrowed seed and food, and have not paid it back, and those who have not 243HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 4:10a paid in full, [let] them all be pardoned."1 1 They were not to be punished for the crime committed when they failed to repay and were forgiven the repayment. 178 B.C. In the second month,2 2 The text writes "third month," but HS 14: 6b, 7b, 10b, 13a lists all these appointments in the second month on the day yi-mao, Mar. 15. We have accordingly emended to . Cf. Mh II, 464, n. 2. some [high] officials begged March [the Emperor] to establish his Imperial Sons as vassal kings. His imperial edict said, "Previously when King Yu of Chao, [Liu Yu], died from being imprisoned, We deeply sympathized with him. [We] have already made his Heir-apparent, [Liu] Sui, the King of Chao. The younger brother of [Liu] Sui, [Liu] Pi-ch'iang, together with the sons of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei2], the Marquis of Chu-hsÃ¼, [Liu] Chang, and the Marquis of Tung-mou, [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, are meritorious [persons] and worthy to be made kings." So [the Emperor] thereupon3 3 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that (which we have translated "thereupon") is an interpolation from the preceding sentence. The SC does not have it. established [Liu] Pi-ch'iang as the King of Ho-chien, [Liu] Chang as the King of Ch'eng-yang, and [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼ as the King of Chi-pei. Because of [those appointments], he established his Imperial Sons, [Liu] Wu as the King of Tai, [Liu] Ts'an as the King of T'ai-yÃ¼an, and [Liu] Yi5 as the King of Liang. In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "According June to the ancient [mode of] governing the world, in the court there was the banner for initiating improvements,4 4 This banner was supposed to have hung where five roads met at the court of Yao; anyone who had an improvement to propose stood under it. Cf. Mh II, 465, n. 1. In the Wen-yÃ¼an Ying-hua (written ca. 978, by Li Fang) ch. 362, p. 6b, Lu Shih (fl. dur. 48-33 B.C.) in his own comment on his Hua-chien [Painted Admonishments], is quoted as saying, "[According to] the stories of the two Han dynasties, in the third year of the Emperor Wen [177 B.C.] there were painted at the Yung-ming Hall [his text says it was inside the Wei-yang Palace, but, according to the San-fu Huang-t'u, (iii to vi cent.) in the Wei-yang Palace there was a Hsien-ming Hall, but no Yung-ming Hall] the five colored objects: the plant that curbs negligence [which grew in the court of Yao and bent its head each time a slanderous flatterer entered the palace], the banner for initiating improvement, the post for speaking ill and criticizing [cf. below], the drum for daring to admonish [the prince], and the single horned monster [which gores wicked people when it sees them]." and the post for speaking ill and 10b 244HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 178 B.C. criticizing,1 1 This legend seems to have originated in the Shih-tzu. Szu-ma Cheng quotes the Shih-tzu (iii cent. B.C.) as saying "Yao established the post for speaking ill and criticizing." The LÃ¼-shih Ch'un-ch'iu (possibly forged by Kao Yu, fl. 205-212, according to Maspero, TP 20: 231) 24: 31 (Wilhelm's trans. p. 422) however says that this post belonged to Shun. Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says, "Yao made them. [They were] posts with a cross-piece [on the] bridges." Ying Shao says, "They were boards at the side of the bridges on which to write the errors and faults of the government. At [the time of] the Ch'in [dynasty], they were done away with; now they were reestablished." Yen Shih-ku approves of the latter explanation. Shen Ch'in-han says, "Ts'ui Pao (fl. dur. 265-420) in his Ku-chin-chu [C: 7a, b, makes] Ch'en Ya ask, `What [likeness] had the posts for speaking ill and criticizing that Yao erected?' He answered, `[Like] the present ornamental pillars, with a cross-piece on the post like a flower and shaped like a well-sweep. On the large roads where thoroughfares meet they were everywhere placed. Some people call them "sign-posts ." They are a sign that the kings receive admonition and also to point out the roads. The Ch'in [dynasty] however abolished them and the Han [dynasty] first reestablished them. Now in the Western Capital [Ch'ang-an] they are called "posts with cross-pieces " ' ." whereby there was kept open the way 4:10b for [good] government and [whereby] remonstrances were caused to come [to the Emperor]. Now in the law there are the crimes of speaking evil and criticizing and of monstrous speech.2 2 The Empress nÃ©e LÃ¼ had abolished this latter crime; evidently it had been revived. Cf. 3: 2a and p. 193, n. 2, also 11: 3a. Yen Shih-ku says that and are synonymous. These [laws] keep the courtiers from daring to express their whole feelings so that the sovereign has no means of hearing about his mistakes and errors. By what means then [can we make] capable and good [people] from distant quarters come [to Us]? Let [these laws] be abrogated. "If it happens that people make imprecations against the sovereign and have made pledges to each other, but later give each other the lie, the officials consider it treason, and, whatever else they may say, the officials nevertheless consider it speaking evil and criticizing. These [acts] are from the stupidity of unimportant people, who do 245HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 4: 10b not know [what they are doing] and run into death. 178 B.C. [Such punishments are what] We very much do not want. From the present time on, whenever there are those who transgress in this manner, do not admit them to trial."1 1 Cf. Mh II, 465, n. 2. In the ninth month, there were first made for the Sept./Oct. Administrators of Commanderies bronze tiger credentials and envoy's bamboo credentials.2 2 Ying Shao says, "Bronze [or copper] tiger credentials were of the first to the fifth [in number]. When the state must mobilize its troops, [the Emperor] sent a messenger to the commanderies who matched his [half of] the credential [with the other half held by the commandery official]. If the credential matched, then [the official in charge] listened to and accepted [the envoy]. The bamboo envoy's credentials all use five stalks of arrow-bamboo [a small species of bamboo]. They are five inches long and are engraved in seal characters number one to number five." The Han-chiu-yi (i cent.) says, "A commandery or a state was given three bronze tiger credentials and five bamboo envoy credentials." Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) says, "The credentials were substituted for the ancient kuei [a long narrow jade used as insignia] and chang [the lengthwise half of a kuei], because they were simpler and easier." Yen Shih-ku says, " `To make credentials for the commandery administrators' means: each one was divided into two halves [lengthwise]. The right [half] was left in the capital; the left [half] was used to give to him [the commandery administrator]." Ch'ien Ta-chao says, "The Shuo-wen [ca. 100, says] is an auspicious jade [tablet used for] mobilizing forth troops. [On it] is the carving of a tiger. He who employs troops uses his majesty and bravery, hence [he uses] jade. Bronze [ones] always use [the character] ." Cf. 3: 7a. In Mh II, 466, n. 1, there is a picture of one with Chavannes' account of them. He must be wrong when he says that "la partie gauche Ã©tait remise Ã  celui qu'on voulait charger d'une mission;" the inscription he prints says that it was given to the commandery Administrator. The SC (Mh II, 465) writes that these credentials were made for "the Administrators or Chancellors of commanderies or kingdoms." An imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the great 11a foundation of the world; it is what the people depend on for their [very] life. Nevertheless the people sometimes do not apply themselves to the fundamental but occupy themselves with what is least [important]. As a result their livelihood is deficient. We are anxious about this state of affairs, hence We now at this time Ourselves lead [Our] ministers in agricultural [pursuits] in order to exhort them [to 246HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 178 B.C. stress agriculture in their government]. Let there 4:11a be granted to the people of the empire this year half of the land tax on the cultivated fields."1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "They were excused from it and it should not be collected." III In the third year, in the winter, the tenth month, Dec. 22 on [the day] ting-yu, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.2 2 Cf. App. III. In the eleventh month, June 6, on [the day] ting-mao, the last day of the month, 176 B.C. there was an eclipse of the sun. The imperial edict said, "Sometime ago an imperial edict ordered the marquises to go to their states. [But they asked] to be excused and have not gone. The Lieutenant Chancellor is [the person] whom We honor [most]. Let him lead the marquises to their states for Us."3 3 The Southern Academy ed. (1528-30), the Fukien ed. (1549), the Official ed. (1739) and the SC all write instead of . We have adopted this reading. Thereupon the Lieutenant Chancellor, [Chou] P'o, was dismissed and sent to go to his state. 177 B.C. In the twelfth month, the Grand Commandant, the Jan./Feb. Marquis of Ying-yin, Kuan Ying, was made Lieutenant 11b Chancellor4 4 Usually appointments and dismissals of even the highest officials were not recorded in the Annals; in this case, because the Grand Commandant's office was abolished in consequence, an appointment was recorded. and the office of Grand Commandant was abolished; [his duties] were taken care of by the Lieutenant Chancellor. In the summer, the May/June fourth month, the King of Ch'eng-yang, [Liu] Chang, died. The King of Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch`ang, killed the Marquis of Pi-yang, Shen Yi-chi.5 5 He murdered him in his house. For details, cf. ch. 44 and Glossary sub Liu Ch'ang. June/July In the fifth month, the Huns entered and occupied the Pei-ti [Commandery], south of the [Yellow] River,6 6 This was the Ordos region in the north of the present Shensi, south of the great northern bend of the Yellow River. It had been conquered by Meng T'ien, a general of the First Emperor (cf. Mh II, 167) and was taken away from the Huns again by Wei Ch'ing in 127 B.C.; cf. 6: 10b. whence they marauded. The Emperor 247HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 4:11b favored the Kan-ch'Ã¼en [Palace by visiting it.1 1 Ju Shun quotes Ts'ai Yung (133-192) as saying, "Where the chariots and equipage of the Son of Heaven go, the people and the officials consider it an unhoped for piece of good fortune, hence it is called `the favor of a visit .' The chief magistrate [of the prefecture], the San-lao, and their official subordinates themselves visit [the emperor's] coach. Music is played and they are granted wine, food, silk, bonnets of linen or of linen woven with white nettle [the Sung Ch'i ed. says that the words for `wine' and `linen' were not in the YÃ¼eh ed (xi-xii cent.)], ornaments worn at the girdle, girdles, and the like. The common people [are granted by the emperor] steps in noble rank by number or the half of the land tax on the fields. Hence they therefore call it `a favor .' " 177 B.C. The Emperor] sent the Lieutenant Chancellor Kuan Ying to attack the Huns,2 2 HS 94A: 10a says that he ordered out border officers, chariots, and cavalry, [altogether] 80,000 [in number] to go to Kao-nu. HS 27Ba: 23b says there were ordered out chariots, cavalry, and soldiers, [altogether] 85,000 [in number]. Cf. de Groot, Die Hunnen, pp. 74-76. and the Huns left. [The Emperor] sent3 3 Chavannes (Mh II, 469, n. 3) suggests emending to . The word for "abolish" in this sense (cf. above) is however . In the "Treatise on Offices" (ch. 19) there is no record of this office having been abolished at this time; the text's reading is preferable. the Palace Military Commander, with skilled soldiers4 4 For "skilled soldiers", who were cavalry and cross-bowmen handling the heaviest cross-bows, cf. p. 80, n. 2; SC 57: 1b; HS 42: 6a; 49: 11a; Mh II, 469, n. 4. belonging to [the army of] the General of the Guard, to encamp at Ch'ang-an. The Emperor went from the Kan-ch'Ã¼an [Palace] to Kao-nu, and, availing himself of the opportunity, he favored [the kingdom of] T'ai-yÃ¼an [by visiting it] and saw his former officials.5 5 T'ai-yÃ¼en had been part of Emperor Wen's former Kingdom of Tai. At this time the Emperor's son Liu Ts'an had been made its King. He granted [favors] to them all, promoting those who had distinguished themselves. He gave favors to the common people, granting them by hamlets an ox and wine. He exempted the people of Chin-yang and Chung-tu from the land tax for three years.6 6 Chin-yang and Chung-tu had been the capitals of the kingdom of Tai when Emperor Wen had been its King. He stayed and amused himself in [the kingdom of] T'ai-yÃ¼an for more than ten days. When the King of Chi-pei, [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, heard 248HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. II 177 B.C. that the Emperor had gone to Tai and that he him- 4:11b 12a self intended to attack the Huns, [the king] rebelled and mobilized his troops, wishing to surprise Jung-yang.1 1 He felt that he had not been adequately rewarded by the Emperor Wen, for, although he had done more than anyone else in overthrowing the LÃ¼ faction, he had been given only a small territory. He belonged to the party that wished to enthrone the King of Ch'i, Liu Hsiang, and took the opportunity given by the Emperor's absence from the capital to start a rebellion. Thereupon an imperial edict abolished the troops of the Lieutenant Chancellor2 2 He had been commanding the troops formerly under the control of the Grand Commandant. Cf. 4: 11b. and made the Marquis of Chi-p'u, Ch'ai Wu, the General-in-chief, leading four generals3 3 Ch'i Shao-nan (1703-1768) says that these four generals were (1) the Marquis of Ch'ang, Lu Ch'ing (cf. Mh III, 141, no. 107), (2) the Marquis of Kung, Lu Pa-shih (cf. Mh III, 133, no. 52), (3) the Marquis of Ning, Wei Su (cf. Mh III, 137, no. 75), and (4) the Marquis of Shen-tse, Chao Chiang-yeh (Mh III, 127, no. 4). Cf. SC 22: 7b. [with] a multitude [numbering] a hundred thousand to attack [Liu Hsing-chÃ¼]. The Marquis of Ch'i, Tseng Ho, was made a General and encamped at Jung-yang. In the autumn, the Aug./Sept. seventh month,4 4 HS 27Ba: 23b says that this autumn there was a drought all over the empire. the Emperor [went] from T'ai-yÃ¼an to Ch'ang-an. His edict read, "The King of Chi-pei [Liu Hsing-chÃ¼] has been ungrateful for [Our] goodness, rebelled against his sovereign, deceived and led into error his officials and people, and committed treason. Those among the officials and people of Chi-pei who stopped [rebelling] of their own accord before the troops arrived and those who submitted together with their army, their cities, or their towns, are all to be pardoned and restored to their official [positions] and their [aristocratic] ranks. Those who have been with the King, [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, leave him, and come [to Us] will also be pardoned." In ept./Oct. the eighth month the King of Chi-pei, [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼, was captured and committed suicide.5 5 The Hsi-ching Tsa-chi (prob. vi cent.) says, "When [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼ first raised his troops, a great wind came blowing straight from the east. It blew straight his banners and flags right up in the sky into a cloud and [a flag] dropped into a well in the western part of his [capital] city. His horses all neighed sorrowfully and would not advance. [His followers] on the left and right, [including] Li K'uo and others, admonished him, but he would not listen. Therefore he later committed suicide." [The 249HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. III 4:12a Emperor] pardoned those who had rebelled with 177 B.C. [Liu] Hsing-chÃ¼. IV In the fourth year,1 1 The SC mentions no events in the fourth or fifth years. in the winter, the twelfth 12b month, the Lieutenant Chancellor Kuan Ying died. 176 B.C. In the summer, the fifth month, [the Emperor] exempted Jan./Feb. from all taxes the families of the [members June/July of the] Liu [house] who had members enregistered [as belonging to the imperial house]. He granted estates to the sons of the vassal kings, to each [the income of] two thousand households.2 2 HS 27Bb: 13a says, "In the sixth month (July) there was a great fall of snow." In the autumn, the ninth month, [the Emperor] appointed ten3 3 The text reads, "seven sons," but HS 15 A: 3b-5b enumerates ten sons of King Tao-hui as all appointed in the fifth month on the day chia-yin (July 1, 176 B.C.). Sun YÃ¼eh's Han-chi follows ch. 15. HS 38:7b also says "seven sons." In their ancient form, "seven" and "ten" are easily confused. sons Oct. of King Tao-hui of Ch'i, [Liu Fei2], as marquises. The Marquis of Chiang, Chou P'o, committed crime; he was arrested and brought to the Imperial Prison of the Commandant of Justice.4 4 Chou P'o was arrested on the report that he planned to rebel. At the intercession of the Empress Dowager nÃ©e Po, the Emperor Wen finally freed Chou P'o. He returned to his state and died in 169 B.C. The Ku-ch'eng Temple was built.5 5 The Ku-ch'eng Temple was the temple for Emperor Wen's posthumous worship. Ju Shun says, "He made his temple while he was alive. [The meaning of its name] is like [the phrase] in the Book of History [IV, V, i, 2; Legge, p. 199] `he regarded (Ku) [continually the bright] requirements [of Heaven,' implying that Ku-ch'eng means, `he regards the performance of Heaven's requirements']. The temple of the Emperor Ching was called Te-yang , that of the Emperor Wu was called Lung-yÃ¼an , that of the Emperor Chao was called P'ai-hui , that of the Emperor HsÃ¼an was called Lo-yu , that of the Emperor YÃ¼an was called Ch'ang-shou , that of the Emperor Ch'eng was called Yang-ch'ih ." After the burning of these temples in the period between the two Han dynasties, the first emperor of the Later Han Dynasty built one temple for all these emperors, with separate compartments (called "temples") for each emperor. Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says, "The [Ku-ch'eng] Temple was south of the city of Ch'ang-an, and was built by Emperor Wen. By turning round one can see the city wall, hence it is named [ku-ch'eng, lit. `looking back on the city wall']." Yen Shih-ku replies that this interpretation is senseless and does not do justice to the words. He prefers Ying Shao's interpretation, which is that Emperor Wen, "when he made a temple for himself, made it humble and low, so it could be completed while watching it," (i.e., in a short time). Chia Yi (198-165 B.C.) said, "Through the Ku-ch'eng Temple he became the Great Exemplar of the empire, as unsurpassed as the Han [dynasty]." 250HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. V 175 B.C. V In the fifth year, in the spring, the second month, 4:12b 175 B.C. there was an earthquake. In the summer, the fourth Feb./Mar. month, the order [against] casting counterfeit cash Apr./May was abrogated. [The coinage] was changed and four shu cash were made.1 1 Four shu was ? of an ounce. These cash then weighed ? of what the Ch'in dynasty's cash did. Chia Yi and Chia Shan both protested against this coinage; cf. ch. 24 and 51. 13a In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, VI the peach and plum [trees] blossomed. In the eleventh Nov./Dec. month, the King of Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch`ang, Dec./Jan. plotted a rebellion, was dismissed, exiled to Yen-tao 174 B.C. in the Shu [Commandery], and died [on the way2 2 Adding the word , at the suggestion of Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832), to correspond with the wording in HS 27Bb: 13a and SC 22: 8a. Yen Shih-ku's comment implies that it was in his text. The HS in this sentence condenses a page of the SC and adds the name of the place where Liu Ch'ang died. The omitted material is put in the HS into the "Memoir of Liu Ch'ang." He starved himself to death in his sealed prisoner's cart. To clear himself of the suspicion of fratricide, the Emperor executed the chiefs of the prefectures on the road who had not attended to Liu Ch'ang and buried him with the honors of a marquis. Cf. SC ch. 18, HS ch. 44; Glossary sub voce. The SC does not record anything after the sixth year down to the thirteenth year. ] at Yung. VII In the seventh year, in the winter, the tenth Nov./Dec. month, [the Emperor] ordered that Dowager Marchionesses, wives of marquises, sons of vassal kings, together with officials [with positions ranking as worth] two thousand piculs, were not arbitrarily to 173 B.C. make levies nor arrests. In the summer, the fourth May month, an amnesty was granted to the world. In July 4 the sixth month, on [the day] kuei-yu, there was a visitation [of fire] in the towers3 3 Ju Shun says, "The eastern [palace] portal with the towers on both sides of it all burnt." Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) says, "Only the towers of the eastern gate burnt." Yen Shih-ku says, "The screen towers are small towers connecting the portals . They are used to cover places where there are double openings in the walls. [Because of] their shape, they are called fou-szu (net) like. They are also called screens . [The first word of this name] is pronounced [the same as] ." Sung Ch'i says that the Chiang-nan ed. (before 976) writes the second word of this name as . Wang Nien-sun says that this edition is correct, for the Shuo-wen has not the word szu . In various places the name of this screening wall is written (as in ch. 27), , or . In modern times the `net' radical has been added to the second character. Yen Shih-ku's comment gives no pronunciation for the second character, showing that in his time it was written without the `net' radical. Cheng HsÃ¼an, in a note to Chou-li 41:34a, sub Chiang-jen, says, "The corner of a city wall is called a ." Wang Hsien-ch'ien concludes, "Then the fou-szu is a small building with an upper storey , for on the corners of city walls and above the portals there always are such [buildings]. Then above this screening wall there was also a building to cover and screen the wall." screening the Eastern Portal of the Wei-yang Palace. 251HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. VIII 4:13b In the eighth year, in the summer, [the Emperor] 172 B.C. 13b enfeoffed as marquises the four sons of King Li of VIII Huai-nan, [Liu] Ch`ang.1 1 These four were Liu An, made Marquis of Fou-ling, Liu P'o, Marquis of An-yang, Liu T'zu, Marquis of Yang-chou, and Liu Liang, Marquis of Tung-ch'eng. These appointments were all made on June 2. Cf. 15A:6a, b. This appointment was the cause of a fruitless admonition by Chia Yi; cf. ch. 48. A long comet appeared 172 B.C. in the eastern quarter [of the sky].2 2 Wen Ying (fl. ca 196-220) says, "The three [kinds of special] stars [i.e. comets] are the bushy ones [lit. `shooting out,' like vegetation], the brooms , and the long ones. In their prognostications they are somewhat alike, however in their shape they are slightly different. The light rays of bushy comets are short; their light goes out in [all] four [directions], [it is] bushy and shooting out. The light rays of broom comets are long and tufted like a broom. With long comets there is one straight light ray, which points sometimes to the end of the sky, sometimes a hundred feet [long], sometimes thirty feet, sometimes twenty feet, without any regularity. [According to the] Ta-fa [seemingly the name of an unknown book], bushy and broom comets are mostly [signs of] doing away with the old and spreading the new, [or] of fire visitations; long comets are mostly [signs of] war." Summer In the ninth year, in the spring, there was a great IX drought. 171 B.C. In the tenth year, in the winter, [the Emperor] X travelled and favored [by a visit] the Kan-ch'Ã¼an Winter [Palace]. General Po Chao died.3 3 HS 18: 6a says, "He was sentenced for killing a messenger [of the Han emperor] and committed suicide." Cheng Te (fl. dur. 265-317) says, "[Po] Chao killed a messenger of the Han [emperor]. The Emperor Wen could not bear to execute him. [so] sent the high ministers to drink wine with him, wishing to cause him to commit suicide. [Po] Chao was not willing [to do so. Hence the Emperor] sent officials wearing mourning garments to go and weep for him; then he committed suicide. He had committed a crime, hence it is said that he `died' ," instead of the word ordinarily used for the death of a marquis, (cf. 2: 6a for an example of the latter). Ju Shun adds, "It is also said that when [Po] Chao lost while gaming with the Emperor Wen and had to drink wine [as a punishment for losing], a Gentleman-in-attendance poured out [too] little [wine] for [Po] Chao while another Gentleman-in-attendance reprimanded and roared at him, and that while this Gentleman was gone down to wash [his hair, Po] Chao sent a man to kill him [because of his lack of manners]. For this reason Emperor Wen caused him to commit suicide." 170 B.C. 252HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XI 168 B.C. XI In the eleventh year, in the winter, the eleventh 4,13b Dec./Jan. month, [the Emperor] travelled and favored [the 169 B.C. kingdom of] Tai [with a visit]. In the spring, the Feb./Mar. first month, the Emperor returned from [the kingdom July/Aug. of] Tai [to the capital]. In the summer, the sixth month, the King of Liang, [Liu] Yi5, died. The Huns pillaged Ti-tao. XII In the twelfth year, in the winter, the twelfth 168 B.C. month, the [Yellow] River broke [its dykes] in the Jan./Feb. Tung Commandery.1 1 For details, cf. ch. 29. Levies from the Tung Commandery rebuilt the dykes. In the spring, the first Feb./Mar. month, [the Emperor] granted estates of two thousand 14a families to each of the daughters of the vassal Mar./Apr. kings. In the second month, the Beauties in the Emperor Hsiao-hui's harem were sent [home] and it was ordered that they might be married. In the Apr./May third month, the [customs] barriers were done away with and passports were no [longer] used.2 2 Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) says, "Passports (chuan4 ) are credentials , like the present `passport' (ko-so )." Ju Shun says, "Two columns of writing on silk are divided; by holding one of them, when you go in or out of the [customs] barrier, if it matches [with the other of the pair], then you are permitted to pass. It is called a chuan." Li Ch'i (fl. dur. 221-265) says, "A passport (chuan) is a ch'i " [a wooden staff with a little flag, divided like a tally]. Yen Shih-ku adds, "Chang [Yen's] explanation is correct. Anciently some used a ch'i and some used silk. The ch'i was an engraved stick [the halves of which] matched and made a credential." She Ch'in-han says, "In the Chou-li [15:11a, sub] the Szu-kuan [cf. Biot's trans. I, p. 330], the commentator, [Cheng HsÃ¼an, says], `A chuan is like the present ko-so documents which are transmitted.' The Shih-ming [written by Liu Hsi (Han period), 6:3a, sub] [says], `To show. With a ko-so, when you come to a barrier or ford, it is used to show to them.' The saying of Ju [Shun], `Two columns of writing on silk are divided,' comes from a comment of Cheng [HsÃ¼an on the Chou-li 3:6b, sub] the Hsiao-tsai [cf. Biot's trans. of Chou-li, I, p. 42 who also says], `Chih-chi means `two similar writings on one tablet which are separated.' [The latter] is the present contract [which is also divided]. The Shih-ming [6:2b], says, ` is to divide. A large writing on a tablet is broken in the middle and divided.' This [article] is also like the chuan of the Chou-li. They are divided and written on silk, hence HS 64B:7b calls them hsÃ¼ [`passports']. Today they are called lu-yin ." 253HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XII 4:14a An imperial edict said, "The road along which to 168 B.C. guide the people is [to make them] devote themselves to fundamentals. We Ourselves have led the world in agriculture for ten years down to the present, yet to the countryside there has not been added any newly broken land, and [as soon as] one year has not a good harvest,1 1 Yen Shih-ku says that means . the people have hungry looks. This [shows that] those who apply themselves to [agriculture] are still too few, and that moreover the officials have not especially put their attention on it. I have many times put forth edicts, and yearly have urged the people to plant and sow,2 2 The word in the text is interpreted by Yen Shih-ku as , `to sow and plant'. but the results [of my action] have not yet appeared. This is [because] the officials have not been diligent in upholding my edicts or [because] they have not been intelligent in urging the people [to agriculture]. Forsooth, my farmers [have suffered] very bitterly, and yet the officials have perceived none of it; how then can [the officials effectively] encourage [agriculture]? Let there be granted to the farmers this year half of the land tax and tax on produce." [The edict] also said, "The Filially Pious and the Fraternally Respectful are the most advantageous [persons] in the world. The Cultivators of the Fields are the fundamental sources of life. The San-lao 254HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XII 168 B.C. are the teachers of the people. Honest officials 4;14a are an example to the people. We greatly approve of the conduct of these few [kinds of] grandees.1 1 "Grandees", denoting the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, the Cultivators of the Fields, the San-lao and honest officials, is here merely a term of respect. "Now in prefectures of ten thousand families it is said, `There are none who [are able to] conform to 14b [the Emperor's] order.'2 2 Yen Shih-ku says, "There were no Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, or Cultivators of the Fields who deserved to be sought out and recommended in conformity with [the Emperor's] order." How can peoples' natures be really [so inadequate]? This is because the way the officials have of recommending the capable is not adequate. Let Internuncios be sent to recompense and make grants: to the San-lao and the Filially Pious, five pieces of silk per person, to the Fraternally Respectful and the Cultivators of the Fields, two pieces, to the honest officials of [the rank of] two thousand piculs and above, for every hundred piculs, three pieces. When [the Internuncio] arrives, [let him] ask the people if there is anything inconvenient or discontenting, and let him establish the regular number of San-lao, Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Cultivators of the Fields in accordance with the number of households and people, and order each to apply himself with all his mind in order to guide the people [aright]." XIII In the thirteenth year, in the spring, the second 167 B.C. month, on [the day] chia-yin, an imperial edict said, Mar. 16 "We Ourself lead the world in farming and plowing in order to offer millet and sacrificial grain [in sacrifice]. The Empress herself raises silk-worms in order to provide sacrificial clothing. Let ceremonies and rites be established [for these procedures]."3 3 It looks as if Emperor Wen began these imperial ceremonies. 255HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XIII 4:14b In the summer, [the Emperor] abolished the secret 167 B.C. Summer invocator.1 1 HS 25A:19a reads, "When the Emperor Wen had been on the throne to the thirteenth year, he gave an edict saying, `The Office of secret invocator is to bear away [the Emperor's] faults to someone below [the Emperor]. We very much disapprove of [this sort of thing]. Let [this office] be abolished." For this official, cf. Mh III, 448; II, 473, n. 7. Ying Shao says, "The state tabooed him, hence he was called `secret.' " Hung Liang-chi (1746-1809) says, "He is probably the Tien-shih of the Chou-li," who takes the responsibility for faults and misfortunes upon himself instead of the Emperor. Cf. Biot's trans., I, 85; HS 25A:17a. A discussion is in the "Treatise on the Suburban Sacrifice and Offerings to the Spirits." 25A:19a In the fifth month, [the Emperor] abolished the May/June law providing for mutilating punishments. A discussion is in the "Treatise on Punishments and Laws."2 2 The HS has shifted the explanatory material which is in the SC at this point to ch. 23. Cf. Mh II, 474 ff. 23:12b-14b In the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Agriculture June/July is the foundation of the world. No duty is greater. Now if [anyone] personally follows this pursuit diligently, he has yet [to pay] the impositions of the land tax and tax on produce. This is making3 3 Liu Pin (1022-1088) says, "I suspect that should be "; Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that the SC writes the second character, and that anciently these two characters were interchanged. no distinction between [the treatment of what is] fundamental and [what is] least important.4 4 Li Ch'i (fl. dur. 220-265) says, "The fundamental is agriculture. The least important is merchandizing. It says that agriculture and merchandizing both pay the land tax and are not different. Hence he did away with the land tax on the [cultivated] fields." The land tax on cultivated fields was reÃ«stablished in 156 B.C. Cf. 5: 3a. This is not appropriate to [Our] way of encouraging agriculture. Let there be abolished the land tax and tax on produce [levied] upon the [cultivated] fields, and let there be granted to the orphans and widows of the empire [linen] cloth, silk, and silk wadding, to each person a definite amount." In the fourteenth year, in the winter, the Huns 15a pillaged at the frontier and killed the Chief Commandant XIV 256HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XIV 167 B.C. Winter of the Pei-ti [Commandery], [Sun] Ang.1 1 HS 94A: 13a, b says that the Shan-yÃ¼ with 140,000 horsemen entered Chao, Pa, and the Hsiao Pass as far as P'eng-yang, burnt the Hui-chung Palace, and rode to Kan-ch'Ã¼an, in sight of Ch'ang-an. This was the greatest of the Hun raids. 4:15a [The Emperor] sent three generals to encamp in the Lung-hsi, the Pei-ti, and the Shang Commanderies.2 2 According to 94 A: 13b, the Marquis of Ch'ang, Lu Ch'ing, was the general sent to the Shang Commandery; the Marquis of Ning, Wei Su, was the general sent to Pei-ti; the Marquis of Lung-lÃ¼, Chou Tsao, was the general sent to Lung-hsi. The Palace Military Commander Chou ShÃª was made General of the Guard; the Chief of the Gentlemen-atthe-Palace Chang Wu was made General of Chariots and Cavalry to encamp north of the Wei [River] with a thousand chariots and a hundred thousand cavalry and foot-soldiers. The Emperor himself inquired about the army's welfare and aroused the troops by reiterated instructions and orders and by making grants to the officers and soldiers. He himself wanted to make the expedition against the Huns. When the courtiers remonstrated, he would not listen, [but] when the Empress Dowager earnestly besought him, the Emperor however stopped. Thereupon [the Emperor] made the Marquis of Tung-yang, Chang Hsiang-ju, the General-in-chief. The Marquis of Ch'eng, Tung Ch'ih,3 3 According to 16: 16b, Tung Ch'ih was Marquis of Ch'eng ; the SC in this passage also says "Marquis of Ch'eng"; HS 94: i, 13b writes the same. The text at this point however writes ; the first character is then an interpolation. We have omitted it. HS 16: 16b says that Tung Ch'ih was the son of Tung Tieh and was appointed Marquis of Ch'eng. The SC at this point also writes Ch'ih; HS 19B: 8b writes that in this year the Prefect of the Capital was Tung Ch'ih. HS 94A: 13b also writes Tung Ch'ih. The text here however writes his given name as Ho . In ancient times, according to Ch'ien Ta-chao (1744-1813) Ho and Ch'ih were interchanged. Since Ch'ih is written more frequently, we read it here. SC 10: 13b says that the Marquis of Ch'eng, Ch'ih, was made the Prefect of the Capital and that Luan Pu was made general. HS 19B: 8b notes that in this year the Prefect of the Capital was Tung Ch'ih. According to SC ch. 100, Luan Pu was never Prefect of the Capital, and HS ch. 19 does not record it. According to HS 94A: 13b, the Marquis of Ch'eng, Tung Ch'ih, was made General, and his being Prefect of the Capital is not mentioned. The statement that anyone was made Prefect of the Capital is quite irrelevant to the military campaign. Wang Hsien-ch'ien suspects that the mention of Tung Ch'ih being Prefect of the Capital is an interpolation in the SC. The natural translation of the HS at this point would seem to be, "The Chien-ch'eng Marquis, Tung Ho, and the Prefect of the Capital, Luan Pu, were both made generals." We have adapted our translation to the facts. the Prefect 15b of the Capital, and Luan Pu were both made generals 166 B.C. to attack the Huns. The Huns fled. 257HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XIV 4:15b In the spring, an imperial edict said, "It is now the 166 B.C. Spring fourteenth year that We have had [the opportunity] to present the sacrificial oxen, the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk for the service of the Lords on High and the [imperial] ancestral temples. As the elapsed time has become longer and longer, and [We] have been neither intelligent nor brilliant, yet have controlled and governed the world for a long time, We Ourselves are very much ashamed [because We are unworthy]. Let there be extended and augmented the mounds on which sacrifices are made, the level places for sacrifice,1 1 Yen Shih-ku says, "Heaping up earth makes a ; to sweep clean the ground makes a is silk for worshipping the spirits." For Chavannes' interpretation of this passage, cf. Mh II, 478, n. 2. the jade tablets, and the pieces of silk at the various sacrifices. "Formerly the ancient Kings extended [their benefits] far and wide and did not seek for any recompense; they performed the sacrifice from a distance [to the great mountains and rivers],2 2 This sacrifice to the illustrious mountains and the great rivers, called , was supposedly very ancient. Its ceremony is described in Mh I, 62, n. 3. but did not pray for their own happiness. In the place of honor were the sages, in the less honorable place were their relatives;3 3 Lit. "on the right" and "on the left." The right was usually the place of honor. Cf. p. 123, n. 1. These two lines are of four characters each and rime. The people [came] first, they put themselves last; [this was] the extreme of the utmost wisdom. Now 258HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XIV 166 B.C. I have heard that when the sacrificial officials pray 4:15b for happy omens,1 1 Ju Shung says, " [means] happiness ." Yen Shih-ku says that this character's "original form is ; this is a borrowed use. Both are pronounced hsi1." Cf. Mh II, 479, n. 2. they all [endeavor to make] happiness revert upon Our private person, and do not [pray] for [Our] subjects. We are very much ashamed at this. If now, in spite of Our lack of virtue, [We] nevertheless specially and solely enjoy the good [coming] from their [prayers for] happiness, and my subjects have no share in it, that will double my lack of virtue. Let it be ordered that the sacricial officials, in presenting their respectful [offerings], should not beg for anything." XV In the fifteenth year, in the spring, a yellow dragon 16a appeared at Ch'eng-chi.2 2 Shen Ch'in-han tells that the Ts'Ãª-fu YÃ¼an-kuei (completed 1013) adds that the character wang appeared in the sun. The YÃ¼-hai (compiled by Wang Ying-lin, 1223-1296), ch. 195, p. 2a quotes the Wang-Ch'i-ch'ing (existed dur. 502-556), "In the time of the Emperor Wen, in the sun there was the word wang." The Emperor thereupon 165 B.C. issued an edict [ordering] the discussion of the sacrifice Spring in the suburbs and [other] sacrifices. Kung-sun Ch'en made clear the colors of the [sacrificial] robes; Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing established the five temples.3 3 The SC (Mh II, 481) says that these five altars were the Temples to the Five Lords [on High] north of the River Wei. Ch. 25 tells that they were northeast of Ch'ang-an, north of the road, at the Ch'ang-men T'ing. Cf. Mh III, 458. Kung-sun Ch'en had told the Emperor that northeast of Ch'ang-an (where these temples were later located) there was a supernatural emanation in five colors. A discussion [of the foregoing matters] 25A:19b, is in the "Treatise on the Suburban Sacrifice and 20a Offerings to the Spirits." May/June In the summer, the fourth month, the Emperor favored Yung [by a visit] and for the first time was presented to the Five Lords [on High] by means of a suburban sacrifice. An amnesty [was granted] to the world. [The Emperor] renewed the sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers, which had 259HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XV 4:16a been worshipped and whose [sacrifices] had been 165 B.C. stopped. The officers charged therewith [were ordered to] perform the [proper] rites [at the right time of] the year and season. In the ninth month, an imperial edict [ordered] Oct. the vassal kings, the ministers, and the commandery administrators to present [to the Emperor] those who were capable and good, and could speak frankly and admonish [their superiors] unflinchingly. The Emperor in person questioned them [by setting a literary exercise]. They set forth in [written] words their ideas for adoption.1 1 This event seems to have been one of the beginnings of the examination system. Chou Shou-ch'ang says, "This was the first time the Han court set literary exercises for the [prospective] officials. Before this, in the second year that he was on the throne, an imperial edict [ordered] the presentation of the capable and good persons, who were four-square and upright, able to speak frankly and admonish unflinchingly [cf. p. 9a], [but] we do not hear who was presented. At the [present] time [the authorities] for the first time [set] literary exercises for the [prospective] officials, using the three sets of virtues, [filial piety and brotherly respect, sageness and goodness, perfect virtue and uprightness], and Ch'ao Ts'o [who later became Grandee Secretary], because he had the highest grade, was promoted from [the position of] the Heir-apparent's Household Steward to Palace Grandee." HS 49: 17a ff. records Emperor Wen's questions and Ch'ao Ts'o's reply. The Emperor invited the capable and good persons to advise him about the state of the government, human relations, and to give frank admonitions. A discussion is in the "Memoir of Ch'ao Ts'o." 49:17a-22a In the sixteenth year, in the summer, the fourth XVI month, the Emperor made a suburban sacrifice to the 164 B.C. Five Lords [on High] at [the altars] to the north of the Apr./May Wei [River]. In the fifth month, [the Emperor] appointed May/June six sons of King Tao-hui of Ch'i [Liu Fei2], and three sons of King Li of Huai-nan [Liu Ch'ang], as kings.2 2 The state of Ch'i was divided into six parts for these six kingdoms. Cf. 14: 7-9. It became the imperial policy to enfeeble its nobles by dividing their fiefs among their children. In the autumn, the ninth month, there Sept./Oct. was found a jade cup with the inscription, "Prolonged life to the Lord of Men."3 3 Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing feigned it was found and ordered it presented to the Emperor, according to Ying Shao. Hsin-yÃ¼en P'ing also said that the tripods of the Chou dynasty, which had been lost in the Szu River, were in the Yellow River at Fen-yin, because he had seen the emanation of precious metals there. Search was made, but nothing was found. So the Emperor built a temple on the southern bank of the River there with the intent of praying them out. Cf. Mh II, 481, n. 3; III, 460. [The Emperor] 260HSIAO-WEN, Ch'ien, Yr. XVI 164 B.C. ordered that universal drinking [should be permitted 4:16a all over] the empire. The next year [the Emperor] changed the beginning [of the count for the years of his rule]. Hou I In the latter [part of his reign],1 1 Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) says, "Hsin-yÃ¼an P'ing observed the sun twice at its meridian [on the same day] and considered it a good omen, hence [the Emperor] changed the beginning [of the count of the] years [of the imperial rule] in order to obtain the blessing of lengthened years." Cf. Mh III, 459. The SC (Mh II, 481) records a "seventeenth" year, and says that the Son of Heaven changed this year to be the first year of his reign. It says nothing about a "Ch'ien" or "Hou" year-period in his reign, merely mentioning "the second year in the latter [part of the reign] ," etc. Then Emperor Wen merely had two "first" years; the historians were the first to speak of the "Hou" years in his reign. This was not the first time, according to the histories, that the numbering of years in a ruler's reign was changed: in 334 B.C., according to the Bamboo Books (composed about the end of iv cent. B.C., buried until found in 281 A.D., but altered later; cf. Legge, Shoo-king, I, p. 174) King Hui-ch'eng of Weih changed the beginning [of his reign] and called his thirty-sixth year his first year; in 324 B.C. King Hui-wen of Ch'in changed his fourteenth year to the first year. The SC (Mh II, 70) also records the latter change. Wang Hsien-ch'ien (1842-1918) thinks that these changes were modelled by the historians after the one made by Emperor Wen, although they may have been made when these rulers adopted the title of "king" in those years. The reason for this change seems to have been that the number of years being thus decreased, the ruler would live longerâKing Hui-ch'eng is recorded as having ruled sixteen years after he changed the numbering of his years! the first year, 16b in the winter, the tenth month, the deceits of Hsin-yÃ¼an Nov./Dec. P'ing were discovered; he plotted rebellion, and was exterminated with his three [sets of] relatives.2 2 Information concerning his deceits was given the emperor. Yen Shih-ku says, "Because his false acts were discovered, he was afraid he would be executed; hence he plotted a rebellion." 163 B.C. In the spring, the third month, the Empress nÃ©e Chang Apr./May of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui died.3 3 The word used for her death here is hung , not the word appropriate for an Empress's death, which is peng . Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) said, "The Empress leagued with the LÃ¼ clan, was dismissed, and lived in the Northern Palace [outside the Wei-yang Palace, a mark of disgrace; the Empress Dowager usually lived in the Wei-yang Palace], hence it is not said that she peng." Cf. 97 A: 5b. Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) replies, "She was not mourned and buried in accordance with the rites for an Empress, hence it is not said that she peng. She is recorded as `Empress,' hence although she had nevertheless retired and lived alone, she had not been dismissed. Chang [Yen] is following ch. 97." Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) says, "A dismissed Empress's death is not recorded. Of the Empress [nÃ©e] Po of the Emperor Ching [but cf. 5: n. 6.6] and of the Empress [nÃ©e] HsÃ¼ of the Emperor Ch'eng it is recorded that they were dismissed, but not recorded that they died. This was the [set] practise of the historians. Although the Empress of Hsiao-hui was dismissed and established in a separate palace, as a matter of fact there was no known imperial edict ordering her dismissal, hence it was nevertheless recorded that she hung." Cowell and Crommelin calculate that Halley's comet passed perihelion in May of this year; it is interesting that it was not recorded. Cf. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 68: 670. Since eclipses are also not mentioned during this decade, it looks as though the recorders of phenomena deliberately refused to record eclipses or comets, for the good reign of Emperor Wen made them think that Heaven was sending no admonitions, hence they concluded that there were no "visitations." 261HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. I 4:16b An imperial edict said, "Recently for many years 163 B.C. there have continually been no good harvests. Moreover there have been visitations of floods, droughts, sickness, and epidemics. We have been very much worried because of them. We are ignorant and not perspicacious and do not yet understand just what is to blame. We have been thinking: is there some fault in Our [way of] government or is there some defect in [Our] conduct? Or is it that [We] have not obeyed the Way of Heaven or have perhaps not obtained the advantages of Earth, or are the affairs of men in great discord,1 1 Perhaps the Emperor had Mencius II, II, i, 1 in mind. Cf. Legge, p. 208. or have the spirits and divinities been neglected [so that] they have not enjoyed [Our offerings]? How has this been brought about? Or is it that the salaries of the officials are perhaps too lavish, or that useless activities are perhaps too many? How is it that the people's food is scarce and lacking? "Now when the fields are measured, they have not 262HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. I 163 B.C. decreased, and when the population is counted, it 4:16b has not increased, [so that] the amount of land per person is greater than in ancient times. Yet there is very much too little food; where does the blame for it lie? Is it that Our subjects devote themselves to what is least important,1 1 I.e., merchandizing. whereby those [persons] who injure agriculture are multiplied? [Is it due to the fact that] they make wine and lees, thereby wasting much grain and that masses of food are given to the six [kinds of] domestic animals? I have not yet been able to attain the proper mean between what 17a is immaterial and what is important. Let [this matter] be discussed with the Lieutenant Chancellor, the marquises, the officials [of ranks worth] two thousand piculs, and the Erudits. Should there be anything that might be of assistance to Our subjects, let them apply themselves with all their minds2 2 Interpreting shuai by hsi , in accordance with the suggestion of Wang Hsien-ch'ien, who says that these two words are alliterative, hence the second was changed to the first. [In Hunan both words are pronounced with an initial s; Karlgren gives the T'ang pronunciations si?t and shiu?t.] The phrase shuai-yi was previously used in 4: 14b; ch. 9 and 10 frequently use hsi-yi. Shuai has the meaning of hsi. and think deeply [about the matter]. Let them not hide anything [from Us]."3 3 Sung Ch'i (998-1061) says that the word follows the last word of this clause in one ed.; Ch'ien Ta-chao reports that this word is in the Fukien ed. (1594). II In the second year, in the summer, [the Emperor] 162 B.C. traveled and favored [by a visit] the YÃ¼-yang Summer Palace at Yung. In the sixth month, the King of July Tai, [Liu] Ts'an, died. The Huns [asked for] peace and friendship.4 4 HS 94A: 13b, 14a says, "Yearly they entered the border, killed and captured very many people, most of all in the YÃ¼n-chung and Liao-tung [Commanderies], more than 10,000 people in a commandery. The Chinese [Emperor] was much worried about them, so he sent an envoy to bear and transmit a letter to the Huns. The Shan-yu also . . . replied saying [that he wanted] peace and friendship." Ch. 94 thereupon cites the Emperor Wen's edict, but not the portion in this chapter. The agreement was that the Great Wall should separate the two countries; neither should overpass it. 263HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. II 4:17a The imperial edict said, "Since We are not perspica- 162 B.C. cious, We have been unable to [extend the influence of Our] virtue to distant [regions]. This has caused states outside the borders sometimes to be disquiet and discontented. Now when [the people] outside the four wildernesses [at the borders]1 1 According to the Book of History, Yu divided the world into five concentric domains, the outermost of which was the wilderness domain . Yen Shih-ku says, "The Jung and Ti [occupied] the wilderness domain, hence it is said, `The four wildernesses.' It says that it is a wilderness, [where] they suddenly go and come without any regularity. The Erh-ya says that Ku-chu [in the north], Pei-hu [in the south], Hsi-wang-mu [a place in the west], and Jih-hsia [in the east] are called the four wildernesses." do not live quietly, [the people] within the fiefs and the imperial domain2 2 Yen Shih-ku says, "The region which the emperor governs by himself [extends] for a thousand li [from the capital]; `not being in repose' [means] not to secure a peaceful dwelling-place." toil, suffer, and are not in repose. The responsibility for [trouble] both [inside and outside the borders] lies altogether in the scantiness of Our virtue and its inability to penetrate to distant [regions]. "In recent times, for many years in succession, the Huns have simultaneously ravaged the border regions; they have killed many of the officials and people. Our subjects at the border, the soldiers and officers, have moreover3 3 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the Official ed. writes yu for , which is the correct emendation. The SC also reads yu. not been able to enlighten them4 4 The SC has instead of the HS's . Cf. Mh II, 482, n. 2. concerning [Our] inner intentions, thereby aggravating my lack of virtue. Since thus for a long time the Central [Empire] and the outer kingdoms5 5 The Han empire and the Hun and other nations. The Han dynasty did not consider itself as a kingdom, but as the empire which included all the kingdoms. have been tied up in difficulties and continued hostilities, how can they themselves be contented [with this situation]? "Now We `have risen early and gone to sleep 264HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. II 162 B.C. late';1 1 A commonly used quotation from the Book of Odes, Pt. I, Bk. V, iv, 5 (Legge, I, p. 100). [We] have toiled and suffered for the world; 4:17a [We] have been solicitous and unhappy about all the people; for them We have been compassionate, sad, 17b and disquieted; not for one day has [this matter] left [Our] mind. Hence [We] have sent envoys [in rapid succession, so that] the caps and [carriage] coverings [of one caravan] were in sight [of the second], and their wheel tracks2 2 Ch'ien Ta-chao says that is the ancient , and that the Southern Academy ed. (1528) and the Fukien ed. (1549) write the second character. The Official ed. also writes the second character; the SC has . were uninterrupted [on the road], in order to enlighten the Shan-yÃ¼ concerning Our intentions. "Now the Shan-yÃ¼ has returned3 3 Cf. Mh II, 483, n. 2. Yen Shih-ku's note seems to indicate that his text had instead of the present . to the path of the ancients; he has sought for the peace of [Our] gods of the soils and grains; [his proposal] is advantageous for the interests of all the people. Recently, [together] with Us, we have [both] given up altogether the slight wrongs [we have done to each other]; hand in hand we are marching upon the road of high [principle]. We have bound ourselves together in the relationship of brotherhood in order to conserve the good4 4 Cf. Mh II, 483, n. 4. Yao Ch'a lived 533-606. people of the world. The peace and friendship has been fixed upon to begin from the present year."5 5 In the correspondence between Emperor Wen and the Shan-yÃ¼ (translated in de Groot, Die Hunnen, pp. 86 ff.) there is no evidence of any marriage to cement this peace; a girl of the imperial house had previously been sent to be married to the Shan-yÃ¼ when Shan-yÃ¼ Lao-chang came to the throne. III In the third year, in the spring, the second month, 161 B.C. [the Emperor] travelled and favored [the kingdom Mar./Apr. of] Tai [by a visit].6 6 The SC records nothing from this year to the sixth year. HS 27A: 21b adds, "In the autumn there was a great rain day and night, which did not end until the thirty-fifth day. In the Lan-t'ien [prefecture] the rivers from the mountains carried away more than nine hundred families and the Han [River] destroyed the houses of more than eight thousand common people. More than three hundred people were killed." 265HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. IV 4:17b In the fourth year, in the summer, the fourth 161 B.C. IV month, on [the day] ping-yin, the last day of the Aug. 16, month, there was an eclipse of the sun.1 1 Cf. App. III, v. In the 161 B.C. fifth month, an amnesty was granted to the world. 160 B.C. [The Emperor] freed the government male and June/July female slaves and made them ordinary people. [The Emperor] travelled and favored Yung [by a visit]. In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, V [the Emperor] travelled and favored the Lung-hsi 159 B.C. [Commandery with a visit]. In the third month, Feb. he travelled and favored Yung [with a visit]. In the Apr. autumn, the seventh month, he travelled and favored July/Aug. [the kingdom of] Tai [with a visit]. In the sixth year, in the winter, thirty thousand VI Hun horsemen entered the Shang Commandery and Winter thirty thousand [Hun] horsemen entered the YÃ¼n-chung [Commandery]. The Chief of the Palace Grandees, Mien,2 2 Yen Shih-ku says that this man's title is Palace Grandee, and his surname is Ling. HsÃ¼ Kuang (352-425) had however said that the title was Chief of the Palace Grandees; Yen Shih-ku replies that the surnames of all the officials are given in this passage and that there was not at this time any Chief of the Palace Grandees, for the title was not instituted until 156 B.C. Chavannes follows Yen Shih-ku; cf. Mh II, 484, n. 2. But Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) replies that 19B: 4b says that in 188 B.C. a Mien was appointed as Master of Ceremonies, and, in his comment on that passage, Yen Shih-ku says that Mien was his given name. Then he is probably the person referred to here, and the historian has merely lost his surname. With regard to Yen Shih-ku's statement about surnames being given, Chou Shou-ch'ang replies that there was no fixed principle about citing surnames, and gives examples to prove his point. With regard to the title of Chief of the Palace Grandees not being in use at this time, he replies that there are many such anachronisms. When Ying Pu was still King of Chiu-chiang, he was called King of Huai-nan. The title of Grand Chief of Agriculture was changed in 104 B.C. to Grand Minister of Agriculture, but in ch. 24 the latter title is sometimes used in dealing of events before 104 B.C. and the former title is used after 104 B.C. Hence HsÃ¼ Kuang is right in saying that his title was Chief of the Palace Grandees. was made General of Chariots and Cavalry, and stationed at Fei-hu; the 18a former Chancellor of [the kingdom of] Ch'u, Su Yi, 266HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VI 159 B.C. was made a General, and stationed at ChÃ¼-chu;1 1 HS 94A: 15b says that the kingdom of Tai garrisoned ChÃ¼-chu and the kingdom of Chao garrisoned the Fei-hu defile. 4:18a General Chang Wu was stationed in the Pei-ti [Commandery]; the Administrator2 2 The present text reads ; but commandery administrators were not called by this title until 148 B.C. Ch'ien Ta-hsin (1728-1804) thinks that the first word is an interpolation and should be omitted. The SC at this point does not have the first character. We have omitted it in the translation. of Ho-nei, Chou Ya-fu, was made a General and encamped temporarily3 3 Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) says, "To stay one night [at a place] is called ; to stay a second night is called hsin ; more than hsin is tz'u ." Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) says, "T'un [to be stationed] is different from tz'u. For a t'un there is an apportioned region; [an army] that tz'u is ready to be transferred." 18b at Hsi-liu. The Superintendant of the Imperial House, Liu Li, was made a General and encamped temporarily at Pa-shang; the Marquis of Chu-tzu, HsÃ¼ Li, was made a General and encamped temporarily at Chi-men, in order to be ready for 158 B.C. the Hu. May/June In the summer, the fourth month, there was a great drouth and locusts.4 4 HS 27Ba: 24a says, "In the spring there was a great drouth [all over] the world." Yen Shih-ku says, "Locusts are ; they eat the sprouts, and cause a visitation . Today they are popularly called po-chung1 ." [The Emperor] ordered that the nobles should not pay tribute. He opened [to the common people] the mountains and marshes,5 5 For hunting and fishing. Cf. Mh II, 485, n. 3. reduced the [imperial] robes and the imperial officers, diminished the [regular] number of Gentlemen and officials, and opened the granaries6 6 Ying Shao says, "Granaries [to which grain is] transported by water are called ." Cf. also Mh II, 485, n. 4. in order to succor the people. The people were allowed to sell 157 B.C. [aristocratic] ranks.7 7 Ts'ui Hao (381-450) comments, "Rich people wanted [aristocratic] ranks; poor people wanted money, hence [the Emperor] permitted buying and selling [ranks]." 19a In the seventh year, in the summer, the sixth month, VII on [the day] chi-hai, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang July 6 Palace. His testamentary decree said, "We have 267HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 4:19a heard it [said that], of all [plants and animals] that 157 B.C. sprout from or are born to any of the beings in the world, all of them, it seems, have to die. Death is a law of Heaven and Earth, and the nature of things. [Then] how could it be [so] greatly lamentable? [But] in the present age all esteem life and hate death; they elaborate burials, thereby ruining their estates; they perform a rigorous mourning, thereby injuring their health. I disapprove of this very much. "Moreover since We have not been virtuous and have not been able to assist Our subjects, if now that [We] are dead, [We] also cause [people] to perform rigorous mourning and lament for a prolonged period, causing them to suffer [extreme] cold and heat for several [years, We would] make old and young to be afflicted [by our death], and would hurt the feelings of the elders [of the people].1 1 SC 10:17a has for the HS and Chavannes (Mh II, 488) translates, "que les esprits des vieux comme des jeunes soient aigris." To diminish their drink and food, to interrupt the sacrifices to the manes and divinities, thereby aggravating my lack of virtueâwhat [could We] say to the world [about that]? "We have had the opportunity to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples, and, [in spite of Our] insignificant person, [We] have been entrusted for already more than twenty years [with a position] above the world's princes and kings. By the aid of the blessing of Heaven [and Earth2 2 Wang Hsien-shen says that the word should be inserted in the text after ; the parallelism requires it and the SC has it. ] and the benediction of the gods of the soils and grains, within the [four] quarters [of the world] there has been peace and contentment and no war.3 3 Cf. Mh II, 488, n. 1. Since We are not intelligent, 268HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 157 B.C. We have been constantly afraid of committing some 4:19a 19b faulty action, thereby dishonoring the virtue handed down by the deceased emperors, [Our father and elder brother]. In truth, as the years have lengthened out, [We] have been afraid of coming to a bad end, but now [We] have [ended1 1 Wang Nien-sun says that after the word there has dropped out the word ; the comments of Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265) and Yen Shih-ku show that it should be added here and in the corresponding passage of the SC. Chavannes has supplied this word in his translation; cf. Mh II, 489. This word is of course implied; but adding it is unnecessary and it spoils the rhythm. The notion behind this saying is that he has died a natural death, for something must be wrong with anyone who comes to a violent end. ] happily the years [assigned to Us by] Heaven, and are permitted to return to and receive offerings in the [ancestral] temple of Kao-[tsu].2 2 The descendant comes from the ancestral temple and after death returns there. When Our lack of wisdom is [thus]3 3 Yen Shih-ku says that yÃ¼ should here be read as , which marks a question. Liu Pin (1022-1088) and Liu Chang (1017-1068) agree. But Wang Nien-sun points out that Yen Shih-ku, in editing the comments on this passage, has excised four words of Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265), which are preserved in the Shih-chi Chi-chieh (written by P'ei Yin, fl. 465-472), "YÃ¼ is an expletive ." Wang Nien-sun says that yÃ¼ in this passage is not to be interpreted as , but as an auxiliary word, without meaning. As examples of this use of yÃ¼ he quotes sentences from HS 1B: 2b; from the Tso-chuan (prob. iv cent. B.C.), Duke Hsi, 23rd year; ibid., Dk. Hsiang, 29th yr.; ibid., Dk. Chao, 17th yr.; from the Kuo-yÃ¼ (prob. iii cent. B.C.), ch. I, p. 6b; ibid. on Chin (twice); ibid. on Chou; and ibid. on YÃ¼eh; in all of which yÃ¼ is merely an auxiliary meaningless word. It is a conjunctive conveying emphasis. HS 6: 8b has the phrase , but that has a different meaning, "am happy to be with; here yÃ¼ is equivalent to . recompensed, how can there be any thoughts of mourning? "Let it be ordered that, when [this] order reaches them, the officials and people of the empire should lament for three days [and then] all take off their mourning garments. Let there be no prohibition of taking a wife or of marrying off a daughter, of making sacrifices or of drinking wine or eating meat. As to those who must themselves take part in mourning 269HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 4:19b ceremonies, wear mourning garments, and lament, 157 B.C. let none of them wear unhemmed [mourning] garments;1 1 Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) and Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) explain as "to walk barefoot"; Yen Shih-ku approves; Chavannes and Wieger, Textes Historiques, follow. The Han-chi and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien write the second character directly. But Fu Yen (prob. ii cent.) says that the first character above means "to cut off. [The sentence means not to use unhemmed mourning garments ." Shen Ch'in-han points out, "In the Book of History, [where,] in the Introduction, [it says that] King Ch'eng , Cheng [HsÃ¼an, 127-200] reads [the first word] as . The Shih-ming [Han period] says, `The mourning garments for the three years [of mourning] are called "cut off"; do not hem it, merely cut it off .' This was the ancient meaning of people in Han times. Fu [Yen's] interpretation is right." Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) adds that this interpretation corresponds with the sense of the next sentence. The HHS, Treatise 26: 3b, says "The Accessory Officials [and officers] below [that grade], with linen clothes, with cap and mourning hat and mourning cloth girdle not wider than three inches, shall lament in the hall; military officials, with a linen mourning hat and great [ceremonial] cap." Wang Hsien-shen says that with these ceremonial garments, it goes without saying that they would not be barefoot. Hence Fu Yen's interpretation is the correct one. their headbands of hemp or white linen 20a strands2 2 Ch'ien Ta-chao says that should be ; the Southern Academy ed. (1528), the Fukien ed. (1549), the Official ed., the SC, and the Han-chi all write the second character. and girdles should not be more than three inches [wide]. Do not make a display of chariots or soldiers' weapons,3 3 Ying Shao says, "Do not use linen cloth to cover the chariots together with the soldier's weapons." But Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) says, "Do not send out light chariots, [used on formal occasions; they had no cloth canopies], and armed soldiers." Yen Shih-ku approves Ying Shao's interpretation, but Li Tz'u-ming (1829-1894) agrees with Fu Ch'ien, "The ancient chariots with canopies all used linen. For the mourning ceremonies, plain chariots with white linen cloth would not have been prohibited. This [passage] of course speaks of displaying chariots and arms. If we take Ying [Shao's] explanation, then it is difficult to explain `soldiers' weapons'; how could the soldiers' weapons be covered with linen?" and do not send people to wail and lament in the palaces or halls. Those in the [Palace] Hall who must lament shall all raise their voices fifteen times each morning and evening.4 4 Chavannes, (Mh II, 489) translates this sentence to mean that fifteen persons shall wail morning and night, but HHS, Tr. 6: 5b, in describing the mourning for an emperor, says that after the presentation of his posthumous name, "the Grand Master of Ceremonies kneels and says, `Wail.' The Grand Herald transmits [the order], `Wail.' Fifteen [times he says], `Raise your voices,' [then], `Stop wailing.' " When the rites are ended, [this practise] 270HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 157 B.C. must be stopped. Except for the morning and 4:20a evening time for lamenting, let [people] be forbidden to wail1 1 Li Tz'u-ming says that the SC has no second after , and since this word should not be repeated, the second one in the HS is an interpolation. HsÃ¼n YÃ¼eh's (148-209) Han-chi likewise has not this word. Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) notes that the Later Han dynasty followed the practises here specified. without special permission. [When the coffin is] already2 2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that was interchanged with . buried, let there be worn deep mourning for fifteen days, light mourning for fourteen days, and thin [garments] for seven days; [then] 20b take off the mourning garments.3 3 Chin Shao (fl. ca. 275) says, "The HS regularily uses ." Yen Shih-ku says these two words are interchanged. "These mourning practises were made up by the Emperor Wen following his own ideas, and were not taken from the Chou-li." Sometimes more than a hundred days elapsed between the death and burial of the Han emperors, so that mourning was worn considerably more than the thirty-six days herein ordered. Ti Fang-chin followed this practise; cf. 84: 4b. The Confucian theory had been to mourn to the third year, which period was ended at the beginning of the third year (27 months in all). Yen Jo-ch'Ã¼ (1636-1704) says, "This rule of the [Emperor] Wen of the Han [dynasty] was followed for three hundred and seventy years. Emperor Wu [died 220] of the Wei [dynasty] first ordered that with the burial [the ceremonies] had been completed, and abolished [the Han rule, ordering that] there should be no thirty-six days of [wearing] mourning. We do not know later what period used thirty-six days as the date for taking off mourning without considering [whether the deceased had been] buried or not. In the mourning for YÃ¼an-[tsung, 713-755] and Su-tsung [756-762] of the T'ang [dynasty], [the period for mourning] was again reduced [from] thirty-six days to twenty-seven days. Then the saying [that Emperor Wen, in determining the length of mourning] changed the days for the months [of the Chou period of mourning, which had been twenty-seven months] arose first from this [event]." Whatever is not [mentioned] in this order, let it all be done in accordance with [the spirit of] this order, and let it be published and told to the world in order that Our will may be clearly known. "Let the mountain and stream at the Pa Tomb4 4 The Pa Tomb was the sepulcher of the Emperor Wen, which he had, following custom, prepared for himself. The point of this order was that there should be no mound raised or any interference with the stream. 271HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 4:20b remain as it has been; let it not be altered. Let [the 157 B.C. concubines of the Emperor], the Ladies1 1 Ying Shao says, "Below the Ladies [who were outranked only by the Empress] there were the Beauties , the Sweet Ladies , the Eighth [Rank] Ladies , the Seventh [Rank] Ladies , the Senior Maids , and the Junior Maids . All were sent back to their homes. He considered important the cutting short of their family lines," i.e. he did not wish them to remain without children. Cf. 97A:2a. The Han-chi says, "His favorite, the Lady [nÃ©e] Shen, and those below, down to the Junior Maids, received an order to be married." Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggests that the Emperor was probably thinking about political mattersâthe way that the Empress Dowager did away with her husband's concubines and that supposed children of the Emperor Hui were brought forward after his death. For an account of the Emperor's harem, cf. Han-kuan Ta-wen, ch. 4, p. 5 ff; Mh II, 533; 490, n. 2. and those [ranking] lower, down to the Junior Maids, be sent back [to their homes]. Let it be ordered that the Palace Military Commander [Chou] Ya-fu be made General of Chariots and Cavalry,2 2 According to the SC 22:11a, the Supervisor of the Household of the Empress and Heir-apparent, Jung Nu, was also made General of Chariots and Cavalry to attend upon the Empress Dowager. that the [Director of] Dependent States [HsÃ¼] Tao be made General In Charge of Encampments,3 3 Yen Shih-ku says that the General In Charge of Encampments was to be "in charge of the encamped armies, in order to be prepared for any unexpected [rebellion or danger]." and that the Chief of 21a the Gentlemen-at-the-Palace Chang Wu be made the General [In Charge of] Replacing the Earth.4 4 Ju Shun says, "He was in charge of opening the grave and filling up and burying." Cf. Mh II, 203, n. 1. Let there be mobilized [for the funeral] sixteen thousand soldiers from the neighboring prefectures and fifteen thousand soldiers of the Prefect of the Capital.5 5 Emperor Wen wished to disturb the military dispositions of the empire as little as possible. The burial of the outer coffin, the opening and replacing of the earth shall be in charge of General [Chang] Wu. Let there be granted to the vassal kings and to those [ranking] below [them] down to the Filially Pious, the Fraternally Respectful, and 272HSIAO-WEN, Hou, Yr. VII 157 B.C. the [Deligent] Cultivators of the Soil, gold, cash, 4:21a and silk, to each a definite amount." July 12 On [the day] yi-szu [the Emperor] was buried in the Pa Tomb. In eulogy we say:1 1 This eulogy (except for the last two sentences) is found in SC 10:16a-17a verbatim (except for a few verbal differences) and translated in Mh II, 485-487. Its presence there, interrupting the account, seems to show that it was interpolated into the SC from the HS, but the differences between the two versions seem to indicate that the SC version is the earlier and the HS version the more polished one. Perhaps someone interpolated into the SC an earlier version of Pan Ku's eulogy. Emperor Hsiao-wen occupied the throne for twenty-three years. In his palaces and apartments, in his pastures and enclosures, in his carriages and saddle-horses, in his garments and daily needs, he made no addition or increase [over the requirements of his predecessors]. If there was [any activity] that was not convenient [for the people], he at once abandoned it in order to benefit his people. At one time he wanted to make a roofless terrace. He summoned the artisans to count up its [cost], and it would cost [the equivalent of] a hundred [catties of] gold. The Emperor said, "A hundred [catties of] gold is the estate of ten families 21b of medium [means]. I have received the palaces and apartments of the deceased emperors and have constantly been afraid that I should disgrace them; what is the use of building this terrace?"2 2 Szu-ma Cheng (fl. 713-742) quotes Ku Yeh-wang (519-581) as saying, "On top of the Li Mountain south of Hsin-feng there are still the ancient foundations of a terrace." Yen Shih-ku says, "Today on the top of the Li Mountain south of Hsin-feng Hsien there is a Lu-t'ai Village [Roofless Terrace Village], which is very high and conspicuous. There is still the place where the Emperor Wen wished to build a terrace." The Li Mountain is located, according to the Shina Redikai Chimei Yoran, 2 li southeast of the present Lin-t'ung , in the Ch'ing dynasty's Hsi-an Fu, Shensi. He personally dressed in thick black3 3 Chia Yi (200-168 B.C.) in his memorial to Emperor Wen, entitled Lun-shih-chen-su, in Han, Wei, Liu-ch'ao Pei San-min Chia-chi writes . Shen Ch'in-han suspects that instead of we should read , making the sentence read, "He personally wore thick silk," and adds, "Why should he have fixed upon black for his clothes? The Ku-chin-chu [prob. written dur. 265-420] writes, `Emperor Wen attended court wearing straw sandals.' " silk. The 273HSIAO-WEN 4:21b clothes of his favorite, the Lady [nÃ©e] Shen, did not trail on the ground. His curtains and canopies had no ornaments or embroidery, thereby showing that in naturalness and simplicity he was the leader of the world. When he constructed the Pa Tomb, he altogether [used] objects of pottery and did not allow the use of gold, silver, copper, or tin as ornaments.1 1 Such pottery mortuary objects are found in museums today. Shen Ch'in-han writes, "The Chin Dynastic History [written by Fang HsÃ¼an-ling, 578-648], in the Memoir of So Ch'en, says, `The people of the three [parts of the territory of ancient] Ch'in robbed and opened the two Han tombs of Pa and Tu [those of Emperors Wen HsÃ¼an; the latter was 50 li south of Ch'ang-an] and got many jewels and precious things. Emperor Min [313-317] asked [So] Ch'en, "How is it then that there are so many things in the Han tombs?" [So] Ch'en replied, "When the Han [dynasty] Sons of Heaven had been on the throne for one year, they made their tombs. The tribute and taxes of the empire were divided into three parts: one provided for the ancestral temple; one provided for [the entertainment of] guests; one provided for the tomb. The years that the Emperor Wu of the Han [dynasty] enjoyed were many and long; when he died, the Mou Tomb could not contain any more articles and its trees were already two spans [in circumference]. The `Red Eyebrows' [a group of bandits, ca. 23 A.D.] took the articles from the tomb, but could not diminish them by half. Today the decayed silk is still left there, and the pearls and jade have not yet been exhausted. These two tombs were parsimonious ones." ' According to what the present Annal says, then, after this Emperor died, his subjects and sons disregarded his acknowledged will." He took advantage of [the rise of] the hill [where] his [grave was built], and did not raise a mound [upon his tomb]. When the Commandant of Nan-yÃ¼eh, [Chao] T'o, set himself up as Emperor, [Emperor Wen] summoned and honored [Chao] T'o's older and younger cousins and enveloped them with his goodness; thereupon [Chao] T'o declared himself his subject.2 2 The Emperor Wen's letter to Chao T'o is considered one of the great pieces of Chinese literature. It is in 95: 9a-10a. After he had made peace and friendship with the Huns, and they had gone contrary to their covenant and entered [his territory] to rob, he ordered that the borders 274HSIAO-WEN should prepare for defence,1 1 Chavannes translates this phrase, "aux commandants prÃ©posÃ©s Ã  la garde des frontiÃ¨res," but I do not find any officials by this title. Cf. Mh II, 486. but did not send troops 4:21b deep into [the Hun territory], for fear of burdening his subjects. When the King of Wu, [Liu P'i], feigned illness and did not come to court, [the Emperor] granted him a stool and a cane.2 2 Presents made to an honored official over the age of sixty-six. Cf. Li-chi, ch. L, pt. i, art. i, sect. 29; Mh II, 487, n. 1. Liu P'i rebelled after the Emperor's death. Cf. 5: 4a. When the officials, YÃ¼an Ang and others, remonstrated [with him], although their words were cutting, he often pardoned them, accepted [their advice], and put it into practise.3 3 Shen Ch'in-han points out that the Feng-su T'ung-yi (written by Ying Shao, ca. 140-206), ch. Cheng-shih, says, "The Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng [32-6 B.C.] asked Liu Hsiang [76-8 B.C.], saying, `Later generations all say that Emperor Wen ruled the world until it almost attained perfect peace, and that his virtue equalled that of King Wen of the Chou [dynasty]. From what did this saying arise?' [Liu Hsiang] replied, `It arose from his practise regarding advice. Emperor Wen respected those who offered advice, in order not to hurt their feelings. When the officials, whether great or small, came [to him], then they could speak to him with ease, and the Emperor would stop his carriage and listen to them. If their advice could be [followed], he called it "Good"; if it could not be [followed], he merely smiled pleasantly. Most of these advisors praised him. Later people saw their transmitted writings, and so considered him to have been as [the writings said].' " 22a When Chang Wu and others accepted bribes of gold or cash, and [the fact] was discovered, [the Emperor] gave to them still more presents and grants, in order to shame them. His sole care was to improve the people by means of his virtue; for this reason [all the country] within the [four] seas was prosperous and opulent and advanced towards proper conduct and right relationships.4 4 Down to this point, this eulogy is found, practically verbatim, in the SC. Cf. p. 272, n. 1. [During his reign] there were pronounced verdicts [of capital punishment] in [only] several 275HSIAO-WEN 4:22a hundred [cases]; [so that he] almost succeeded in setting aside punishments [without using them].1 1 HS 72: 14a says, "[Kung] YÃ¼ [a high official, lived 124-43 B.C.] also said, `In the time of Emperor Hsiao-wen, he honored probity and purity and despized avariciousness and impurity. The adopted sons-in-law of merchants and officials who were sentenced for bribery were always imprisoned and could not become officials. He rewarded goodness and punished wickedness, and did not make his relatives and kin his chief officials. When [anyone's] crime was plain, [the Emperor ordered that person] to suffer his punishment; when it was doubtful, he gave [the criminal] to the people [for public opinion upon his crime; cf. Chou-Li, 35: 26, Biot p. 322 f]. He had no law for commuting crimes [by the payment of a fine], hence his orders were carried out and his prohibitions were effective, and the [land] within the [four] seas was greatly influenced [by his example]. In the empire there were pronounced verdicts upon [only] four hundred [cases], which was no different from setting aside punishments [without using them].' " Alas! How benevolent he was!2 2 This concluding sentence is the positive form of the last sentence in the SC's chapter. Cf. Mh II, 495. This eulogy of Emperor Wen is largely a criticism of Emperor Wu, who did very much the opposite of what Emperor Wen is here represented as having done. Cf. 6: 39b, the last sentence. 276 CHAPTER IV Appendix I STANDARD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES OF HAN TIMES The standard weights and measures are given in HS 21A: 15b-20a as follows: "The measures of length are the fen , the inch , the foot , the chang , and the yin . They are used to measure length. They arose originally from the length of the huang-chung [a sonorous tube; cf. Mh III, 302, 314-316]. Using medium sized kernels of black millet [which the Erh-ya III, p. 8a, defines as black millet], with the width of one [kernel of] millet measure ninety fenâ[that is] the length of the huang-chung.1 1 SC 25: 8a (Mh III, 314) says that the huang-chung is 8.1 Chinese inches long; but Liu Hsin (i cent. B.C.), Cheng HsÃ¼an (127-200), the Sui Dynastic History, and other authorities all give the length of the huang-chung as 9 inches. One [kernel of millet] is one fen; ten fen are an inch; ten inches are a foot; ten feet are a chang; ten chang are a yinâthus the five measures of length are clearly defined. . . . "The measures of capacity are the yo , the ko , the sheng , the tou , and the hu . They are used to measure amounts. They arose originally from the yo of the huang-chung. They are used to measure quantities and therein to define its volume. Using medium sized kernels of black millet, 1200 [kernels] fill its yo, using [clear] well water to level off the grains which stick out above the top of the measure. Double a yo makes a ko [a pun; the word for ko is used to mean `double']; ten ko make a sheng; ten sheng make a tou; ten tou make a hu. Then the five measures of capacity are excellent [standard instruments]. "The method of [construction of the standard measure is as follows]: Using bronze, [take] a square [which is] a foot [on each side] and circumscribe [a circle] outside of it, [on each] side making a [slight] additional space. Its top is the hu, its bottom is the tou, its left ear is the sheng, and its right ear is the ko and the yo. Its shape is like a bird-cup (chio). . . . Its weight is two chÃ¼n, . . . double 11,520 [shu]. . . . The persons who hold the offices of the Great Granarian and of the Grand Minister of Agriculture have charge of them. . . . "The weights used with a balance are the shu , the tael , the catty , the chÃ¼n , and the picul . They are used to weigh things; with a level [balance] as a standard, to know their weight. They 277APPENDIX I arose originally from the weight in the huang-chung. One yo [the volumetric contents of the huang-chung] contains 1200 [kernels of] millet and weighs 12 shu. Double it is a tael [a pun, the word for `tael' also means `double']. Twenty-four shu make a tael; sixteen taels make a catty; thirty catties make a chÃ¼n; four chÃ¼n make a picul." Fortunately we are not ignorant of the units contained in this table. There has been preserved in the imperial palace at Peking an imperial standard measure that is dated by its inscription in 9 A.D., during the reign of Wang Mang. It came to light in 1924. A hundred of these standard measures are said to have been made and distributed about the empire, of which only this one remains. This measure is plainly alluded to in the passage of the HS translated above. The inscription on the hu of this standard measure is translated here: "The lawful admirable [standard] measure. The hu. [The area of its base is obtained by taking] a square [which is] a foot [on each side] and circumscribing [a circle] outside of it. The additional space on [each] side is 0.095 inch. The area [of the base] is 162 [square] inches. Its depth is a foot. Its volume is 1620 [cubic] inches. Its capacity is ten sheng." The other measures have similar inscriptions, except for the numerals. This standard measure is a bronze right cylinder in shape, with a membrane across it one inch from one end, thus making of the two ends a hu and a tou measure respectively. On one side is attached a similar cylinder containing a sheng; on the other side is another cylinder, arranged like the large one, making a ko and a yo measure. A drawing of this measure is to be found in the Hsi-ch'ing Ku-chien , ch. 34; an account of it is in Wang Kuo-wei, Kuan-t'ang Chi-lin , no. 19. An account of the mathematics involved is to be found in the Yenching Journal of Chinese Studies, Dec. 1930, no. 8, p. 1493 ff. An excellent description, with photographs, is to be found in Ma Heng, The Fifteen Different Classes of Measures as Given in the LÃ¼ Li Chih of the Sui Dynasty History, translated by John C. Ferguson, Peiping, 1932. Mr. H. Ma of the National Palace Museum, Peiping, has very kindly supplied me with measurements of this important standard measure. The hu, which is said to be 1 ancient foot deep, measures 0.2310 meters in depth. The other measures are in proportion. The volume of the hu is 19968.753 cc. with the others in proportion. Mr. Ma Heng also very kindly sent me a copy of a paper by the late Dr. Fu Liu , in which Dr. Liu tells that he examined four 278CHAPTER IV weights dating from the time of Wang Mang, which were in the possession of the Peiping . These four weights are evidently of 3, 6, 9, and 60 catties respectively, and weighed 730.050 g., 1446.150 g., 2222.870 g., and 14775.000 g., respectively. The first two have no inscription; the third is marked " Nine Legal Catties," and the fourth is marked " Two Legal [ChÃ¼n]." The legal weight of a catty in Wang Mang times, as determined by these four weights, was 243.350 g., 241.025 g., 246.986 g., and 246.250 g., respectively, the average being 244.028 g. Dr. Liu thinks this weight is quite reliable; we may then take 244 g. as the weight of the ancient catty. Dr. Liu had previously weighed the standard measure of Wang Mang, which the HS says (in the passage quoted above) weighs two chÃ¼n. From that weight he calculated the catty as 226.667 g. I have also checked that weight by millet grains. Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the millet in terms of which these measures and weights are given is p'ei , which is said by the Erh-ya to have two kernels in one husk. But the Erh-ya seems to distinguish between p'ei and chÃ¼ (the word used in the HS); seed experts moreover doubt the existence of any such millet as the supposed p'ei, for all known millets have only one seed in a spikelet. It may be a rare sport. Panicum miliaceum is of the right size to be the millet referred to; the black veronesh variety is a dark brown and could easily be denoted by the definition of chÃ¼ in the Erh-ya, "black millet." Ten of its seeds set side by side measure 21.8 mm., which is only a little smaller than the Han inch. Stein (Serindia, I, 374) measured the inch of later Han times as 22.9 mm. Data found on a piece of silk of Han times (cf. Chavannes, Documents decouverts par Aurel Stein, p. 118) indicate that the Han inch was 22.7 mm. Twenty average size seeds were weighed by an expert and the weight of a seed (average of three weighings) was found to be 0.00590 grams, so that the ancient tael weighed about 218 gr. or 14 g. According to the size, this weight should be a little under the standard Wang Mang weight. To check this weight, 111 ancient cash, all with the inscription, "Half tael," and dating from Ch'in and Han times, loaned by Dr. A. W. Hummel, were weighed. Four large cash averaged 96.1 gr. each. The two best medium sized cash averaged 95.7 gr. each. Thirteen medium sized cash averaged 74.8 gr. each. Nine small cash seemingly in good condition averaged 42.2 gr. each. Eighty-five ordinary small cash averaged 38.3 gr. each. Since the Han dynasty regularly issued light-weight cash and permitted private coinage, it is natural that there should have been large variations in the weight of cash. If we take the weight of 279APPENDIX I the largest of these cash as being an actual half-tael, as its inscription says, the ancient tael weighed 192 gr., not far from the weight found from the miliaceum seeds. Something should be added to this weight because of the wear and tear on coins. Chavannes (Mh II, 103, n. 2) reports a statement in the Chin-shih-so (sect. Chin-sou, B) that the ancient catty weighed 6 taels of the present weight or 225 grams, which checks well with the weight we found. To check the volumetric data, the volume of 9600 miliaceum seeds was measured and found to be 81 ml., so that the volume of a yo would be 10.1 cc., an amount slightly larger than that in the Wang Mang measure. Laufer (Chinese Pottery of the Han Dynasty, p. 293) however notes a pottery ewer inscribed "Contains one sheng; weighs 14 taels; 52 B.C. No. 5." He reports its capacity as 790 cc., which is much too large; its weight, about 18 ounces, is also too large; this measure must be rejected as representing a marked variant. Stein (ibid. II, 660, 669) found several foot-rules of Han times in the desert, which measured about 9 inches (Eng. meas.) in length. Wang Kuo-wei (Jour. N. C. Br. R. A. S., 59: 111 ff) reports a foot-measure of the Wang Mang period a little over 9 inches (Eng. meas.) in length; he checked its length by the `trousers cash,' four of which made a foot. Using the above data from the Wang Mang standard measure and from the weights, the following table of Han standard measures is obtained: LENGTH 1 fen =â2.31 mm. = 0.091 in. Eng. meas. 10 fen = 1 inch = 23.10 mm. = 0.909 in. Eng. meas. 10 inches = 1 foot = 231.0 mm. = 9.094 in. Eng. meas. 10 feet = 1 chang = 2.31 meters = 7 ft. 6.94 in. Eng. meas. 10 chang = 1 yin = 23.10 meters = 75 ft. 9.4 in. Eng. meas. CAPACITY 1 yo =â9.98437 cc. = 0.60927 cu. in. 2 yo = 1 ko = 19.9687 cc. = 1.2185 cu. in. 10 ko = 1 sheng = 199.687 cc. = 12.1856 cu. in. = 0.36 U. S. dry pint. 10 sheng = 1 tou = 1996.875 cc. = 121.8561 cu. in. = 1.81 U. S. dry quart. 10 tou = 1 hu = 19968.753 cc. = 1218.5608 cu. in. = 0.565 U. S. bushels = 19.9682 liters. 280CHAPTER IV WEIGHT 1 shu =â9.8 gr. = 0.64 g. 24 shu = 1 tael = 235.4 gr. = 15.25 g. 16 taels = 1 catty = 8.6 oz. avoir. = 244 g. 30 catties = 1 chÃ¼n = 16 lb. 2.2 oz. avoir. = 7.32 kilograms. 4 chÃ¼n = 1 picul = 64 lb. 8.8 oz. avoir. = 29.3 kilograms. These measures are all smaller than present day measures. Wang Kuo-wei (cf. Jour. N. C. Br. R. A. S.) has described the causes and manner in which the foot measure was lengthened. Probably similar causes operated with other measures. Whereas in Han times 10 tou made a hu, later five tou made a hu. The very existence of a standard measure illustrates forcibly the degree of imperial organization at that time. 281 CHAPTER IV Appendix II THE SACRED FIELD This was the field in which the emperor opened the agricultural season by himself turning several furrows. Chavannes discussed the derivation and meaning of this word; cf. Mh II, 463, n. 2. The Commentator Tsan whom he mentions is Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285). Cf. also Maspero, La Chine antique, p. 231-232. Ying Shao, in a comment to HS 4: 9b, says, "Anciently the Son of Heaven plowed 10 mou of the sacred field for the world." Wei Chao adds, " is to borrow. He borrows the strength of the people to cultivate it in order to uphold the ancestral temple and moreover to encourage and lead the empire, causing them to emphasize agriculture." Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that, anciently and were interchanged; according to the comment of Ying Shao on HS 4: 9b, his text had the latter character; Wei Chao's comment (197-273/4) shows that his text had the former. The Official ed. has the latter character at that point. The word should be written correctly as . In the Shuo-wen under this last character "it says, `The emperor's Sacred Field [contains] 1000 mou. In ancient times [the government] employed the people like borrowing them. Hence it was called , from [to plow] and giving the pronunciation.' Under [the Shuo-wen] says, `The sacrificial pad [made of Myriophyllum or Imperata , on which an offering was placed].' It also says, `Grass which is not plaited is a wolf's litter (i.e. in great disorder) .' Under it says, `An account book.' " Then Wei Chao's interpretation, which Chavannes rejects, is correct. HS 65: 10b says, "The Ku-ch'eng Temple is distant, with no place for sojourning; moreover [the place is entirely] occupied by catalpas, bamboos, and the Sacred Field." Fu Ch'ien [ca. 125-195] comments on a sentence on 4: 12b [cf. p. 249], "The Ku-ch'eng Temple was south of the city of Ch'ang-an." Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) says, commenting on 4: 9b, "This was the fixed place of the Han [dynasty's] sacred field. Emperor Hsiao-wu plowed [the sacred field] in the Shang-lin [Park; Emperor] Hsiao-chao plowed [the sacred field] in the amusement park [within the Wei-yang Palace] of the Intendant of the Imperial Palace Parks. Hence the annals especially record it [because it was not the usual practise. 282CHAPTER IV HS] 24 [A: 12a] says, `The Emperor was impressed by the words of Chia Yi to open the sacred field the first time.' " But from the dates in Chia Yi's memorial (24A: 10b), this latter statement seems incorrect. Tu Yu (735-812) in his T'ung-tien, ch. 46, has a long historical account dealing with the practise of plowing the sacred field, beginning with the Chou and ending with the T'ang dynasty. We append a translation of his account dealing with the first two dynasties: "[According to] the regulations of the Chou [dynasty], `the Son of Heaven in the first month of spring selected [the day] of the first conjunction [of the sun and moon] and, himself carrying the plow and plowshare, placed them in the right [side] of his chariot. Leading the great ministers of the first and second ranks, the nobles, and the grandees, he personally plowed in the sacred field of a thousand mou in the southern suburbs [of the capital]. With his [ceremonial] cap with vermillion cap-strings, he himself held the plow, and the Son of Heaven [turned] three furrows' [the foregoing sentences are taken from the Book of Rites, Bk. IV, sect. I, pt. I, par. 13] in order to use it to serve Heaven, Earth, the mountains, the streams, the gods of the land and of the grains, and the deceased rulers, using [its products] to make sweet wine, rice or millet wine, millet, and sacrificial grain. Thereupon these products were taken to the Neichai [the superintendant of the inner apartments in the palace] and `an imperial edict [summoned] the Empress to lead the persons in the six palaces [within the imperial palace] to make the late and early [varieties of] seed to grow in order to present them to the ancestors' [these sentences are taken from the Chou-li, cf. Biot's trans. I, p. 148]. She ordered the ladies of the harem to store the seed to grow it again. The Tien-szu [the officer in charge of the laborers] `put himself at the head of his subordinates and tilled and hoed the King's field, and in season brought [to him its products]' [this sentence is also taken from the Chou-li; cf. Biot's trans. I, p. 84]. "Under the Han [dynasty], the decree of Emperor Wen reads, `Agriculture is the foundation of the world. Let the sacred field be opened. We Ourself lead in plowing in order to provide millet and grain offerings for the [imperial] ancestral temples.' The [Han-]chiu-yi [composed by Wei Hung, fl. 25-57, pt. II, p. 6b, 7a] says, `In the beginning of spring, [the Emperor] himself plows in the sacred field east [of the capital]. The officials sacrifice to the God of Agriculture. (The God of Agriculture is Shen-nung, Emperor Yen.) They offer one ox, one ram, and one pig. The many officials all follow him. The Emperor [plows] three furrows, the three highest ministers [plow] five [furrows], 283APPENDIX II the assistants to the three highest ministers and the [other] ministers [plow] ten ]furrows], the gentlemen and the common people [finish plowing] the entire mou. [The Emperor] grants to [the people of] the three [capital] commanderies within 200 li, to the Filially Pious, Fraternally Respectful, and Cultivators of the Fields and to the San-lao, cloth, silk and ten thousand hu of seeds of all kinds of grains, in order to establish for them the granary of the sacred field. He establishes a Chief and Assistants for the granary. The grains are all used for the grain offerings at the worship in the sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, in the ancestral temple, and to the many spirits of mountains and rivers.' The Emperor Ching's imperial edict said, `We Ourselves plow to lead the world [in plowing].' The Emperor Chao, when young, ascended the throne and plowed in the amusement park of the Intendant of the Imperial Palace Parks [within the Wei-yang Palace]." The ancient word for the Sacred Field implies that this field was one which `borrows' the forces of the people for its cultivation. The Emperor himself only plowed a few furrows, the actual cultivation was done by others. In Han times, the Imperial Sacred Field was located at the Ku-ch'eng Temple, south of Ch'ang-an, although, on occasion, other places were plowed. The products of the Imperial Field were used for sacrifices in the imperial ancestral temples. 284 CHAPTER IV Appendix III ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR WEN During this period, six eclipses were recorded in the SC and HS. We discuss them in chronological order. i. In the second year, the eleventh month, on the day kuei-mao, the last day of the month, an eclipse was recorded (4: 8b). P. Hoang gives this date as Jan. 2, 178 B.C., on which Oppolzer calculated his solar eclipse no. 2447. This was a partial eclipse; calculation shows that at Ch'ang-an it reached a magnitude of 0.20 at 2:48 p.m., local time. The longitude of the sun was 279.0Â° = 278.2Â° R.A. HS 27 Cb: 13b says that it was one degree in the constellation Wu-nÃ¼, of whose stars ? and ? Aquarii were then in 281.7Â° and 283.0Â° R.A. respectively. ii. In the SC, after the record of the above eclipse, there is the following statement (cf. Mh II, 461), "In the twelfth month, on the day of full moon [the fifteenth of the month], there was an eclipse of the sun." This date was, according to Hoang, Jan. 17, 178 B.C.; but eclipses of the sun cannot happen on the day of full moon. They happen only at new moon, whereas eclipses of the moon happen at full moon. HsÃ¼ Kuang (352-425) says that the HS does not record this eclipse [it is now neither in chap. 4 nor chap. 27], and tells that one copy [of the SC] says it was an eclipse of the moon, but that the histories do not record eclipses of the moon. The conjectural emenation of that copy is correct âOppolzer calculated his lunar eclipse no. 1580 on the evening of Jan. 16, 178 B.C. at Ch'ang-an. If the historian misread in the astronomical records a poorly written as being , this mistake could easily occur. This passage seems to show that the court astronomers kept a record of lunar as well as of solar eclipses. The discrepancy in dates indicates that Hoang's calendar is a day in error here. iii. In the third year, the tenth month, on the day ting-yu, the last day of the month, a third eclipse was recorded (4: 11a). This date was Dec. 22, 178 B.C., for which Oppolzer calculated his solar eclipse no. 2449. He charts the umbra of the moon as passing through the Malay peninsula; calculation shows that the eclipse at Ch'ang-an reached a magnitude of 0.35 at 1:58 p.m., local time. The sun was in long. 267.4Â° = 267.1Â° R.A. HS 27 Cb: 13b adds, "It was 23 degrees in [the constellation] Tou," of whose stars ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and ? Aquarii were then in R.A. 241.1Â°, 243.5Â°, 247.2Â°, 249.8Â°, 253.3Â° and 250.6Â°, respectively. 285APPENDIX III iv. In the third year, the eleventh month, on the day ting-mao, the last day of the month, a fourth eclipse is listed (4: 11a). P. Hoang gives this date as Jan. 20, 177 B.C., the first day of the twelfth month. HS 27 Cb: 13b adds, "It was 8 degrees in [the constellation] HsÃ¼," whose stars, ? Equulei and ? Aquarii, were then in R.A. 291.4Â° and 293.4Â°. The Han-chi 7: 7b dates this eclipse on "[the day] yi-mao, the last day of the month," 12 days before the HS's date and on the 18th day of that month. There was no eclipse on that date, for Oppolzer gives none. In the 22 years from the preceding eclipse to the next correctly dated eclipse in 154 B.C., in which period the HS lists 3 eclipses, there occurred 56 eclipses, of which only 10 were visible in China.1 1 Besides those located in Oppolzer, the following 9 partial eclipses were invisible in China because they belonged to initial (i.) or terminal (t.) runs in exeligmos series whose nearest umbral eclipses was located near the south pole: no. 2454 (t.); no. 2457 (i.), no. 2464 (i.), no. 2473 (t.), no. 2498 (t.), no. 2474 (t.), no. 2482 (i.), no. 2483 (t.), and no. 2501 (i.). In this period, 9 umbral eclipses were visible in China: (1) no. 2452, on June 6, 176 B.C., 23 days after a ting-mao day, sun in long. 70.7Â° = 69.3Â° R.A.; (2) no. 2459, on Oct. 10, 174 B.C., 39 days after such a day, sun in long. 193.2Â°; (3) no. 2460, on May 4, 173 B.C., 36 days after such a day, sun in long. 10.6Â°; (4) no. 2470, on July 17, 169 B.C., 41 days after such a day, sun in long. 110.2Â°; (5) no. 2475, on May 28, 167 B.C., 1 day after such a day, sun in long. 61.9Â°; (6) no. 2477, on May 17, 166 B.C., 55 days after such a day, sun in long. 51.4Â°; (7) no. 2486, on Mar. 5, 162 B.C., 3 days after such a day, sun in long. 340.9Â°; but the umbral path of this eclipse ran so far south that I calculated it, and found it invisible in the present Ch'ang-an, Pei-p'ing, Shantung, and Ch'ang-sha. In Wu (present Soochow), the eclipse reached a magnitude of only 0.02 at 4:34 p.m. local time, so that it was practically invisible; (8) no. 2489, on Aug. 16, 161 B.C., 53 days after such a day, sun in long. 140.1Â° = 142.5Â° R.A.; the umbral path of this eclipse ran so far north that I calculated it and found that in Ch'ang-an it reached a magnitude of 0.17 at 5:16 a.m. local time; (9) no. 2505, on Oct. 10, 155 B.C., 19 days after such a day, sun in long. 193.4Â°; the umbral path of this eclipse ran so far south that I calculated it and found that in Ch'ang-an the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.17 at 9:32 a.m., local time. Westwards and southwards its magnitude was greater. In this period, 11 partial eclipses occurred in the northern hemisphere, of which only one was visible in ancient China: no. 2481, on Mar. 26, 164 B.C., 13 days after a ting-mao day, sun in long. 165.7Â°. At Ch'ang-an the eclipse reached a magnitude of only 0.02 at 7:12 a.m., with visibility 286CHAPTER IV better at places north and west. On the longitude of Ch'ang-an, at latitude 40Â°, in the Ordos region, the magnitude of the eclipse reached 0.14.2 2 The other ten eclipses were all calculated approximately and found to be invisible in China. They were: no. 2455, on May 26, 175 B.C.; no. 2456, on Oct. 20, 175 B.C.; no. 2465, on Mar. 14, 171 B.C.; no. 2466, on Aug. 8, 171 B.C.; no. 2471, on Jan. 10, 168 B.C.; no. 2472, on June 7, 168 B.C.; no. 2490, on Jan. 12, 160 B.C.; no. 2492, on Aug. 6, 160 B.C.; 2499, on June 5, 157 B.C.; and no. 2500, on Oct. 31, 157 B.C. It is probable that the eclipse intended by the text was the first umbral eclipse listed above, on June 6, 176 B.C. Then the ting - mao of the text is an error for hsin - mao (a natural mistake) and Hoang's calendar is two days in error; this date was the first day of the fifth month, in the fourth year. The heavenly location given for this eclipse is then greatly in error. v. In the latter part of the reign, the fourth year, the fourth month, on the day ping-yin, the last day of the month, a fifth eclipse is listed (4: 17b). The Han-chi 8: 15a has the same reading. But there was no ping-yin day in that month. HS 27 Cb: 13b dates it on the day ping-ch'en, and adds, "It was 13 degrees in [the constellation] Tung-ching." This latter date was June 9, 160 B.C., according to P. Hoang. The first star in Tung-ching, ? Gemini, was then in 63.4Â° R.A. But Oppolzer lists no eclipse on this date. For the eclipses occurring about this time, cf. the discussion under the preceding eclipse. As to their cyclical days, ping-yin is the day before ting-mao, and ping-ch'en is 11 days before ting-mao. Very possibly the eighth umbral eclipse mentioned previously, on Aug. 16, 161 B.C., is the eclipse referred to in the text. It occurred on a keng-shen day, in the third year, the sixth month, the day before the last day of the month, according to Hoang's calendar. This identification would require no alteration in the order of events of HS ch. 4, merely a redating of one event; the cyclical day is already in doubt because of the difference between the two recordings. The location of the eclipse in the heavens is about 60Â° in error. vi. HS 27 Cb: 13b adds, "In the seventh year, the first month, on [the day] hsin-wei, the first day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun." The Han-chi has the same recording. P. Hoang gives this date as Feb. 9, 157 B.C. But no eclipse occurred on that date. For eclipses occurring about this time, cf. sub eclipse iv. Hsin-wei is 4 days after ting-mao. There was no eclipse visible in China in Emperor Wen's reign after the date we adopted for the preceding eclipse. It seems that Pan Ku considered this eclipse doubtful, for he did not put it into his "Annals," although it got into his chapter on the "Five Elements," 287APPENDIX III and was copied by the Han-chi in its chronological account. It looks as though someone considered that an eclipse was due at this time in order to predict the death of Emperor Wen, so placed an eclipse five months (about an eclipse season) before his death. Pan Ku's rejection of this eclipse in his Annals is a good testimony to his historical judgment. But the solar eclipse of Oct. 10, 155 B.C., which Hoang dates in Emperor Ching's second year, the ninth month, the day yi-yu, the last day of the month, was the only eclipse visible in China after the one identified for the preceding eclipse and before the next and correctly dated eclipse. Since Hoang's calendar may be a day in error, this date may have been the tenth month, the first day, the day ping-hsÃ¼. It seems stretching things to identify this eclipse with the one listed in ch. 27, yet it is peculiar that, in a period during which only one eclipse was listed, there should have been only one eclipse visible. 288 CHAPTER IV Appendix IV SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS OF THE FORMER HAN DYNASTY Since exactly fifty years elapsed from the accession of Kao-tsu in 206 B.C. down to and including the year of Emperor Wen's death, 157 B.C., it may be useful to summarize the results we have obtained in the discussion of the eclipses during that period. Out of the total number of 119 eclipses occurring, only 23 were visible in China. Four of these were so barely visible that we can hardly expect them to have been noticed. Excluding these, only 19 eclipses were visible in Ch'ang-an in this half-century. Six of them were recorded correctly. For three more listings we were able to suggest plausible dates. If these suggestions are accepted, only 9 out of a possible 19 eclipses were recordedâ about half of the total eclipses visible, weather permitting. In these four reigns, we found 13 records of solar eclipses. Nine referred to actual solar eclipses (accepting the suggested corrections for their dates). One plainly referred to an actual lunar eclipse. In the case of the three remaining we found great difficulties in suggesting any date. For one, we found reason to suspect that it was a later interpolation. For a second, we found that the general opposition on the part of the officials to the Empress Dowager's acts made it possible that an eclipse was fabricated to warn her. The third we found textually doubtful, since Pan Ku had not included it in his "Annals." The ten plainly visible eclipses that were not recorded were the following: in the reign of Kao-tsu, four: July 6, 206 B.C., Jan. 1, 205, July 26, 197, June 6, 195; in the reign of Emperor Hui, one: Sept. 29, 192; in the reign of the Empress of Kao-tsu, none; in the reign of Emperor Wen, five: Oct. 10, 174, Apr. 4, 173, July 17, 169, May 28, 167, and May 17, 166 B.C. The four others which were barely visible or visible only outside of Ch'ang-an were those of Oct. 8, 201 B.C., May 6, 184, Mar. 26, 164, and Mar. 5, 162 B.C. Bad weather is a possible cause for the failure to record some of these eclipses. But in Sian (Ch'ang-an), Shensi, during the period 1924-1934, the number of overcast days, as reported by Fr. E. Gherzi, S.J., the Director of the Zikawei Observatory, averaged almost the same for each 289APPENDIX IV month in the year, ranging from 7 in July and November to 11 in April and October. The monthly variation of the weather thus cannot account for the omission of these eclipses. Reports could moreover have been secured from places outside the capital. It is however noticeable that during the years 188 to 175 B.C. all the visible eclipses were recorded,1 1 If we adopt the eclipse of 192 for the first eclipse in the Empress Dowager's reign, that period is lengthened from 194 to 175 B.C. whereas between 175 and 162 B.C. five eclipses were visible and none were recorded. None of these were total in Ch'ang-an; they might easily have been missed if no one was looking for them. Why were they missed? Was it because of a change in the responsible astronomer, who was negligent in his duties? Or was it because it was considered that the good reign of Emperor Wen left Heaven without any necessity of sending eclipses? Emperor Wen in an edict said that an eclipse was an admonition from Heaven (4: 9a). Neugebauer (op. cit. II, 73) says that an eclipse is not conspicuous unless it reaches a magnitude of at least 0.75, or, at sunrise or sunset, 0.33, so that, unless people were looking for eclipses, they might easily be missed. Yet Halley's comet appeared in 163 B.C. (cf. p. 261, note), and it too was not recorded. Such a spectacle could hardly have been missed. Perhaps comets were not then being regularly recorded; cf. 5: n. 1.3. In later periods of good rule, such as that of Emperor HsÃ¼an, eclipses are similarily lacking in the records. Several conclusions emerge from a consideration of these eclipses: First, the Chinese accounts are predominatingly reliable, even for the beginning of the Han period. In the later parts of this period, we shall find them much more reliable. Secondly, there are errors of recording or transmission of the text. One eclipse (the second one in Kao-tsu's reign) is probably a later interpolation; three others were incorrectly dated, possibly before Pan Ku used them. In the case of the lunar eclipse we found positive evidence that an error had been made in transcribing from the original astronomical records. Thirdly, we found that the court astronomers, in some cases at least, kept records of lunar as well as of solar eclipses, although the historians did not consider them worth recording. Fourthly, we found that in one case at least (cf. ch. 2: App., ii) astronomical reports were gathered from places outside the capital. The divergences between the list in the "Annals" and that in ch. 27 regarding this eclipse suggest that the list in ch. 27 came from the court astronomers at the capital. 290CHAPTER IV Fifthly, we found that Pan Ku must have had records of eclipses not found in the SC, which he inserted into that material. Sixthly, eclipses were considered as warnings to the ruler from Heaven, so that during an unpopular reign all visible eclipses were recorded, while during a decade in a "good" reign no eclipses were recorded, not even a conspicuous comet. Seventhly, our tables of correspondences between European and Chinese dates are quite accurate for Han times, but they may be two days in error. Eighthly, the records of the position of the sun at the time of an eclipse are not reliable. In the case of the six correctly recorded eclipses, that location is fairly good, but in the only one which was total in Ch'ang-an, that of 181 B.C., in which alone the position of the sun among the stars could have been observed at the time of the eclipse, that position is in error by 14Â°. In the case of the three eclipses for which we suggested emendations in their date, the location of the sun is grossly in error. In the case of the one which seems a later interpolation, the location of the sun was plainly calculated from the calendar. We suspect that all of these records were so calculated. These locations are moreover not given in the "Annals," but only in the "Treatise on the Five Elements," and in two cases not at all. They are thus of little help in identifying an eclipse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">291 Chapter V INTRODUCTION This chapter, like the other Annals, is rather a chronological summary of the reign, amplified by the more important imperial enactments of the period, than what we should today call a history. The history, in the modern sense, is to be found in the "Treatises" and "Memoirs" dealing with the period. The chief source for this chapter, as for the preceding chapters, was probably the corresponding section of the SC, which, in this case, comprises the last part of ch. 10 ("The Annals of Emperor Wen") and the whole of ch. 11 ("The Annals of Emperor Ching"). The foregoing conclusion has however been challenged; Chang Yen, in the third century, declared that SC ch. 11 was one of the ten chapters which Pan Ku says were missing from that book; Szu-ma Cheng in the eighth century says that SC ch. 11 was taken from HS ch. 5. That skeptical view has received wide credence; Liang Ch'i-ch'ao (1873-1929) accepts it without comment in his Yao-chi Chieh-t'i Chi-ch'i Tu-fa, p. 51. Since Chang Yen's exact statement can better be discussed in connection with the next chapter, I shall here merely refer the reader to the introduction of that chapter and the conclusions there drawn. The only sure fact is that Pan Ku found ten chapters missing from the SC; Chang Yen seems to have made little more than a poor guess concerning which ones they were. Chavannes, after discussing this matter, says flatly that SC ch. 11 is not taken from HS ch. 5: "Nous ne voyons aucune raison de mettre en doubte leur authenticitÃ©." (Mh I, cciv; cf. also id. II, p. 496, n. 1). He also says that SC ch. 11 is quite incomplete, that it is inferior to Szu-ma Ch'ien's other work, and that hence the latter doubtless did not complete it as he had planned. With Chavannes's conclusion I am in full accord. HS ch. 5 is similar to the preceding chapters in its condensation and amplification of the material in the corresponding chapters of the SC. SC ch. 11 is rather sketchy; Pan Ku filled it out, chiefly from the collection of imperial edicts which he found in the imperial files, so that this chapter contains much that is not in the SC. Sometimes, however, Pan Ku condensed SC ch. 11. That chapter contains a long list of the alterations in official 292CHAPTER V titles made by Emperor Ching. Pan Ku transferred them to his treatise dealing with the bureaucracy. Mentions of ministerial appointments are similarily transferred. The estimate of Emperor Ching in the concluding paragraph of SC ch. 11 is moreover quite different from that in this chapter, so much so that Pan Ku seems to be combating the unfavorable impression given by Szu-ma Ch'ien in that paragraph. These are precisely the phenomena we should expect if Pan Ku were basing his account upon that of Szu-ma Ch'ien. Perhaps the most nearly conclusive evidence for the originality of SC ch. 11 is the curious mistake made in HS 5: 5a. Evidence from other parts of the HS and SC shows that the text of the HS at this point is in error (cf. n. 5.6); that error is moreover merely a condensed repetition of the corresponding passage in SC ch. 11. The SC moreover contains at this point additional statements omitted from the HS, so that the HS is plainly condensing the account in the SC and has fallen into error by copying that account. If Pan Ku had been compiling his account independently, he would hardly have made the same mistake that SC ch. 11 does, and would in more likelihood have given the correct information obtainable from other parts of his own and of Szu-ma Ch'ien's book. There is then every reason to conclude that Pan Ku followed mainly the corresponding chapter of the SC in preparing this chapter. The sort of material he added is the same as that in ch. 4, and has been discussed in the introduction to that chapter. *â*â* The outstanding event during the reign of Emperor Ching was the rebellion of the Seven Kingdoms in 154 B.C. Because it lasted only a few months, only one paragraph is devoted to it in the Annals. Yet it was the most serious revolt during the Former Han period. The leaders of this rebellion were Liu P'i, King of Wu, and the descendants of Liu Fei, King of Ch'i. A full account is given in the relevant Memoirs, from which this abstract in condensed. There had previously been serious trouble between Liu P'i and the imperial family. When Emperor Ching was still Heir-apparent, while playing an ancient game, resembling dice, he had a drunken quarrel over precedence with his second cousin, Liu Hsien, who was the son and heir of Liu P'i. The future Emperor took up the dice board, struck, and killed Liu Hsien. The Heir-apparent seems to have been in the right, for he was not punished, and the body was sent to Wu for burial. But Liu P'i was angry and sent the body back to Ch'ang-an. Emperor Wen smoothed the matter over and buried the murdered prince. Liu P'i thereafter alleged that he was ill and refused to come annually to 293INTRODUCTION Ch'ang-an to pay court as was required. Such conduct was almost equivalent to rebellion, but Emperor Wen, after investigation, again smoothed matters over, granting to the offended King a stool and cane, symbols of age, and excusing him from attendance because of his infirmities. Liu P'i then maintained peace as long as Emperor Wen was alive. There had also been bad feeling between the royal family of Ch'i and the imperial family. That royal family had descended from Kao-tsu's eldest son, Liu Fei, who did not succeed Kao-tsu because he was the child of a concubine. When the Empress of Kao-tsu died, Liu Fei's eldest son, Liu Hsiang, naturally thought that he would be given the imperial throne, but Kao-tsu's followers selected Emperor Wen, a son of Kao-tsu by another concubine. Liu Hsiang had put into the field his army and that of the oldest active member of the imperial clan, while the future Emperor Wen had done nothing. Hence Liu Hsiang and his clan thought the selection unjust and were bitterly disappointed. Chia Yi, perhaps the greatest statesman of Former Han times, warned Emperor Wen about the possibility of rebellion by the various vassal kingdoms, and urged weakening their power. Emperor Wen saw the cogency of his reasoning, but also had the wisdom to see that if he tried to take any territory from the feudal princes, such action would induce, rather than avoid, rebellion. He rejected Chia Yi's advice and sent him away to Ch'ang-sha, far from the court, thus placating the vassal kings. When Liu Tse, King of Ch'i and son of Liu Hsiang, died without heirs in 164 B.C., Emperor Wen put into practise Chia Yi's advice, dividing the large kingdom of Ch'i into seven kingdoms, which were given to Liu Hsiang's six brothers who had not yet been given kingdoms. Another kingdom, Ch'eng-yang, had also previously been made out of a section from Ch'i. Emperor Ching favored Ch'ao Ts'o greatly, and, soon after he ascended the throne, made the latter his Grandee Secretary. Like Chia Yi, Ch'ao Ts'o realized the danger to the throne from the vassal kingdoms. The strongest kingdom was Wu, rich in copper ore. Its king, Liu P'i, minted cash and made salt from sea-water in the southern part of his kingdom. These two enterprises produced so much revenue that he dispensed with taxation. Ch'ao Ts'o was not willing to wait to enfeeble Wu until the death of this king, who was already over sixty, for he had heard that Liu P'i was making preparations for rebellion and would rebel as soon as those preparations were complete. So Ch'ao Ts'o urged upon Emperor Ching the importance of curtailing immediately the power of the various vassal kings. 294CHAPTER V In doing so, he took advantage of the Han laws, which seem to have been so numerous and flexible that hardly anyone could avoid violating some of them. The King of Ch'u was first charged with having broken the rule requiring continence during mourning. Ch'ao Ts'o reported his crime and suggested that he be sentenced to execution so that Emperor Ching might take away a large slice of his territory in commutation of his sentence. Ch'ao Ts'o next made other accusations against the King of Chao, part of whose territory was likewise confiscated. The same treatment was given to the kingdom of Chiao-hsi. Thus the vassal kings were thrown into consternation, wondering who would suffer next. The King of Wu knew that, as the richest and strongest of the vassal kings, he would undoubtedly be attacked, and seems to have had private information that the officials in the capital were planning to take away most of his territory. He took the lead in arousing the vassal kings against the imperial government, especially the descendants of the King of Ch'i. His messengers arranged a coalition against the Emperor. He especially sought the King of Chiao-hsi, who was known for his military prowess. When a order arrived in Wu, commanding that his fairest provinces, including the copper region, should be taken from him, the King of Wu mobilized his army and six other kingdoms followed suit. The news of the revolt threw Emperor Ching into a panic. Urged by his ministers, he however promptly made arrangements to meet the rebellion. The Han dynasty kept a very large body of troops, numbering many tens of thousands, at the capital (cf. p. 206, n. 4). Emperor Ching selected his father's ablest generals to lead the three armies sent against the three groups of rebels, and made his maternal cousin, Tou Ying, the Commander-in-chief, putting him in charge of the reserve army to be stationed at Jung-yang. The King of Wu had sent a letter to all the vassal kings, blaming Ch'ao Ts'o for the conditions which led to the revolt, and urging them to join in executing Ch'ao Ts'o. A private enemy of this powerful minister secured an imperial audience and told Emperor Ching that if Ch'ao Ts'o were executed and the territory of the rebels were restored to them, they would submit. The Emperor was ready to catch at a straw. His ablest advisors, who could have corrected him, were away with the armies; when Emperor Ching secretly proposed the matter to three of his high ministers, they servilly agreed and prepared a secret memorial accusing Ch'ao Ts'o of capital crimes and begging for his execution, together with that of his relatives. Emperor Ching secretly approved this 295INTRODUCTION memorial and sent his Military Commander at the Capital to arrest Ch'ao Ts'o. The latter had no suspicion of the plot; when summoned, he dressed in his court garb and mounted his chariot to attend court. At the market-place he was stopped, was made to get down, and was cut in two at the waist. This cowardly sacrifice of a loyal minister helped Emperor Ching not at all. Some days later an aged colonel told him that Liu P'i had visions of setting up an independent empire with himself as Eastern Emperor; Ch'ao Ts'o's death had merely aided the rebels by removing a faithful and far-seeing servant of the Emperor and by discouraging bold and loyal imperial subjects. The rebelling kingdoms included four of the seven kingdoms that had been made out of Ch'i, viz. Chiao-hsi, Chi-nan, Tzu-ch'uan, and Chiao-tung, together with the three other kingdoms that had been curtailed, Wu, Chao, and Ch'u. The three other kingdoms formed from Ch'i remained loyal. The King of Ch'i went back on his agreement to rebel and guarded his cities. The King of Chi-pei said that his city-wall was broken and needed to be repaired. Nothing is said about the King of Ch'eng-yang. The King of Huai-nan, the famous Liu An, had also planned to rebel, but his plan was thwarted by his Lieutenant Chancellor. The high officials of the vassal kings were all appointed by the Emperor and were expected to watch their kings; in Ch'u and Chao four loyal officials lost their lives in attempting to prevent the revolt (cf. n. 6.5). In Huai-nan the Lieutenant Chancellor induced his King to make him General-in-Chief. In time of war, by custom, even a king had to obey his General-in-chief. This official then closed the gates of the cities and declared for the Han dynasty! An imperial general was sent to aid him; thus revolt was averted and the king kept his throne. Thus of the ten or more kingdoms that planned to rebel, only seven actually put their forces into the field. The rebels were located in three regions: Wu and Ch'u in the lower Yangtze valley, the four kingdoms made out of Ch'i in the present Shantung, and Chao in the present western Hopei. Chao was isolated; it sent its troops to its western border, intending to join with the forces of Wu and Ch'u when they came north, secure aid from the Huns, and advance upon the imperial capital. Chao was unable to take any active part in the campaign. The kingdoms formed from Ch'i were held back by the defections in their ranks. They gathered to besiege the capital of Ch'i. Its king sent a palace official to the Emperor for aid. Just when, against the wishes of his officials, the King of Ch'i was arranging to surrender, this 296CHAPTER V palace official returned. He was captured by the besiegers and was allowed to speak to his King from the foot of the city-wall, on condition that he would falsely report the defeat of the relieving army. The man agreed, but, when he had his opportunity to speak, he sacrificed his life in order to give his message that the relieving force had been victorious and would soon arrive. Thus surrender was prevented. The troops of these four kingdoms were thus held near their bases and did little to aid the revolt. The brunt of the fighting fell upon the troops of Wu and Ch'u. The King of Wu assembled his troops at Kuang-ling, crossed the Huai River, went west, made a junction with the troops of Ch'u, and attacked the kingdom of Liang, which was ruled by Emperor Ching's full brother, Liu Wu. The forces of Liang were routed at Chi-pi, where it is said that several tens of thousands were killed. The King of Liang sent another army against the rebels, but it was also defeated, so his troops fled into his capital, Sui-yang, which was defended. Chou Ya-fu, who was made the imperial general against the armies of Wu and Ch'u, proposed, as his plan of campaign, to cut their communications and allow them to wear themselves out before he attacked them. They came from the Yangtze valley, where horses were scarce, hence were weak in light soldiers and cavalry, while the imperial force was strong in cavalry. Chou Ya-fu sent his cavalry to cut the communications by which food was brought to these armies. The King of Liang sent a messenger to Chou Ya-fu for aid. But Emperor Ching was jealous of his brother, for Liu Wu was the favorite child of his mother, the Empress Dowager nÃ©e Tou. The Emperor could not openly oppose his mother, but he would not have been sorry if his brother had suffered harm, for, probably by prearrangement with the Emperor, Chou Ya-fu refused to send aid to Liang. When Liu Wu got Emperor Ching to order that Chou Ya-fu should send aid to Liang, Chou Ya-fu did not pay any attention to the order, yet he was never called to account for his disobedience of an imperial edict. Time was with the imperial forces, and Chou Ya-fu's plan of campaign proved wise. It was winter and the rebels had little food, for they could not capture the cities, in which food was stored, and their communications were interrupted. The rebels were finally defeated by Liang and came to Hsia-yi, where Chou Ya-fu had concentrated his troops, but Chou Ya-fu would not come out of his entrenchments to fight. Not until more than a month after the rebellion had begun, when the troops of Wu were scattered, had lost many through desertion, and were 297INTRODUCTION famished, did Chou Ya-fu fight a pitched battle. He routed the troops of Wu and Ch'u. The King of Wu fled from the army by night and the King of Ch'u committed suicide. Liu P'i fled across his kingdom to the south, where he took refuge with the barbarians of Eastern YÃ¼eh and attempted to gather troops for another attempt. But the emissaries of Emperor Ching induced the people of Tan-t'u to stab Liu P'i as he was out encouraging his troops. His head was sent to Ch'ang-an. When the imperial forces had routed the besiegers of the capital of Ch'i and relieved its siege, it was discovered that the King of Ch'i had originally agreed to revolt. He committed suicide. Emperor Ching however pardoned his heir and appointed him to succeed his father. The kings of the four revolting kingdoms made from Ch'i either committed suicide or were executed; their kingdoms were abolished and made into commanderies. When the Huns heard that Wu and Ch'u had been defeated, they did not come to the aid of Chao. Its king retreated to his capital, Han-tan, where he was besieged. The river was finally used to breach the city-wall, and the King of Chao committed suicide. Thus the imperial line was firmly established on the throne and a break-up of the empire was prevented. Thereafter it became the set policy of the dynasty to enfeeble the vassal kingdoms by dividing the territory of a kingdom among all the heirs of a king, and by taking away some territory whenever a king committed a misstep. The vassal kings were carefully watched and supervised by their own officials (who were appointed by the imperial court). These kings became so unimportant that the Emperor could utterly disregard their wishes and Wang Mang could reduce them to private life without difficulty. *â*â* The reign of Emperor Ching shows the deterioration in character that was inevitable when an emperor had been raised in a harem and protected from close contact with the world of action. The decay and fall of the dynasty was eventually produced by this deterioration. Emperor Ching indulged his petty personal feelings, allowing his likes and dislikes to guide him in his choice and treatment of his ministers. He showed in practise an acute distaste for frank admonitions, and allowed palace intrigues to influence the government. Chou Ya-fu was the most distinguished general and official in the reign. He was a faithful and capable servant, who put down the rebellion of the Seven Kingdoms and in reward was made Lieutenant 298CHAPTER V Chancellor, the highest position in the government. But he did not always trouble to bring himself into accord with Emperor Ching's likes and dislikes. After the Emperor had divorced his first Empress and had appointed his second Empress, the Emperor's mother suggested that the new Empress's brother, Wang Hsin, should be made a marquis. The procedure of ennobling the close relatives of an empress or even those of a favorite concubine, which later became common, had not yet become a custom, and Chou Ya-fu protested. He is reported to have said, "Emperor Kao-tsu made a covenant with his generals that, except for members of the Liu clan, no one should be made a king, and, except for those who have done distinguished [military] service, no one should be made a marquis. Now, although Wang Hsin is the older brother of the Empress, he has done no distinguished service; to make him a marquis would be contrary to the covenant." Emperor Ching had accordingly to drop the matter. Later Chou Ya-fu also protested against enfeoffing as marquises five Hun kings and nobles who surrendered to the Chinese: "These people have turned traitor to their king and have surrendered to your Majesty; if your Majesty makes marquises of them, then how will you be able to reprove your subjects who do not keep faith with you?" Emperor Ching did not think his arguments were apposite. He enfeoffed the lot, and Chou Ya-fu resigned his position on account of illness. The Emperor could not forget criticism and resolved to even the score. He summoned Chou Ya-fu to a feast in the forbidden apartments of the palace and had set before him large slices of meat without having them cut up and without any chopsticks wherewith to eat. Chou Ya-fu fell into the trap, and, with the easy familiarity of one who was used to command, turned to the Master of the Mats, saying, "Bring some chopsticks." Such a request however implied criticism of the imperial arrangements, and Emperor Ching looked at him, laughing sarcastically, "This too cannot be unsatisfactory to you, sir?" Chou Ya-fu begged pardon, but the Emperor merely said, "Rise," whereupon Chou Ya-fu hastened out. Emperor Ching looked after him and said, "This man is tormented by desire; he cannot be a satisfactory official for the young lord my successor." After such an imperial condemnation, the officials merely awaited a pretext to end his career. Before long his son purchased five hundred suits of armor from the imperial Department of Works for use in his father's funeral. A mistreated workman informed against the son, and Chou Ya-fu was arrested. He proudly refused to answer the questions put him by the officials. When Emperor Ching heard of it, he cursed 299INTRODUCTION him, saying, "I have no more use for him," and sent him to the Commandant of Justice's jail. There he was again questioned and charged with planning rebellion. Chou Ya-fu answered that these arms were merely burial articles, whereupon an official replied, "If you, sir, do not intend to rebel on earth, then you merely intend to rebel below the earth." The officials pressed him harshly; he refused to eat and died in five days. Thus was rewarded a faithful servant of the dynasty who had opposed the imperial will for the good of the empire. Although Emperor Ching continued the practise of his father in his edicts, asking the officials to recommend for the bureaucracy persons who "can speak frankly and admonish unflinchingly," yet by his actions he tacitly encouraged sycophancy and discouraged any opposition to his will. A century later advice contrary to the imperial will could be denominated a crime and punished. Chou Ya-fu was the outstanding example of the Emperor's indulgence in petty dislikes; the able and proud Tou Ying was kept from high office all through the reign because he had opposed the Emperor's change of his Heir. Emperor Ching tolerated no opposition. *â*â* Intrigue showed itself most prominently in the change of the imperial heir. Emperor Ching had fourteen sons (and numerous daughters) by six different women of his harem, the largest number of children by any emperor of the Former Han dynasty. He first chose as his Heir-apparent his oldest son, Liu Jung, a son of the Concubine nÃ©e Li. His other sons, including Liu Ch'Ãª, the future Emperor Wu, were made kings. The first Empress, nÃ©e Po, had been appointed through the influence of Emperior Ching's grandmother, the Grand Dowager Empress nÃ©e Po, to whose clan the Empress belonged. But the Empress had no children and lost her husband's favor; four years after the death of the Grand Empress Dowager, the Empress nÃ©e Po was dismissed. The favorite women of the Emperor thereupon intrigued for the vacant position. Emperor Ching's eldest sister, Liu Piao, who was entitled an Elder Princess, recommended to him the women of his harem whom he favored with his attentions. She wanted to marry her daughter to the Heir-apparent, as was often done, for the two children were of different surnames. But the Heir-apparent's mother, the concubine nÃ©e Li, was jealous of the Elder Princess's influence with the Emperor and refused to consent to the marriage. The Elder Princess thereupon suggested marrying her daughter to Liu Ch'Ãª, the Emperor's son by a Lady nÃ©e Wang. The Lady nÃ©e Wang 300CHAPTER V agreed, although her son was then less than four years old. From that time on, the Elder Princess slandered the Concubine nÃ©e Li to Emperor Ching and praised the Lady nÃ©e Wang. When the latter knew that the Concubine nÃ©e Li was definitely out of favor with Emperor Ching, she moved to crystallize his feelings by sending someone to urge upon the officials the propriety of asking for the appointment of a new Empress. An official promptly suggested the mother of the Heir-apparent, the Concubine nÃ©e Li, as the Empress. Emperor Ching became thoroughly wrathful at this idea and had the official who had made the suggestion tried and executed. Then he dismissed from his position as Heir-apparent the son of the Concubine nÃ©e Li, Liu Jung, for it was the custom that the mother of the Heir-apparent should become the Empress. Emperor Ching next appointed as Empress his favorite, the Lady nÃ©e Wang, and then made her son, Liu Ch'Ãª, the Imperial Heir-apparent. Three years later, the first Heir-apparent, Liu Jung, was imprisoned for usurping temple land and committed suicide. Thus Emperor Wu came to the throne because of palace intrigues. There were other such palace intrigues: the memoirs of the important personages of the reign are full of them. Liu Wu, Emperor Ching's younger brother, was the favorite son of Emperor Ching's mother, and she tried to have Liu Wu made the Heir-apparent of Emperor Ching. Her nephew, the bold Tou Ying, advised Emperor Ching against such a move, thus incurring the enmity of the Empress Dowager, who banished him from the court. Later she renewed her entreaties for Liu Wu, but YÃ¼an Ang opposed the move. In revenge Liu Wu had YÃ¼an Ang assassinated. Emperor Ching was enraged and had the assassins traced to Liu Wu's palace. The Empress Dowager wept incessantly and refused to eat for fear that her younger son would be executed. Emperor Ching was told by the official sent to investigate, "If now Liu Wu is not executed, the law of the Han dynasty will not be carried out; if he is executed, the Empress Dowager's food will be tasteless and her sleep troubled. This trouble will come upon your Majesty." Filial piety thus kept Emperor Ching from carrying out the law, and Liu Wu was finally pardoned in spite of the Emperor's dislike for him. Such incidents throw deep shadows upon Emperor Ching's reign. They seem quite inevitable when the ruler has grown up in the luxury and indulgence of an imperial harem. These intrigues are not told in the "Imperial Annals," because they belong to the private life of the individuals concerned, rather than to the official actions of the government, which latter were alone thought to belong in the "Annals." They 301INTRODUCTION are mentioned here to show the extraordinary wealth of information contained in this encyclopedic history and to urge the reader to go behind the "Annals" to the real history of the reign, which is often to be found in the "Memoirs." An abstract of the pertinent "Memoirs" will be found in the Glossary. *â*â* Szu-ma Ch'ien, in his summary of this reign (Mh II, 509), does not award the slightest praise to Emperor Ching; Wieger, in his Textes historiques, I, 452 f, condemns the Emperor roundly. Pan Ku, in his eulogy (5: 10b), on the other hand equates Emperors Wen and Ching with Kings Ch'eng and K'ang of the Chou dynasty, which seems to be high praise. Many of the additions made by Pan Ku to Szu-ma Ch'ien's "Annals," especially those in the latter years of the reign, seem designed to counteract the low impression of Emperor Ching given in the SCâ these additions show an attempt on the part of the Emperor to be a beneficent ruler over his people, limiting severities, punishing wrongdoing, and improving the administration. Emperor Ching does not deserve Wieger's condemnation. In spite of the fact that many of his deeds cannot bear scrutiny, and that his self-indulgence of petty whims sometimes brought calamity to the highest personages, yet in general the administration of the government was good, and the Emperor attempted to continue the beneficence and economy of Emperor Wen. Szu-ma Kuang, in his Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 15: 19b ff, quotes Pan Ku's eulogy and points out that the period of Emperors Wen and Ching was in general a time of peace and plenty, when wealth accumulated and properity was restored, but when growing wealth also brought about the beginning of the extravagance and luxury that was, together with continual military expeditions, to result in the economic collapse under Emperor Wu. The SC says little of King K'ang except that his reign was a period of peace, so that, during his reign and that of his father, "the mutilating punishments were set aside and not used for a period of forty years." Inasmuch as Emperor Ching's reign was largely a period of peace (the revolt of the Seven Kingdoms lasted only a few months), and inasmuch as he attempted to continue the excellent tradition left by his father, Pan Ku's comparison of Emperor Ching with King K'ang seems quite apt. 303 THE BOOK OF THE [FORMER] HAN [DYNASTY] Chapter V THE FIFTH [IMPERIAL ANNALS] The Annals of [Emperor Hsiao]-Ching Emperor Hsiao-ching was the Heir-apparent of Emperor Wen. His mother was called the Empress [nÃ©e] Tou. In the seventh year of the latter [part 157 B. C. of Emperor Wen's reign],1.1 1.1 The reign of an emperor continues, for chronological purposes, to the end of the calendar year in which he dies. The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien (1084) includes the events in an emperor's reign previous to the beginning of his first year, including his accession, in the previous emperor's reign. in the sixth month, Emperor July 6 Wen died; on [the day] ting-wei the Heir-apparent July 14 took the imperial throne.1.2 1.2 This date was two days after the burial of Emperor Wen. SC 10: 18b (Mh II, 491) says that he took the throne "in the Temple of Kao-[tsu] and on [the day] ting-wei he inherited the title and was called `Emperor.' " The Kung-yang Commentary (iii cent. B.C.) 25: 7b (Dk. Ting, I), says, "Arrange the coffin between the two [central] pillars, and then only take the throne." Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831) remarks, "The regulation, [used by] later generations, of taking the throne before the encoffined corpse, came thus from the explanation in the Kung-yang [Commentary]. This [practise] is honoring [the customs] of later antiquity." He honored the Empress Dowager nÃ©e Po, entitling her the Grand Dowager Empress. The Empress [nÃ©e Tou] was entitled the Empress Dowager. In the ninth month a Oct. comet appeared in the western quarter [of the sky].1.3 1.3 HS 27 Cb: 22b adds, "Its trunk was straight [in the constellations] Wei3 and Chi, and its end pointed to [the constellations] HsÃ¼ and Wei1. It was more than ten feet long and reached the Heavenly Han [River (the Milky Way)]. On the sixteenth day it disappeared." This comet is no. 17 in J. Williams, Chinese Observations of Comets. The Chinese phraseology in recording a comet is very expressive, e.g., , lit. "There was a star which bushed out [or `cometed'] in the western quarter [of the sky]." When we remember that a comet often appears at first as a mere star wandering among the other stars and later puts forth a tail, the Chinese expression appears apt. Before the time of Emperor Ching only two comets are mentioned in Han times: one in Aug./Sept. 204 B.C. (27 Cb: 22a) and the other in the summer of 172 B.C. (4: 13b). Even Halley's comet, which passed perihelion on May 20, 163 B.C., was not recorded. Did Emperor Ching install an astrologer who was really interested in watching the heavens? Szu-ma T'an did not begin his official career until after 140 B.C., when he became Grand Astrologer (SC 130: 3a). In 157 B.C. there was ended the last of the vassal kingdoms not ruled by a scion of the Liu family. Wu Jui had been moved from the kingdom of Heng-shan to that of Ch'ang-sha in 202 B.C. (1 B: 4a); in 157 B.C. the last king of his line died without heirs, and the kingdom was abolished, later to be given to a son of Emperor Wu. All the other vassal kingdoms not in the hands of a member of the imperial clan had been ended by 196 B.C. 304HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 177 B.C. I In the first year, in the winter, the tenth month, 5:1a Nov. an imperial edict said, "We have indeed heard that the ancients regarded as founder him who achieves great deeds and as exemplar him who possesses 1b virtue.1.4 1.4 Ying Shao (ca. 140-206) says, "The one who first takes the empire is the Founder (tsu ). That Emperor Kao was entitled Kao-tsu [lit. "the Eminent Founder"] is an instance [of this use]. The one who first governs the empire well becomes the Exemplar (tsung ). That Emperor Wen was entitled the Grand Exemplar (t'ai -tsung) is an instance [of this use]." Yen Shih-ku, with his usual cocksureness, writes, "Ying [Shao's] explanation is wrong. Tsu [means] first; he first received the mandate [of Heaven]. Tsung [means] honorable; being virtuous he deserves to be honored." Liu Pin (1022-1088) replies, "Yen [Shih-ku's] saying is mistaken. The one who first received the Mandate [of Heaven] is entitled the Great Founder (t'ai-tsu). Those who perform great deeds are also entitled tsu. [Emperor] Tsu-chia [said to have reigned 1258-1226 B.C.] of the Shang [dynasty] was an instance [of this use]." Cf. Mh II, 491, n. 1. Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an (xix cent.) writes, "That `the Founder has merit and the Exemplar has virtue' is said in the K'ung-tzu Chia-yÃ¼ [forged by Wang Su, fl. 386-534, based on an ancient book and later interpolated], ch. "Miao-chih," to be a saying of Confucius. Although this is not adequate proof, in the HHS, An. 1: [1a], the commentator [Li Hsien, 651-684] quotes these words and attributes them to the Rites, which is probably a lost treatise on the rites." In establishing rites and music, each [element of the ceremonies] should have its corresponding motive. Songs are the means of expressing virtue. Dances are the means of manifesting great deeds.1.5 1.5 Wang Ch'i-yÃ¼an calls attention to a passage in the Po-hu-t'ung Te-lun (said in HHS, Mem. 40 B: 9a to have been composed by Pan Ku; said by W. Hung to have been composed between 213-245), A: 22a, which reads, "The singers are placed above [in the hall]; the dancers are placed below [the hall]. Why? Because the singers symbolize virtue and the dancers symbolize great deeds. The superior man places virtue above and great deeds below." When, in the Temple of Kao-[tsu], the 305HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 5:1b eighth month wine1.6 1.6 Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) explains, "On the first day of the first month they make wine; in the eighth month it is completed. It is named chou [the word in the text]. It is called chou because it is pure. At the time of Emperor Wu, because in the eighth month, when [the Emperor first] tastes this chou, there was an assembly of the nobles in the [imperial ancestral] temple, at which they paid money to assist in [defraying the expenses of] the sacrifice, it was hence called the eighth month wine money ." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Chou is a thrice-repeated agitated and purified wine. Its taste is rich, hence it is used as an offering in the ancestral temples." Cf. 6: App. III for a description of the ceremonies connected with this wine. [is offered], there are per- 157 B.C. formed the Dances of Military Virtue, of the Peaceful Beginning, and of the Five Elements.1.7 1.7 HS 22: 13b says, "The Dance of Military Virtue was made in the fourth year of Kao-tsu (203 B.C.) in order to symbolize that the empire is happy because military power has already been used to do away with confusion. The Dance of the Peaceful Beginning was originally Shun's Shao Dance. In his sixth year (201 B.C.), Kao-tsu changed its name to the Peaceful Beginning to show that he [did] not copy [what Shun had done]. The Dance of the Five Elements was originally a dance of the Chou [dynasty]. In his twenty-sixth year (221 B.C.), the First Emperor of the Ch'in [dynasty] changed its name to the Five Elements." Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) adds, "In the Military Virtue, the dancers hold shields and battle-axes. In the Peaceful Beginning, the dancers hold feathers and flutes. In the Five Elements, the dancers' ceremonial hats and clothes imitate the colors of the five elements. Cf. the `Treatise on Music' [HS, ch. 22]." Ying Shao, in a note to SCHC 10: 44, remarks, "According to my opinion of what the present passage says about the dancing in the Dances of Military Virtue, of the Peaceful Beginning, and of the Five Elements, their music in general was like the music of King Wu [of the Chou dynasty, 1122-1117 B.C.]. The meaning was that Kao-tsu used military means to conquer the world, hence he showed that he was not copying [what King Wu had done, and could make a new beginning, just as King Wu did]. When they begin to perform music, they first perform the Peaceful Beginning. Using feathers, flutes, and ornamented and embroidered clothes, they make the first [performance]; then they immediately perform the Five Elements. The Five Elements is a military dance; they hold shields and battleaxes and in their clothes they have the colors of the five elements." In a comment to the Chou-li 23: 7b, sub the Ta-hsÃ¼, Cheng Chung (ca. 5 B.C.-A.D. 83) says, "The Han Code Concerning the Music Master [now lost] says, `The children of humble people are not permitted to dance at the offering of the eighth month wine in the [imperial] ancestral temples. Officials who have been appointed to [positions ranked at] two thousand piculs down to six hundred piculs, together with those [holding noble ranks from] Kuan-nei Marquis down to Fifth Rank Grandee first pick their heirs who are seven feet [63 in. Eng. meas.] tall or more, in their twelfth year to their thirtieth year, whose features and appearance are harmonious, and whose body and members are healthy, and use them for the dancers.' " When, 306HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 157 B.C. in the Temple of [Emperor] Hsiao-hui, the eighth 5:1b month wine is offered, there are performed the Dances of the Peaceful Beginning, and of the Five Elements. "When Emperor Hsiao-wen administered the empire, he opened [free] the [customs] barriers and bridges,1.8 1.8 Cf. 4: 14a. making no difference between [near and] distant regions; he suppressed [the punishments for] speaking ill and criticizing,1.9 1.9 Cf. 4: 10b. and did away with mutilating punishments;1.10 1.10 Cf. 4: 14b. he bestowed and granted [pensions] to elders and the aged;1.11 1.11 Cf. 4: 7a, b. he took care of and pitied the orphans and the childless,1.12 1.12 Cf. p. 238, n. 1; 4: 14b. in order to satisfy [the desires of all] living [persons]. He restrained his likes and desires and did not receive any presents, not enriching himself with [such] advantages.1.13 1.13 The clause translated, "not enriching himself with such advantages," now stands after the clause, "did not punish those who had committed no crimes." It has been moved in accordance with its meaning, following the Fukien ed. (1549) and the SC, at the suggestion of Ch'ien Ta-chao and Wang Hsien-ch'ien. 2a [In the punishment] of criminals [he did not involve] their wives and children;2.1 2.1 Cf. p. 233 &amp; n. 3. The text reads ; Yen Shih-ku says that this character "should be read as ." Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks, "The Mao [text of] the Book of Odes, the Li-ki, and the HS all write" the first character; "the Book of History and the Mencius write" the second character. "It is a corrupt form, and arose from LÃ¼ Shen's [fl. 265330] Tzu-lin. Cf. Chang Ts'an, Wu-ching Wen-tzu [776]." he did not punish those who had committed no crimes; he suppressed the punishment of castration,2.2 2.2 The SC reads instead of , repeating what is said above (5: 1b); cf. Mh II, 492, n. 5. This reading in the SC may be a corruption arising from conflation with this passage of the HS, as Wang Hsien-ch'ien thinks, or it may be an error in transcribing an original . Wang Hsien-ch'ien remarks that the last part of this sentence shows that castration, not mutilation, is the original meaning. Ch. 23 does not say that Emperor Wen specifically abolished castration independently of the other mutilating punishments. But 5: 7a says that the Emperor allowed those who had been sentenced to capital punishment to be castrated instead, so that probably in the time of Emperor Wen castration had really been abolished. and sent 307HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr.

"Since We are not intelligent, [We] are not able to know everything. [It however appears to Us] that these things were all beyond the attainment of previous generations, yet they have been achieved by Emperor Hsiao-wen himself. The depth of his virtue was equal to that of Heaven and Earth; the benefits of his favor were extended to [the borders of] the four seas, [so that] no one failed to receive happiness. His brilliance was like that of the sun and moon, yet the music in the [imperial ancestral] temple is inadequate [to express it]. We are very much awed. Let there be made for the Temple of Emperor Hsiao-wen the Dance of Glorious Virtue,2.4 2.4 HS 22: 14a says, "[Emperor] Hsiao-ching selected from the Dance of Military Virtue to make [the Dance of] Glorious Virtue, in honoring the Temple of the Great Exemplar." in order to make manifest his praiseworthy virtue. Then only the glory and virtue of the founder and exemplar2.5 2.5 The SC at this point adds, "will be written upon bamboo and silk" (the writing materials of the time). Cf. Mh II, 493. will be exhibited for ten thousand generations, for ever and ever without end. We approve most highly of this. Let [the proper officials], with the Lieutenant Chancellor [Shen-t'u Chia], the marquises, [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs,2.6 2.6 Cf. Glossary, sub Salaries. and the officials [set over] the rites, prepare a memorial concerning these rites and observances." [In reply], "the Lieutenant Chancellor, your subject [Shen-t'u] Chia" and others memorialized [the Emperor], saying, "Your Majesty is always thinking of the Way of filial piety and has established the 308HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 157 B.C. Dance of Glorious Virtue in order to make manifest 5:2a the abundant virtue of Emperor Hsiao-wen. The stupidity of us, your subjects, [Shen-t'u] Chia and the others, prevents us from attaining to all [these matters]. Your servants have carefully discussed [this matter], and say:2.7 2.7 Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggests that, since the in the text is inappropriate and the SC and the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien do not have it, it is a mistake for , which is in the SC. We have adopted this emendation in the translation. "In achievements, no one has been greater than 2b Emperor Kao-[tsu]; in virtue, no one has been more abundant than Emperor Hsiao-wenâthe Temple of Emperor Kao-[tsu] should be made the Temple of the Great Founder of Emperors and the Temple of Emperor Hsiao-wen should be made the Temple of the Great Exemplar of Emperors.2.8 2.8 The titles "Great Founder" and "Great Exemplar" became the "temple names" of Emperors Kao-tsu and Hsiao-wen respectively, and are used with their posthumous names in the headings of the chapters devoted to them in the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien and other histories. The Son of Heaven should from generation to generation make offerings in the Temples of the [Great] Founder and of the [Great] Exemplar. The commanderies, the kingdoms, and the nobles should each establish a Temple of the Great Exemplar for Emperor Hsiao-wen; delegates from the vassal kings and the marquises should attend at the sacrifices which the Son of Heaven offers [yearly] in the Temples of the [Great] Founder and of the [Great] Exemplar.2.9 2.9 Wang Hsien-ch'ien points out that the SC has for the HS's , and that Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) explicitly uses the former word in his comment; Yen Shih-ku uses the latter character. We have adopted this emendation. Chang Yen says, "The kings together with the marquises, yearly, at the correct seasons, sent delegates to visit the capital and attend the sacrifices to assist at the sacrifices." Ju Shun (fl. dur. 189-265) says, "It is exactly [the case] as the Temple of [Emperor] Kuang-wu [25-58] is at the Chang Tomb and the Grand Administrator of the Nan-yang [Commandery], being entitled a delegate, went to sacrifice [there]. The marquises and kings are not sent to make the sacrifices, [because] the nobles of the imperial house are not permitted to take as their ancestor the Son of Heaven; [they worshipped their imperial ancestors as subjects, not as descendants]. All [nobles] who attend the sacrifices at the ancestral temples act as attendants [not as sacrificers] at the sacrifices." Yen Shih-ku adds, "Chang [Yen's] explanation is correct. Since it says, `The temple where the son of Heaven makes offerings to the [Great] Founder and the [Great] Exemplar,' it does not speak of the temples in the commanderies and kingdoms." 309HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 5:2b We beg that this be proclaimed and published to the 157 B.C. world." [The Emperor's] decree said, "It may be done." In the spring, the first month, an imperial edict 156 B. C. said, "Recently, for successive years there have not Jan./Feb. been good harvests, so that many people are lacking food; early death is cutting short their natural [span of] years. We are very much pained at this [circumstance]. In some of the commanderies and kingdoms there are stony and narrow [regions] and there is no place for agriculture or sericulture or the feeding and rearing [of domestic animals],2.10 2.10 Wang Nien-sun (1744-1832) says that the T'ung-tien (compiled by Tu Yu, 735812) in its first chapter on "Foods and Goods," quotes this passage, and that before the words there is the word , which is lacking in the present text, and should be supplied. It is parallel with the same word in the next sentence. Yen Shih-ku says, " is an ancient form of ; it means to fatten and rear them; means to put out to grass." [whereas] in other [commanderies and kingdoms] there are fertile and broad regions, abundant in tall grass,2.11 2.11 Ju Shun explains, "Chuang Chou [iv cent. B.C.] says, `What deer eat is called grass (chien ).' It is also said that when the grass is thick it is called chien; when it is long it is called mang [translated, `tall grass']." But Wang Nien-sun replies, "If you interpret chien as grass, then the phrase, `chien, grass, and mang' is repetitious. I say that chien means chÃ¼ [together, dense]. It means that the region is fertile and broad and that in it the grass and tall grass is dense. Chien is used for ch'ien . The Tso-chuan [iv. cent. B.C., Dk.] Hsiang, IV [Legge 42214], says, `The Jung and Ti live in groups (ch'ien),' while the [Kuo]-yÃ¼ [iv or iii cent. B.C., in the chapters on] Chin, says, `The Jung and Ti dwell in groups (ch'ien).' Wei [Chao (197-273/4)] and Tu [YÃ¼ (222-284)] both comment, saying, `Ch'ien is chÃ¼.' HS ch. 84: [20a, says], `He planted it heavily (chien) with thorns,' and Yen Shih-ku comments, `Chien should be read as ch'ien. Ch'ien is heavily, together (chÃ¼).' " Chou Shou-ch'ang (1814-1884) adds, "HS ch. 69: [11b, says], `Now the caitiffs [Huns] have lost their beautiful land and chien grass.' The T'ang History, `Memoir on the Ch'i-pi-ho-li,' [says], `They followed the dense (chien) grass and fine water for their livelihood." This [passage] speaks of the density of the grass and the advantageousness of streams and springs. The ancients changed the word-order in using [passages with] parallel [phrases]." and the streams and wells are advantageous, 310HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 156 B.C. yet the people have not been allowed to migrate [to 5:2b 3a these places]. Let it be discussed that the people who wish to migrate to [such] broad and large regions may be permitted to do so." Apr./May In the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty was granted to the empire and the common people were given one step in noble rank.3.1 3.1 The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 15: 16 dates this amnesty on the day yi-mao, May 18. [The Emperor] sent the Grandee Secretary [T'ao] Ch'ing-ti3.2 3.2 The SC says that the Huns had invaded the region of Tai, hence this treaty. This man's personal name has been the subject of discussion. HS 19 B: 10 says, "The Grandee Secretary T'ao Ch'ing [sic] was made Lieutenant Chancellor." Ibid. 9b says, "T'ao Ch'ing became Grandee Secretary." Shen Ch'in-han writes that the Wen-yÃ¼an Ying-hua (publ. ca. 978), ch. 873 tells that Hsiao Lun's (ca. 508-551) stele to T'ao the Hermit (T'ao Hung-ching, 452-536) says, "The son of T'ao She, [T'ao] Ching-ti [occupied] positions up to that of Lieutenant Chancellor." A Lieutenant Chancellor of Emperor Wu was named Yen (or Chuang) Ch'ing-ti; Yen Shih-ku, Shen Ch'in-han, Ch'ien Ta-hsin, and Ch'i Shao-nan think that the last word of his name may have been added by confusion to that of T'ao Ch'ing. But Yang Shu-ta (1885- ), in his Han-shu Pu-chu Pu-cheng 2: 30, remarks, "Duke Wen of Chin [636-628 B.C.] was named Ch'ung-erh; the Tso-chuan, [Dk.] Ting, IV, in recording the oath at Chien-t'u, however says, `Chung of Chin.' Shou Chen-to of Ts'ao is called `Shou Chen' in the [Kuo]-yÃ¼, [ch. on] Chin; the SC calls him `Shou To.' Duke Yin of Lu [722-712 B.C.] was named Hsi-ku; SC ch. 33 calls him only `Hsi.' Anciently there was the practise of calling [given] names [composed] of two words by one word for short. HS ch. 19 [in mentioning T'ao Ch'ing-ti] has not the word ti, for it copies the text of SC 22: [11b], this text [i.e. HS 5: 3a] therefore completes [the name]. The Superintendent of the Imperial House, Liu Hsi, in SC ch. 120, is called Liu Hsi-chi in the HSâthis is a clear proof that the SC [uses] a shorter name and Pan [Ku] added to it and that the explanations of Ch'i [Shao-nan], Shen [Ch'in-han], and Ch'ien [Ta-hsin] are all incorrect. Cf. my Ku-shu Yi-yi ChÃ¼-lieh Pu." to Tai3.3 3.3 The word hsia is sometimes added to a place-name which is composed of only one word in order to make a binomial. For example, in SCHC 47: 91 and HS 81: 14b, K'ung Fu is said to have died at Ch'en2-hsia; in the K'ung-ts'ung B: 34a, sect. 19, near the end, he is said to have died at Ch'en2. SCHC 11: 3 (Mh II, 497) says under this date, "The Huns entered Tai and [the Emperor] made a treaty of peace and friendship with them," hence it was natural that T'ao Ch'ing-ti should have been sent to Tai. to make peace and friendship with the Huns. 311HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 5:3a In the fifth month [the Emperor] ordered that the 156 B.C. May/June cultivated fields should pay half of their [former] tax.3.4 3.4 Emperor Wen had exempted agriculturists from taxes; cf. 4: 14b. Now that tax was re-established at half its former rate. The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 15: 16b adds that this tax was at the rate of 1/30. In the autumn, the seventh month, an imperial July/Aug. edict said, "When officials receive food or drink from those who are superintended or governed by them, dismissal [from their positions and noble ranks is too] heavy [a punishment]; when they receive valuables and articles [from such persons], or when they purchase [things] cheaply and sell dearly, their sentences have been [too] light. [Let] the Commandant of Justice discuss [this matter] anew with the Lieutenant Chancellor [in order to establish] a statutory ordinance." The Commandant of Justice Hsin carefully discussed [the matter] with the Lieutenant Chancellor [Shen-t'u Chia], and said, "If an official or anyone who has [official] rank has received anything from his official subordinates, whether from those superintended by him, or those under his rule, or those of whom he is [temporarily] in charge, or those whom he commands [as a military leader], let those who have received food or drink and who calculate [its value] and repay this expense not be tried [for crime; those who receive] other things, [not food or drink, and officials who] have purposely bought things cheap and purposely sold them dear must all be sentenced for having received bribes, and treated as robbers; 3b their bribes shall be confiscated and paid to the governement.3.5 3.5 Szu-ma Cheng (fl. 713-742) in a note to SCHC 57: 23 says, "The hsien-kuan is the Son of Heaven. The reason that the state is called the hsien-kuan is that in [the Chou-li, sub] the Ministers of Summer, [it says,] `The inner prefecture (hsien) of the imperial central domain is the capital of the state.' The king controls (kuan) the world. Hence he is called the hsien-kuan [i.e. controller of the capital prefecture]." The Chou-li does not seem to contain this statement; the two words referring to that book may be an interpolation. If officials have been removed, exiled, 312HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. I 156 B.C. dismissed, or their offices discontinued, and receive 5:3b from their former official subordinates who have been under their [military] command or under their superintendency or control, the gift of any valuables or things sent them, their noble ranks shall be taken away from them and they shall be made common soldiers, [but] shall be relieved of [any further punishment].3.6 3.6 Li Ch'i explains, "Those who had noble ranks were to have [their ranks] taken from them and to be made common soldiers; those who had official positions were to be dismissed from their positions." But Shen Ch'in-han replies that the case of those who have already left their positions is different from those who are in official positions, since in the former case they could not compel their subordinates to pay bribes; hence in such cases they were to be punished by merely having their noble titles taken away from them and were excused from further trial. He adds that the Han practise was, at the first crime, to dismiss a person from official position, and, when he was tried a second time, to take away his noble rank. If they have no noble rank, they shall be fined [the equivalent of] two catties of gold and it shall be ordered that [the amount] they have received shall be confiscated and paid [into the treasury]. Anyone who is able to arrest or inform [of bribery] shall be given [the amount of] the bribe which is received [by the accused]." II In the second year, in the winter, the twelfth 155 B. C. month, a comet appeared in the southwest.3.7 3.7 This is comet no. 18 in John Williams, Chinese Observations of Comets, London, 1871. His date is incorrect; this month was Jan. 18-Feb. 15, 155 B.C. The Han-chi 9: 1b erroneously dates this comet in the eleventh month; the Tzu-chih T'ung-chien reads as the present text does. [The Jan./Feb. Emperor] ordered that young men of the empire should be first enregistered [for military service and taxes] in their twentieth year.3.8 3.8 Yen Shih-ku explains "[According to] the old law, in their twenty-third [year they were enregistered (cf. p. 80, n. 2)]; now this [edict sets the age at] twenty, a change to a different [dynasty's] code." But Shen Ch'in-han replies, "Originally those who were in their fifteenth year and over had to pay the poll-tax (suan) in cash [cf. p. 93, n. 1]; now [the Emperor] liberalized it, making it the twentieth year." Apr./May In the spring, the third month,3.9 3.9 HS 14: 14a, 15a dates these appointments on the day chia-yin, May 12. [the Emperor] established his Imperial Sons: [Liu] TÃª as King of 313HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. II 5:3b Ho-chien, [Liu] O as King of Lin-chiang, [Liu] YÃ¼2 155 B.C. as King of Huai-yang, [Liu] Fei1 as King of Ju-nan, [Liu] P'eng-tsu as King of Kuang-ch'uan, and [Liu] Fa as King of Ch'ang-sha. In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] June 9 jen-wu, the Grand Empress Dowager [nÃ©e Po] died. In the sixth month the Lieutenant Chancellor, July/Aug. [Shen-t'u] Chia, died. [The Emperor] enfeoffed [Hsiao] Hsi, a grandson of the former Chancellor of State, Hsiao Ho, as a marquis. In the autumn, [the Emperor] made peace and 4a friendship with the Huns. Autumn In the third year, in the winter, the twelfth month, III an imperial edict said, "[Chi] K'uei-yÃ¼eh, a son of 154 B. C. the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, [Chi T'ung]-chia,4.1 4.1 According to 16: 43b, the Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing was Chi T'ung. Here he is called [Chi] Chia. We have understood this as merely another case of a double given name for one person; cf. n. 3.2. has Jan./Feb. been unfilial and has conspired to revolt, intending thereby to kill [his father, Chi T'ung]-chia, which is treason and inhumanity. Let [Chi T'ung]-chia be pardoned and be [again] made Marquis of Hsiang-p'ing, and, together with his wife and children, who should be condemned with him, let him be restored to his former noble rank; let [Chi] K'uei-yÃ¼eh, together with his wife and children, be sentenced according to the law."4.2 4.2 Ju Shun says, "According to the Code, when there is a case of `treason and inhumanity,' the father, mother, wife, children, and brothers and sisters should all be publicly executed." Evidently Emperor Wen's abrogation of extending punishment to the relatives of a criminal (4: 5b) did not extend to treason and inhumanity. In the spring, the first month, there was a visitation Feb./Mar. [of fire] in the Main Hall at the Palace of the King of Huai-yang [Liu YÃ¼2], and the King of Wu, [Liu] P'i, the King of Chiao-hsi, [Liu] Ang, the King of Ch'u, [Liu] Mou, the King of Chao, [Liu] Sui, the King of Chi-nan, [Liu] Pi-kuang, the King 314HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. III 154 B.C. of Tzu-ch'uan, [Liu] Hsien, and the King of Chiao- 5:4a tung, [Liu] Hsiung-ch'Ã¼, all mobilized their troops and rebelled. [The Emperor] granted a general amnesty to the empire and sent the Grand Commandant, [Chou] Ya-fu, and the General-in-chief, Tou Ying, with troops, to attack them. [The Emperor] had the Grandee Secretary, Ch'ao Ts'o, beheaded in order to excuse himself to the Seven Kingdoms. In Apr. 4 the second month, on [the day] jen-tzu, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun.4.3 4.3 This dating is incorrect. For a discussion of the eclipses in this chapter, cf. App. II. The generals routed the Seven Kingdoms, cut off more than a hundred thousand heads, pursued and beheaded the King of Wu, [Liu] P'i, at Tan-t'u. 4b The King of Chiao-hsi, [Liu] Ang, the King of Ch'u, [Liu] Mou, the King of Chao, [Liu] Sui, the King of Chi-nan, [Liu] Pi-kuang, the King of Tzu-ch'uan, [Liu] Hsien, and the King of Chiao-tung, [Liu] Hsiung-ch'Ã¼, all committed suicide.4.4 4.4 For an account of this rebellion, cf. Introduction. July In the summer, the sixth month, an imperial edict said, "Recently the King of Wu, [Liu] P'i, and others, rebelled and raised their troops to coerce [Us], leading astray their officials and people. Their officials and people could not do otherwise [than follow them]. Now that [Liu] P'i and the others have already been exterminated, let the officials and people who should be sentenced [for being accomplices of Liu] P'i and the others, together with those who have absconded and fled or deserted the army, all be pardoned. [With regard to Liu] Yi4, the son of King YÃ¼an of Ch'u, [Liu Chiao], and others, who rebelled with [Liu] P'i and the others, We cannot bear to apply the law [to them]. Let [their names] be expunged from the register [of the imperial house] and do not let them defile the imperial house. We establish the Marquis of P'ing-lu, Liu Li, as King of 315HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. III 5:4b Ch'u, to continue the posterity of King YÃ¼an." 154 B.C. [The Emperor also] established his Imperial Sons, [Liu] Tuan as King of Chiao-hsi and [Liu] Sheng as King of Chung-shan, and granted to the common people one step in noble rank. In the fourth year, in the spring, [the Emperor] IV reestablished the various [customs] barriers [and 153 B. C. ordered] the use of passports for going out and in.4.5 4.5 In 169 B.C. these barriers had been abolished. Cf. 4: 14a. The SC dates the present order in the intercalary ninth month (Oct./Nov., 153) and says, "He re-established the fords and [customs] barriers." Cf. Mh II, 500. Ying Shao says that this reestablishment was "because the Seven Kingdoms had just rebelled and to be prepared for any untoward circumstance." Spring In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] May 16 chi-szu, [the Emperor] established his Imperial Sons, [Liu] Jung as Imperial heir-apparent, and [Liu] Ch'Ãª as King of Chiao-tung, and in the sixth month June/July an amnesty was granted to the world and the common people were granted a step in noble rank. In the autumn, the seventh month, the King of July/Aug. Lin-chiang, [Liu] O, died, and in tenth month, on [the day] mou-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. 152 B. C. In the fifth year, in the spring, the first month, 5a [the Emperor] built the Yang Tomb and the town V [of Yang-ling]. In the summer, [the Emperor] solicited Feb./Mar. common people to move to Yang-ling, granting Summer them two hundred thousand cash. He sent a Princess to be married to the Shan-yÃ¼ of the Huns. In the sixth year, in the winter, the twelfth month, VI there was thunder and prolonged rain. Jan. In the autumn, the ninth month, the Empress Sept./Oct. nÃ©e Po was dismissed.5.1 5.1 She had no children, had lost the favor of Emperor Ching, and her protectress, the Grand Empress Dowager nÃ©e Po, had died. In the seventh year, in the winter, the eleventh VII month, on [the day] keng-yin, the last day of the 150 B. C. 316HSIAO-CHING, Ch'ien, Yr. VII 150 B.C. Jan. 22 month, there was an eclipse of the sun, and in the 5:5a Feb./Mar. spring, the first month, [the Emperor] dismissed the Imperial Heir-apparent [Liu] Jung and made him King of Lin-chiang.5.2 5.2 SC ch. 11 (Mh II, 501) dates this dismissal in the winter of 151/150 B.C. HS 14: 17a dates his appointment as king "in the eleventh month, on [the day] chi-yu," which day was only possible in the tenth and twelfth months of that year. SC 17: 21b dates the dismissal and appointment both "in the eleventh month, on [the day] yi-ch'ou," which was Dec. 28, 151. The Tzu-chih T'ung-chien 16: 12b follows HS 14: 17a. The Han-chi 9: 12b follows HS 5: 5a. Mar./Apr. In the second month, [the Emperor] abolished the office of the Grand Commandant.5.3 5.3 The Grand Commandant, Chou Ya-fu, was made Lieutenant Chancellor on Apr. 7, according to Mh II, 501, and, according to HS 19 B: 11a, after Aug. 5. June 6 In the summer, the fourth month, on [the day] yi-sz?, [the Emperor] established the Empress nÃ©e June 18 Wang [as Empress]. On [the day] ting-sz?, [the Emperor] established the King of Chiao-tung, [Liu] Ch'Ãª, as Imperial Heir-apparent, and granted to those common people who would be the successors of their fathers one step in noble rank.5.4 5.4 For the intrigues leading to this change of heirs, cf. Glossary sub Wang, Empress nÃ©e; Mh II, 501, n. 5. I In the middle [part of the reign],5.5 5.5 The name for this year is usually written today as if there had been a year-period by the name of Chung-yÃ¼an . There is also tacitly assumed to have been a year-period Hou-yÃ¼an . Both the SC and the HS however only write the first of these two pairs of characters. In the SC, the Chinese for the various years is , etc. In the HS, only the first year of the part of the reign is preceded by ; in that year the word yÃ¼an is plainly intended to indicate the "first" year of that part of the reign. In the "Tables," the Chinese dates for the latter two parts of this reign are always written , etc. Cf. 14: 17b, 19a; 15 A: 8a; 16: 7b, 8a, 9a, 14a, b; 17: 1b, 4a, 6a; 18: 7b. There is an exception: 16: 13b has , but Chu Yi-hsin (1846-1894) says that the Wang ed. (1546) is correct in reading only one yÃ¼an, for the second yÃ¼an is dittography. Wang Hsien-ch'ien, in a note to 5: 8b, also uses the single character to indicate this part of the reign, but Shen Ch'in-han, in a note to 5: 8a, uses two characters, making it the name of a year-period. Emperor Ching was merely imitating the practise of his father, Emperor Wen, in beginning anew the numbering of the years in his reign. Reign-periods were not introduced until 114 or 113 B.C., in the reign of Emperor Wu. Cf. p. 260, n. 1; ch. 6, App. I. the first year, 317HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. I 5:5a in the summer, the fourth month, an amnesty was 149 B.C. 149 B. C. granted to the world and the common people were May/June granted one step in noble rank. [The Emperor] enfeoffed the grandson and son of the former Grandee Secretaries Chou Ho and Chou Ch'ang as marquises.5.6 5.6 The words for "grandson and son" seem to be a mistake on the part of Pan Ku in which he follows the text of SC ch. 11. HS 16: 45a tells that the Marquis of Kaoching, Chou Ch'eng, was enfeoffed because of his father, Chou Ho, and that in 159 B.C. his marquisate was abolished, but that in 149 B.C. (the present year) Chou Ch'eng's grandson, Chou Ying, was enfeoffed as Marquis of Sheng. SC 18: 45a (Mh III, 130, no. 25) says the same. Then Chou Ying was Chou Ho's great-grandson. HS 16: 15b, 16a tells that Marquis Tao of Fen-yin, Chou Ch'ang, transmitted his marquisate to his son and grandson. The latter was punished and the marquisate abolished, but in "the second year of the middle [part of the reign] of [Emperor] Hsiao-ching, [Ch'ien Ta-chao remarks that it should be the "first year"], [Chou] Tso-ch'Ãª succeeded to enfeoffment because he was a grandson of [Chou] Ch'ang" and became Marquis of An-yang. SC 18: 12a says the same. HS 42: 4a also says that Chou Tso-ch'Ãª was Chou Ch'ang's grandson. Then these two new marquises were the great-grandson and grandson of these Grandee Secretaries. SC ch. 11 (Mh II, 502) says, "[The Emperor] appointed [Chou] P'ing [who was the son of Chou Ying, according to SC 18: 45a and HS 16: 45a], the grandson of the former Grandee Secretary Chou Ho, as Marquis of Sheng and [Chou] Tso-chÃ¼n [chÃ¼n instead of the ch'Ãª in HS 16: 15b], the son of the former Grandee Secretary Chou Ch'ang, as Marquis of An-yang." The HS seems here to have clearly been abstracting from the corresponding passage in the SC. In the second year, in the spring, the second 5b month, [the Emperor] ordered that when vassal II kings die, and when marquises are first enfeoffed and 148 B. C. go to their states, the Grand Herald should memorialize Mar. [the Emperor] concerning [respectively] their posthumous names and eulogies and their charters [of appointment]. When marquises die and when the nobles' Grand Tutors are first appointed and go to their offices, the Grand Messenger shall memorialize [the throne concerning respectively] their posthumous 318HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. II 148 B.C. names and eulogies and their charters [of 5:5b 6a appointment].5.7 5.7 Ying Shao writes, "When the Emperor entertains the vassal kings or treats kings and nobles as his guests, they are all under the charge of the Grand Herald. Hence, when they die, he memorializes their deeds and grants them posthumous names, together with funeral eulogies." Ch'ien Ta-hsin adds, "The posthumous name and eulogy are used for the dead; charters are used by those who are newly enfeoffed and go to their states." Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) says, "Emperor Ching in this year had already established a Grand Herald, yet HS 19 [A: 13b] says, `In 104 B.C. Emperor Wu changed [the title of the Chief Grand Messenger] to be the Grand Herald,' which is, according to this passage, incorrect." The use of the title, Grand Herald, here may however be an anachronism. Yen Shih-ku says, "The Grand Herald was originally named the Director of Guests; later [his title] was changed to be Grand Herald. The Chief Grand Messenger was originally named the Messenger, which was a subordinate office to the Director of Guests. [His title] was later changed to be Chief Grand Messenger. Hence, in honorable and important matters, [the Emperor] sent the Grand Herald, and in less honorable or important ones, [the Emperor] sent the Grand Messenger. According to the text of this `Annals,' Emperor Ching had already changed [the title of] the Director of Guests to be Grand Herald, and changed the Messenger to be the Grand Messenger. Yet HS 19 [A: 13b] says, `In 144 B.C. Emperor Ching changed the title [of the Director of Guests] to be Chief Grand Messenger. In 104 B.C. Emperor Wu changed the title [of the Chief Grand Messenger] to be Grand Herald . . . and changed the title of the Messenger to be the Chief Grand Messenger.' According to the text [of ch. 5], ch. 19 is mistaken." According to HS 53: 2b, when King Hsien of Ho-chien, Liu TÃª, died in 130 B.C., the Chief Grand Messenger memorialized his posthumous name. The passage regarding posthumous names, etc., is not in SC ch. 11; Pan Ku probably found the law regarding the memorializing of posthumous names, eulogies, and charters in the form it assumed after the titles of the participating officials had been changed, and inserted it in the "Annals" at the time when it was originally enacted, so that the titles of the officials are merely anachronisms. The title in this passage, Imperial Household Grandee, is also an anachronism, for according to HS 19 A: 9a that title was not established until 104 B.C. Ying Shao misunderstood the meaning of ts'Ãª in this passage. Here it is the term for the charter given an official upon his appointment. Ch'ien Ta-hsin (1720-1804) corrects him, saying, "When marquises are first enfeoffed and go to their states, the Grand Herald has charge of memorializing their charter. Ying [Shao] considered that the ts'Ãª was a `funeral eulogy,' which is a mistake." Such charters are to be found in HS 99 A: 6b, 21a, etc. Another is translated in Appendix I. When kings die, an Imperial Household Grandee shall be sent to condole, provide grave-clothes, sacrifical food, funeral horses and carriages, oversee the mourning ceremonies and on 319HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. II 5:6a the same occasion enthrone the son who succeeds 148 B.C. to [the kingdom]. When marquises die, a Grand Palace Grandee6.1 6.1 Wang Hsien-ch'ien's text writes ; the Official ed. (1739) writes , so does HS 19 A: 8b, 9a. shall be sent to condole, offer sacrifical food, oversee the mourning ceremonies, and on the same occasion enfeoff the heir. When they6.2 6.2 The text at this point has the word , which is superfluous and interrupts the meaning. It seems to have crept in through dittography from the preceding three instances of that word. It is not in Han-chi 9: 3a. Following Wang Nien-sun, we have omitted it. are buried, their states shall be allowed to mobilize not more than three hundred common people for the whole matter of pulling the hearse and mourning, digging and replacing the earth, and building the tomb. The Huns entered into [the kingdom of] Yen.6.3 6.3 SC ch. 11 (Mh II, 503) adds at this point, "Thereafter there ceased to be peace and friendship [between the Chinese and the Huns]." [The punishment of execution and] quartering [the body] was changed to that of public execution, so that no one was any more to be quartered.6.4 6.4 This is one of the classic texts dealing with these two punishments. Ying Shao says, "Before this time those who were punished with death were all chÃª in the marketplace . Now it was changed and called public execution . From [this time], except for monstrous [crimes] and rebellion, they did not again chÃª anyone." Chavannes Mh I, cxi, n. 2), Couvreur, (Dict. Classique) and the Tz'u-yÃ¼an say that chÃª means "to quarter" (the latter writes ). In support of this interpretation is the use of the word chÃª in the Book of Rites for the cutting up of victims offered in some sacrifices (cf. Couvreur, Li-Ki, I, 352, 406). The existence of a punishment which consisted in quartering is established by the use of those words in HS 100 A: 9a. But Yen Shih-ku writes, "ChÃª means exposing his corpse ; public execution is to kill him in the market-place . It means that when someone is to be publicly executed, there is employed [the principle stated in the Li-ki III, ii, 11 (Legge I, 215; Couvreur I, 274)], `A person should be executed in the market-place, [thus] being done away with (hsi) with the participation of the crowd.' " The K'ang-hsi Dictionary gives both meanings for chÃª: "." Perhaps Yen Shih-ku was attempting to make an ancient practise appear more humane than it really was. In the third month, the King of Lin-chiang, [Liu] Apr. 320HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. II 148 B.C. Jung, was found guilty of encroaching upon the land 5:6a of the Temple of the Great Exemplar. He was summoned [to the capital], went to [the quarters of] the Palace Military Commander, and committed suicide. Apr./May In the summer, the fourth month, a comet appeared in the northwest. [The Emperor] established his Imperial Sons, [Liu] YÃ¼eh as King of Kuang-ch'uan and [Liu] Chi as King of Chiao-tung. July/Aug. In the autumn, the seventh month, [the Emperor] changed [the titles of] Commandery Administrators to be Grand Administrators, and Commandery Commandants to be Chief Commandants. Sept./Oct. In the ninth month, [the Emperor] enfeoffed the sons of four persons who had been the former [Grand] Tutor, Chancellors, and Prefect of the Capital at [the kingdoms of] Ch'u and Chao, who had previously 6b died [because of] what they had done, and made [these sons] marquises.6.5 6.5 Wen Ying (fl. ca. 196-220) says, "The Chancellor of Ch'u, Chang Shang, the Grand Tutor [of Ch'u], Chao Yi-wu, the Chancellor of Chao, Chien-tÃª, and the Prefect of the Capital [at Chao], Wang Hanâthese were the four persons. Each had admonished his king not to bring about a revolt, [but their kings] would not heed and killed all of them. Hence their sons were appointed." HS 17: 3a, b, 4a and SC 19: 21b, 22a, b (from which the above information was taken) note these four persons as all appointed in the fourth month, on the day yi-szu, May 26, 148 B.C. SC ch. 11 (Mh II, 503) dates these appointments "in the summer," putting the words for "in the ninth month" after this notice. On [the day] chia-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. III In the third year, in the winter, the eleventh Dec./Jan. month, the offices of Grandee Secretaries were abolished 147 B. C. in [the courts of] the nobles. Feb./Mar. In the spring, the first month, the dismissed Empress [nÃ©e Po] died.6.6 6.6 There is some mistake in the text. At present it reads, "The Empress Dowager died." But the Empress Dowager nÃ©e Tou did not die until 135 B.C. This notice of a death is not in the SC or the Han-chi. Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) quotes Wang Mou (fl. before 265) as saying, "The Empress [nÃ©e] Po of Emperor Ching died in this year; I suspect that it was she. It should say the `dismissed Empress,' " i.e., read instead of . Wang Mou may be taking as his authority HS 97 A: 8b, which says that this Empress died the fourth year after she was dismissed. The latter date was 151 B.C. (5: 5a); then she died in 147 B.C. We have followed Wang Mou's emendation in the translation. There are however very serious objections. Yen Shih-ku points out that the death of a dismissed empress is not recorded and that the particular word here used for "died" would never be used of a dismissed Empress. Cf. p. 260, n. 3. Ch'ien Ta-chao concludes that the whole sentence is an interpolation. 321HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. III 5:6b In the summer there was a drought,6.7 6.7 HS 27 Ba: 24a calls it a "great drought" and dates it in the autumn. and the 147 B.C. Summer sale of wine was prohibited. In the autumn, the Oct./Nov. ninth month, there were locusts,6.8 6.8 These locusts are also mentioned in HS 27 Bb: 20a. and there was a comet in the northwest.6.9 6.9 This is no. 24 in Williams, Observations of Comets. On [the day] mou-hsÃ¼, Nov. 10 the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. [The Emperor] established his Imperial Son [Liu Fang]-sheng as King of Ch'ing-ho.6.10 6.10 HS 14: 18b dates this appointment in the third month, on the day ting-yu, May 13, 147 B.C. In the fourth year, in the spring, the third month, IV the TÃª-yang Residence was built.6.11 6.11 This was to be Emperor Ching's funerary temple. Ch'ien Ta-chao notes that the Fukien ed. (1549) mistakenly has interchanged the words in this temple's name. 146 B. C. The Grandee Secretary [Wei] Wan memorialized Apr./May [the throne] that horses five feet and nine inches and more in height whose teeth were not yet smooth should not be allowed to go out through the [customs] barriers.6.12 6.12 This height is about 52 in. Eng. meas. Fu Ch'ien explains, "When horses are in their tenth year, the surfaces of their teeth become smooth." The SC (Mh III, 544) says that in the time of Emperor Ching, additional horse pastures were established in order to increase the public resources. In the summer, there were locusts. 7a In the autumn, an amnesty was granted to the Autumn convicts who had built the Yang Tomb. Those who had committed capital crimes and wished to be castrated 322HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. IV 145 B.C. [instead of being executed] were permitted [to 5:7a be thus punished].7.1 7.1 Ju Shun explains that castration was called , i.e., rottenness, because it was being like a rotten tree, which could not bring forth any fruit. HS 97 A: 21b tells that when HsÃ¼ Kuang-han had committed a capital crime, an edict of Emperor Wu invited him to enter the silkworm room of the palace, (i.e., to be castrated instead of executed). In the San-kuo Chih (by Ch'en Shou, 233-297) Chung Yu (a Grand Tutor and a famous calligraphist) says to Emperor Ming (58-75), "It is proper that, like the ordinance of [Emperor] Hsiao-ching, whoever should be publicly executed and wishes [instead] to cut off his right toes should be permitted to do so." Chou Shou-ch'ang remarks that castration accordingly does not seem to have been the only way of commuting the death penalty. 145 B. C. In the tenth month, on [the day] mou-wu, there Mar. 26 was an eclipse of the sun. V In the fifth year, in the summer, [the Emperor] Summer established his Imperial Son [Liu] Shun as King of June/July Ch'ang-shan.7.2 7.2 HS 14: 19a dates this appointment in the third month, on the day ting-szu, an impossible month and day, according to Hoang, Concordance. In the sixth month an amnesty was granted to the world and the common people were granted one step in noble rank. Sept. 11 In the autumn, the eighth month, on [the day] chi-yu, there was a visitation [of fire] at the Eastern Portal of the Wei-yang Palace.7.3 7.3 HS 27 A: 11a blames this fire on the dismissal and suicide of the first heir-apparent, Liu Jung, and the dismissal of Chou Ya-fu. Cf. Glossary, sub vocibus. The titles of the nobles' Lieutenant Chancellors were changed to that of Chancellors.7.4 7.4 The purpose of this change, as of that abolishing Grandee Secretaries in kingly courts, was to exalt the imperial court and to distinguish imperial from kingly titles. Oct./Nov. In the ninth month, an imperial edict said, "The laws and ordinances, the measures and weights are for the purpose of preventing violence and of stopping wrongdoing. Criminal tribunals are the great [determiners] of peoples' fate, [for] the dead cannot come to life again. Some of the officials do not uphold the laws and ordinances: they make a business of presents and bribes; they form parties and cliques and practise favoritism; they consider merciless inquisition as penetration and exacting 323HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. V 5:7a cruelty as perspicacity, so that they cause the inno- 145 B.C. cent to lose their positions (We pity them greatly), 7b and the guilty do not suffer for their crimes. They violate the laws and act tyrranously. It is utterly unspeakable. Whenever a judicial case is doubtful, although [the decision] may have been made out as if it fits the law, if yet it does not satisfy peoples' minds, [the case] shall be specially referred to a superior."7.5 7.5 Chou Shou-ch'ang says, "The T'ung-tien, ch. 4 on Punishments, "Miscellaneous Discussions," pt. A, says, `The Chief Justice sent to the Emperor a prisoner, Fang Nien. His step-mother, [Fang] Ch'en, had murdered Fang Nien's father. Fang Nien therefore killed [Fang] Ch'en. According to the Code, a matricide should be sentenced as having committed treason. The Emperor doubted [the justice of such a sentence]. " `The [future] Emperor Wu was at this time in his twelfth year and was Heir-apparent. He was by [the Emperor's] side. The Emperor thereupon asked him [about the case]. The Heir-apparent replied, saying, "Now a step-mother is like a mother, [but] it is plain that she is not equal to a mother. Because of his father, she is similar to a mother. Now this step-mother acted wrongly. With her own hand she murdered his father; then from the day that she put forth her hand [against his father], his indebtedness to her as a mother was already ended. He should be sentenced as a person who has killed another, and should not be sentenced as one who has committed treason." [The Emperor] followed his [judgment].' From this [account we see that] this affair happened in precisely the year [of the edict in the text]." In the sixth year, in the winter, the tenth month, VI [the Emperor] travelled and favored Yung [with a Nov./Dec. visit, where he] performed the suburban sacrifice at the altars to the Five [Lords on High].7.6 7.6 SC 11: 5a (Mh II, 505) says that this visit was in the second month, on the day chi-mao, Apr. 9, 144 B.C. In the twelfth month, he changed the names of the 144 B. C. officials7.7 7.7 For details, cf. Mh II, 506; HS ch. 19 passim. and established the statute [fixing] public Jan./Feb. execution for coining cash or [making alchemistic] counterfeit gold.7.8 7.8 Ying Shao writes, "Emperor Wen, in his fifth year (175 B.C., cf. 4: 12b), allowed people to coin [cash], a law that had not yet been abrogated. At earlier times there had been made much [alchemistic] counterfeit gold. [But] counterfeit gold cannot really be made, and vainly [causes] loss and expense, so that it turns to mutual boasting about one's brilliancy. When [these alchemists become] poor, then they rise up and become brigands and robbers, hence [the Emperor] established this law." Meng K'ang (ca. 180-260) quites a popular "saying, `If gold could be made, the world could be measured.' " This edict of 144 B.C., together with these comments of the second and third century of our era establish the existence of alchemy in China at this early date. Cash had been largely coined in the kingdom of Wu, under its King, Liu P'i. Now that he had rebelled and had been executed, private coinage was forbidden. 324HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. VI 144 B.C. Apr./May In the spring, the third month, snow fell,7.9 7.9 HS 27 Bb: 13a says that this snow prognosticated a Hun raid and the death of Chou Ya-fu. and 5:7b May/June in the summer, the fourth month, the King of Liang, [Liu Wu3], died.7.10 7.10 Ch'ien Ta-chao says that the omission of the King's personal name must probably have been due to a copyist's error. [The Emperor] divided Liang into five kingdoms and established all the five sons of King Hsiao [Liu Wu3] as kings. June/July In the fifth month an imperial edict said, "Now the officials are the teachers of the people. It is proper for their carriages and quadrigae, their clothes and robes to be proportionate [to their station]. Officials [ranking at] six hundred piculs and above 8a are all important officials.8.1 8.1 Chang Yen (prob. iii cent.) comments, "The position of six hundred piculs was that of Grandees." This may be the only place where is used in the sense of "important officials." Elsewhere it is the title of certain subordinate officials. Persons negligent of the rules sometimes do not [wear] their official robes, so that when they go in and out of the villages they [appear] no different from the common people. [We] order that on the carriages of important officials [who are ranked at] two thousand piculs, both side-screens should be made vermillion;8.2 8.2 Ying Shao explains, "They are the ears of a carriage which open out. They are the means whereby one protects (fan) and covers himself against dust and mud. [Officials ranking at] two thousand piculs make the pair of them vermillion; those of lower rank do it for the left side only. They are made of bamboo matting, or leather is used." Ju Shun says, "Fan is pronounced as ; they are the two screens of a small carriage." Yen Shih-ku adds, "According to the explanation of HsÃ¼ Shen [fl. 100] and Li Teng [fl. dur. 220-265], fan is the covering of a carriage. . . . They were screens to cover the carriage. To say that they `are the ears of a carriage which open out' is mistaken." Wang Hsien-ch'ien notes that the Supplement to the Official ed. (1739) says, " is erroneously written . Following Sung [Ch'i's] ed. [ca. xii cent.], it is emended." HHS, Tr. 29: 10b (by Szu-ma Piao, ca. 240-304) says, "In 145 B.C. there first was an edict granting permission to [officials ranked at] six hundred piculs and above to use bronze for the five ends of their carriage screens and on their yokes to have chi-yang pipes." and on those 325HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. VI 5:8a [of officials whose positions are ranked from] one 144 B.C. thousand to six hundred piculs the left screen should be made vermillion. If their carriages or the horsemen in their retinue are not proportionate to the office [of their master], or if the robes of petty officials, when they go out and in the hamlets, are not according to their official dignity, [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs should report what are the offices to which [such officials] belong; [in the capital districts] the Three Adjuncts8.3 8.3 "Three Adjuncts" (q.v. in Glossary) is probably anachronistic here; this title was not used until 104 B.C. According to HS 19 A: 20b, until 155 B.C. there was only a Prefect of the Capital; in that year Western and Eastern Prefects of the Capital were appointed. Ch'Ã¼an Tsu-wang (1705-1755) thinks that perhaps the Western and Eastern Prefects of the Capital, together with the Military Commander at the Capital, governed the capital city, and had covertly divided it into the "Three Adjuncts" (which title denotes also the three districts governed by those three officials). Wang Hsien-ch'ien suggests, "The use of the title, `Three Adjuncts,' is perhaps an anachronistic change by a historian. In this book this sort of thing is quite frequent." should report any who do not act in accordance with the laws and ordinances [on this point]. All shall be reported to the Lieutenant Chancellor or [Grandee] Secretary, who shall beg [the throne to order them punished]." Previous to this time most of the officials [had owed their appointments to] their military achievement, so they had paid scant attention to their carriages and robes, hence [the Emperor] made this 8b prohibition. He moreover reflected that cruel officials, using the sanction of the law, might depart from equity, hence he issued an imperial edict [ordering] that the high officials should [propose] a law lightening [the punishment] of beating, and an ordinance fixing [the size of] the stick. A discussion is in the "Treatise on Punishments and Laws." 23:14b-15a In the sixth month, the Huns entered into the July/Aug. Yen-men [Commandery] to Wu-ch'Ã¼an, and entered into the Shang Commandery, where they took the horses of the imperial pastures.8.4 8.4 Ju Shun comments, "The comment in the Han-[chiu]-yi [written by Wei Hung, fl. dur. 25-57, says], `The various pastures [under the care of] the herdsmen of the Chief of the Stud [number] thirty-six. They are divided and spread over the northern and western borders. Gentlemen are used as Superintendants of the Pastures; thirty thousand male and female slaves care for three hundred thousand horses.' " Yen Shih-ku adds, "Places for rearing birds and beasts are comprehensively named pastures . Hence it says that a place for herding horses is a pasture." Two thousand 326HSIAO-CHING, Chung, Yr. VI 144 B.C. officers and soldiers died in battle, and in the autumn, 5:8b Sept. 8 the seventh month, on [the day] hsin-hai, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun. I In the last [part of the Emperor's reign], the first 143 B. C. year, in the spring, the first month, an imperial edict Feb./Mar. said, "A trial at law is an important matter. [Some] people are wise and [some are] stupid; [some] offices are superior and [some] inferior. When, in a trial it is doubtful [what to decide, the case] should be referred to the high officials; what the high officials cannot settle should be transferred to the Commandant of Justice. If it is ordered that a matter should be referred [to a superior judge], and later [it is found that] it should not have been referred, [that reference] does not constitute a fault. [We] desire to bring it about that those who judge lawsuits should above all take care to be lenient." Apr. In the third month, an amnesty was granted to the empire, the common people were granted one step in noble rank, and [officials ranking at] fully two thousand piculs and Chancellors of the nobles [were granted] the noble rank of Senior Chiefs of the Summer Multitude. In the summer, universal drinking [was allowed] for five days and the people were permitted to buy and sell wine.8.5 8.5 Buying and selling wine had been forbidden since 147 B.C. Cf. 5: 6b. June In the fifth month there was an earthquake. In Aug. 28 the autumn, the seventh month, on [the day] yi-sz?, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun, and the Marquis of T'iao, Chou Ya-fu, was sent to prison, where he died.8.6 8.6 Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) argues that this date is mistaken and that Chou Ya-fu died in 147 B.C., which is the date given in the SC (Mh II, 504). According to HS 19 B: 12a, he was dismissed from his position as Lieutenant Chancellor in 147 B.C., and 40: 28a tells that soon afterwards he was insulted by the Emperor. When his son had purchased arms for use in his funeral, Chou Ya-fu was arrested and committed suicide by starvation. HS 16: 13a notes that he was made a marquis in 162 B.C., (Chu Yi-hsin says that the Wang ed. (1546) is correct in reading 161 B.C.) and was dismissed from his title of marquis in the eighteenth year after, which would be 145, 144 or 143 B.C. HS 40: 28b moreover says that the same year that he died, Emperor Ching enfeoffed his son as Marquis of P'ing-ch'Ã¼; HS 16: 13b dates that appointment in 143 B.C., so that the date of his death in 5: 8b is corroborated. 327HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. II 5:9a In the second year, in the winter, the tenth month, 141 B.C. 9a [the Emperor] dispensed with the marquises going II to their states.9.1 9.1 In 179 B.C. (cf. 4: 8b), Emperor Wen ordered the marquises to go to their states, which order is now dispensed with. Chavannes (Mh II, 508) translates quite differently, "on examine si les seigneurs avaient Ã©tÃ© envoyÃ©s dans leurs Ã©tats." The nobles had however evaded Emperor Wen's order that they should go to their estates (cf. p. 246). Emperors regularily enfeoffed the relatives of their mothers and favorite concubines; we do not hear of any such nobles thereupon disappearing from the capital; on the contrary they continued to figure in intrigues even when they did not hold office. According to 8: 9a, in 67 B.C. the Emperor "granted to each of the eighty-seven marquises who were at their estates twenty catties of actual gold." But, according to the "Tables," there were at that time more than two hundred marquises, so that the vast majority of the marquises were in the capital. Marquises were moreover sometimes sent to their estates as a punishment, cf. HS 45: 18a, also Glossary, sub Marquis. The original term for marquis , which is here used in the text, was tabooed because the word ch'Ãª was the personal name of Emperor Wu. Chou Shou-ch'ang says that this reading is a copyist's chance error. Oct./Nov. In the spring the Huns entered into the Yen-men 142 B. C. [Commandery] and its Grand Administrator, Feng Spring Ching, died in battle with them. Chariots, cavalry, and skilled soldiers were sent to garrison [the Yen-men Commandery]. In the spring,9.2 9.2 Wang Hsien-ch'ien points out that "the spring" has been previously mentioned and that this word is here an interpolation. The SC dates the invasion of the Huns in the third month and the prohibition of feeding grain in the first month. because in the [previous] year there had not been a [good] harvest, in the commanderies under [the Prefects] of the [Imperial] Capital,9.3 9.3 SC 11: 6a reads , in which phrase the HS omits the middle word. Yen Shih-ku says that what were confiscated were the horses. feeding horses with grain was prohibited and they were confiscated to the government. 328HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. II 142 B.C. Apr./May In the summer, the fourth month, an imperial 5:9a edict said, "Carved ornaments and chiseled engravings are matters that injure agriculture. Brocade, embroidery, vermillion silk ribbons, and braided ribbons harm women's work.9.4 9.4 Ying Shao writes, "Tsuan are the present laces of many colors. Silk stuff of variegated colors (tsui ) is this [material]. Tsu is the present seal-ribbon. Intermixed silk cords is this [material]." But Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) writes, "HsÃ¼ Shen [who wrote the Shuo-wen, ca. 100] says, "Tsuan is vermillion tsu,' " and Yen Shih-ku writes "[Fu] Tsan's explanation is correct. Tsui is hui [many-colored embroidery] and hui is many [colored] ts'ai [many-colored flowered silk]. At present it is called ts'o-ts'ai [woven multicolored stuff]. It is not tsuan." Women's work was especially raising silk-worms, weaving, and sewing. Raising food is men's work; making cloth and clothes is women's work. Injury to agriculture is the source of hunger; harm to women's work is the cause of [suffering from] cold. Verily when hunger and cold both come at the same time, there are few who will be able to keep from doing wrong.9.5 9.5 The foregoing sentence is found in a conversation about punishments between Marquis Wen of Weih and Li K'o or Li K'uei (cf. Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, p. 43, n. 2), in the Shuo-yÃ¼an (written by Liu Hsiang, 77-6 B.C.), ch. "Fan-chih." We Ourself plow and the Empress herself cultivates silkworms in order to lead the empire by furnishing the millet, the sacrifical grain, and the sacrificial robes for the [imperial] ancestral temples. [We] have not accepted the [yearly] offerings;9.6 9.6 The taxes paid to the emperor by commanderies and nobles. [We] have reduced [the supplies of] the Grand Provisioner; [We] have diminished the amount of public service and the poll-taxes, wishing that the empire 9b should stress agriculture and sericulture and should constantly have stores and provisions in order to be prepared for visitations and calamities, the strong should not rob from the weak, the many should not do violence to the few, the aged and those over sixty should die a natural death, and the young and orphans should be allowed to grow to maturity. 329HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. II 5:9b "Now for some years there have not been good 142 B.C. harvests and the food of the common people has been quite scanty; where does the fault lie? Perhaps dishonest and hypocritical officials make a business of presents and bribes, taking by fraud or by force the peoples' [property], encroaching upon and consuming the many common people.9.7 9.7 YÃ¼ YÃ¼eh (1821-1906), in his Hu-lou Pi-t'an 4:4, suggests that one wei and one li are due to dittography. A parallel passage is found in HS 6: 17a. Li Ch'i (fl. 220-265) writes, "Mou is an insect that eats the roots of cereals. is to eat up the people like this mou." Yen Shih-ku explains yÃ¼ by lieh (hunting), but Chou Shou-ch'ang replies, "To invade and take by force without choosing [any particular things] is called yÃ¼. YÃ¼ and lieh are two [different] things." An Assistant Prefect is a Chief Official; [for him] to pervert the laws and rob with the robbers is utterly unspeakable.9.8 9.8 Ch'ien Ta-chao notes that the Fukien ed. (1549) mistakenly reads for . "Let it be ordered that [officials whose positions rank as] two thousand piculs should each look after their own charge. As to those who do not occupy themselves with their official duties or who govern unintelligently, the Lieutenant Chancellor should report it and beg [the throne to order punishment] for their crimes. Let this be published and told to the empire and cause Our will to be clearly known." In the fifth month, an imperial edict said, "A May/June person should not be disquieted if he is ignorant, [but] he should be disquieted if he acts deceitfully. He should not be disquieted if he is not brave, [but] he should be disquieted if he acts tyrannously. He should not be disquieted if he is not rich, [but] he should be disquieted if he is not satisfied [i.e., is covetous]. Only incorrupt gentlemen make their desires few and are easily satisfied. [But] now [a person must have] capital [sufficient to be required to pay at least] ten or more [times] the poll-tax (suan) before he is permitted to become a palace official.9.9 9.9 Fu Ch'ien (ca. 125-195) comments, "Those whose tzu (capital or property) is ten thousand cash [pay] as a poll-tax (suan [cf. p. 184, n.1]) 127 [cash]." Ying Shao explains, "Anciently [people] hated that officials should be covetous. `If their clothes and food are enough, they know [how to distinguish between] honor and disgrace.' [A quotation from Kuan-tzu]. So [official position] was restricted [to those whose] capital (tzu) [was sufficient so that they paid at least] ten [times] the poll-tax (suan) and then only were people permitted to become officials. [Those who paid] ten [times] the poll-tax [possessed] a hundred thousand [cash]. Merchants who had wealth were not permitted to become officials; incorrupt gentlemen who had no capital were also not allowed to become palace officials (huan). Hence [the Emperor] reduced [the required] capital to [enough to require the payment of only] four [times] the poll-tax [as the amount required before they] were permitted to become palace officials (huan)." Ho Ch'uo (1661-1722) adds "What Tung Chung-shu said [in the HS] `To select Gentlemen and officials according to their wealth and capital (tzu)' points to this tzu and suan. [HS 57 A: 1a says that] Szu-ma Hsiang-ju, `by his capital (tzu) and poll-taxes (suan) became a Gentleman.' " The Han dynasty had a tax upon property or capital; each ten-thousand cash of property paid one poll-tax (which tax was different in amount at different times; cf. Glossary sub Poll-tax). Poor people were kept out of office in order to avoid securing high officials who sought profit in holding office. Yao Nai (1732-1815) however says, "When this [passage] says palace officials (huan ), it means Gentlemen. [But cf. below]. At the beginning of the Han [period], Gentlemen had to furnish ornamented robes and horses before they were permitted to wait upon the emperor, hence [they were appointed] according to their capital (tzu) and poll-taxes (suan). The saying of Chang Shih-chih [HS 50: 1a], `Being a palace official (huan) for a long time reduced my [older brother] Chung's possessions' and that General Wei Ch'ing ordered that the members of his suite should all furnish their saddles, horses, deep red garments, jade, utensils, and swords is about this [matter]. "In Han [times], when a person [wanted to] enter official life, in general there were three ways: [1] as a Gentleman or [Palace] Attendant, [2] by holding office in a province or commandery or in the yamen of a minister, or [3] by an imperial summons. Gentlemen were attendants upon the emperor. Without capital, they were not allowed to become attendants upon the emperor, but naturally they could hold office in the commanderies or prefectures or in the yamens of the ministers. At the time of Emperor Wu, schools were established and the filial and incorrupt were recommended; after that, Gentlemen did not need capital [on which to pay] poll-taxes in order to be promoted; yet they contributed sheep and contributed grain in order to be given a vacancy among the Gentlemen, which was a very much greater [payment] than the former [requirement] of capital [on which to pay] poll-taxes. All this did not exist before the time of Emperor Ching. When Ying [Shao] says, `[Official position] was restricted to those whose capital [was sufficient so that they paid at least] ten [times] the poll-tax, and then only were they permitted to become officials,' he did not comprehend that this regulation did not apply to all officials." Wang Hsien-ch'ien says that the Official ed. (1739) and the Academy ed. (1124) read kuan (offices) instead of huan (palace officials) both in the text and in Ying Shao's comment, at the places indicated by 9.9 or by (huan). If this emendation is accepted (and the first part of Ying Shao's comment uses the word li for "officials," so that he may not have had huan in his text), Yao Nai's restriction that only palace officials were required to have property falls to the ground. This emendation is however making a difficult reading easy and hence is operating on a wrong principle. Dr. J. J. L. Duyvendak remarks that it is not likely that an original kuan should have been changed to huan and that such a change does not make a proper sentence, inasmuch as in the HS kuan is used to mean "office" rather than "official." For "official," the word li would have been used. Emperor Ching seems to have been thinking that entrance into the government bureaucracy is normally through first becoming a Gentleman in the imperial palace, where the Emperor could get to know him, and from which position persons were promoted to governmental offices. He deplored that only very wealthy persons could thus enter the government service, hence he lowered the amount of property required for service in the palace. At a later time Commandery Administrators and other high officials recommended persons as filial and incorrupt, etc., whereupon such persons were sent to the quarters of the Major in Charge of Public Carriages or to the Yellow Gate in the imperial palace, where they became Expectant Appointees and were given a small allowance. Later such persons were given positions in the bureaucracy, seemingly without being made Gentlemen. Hence Yao Nai is correct in pointing out that not all officials first became Gentlemen, at least in the time of Ying Shao. Whether that was the case before the time of Emperor Ching is difficult to determine. The [number of] poll-taxes [which can 10a 330HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. II 331HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. II 5:10a be paid by] incorrupt gentlemen are not inevitably 142 B.C. many. [Just as] those who are enregistered in the market-places [as merchants] are not allowed to become palace officials,9.9 [so] those who have not [sufficient] capital are also not allowed to become palace officials.9.9 We very much deplore this. If the capital [of incorrupt gentlemen is sufficient so that they pay] four [times] the poll-tax, they shall be allowed to become palace officials,9.9 so as not to let incorrupt persons be kept for a long time from office and covetous fellows to profit continuously." In the autumn there was a great drought. Autumn In the third year, in the spring, the first month, III an imperial edict said, "Agriculture is the foundation 141 B. C. of the world. As to real gold, pearls, or jade, when Feb./Mar. one is hungry, they cannot be eaten; when one is cold, they cannot be worn. They are considered and used as objects of value, [but] one does not understand how their final or original [value came to be]. 332HSIAO-CHING, Hou, Yr. III 141 B.C. "Recently for some years there have not been good 5:10a harvests. In [Our] opinion this is because those who do non-essential things [merchanizing and craftsmanship] are many, [whereas] the common people who make agriculture [their profession] are few. Let it be ordered that the commanderies and kingdoms shall stress the encouragement of agriculture and sericulture, and increase the sowing and planting, [in order that] there may [thus] be obtained articles for clothing and food. If officials, in mobilizing the common people or in taking from them substitute-[money, employ them] to collect real gold, pearls, or jade, [such officials] shall be condemned [as having taken] booty and treated as robbers. [Officials 10b ranking at] two thousand piculs who permit [such actions, shall be punished] with the same punishment [as other officials]." The Imperial Heir-apparent [Liu Ch'Ãª] was capped,10.1 10.1 Cf. p. 182, n. 2. and those people who would be the successors of their fathers were granted one step in noble rank. Mar. 10 On [the day] chia-tzu, the Emperor died in the Wei-yang Palace.10.2 10.2 Fu Tsan (fl. ca. 285) writes, "The Emperor was in his thirty-second year when he came to the throne; he reigned to his sixteenth year; he lived to his forty-eighth year." Then he was born in 188 B.C. In his testamentary edict, he granted to the vassal kings and to the marquises two teams of four horses each, to officials [ranking at] two thousand piculs, two catties of actual gold, and to the [lower] officials and the common people, a hundred cash to each household. He freed the women of the [imperial] harem and sent them back to their families, exempting their persons [from taxation] for life.10.3 10.3 Wang Ming-sheng (1722-1798) remarks, "When Emperor Wen died, he sent home [his concubines], from his Ladies down to his Junior Maids, [hence] when Emperor Ching died, he also freed the women of his harem. In [the time of Emperors] Wu and Chao there came to be the practise [that members of an emperor's harem] should uphold [his worship] at his tomb. When Emperor P'ing died, Wang Mang again freed [the Emperor's] concubines and sent them all home." In the second month, on [the day] Mar. 18 kuei-yu, he was buried in the Yang Tomb. 333HSIAO-CHING 5:10b In eulogy we say: Confucius eulogized, "These people! They are whereby the three dynasties pursued their straight course."10.4 10.4 Analects, XV, xxiv, 2. Yen Shih-ku explains, "He means that the people of this time were the same as those governed by the Hsia, Yin, and Chou [dynasties], when, because of the government's cultural influence, purity, and unity, [the people] could follow a straight path in their actions. He regrets that at this time [the situation] was different." It was true indeed; the error of the Chou and the Ch'in [dynasties] was that although the net [of their laws] was fine and their enactments were severe, yet they could not overcome the ways of the wicked.10.5 10.5 The Ch'in dynasty enacted many and severe laws, which applied to everyone, high and low. These were the "fine net" and "severe enactments." The Lord of Shang, who established the severe laws of Ch'in, is said to have even had the nose of the Grand Tutor of the Heir-apparent, Prince Ch'ien, sliced off in punishment. Cf. J. J. L. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, p. 19. When the Han [dynasty] arose, it swept away [such] vexations and harshness and gave the common people repose and rest. [Emperor] Hsiao-wen added [the virtues of] respectfulness and frugality; [Emperor] Hsiao-ching followed his practises. In the course of fifty or sixty years,10.6 10.6 Wang Hsien-shen (1859-1922) says that the words are an interpolation; the T'ai-p'ing YÃ¼-lan (978-983) ch. 88, quotes this passage without these two words. [these Emperors even] altered the people's customs and changed their usages, [so that] the many common people10.7 10.7 On the meaning of this phrase, cf. 10: n. 6.7. became pure and sincere. The Chou [dynasty] talked about [Kings] Ch'eng and K'ang; the Han [dynasty similarly] speaks of [Emperors] Wen and Ching. How splendid! 334 Appendix I AN OFFICIAL'S CHARTER When important officials or nobles were appointed, they were given a charter; cf. n. 5.7. The Han-chiu-yi (by Wei Hung, fl. 25-57) A: 12a, contains such a charter, which shows that these charters consisted of admonitions by the ruler to the appointee: "A [certain] charter for a Grandee who was newly installed says, " `Verily, in [the year-period] Wu-feng, the third year, the first month, on [the day] yi-szu [Feb. 19, 55 B.C.], the Grandee Secretary took office and the Emperor invited him to mount [the steps to the throne] and in person gave him an imperial edict, which said, " ` "Let the Grandee Secretary approach, empty himself [of his notions], and receive Our words. We are ignorant of the Great Way, [yet We] have had the opportunity to protect the [imperial] ancestral temples, [so that We are] very fearful and humble. Day and night [We] think of [Our] own faults without taking leisure, joy, or repose. During the day We think that the people have not yet been able to be tranquil. Alas! Let the Grandee Secretary apply himself with all his mind and do his best in supplying Our deficiencies. Alas! Let the nine high ministers, the grandees, and all the officials be careful. If you are not earnest in your duty, there is the regular law. Go and apply yourself with all your mind in harmonizing, enriching, and opening [the way for] capable persons, enabling the capable to have the means of returning to their proper places [in the bureaucracy, and so of] directing the people. Do not keep silence before Our Self. The multitude [of people] in the world receive commands from Us and consider the law as [determining] their fates. [Then] can you fail to be careful? Alas! O Grandee Secretary, be warned." ' " The list of officials in HS ch. 19 B does not give any appointment on the date in this document, and from the dates in that chapter it does not seem at all likely that this date is correct. Ibid. p. 23a however lists the appointment of Wang Yen-kuang in the third year of T'ai-ch'u, the first month. According to this suggestion, the year and month are correct, and yi-szu is a mistake for chi-szu (a common error). Then the date is Feb. 18, 102 B.C. The phrasing may well be that of Emperor Wu. 335 Appendix II SOLAR ECLIPSES DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR CHING During this period of sixteen years, ten eclipses are recorded in the SC or HS. We consider them in their chronological order. i. In Ch'ien III (the third year of the first part of the reign), the second month, on the day jen-tzu, the last day of the month, a solar eclipse is listed (HS 5: 4a). But, according to P. Hoang, Concordance des chronologies nÃ©omÃ©niques chinoise et europÃ©enne, there was no jen-tzu day in the second month. HS 27 Cb: 13b dates this eclipse "on [the day] jen-wu, the last day of the month. It was two degrees in [the constellation] Wei4." This date was Apr. 5, 154 B.C. The Han-chi (ii cent.) 9:5b however dates this eclipse "in the second month, on [the day] hsin-szu, the first day of the month," which was Apr. 4, 154 B.C., according to Hoang. Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2506 on Apr. 4, 154 B.C., which date Hoang calculates as the day before the last day of the month. Oppolzer calculates the sun as in long. 10.9Â° = 10.0Â° R.A.; the stars of Wei4 were then in 11.2Â° to 12.8Â° R.A. ii. HS 5: 4b says, In Ch'ien IV, "the tenth month, on [the day] mou-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, there was an eclipse of the sun." HS ch. 27 and the Han-chi both fail to list this eclipse. The listing in ch. 5 is moreover peculiar, since here the tenth month, which really began the year, is noted at the end of the year. Another eclipse in the tenth month at the end of a year is noted in Chung IV, on the day mou-wu. Because of the similarity of these two dates, there is a possibility of conflation between these two recordings. HS ch. 27 lists neither of them. P. Hoang, in his Catalogue des Ã©clipses de soleil et de lune dans les documents chinois ("VariÃ©tÃ©s sinologiques", n. 56) suggests Oppolzer's solar eclipse no. 2507, but that was visible only in the southern hemisphere. Chu Wen-hsin, in his Li-tai Jih-shih K'ao (1934) suggests Oppolzer's no. 2510, but that eclipse was also invisible in China. Liu Pin and Chou Shou-ch'ang think that this eclipse is an interpolation, because of the peculiar month, because HS ch. 27 does not list it, and because of the similarity to the one listed for Chung IV. Ho Ch'uo suggests that since the SC lists an "intercalary ninth month" in this 336CHAPTER V year, this intercalary month is intended. Hoang does not however put any mou-hsÃ¼ day in that intercalary month, making such a day the twenty-fifth of the regular ninth month, Oct. 12, 153 B.C. In the four years between the preceeding correctly recorded eclipse in 154 B.C. and the next such a one in 150 B.C., there occurred eight solar eclipses, of which only two were visible in China.1 1 Besides those located by Oppolzer, three were partial. Of those, no. 2508 was near the south polar regions; the other two, upon cursory calculation, were also found located outside China. The eclipse of Aug. 7, 152 B.C. was invisible in Ch'ang-an, but calculation shows that at the present Peiping it reached a magnitude of 0.08 (totality = 1.00) at sunrise. This day was in Ch'ien V, the sixth month, on the day ting-yu, the day before the last day of the month. Calculation shows also that the eclipse of Feb. 2, 151 B.C. reached a magnitude of 0.03 at Ch'ang-an at 10:08 a.m., local time; at the present Ch'ang-sha it reached a magnitude of 0.15 at 10:27 a.m., local time. This date was in Ch'ien VI, the first month, the day ping-shen, the first day of the month. Ping-shen is two days before mou-hsÃ¼ and ting-yu is the day before mou-hsÃ¼. Since Hoang's calendar (from which these datings are taken) might be as much as three days in error, either of these two eclipses might be the one referred to in this recording, as far as the cyclical days go. These eclipses were however both quite small and would easily be missed. Since our other sources do not list this eclipse, it is more probably an interpolation into the text, possibly a conflation or dittography for the other peculiar eclipse in Chung IV. iii. In Ch'ien VII, the eleventh month, on the day keng-yin, the last day of the month, a third eclipse of the sun is recorded (5:5a). HS 27 Cb: 13b also records it and adds, "It was 9 degrees in [the constellation] HsÃ¼." The SC (Mh II, 501) mistakenly dates this eclipse on the last day of the twelfth month. Hoang gives this date as Jan. 22, 150 B.C.; Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2515 for that date. He calculates the sun's longitude as 299.1Â° = 301.2Â° R.A. The two stars of HsÃ¼ were then in 291.8Â° and 293.9Â° R.A. iv. In Chung I, the twelfth month, on the day chia-yin, the last day of the month, a fourth solar eclipse is listed in HS 27 Cb: 13b; ch. 5 and the Han-chi do not mention this eclipse. Hoang gives this date as Feb. 10, 149 B.C. There was no eclipse on that date. In the three years between the preceding eclipse and the next correctly 337APPENDIX II recorded one in 147 B.C., there were 7 solar eclipses, of which only one was visible in China.2 2 The one partial eclipse, no. 2517, was located near the south pole. Five other eclipses are charted as invisible in China. This one occurred on June 7, 149 B.C., in Chung I, the fifth month, on the day jen-tzu, the last day of the month. Oppolzer charts the moon's umbra as passing into northern Siberia, so that this eclipse was visible as a small partial eclipse in northern China. Chia-yin is the second day after jen-tzu; it is likely that Hoang's calendar is here two days in error and that "fifth" was misread as "twelfth," so that the eclipse of 149 B.C. is the one intended in this recording. Then the Han-chi did not list all the eclipses given in the HS, and missed this one because it is listed only in HS ch. 27. v. In Chung II, the ninth month, on the day chia-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, a fifth solar eclipse is recorded (5: 6b; 27 Cb: 13b; Han-chi 9: 14b). Hoang gives this date as Oct. 22, 148 B.C. No eclipse happened on that day. If we are correct in identifying the preceeding eclipse with that of 149 B.C., there was no solar eclipse visible in China between the two eclipses of 150 and 147 B.C. This listing is probably dittography for the next eclipse. Both were listed in the ninth month, one on the day chia-hsÃ¼ and the other on the day mou-hsÃ¼; one in the second year and the other in the third year. In the list of eclipses in ch. 27 this dittography is quite plain. There two groups, each of eleven characters, follow each other, differing only in two characters. If, possibly in copying the original astronomical records, the word for "three" had been carelessly written "two," and someone had added the correct notation of the next eclipse and had also noted that mou-hsÃ¼ is incorrect for that month of the second year and had changed mou to chia, the list would stand as it is now. Its insertion into the Annals would naturally have followed. vi. In Chung III, the ninth month, on the day mou-hsÃ¼, the last day of the month, a sixth solar eclipse is recorded (5: 6b; 27 Cb: 13b; Han-chi 9: 14b). Ch. 27 adds, "It was almost total. It was nine degrees in Wei3." Hoang gives this date as Nov. 10, 147 B.C., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2523. He charts the moon's umbra as passing approximately through the present Urga, Mongolia, and Shanhai-kuan, Hopei. Calculation shows that the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.77 in Ch'ang-an at 10:58 a.m., local time. 338CHAPTER V The sun's longitude was 224.9Â° = 222.4Â° R.A. The nine stars of Wei3 ranged in R.A. from 218.2Â° to 230.7Â°. vii. In Chung IV, at the end of the record for the year, there is listed an eclipse of the sun in the tenth month, on the day mou-wu (5: 7a; Han-chi 9: 14b). HS ch. 27 does not list this eclipse. There could of course be no tenth month at the end of the year, for the tenth month was the first month in a year. In the three years between the preceeding eclipse and the next correctly recorded one in 144 B.C., there were six solar eclipses, of which only one was visible in China.3 3 Three were partial eclipses; two, nos. 2525 &amp; 2526 were near the south pole. The other, on Apr. 6, 146 B.C. was calculated and found invisible, in Chinese longitudes, south of 60Â° N lat. The two other eclipses are charted as plainly invisible in China. This one occurred on the morning of Mar. 26, 145 B.C. It was invisible at Ch'ang-an and even in the ancient Lu, the modern Ch'Ã¼-fou, Shantung. But at Jung-ch'eng, on the eastern tip of the Shantung peninsula, the eclipse reached a magnitude of 0.16 at sunrise, according to calculation. This day was in Chung V, the second month, the day keng-shen, the last day of the month, according to Hoang. Mou-wu is the second day before keng-shen. There thus occurred an eclipse within a few months of the time when this eclipse is said to have occurred, on a cyclical day which was possibly the same cyclical day as that for which it was listed (since Hoang's calendar might be two days in error). At sunrise an eclipse must reach a magnitude of 0.33 to be conspicuous, and an eclipse of 0.16 is visible to the naked eye. It is possible that some official in eastern Shantung reported this eclipse to the imperial court and that somehow the record got into the "Imperial Annals" in a garbled form. Since the list in ch. 27 seems to represent the records of the court astronomers, it is natural that this eclipse did not get into that list. viii. In Chung VI, the seventh month, on the day hsin-hai, the last day of the month, an eighth eclipse is recorded (5: 8b; 27 Cb: 14a; Han-chi 9: 15b). Ch. 27 adds, "It was 7 degrees in [the constellation] Chen3." Hoang gives this day as Sept. 8, 144 B.C., for which Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2530. He charts the path of totality as passing near the present Canton. He calculates the sun in long. 161.6Â° = 163.2Â° R.A. The stars of Chen3 then ranged from 155.7Â° to 161.4Â° R.A. 339APPENDIX II ix. In Hou I, the seventh month, on the day yi-szu, a ninth solar eclipse is recorded. HS 5: 8b says it was on the last day of the month; 27 Cb: 14a however says it was "one day before the last day of the month," and adds, "It was 17 degrees in [the constellation] Yi." Hoang gives this date as Aug. 28, 143 B.C., the day before the last day of the month, for which day Oppolzer calculates his solar eclipse no. 2532. He charts the path of totality as passing through Siberia and the island of Yezo. He calculates the sun's longitude as 150.8Â° = 152.9Â° R.A. The stars of Yi then ranged from 136.0Â° to 144.7Â° R.A. x. Under Hou III, the tenth month, which was Nov. 16-Dec. 14, 142 B.C., the SC (Mh II, 508) says, "The sun and the moon were both eclipsed and red for five days." The HS does not mention this matter either in the Annals or in ch. 27. The only solar eclipse visible in China between that of 143 B.C. and the next correctly recorded one in 138 B.C. was that of Aug. 8, 141 B.C., which may have been separately recorded in ch. 6.4 4 In this period of 5 years there were 12 solar eclipses, of which 6 were partial. Nos 2534 &amp; 2543 were near the south pole. The remaining four were calculated and found invisible in China. There was no eclipse of the moon in Nov./Dec. 142 B.C. This record seems to refer to a dust-storm.</field>
