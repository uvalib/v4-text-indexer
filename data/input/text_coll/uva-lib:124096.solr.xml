      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION HISTORICAL SKETCH By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the College, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâthe buildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartments for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, 9.): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an university, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items where it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles letters; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfil those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its chairman, the latter being a member of the faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this university and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsânamely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. In April, 1919, was founded through the generous gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, the McIntire School of Fine Arts, embracing instruction in Art, Architecture and Music. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the faculty substituted for the doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. THE HONOR SYSTEM For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the university authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 228. For admission to the Department of Law, see page 291. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 304. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, the Department of Education, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College of Arts and Sciences, page 212; for the Department of Education, page 235; for the Department of Engineering, page 251. Admission of Women.âThe admission of women to the several departments of the University is subject to the following conditions: 1. General Requirements: The applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private-school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. 2. Specific Departmental Requirements: These will be found in the requirements for admission to each of the several departments.

This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must make at least the grade required by the School for recommendation to college, and must have the general recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. The university accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. Certificate credit for any entrance unit is invalidated by subsequent failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS June, 1928 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS REGISTRATION Registration.âApplicants seeking admission to the University must present themselves to the Deans of their respective departments at some time during the first three days of the session, and new students (not transfers from other colleges) applying for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences must also present themselves at 10:00 a. m. on Wednesday, September 12, at Memorial Gymnasium to take the qualifying examinations in English and general scholastic aptitude. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the College of Arts and Sciences during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after October 1, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 136. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or who live more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 139. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 138. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training, see page 201. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 355.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required to at once cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself, be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES University and Tuition Fees* * The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff, and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. College students from Virginia taking a single technical course in the Department of Engineering pay a tuition of $60, or $20 per term. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee, all students $ 50.00 $ 60.00 Tuition, Academic students $ 40.00 $215.00 â  â  Candidates for B.S. in Architecture, after the first year, are registered as professional students in Architecture.

BOARD AND LODGING A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Bursar. The University Cafeteria The University Commons, conveniently situated near the center of the University, is now being conducted on the Cafeteria plan, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Good, wholesome food is being served at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. University Dormitories Rules.âStudents desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. Rates.âThe rates stated below are for furnished room. If occupied by one student, the following furniture is provided: 1 three-piece enameled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 table, one straight chair and one rocking chair or morris chair. If occupied by two students, the following furniture is provided: 2 single beds, or 1 double deck bed with springs and mattresses, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 desk or two tables, 1 rocking chair or morris chair and two straight chairs. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. All rooms are heated by hot water and lighted by electricity. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, pillow, etc., or they can be purchased here if desired. The rates given are for the session of nine months. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 not later than May 1. No room may be sublet without the consent of the Bursar. East and West Lawns ONE OCCUPANT TWO OCCUPANTS Rooms in Bachelor's Row, W.

The necessary expenses included here are university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. Loans will be provided for deserving students. See page 151.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS All inquiries concerning and all applications for scholarships and fellowships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. Applicants for scholarships and fellowships, if not already registered as students of the University, must comply with the entrance requirements. The President will, after due warning to the holder, declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time, if the holder's scholastic record is such as to necessitate scholastic discipline in his case. Unless otherwise stated, the tenure of each scholarship or fellowship is one year, and the holder may be a student in any department of the University. SCHOLARSHIPS The Accredited School Scholarships in the College of Arts and Sciences, Education and Engineering: one for each of the accredited public or private secondary schools in Virginia, and one for each of a list of accredited secondary schools located in other states.

In case chapters qualified to nominate incumbents fail to do so by September 1, the President of the University may fill such vacancies. Every alumni chapter shall announce each year in its local daily papers the nature and conditions of the scholarship, and shall invite applications therefor. It is felt that the chapters may do good service with their scholarships if they select for incumbents young men of brilliantâor at least more than averageâpromise.

Associate Professor Benton. Chemistry D4* : Atomic Structure: An introduction to the modern theory of atomic structure and its application in the study of the structure and some properties of matter. Associate Professor Benton. Research: Every graduate student in Chemistry is expected to carry on research. No special courses are listed, as the nature of the work and the credit received will vary with the time spent upon it, the previous training of the student and the degree for which the student is applying. At present investigations are under way in this laboratory in the fields of catalysis; adsorption; reaction velocity in heterogeneous systems; free energy of lead compounds; colloid chemistry; organic synthesis and other problems in organic chemistry. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions. The privileges of the club are extended to all members of the University and others who are interested in the progress of Chemistry. The Chemical Laboratory, recently completed, is of brick, fire-proof construction, and the three floors afford 30,000 square feet of space. The seven larger laboratories will accommodate 625 students, and, in addition to these there are smaller laboratories for the use of the instructors and advanced students. There are also rooms for assay furnaces, gas and water analysis, photography, etc. The equipment is satisfactory for purposes of both instruction and research. The laboratory maintains a working library containing about 5,000 volumes directly relating to chemistry as well as complete files of the important periodicals. A gift to the School of Chemistry from Mrs. Hamilton Barksdale in memory of her husband, and from Delaware alumni and friends of the University, will make possible at once a number of additions to the library. The annual income from this fund, which became available for the first time in the session of 1925-26, will soon make the library thoroughly adequate. Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy: In addition to fulfilling the regular University requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, candidates for this degree who select chemistry as their Major Subject must give evidence of thorough training in the general principles of chemistry, in organic chemistry, and in analytical chemistry, by passing written qualifying examinations in these subjects; these examinations to be passed not later than the close of the session preceding that in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. Fellowships: There will be available for the session of 1928-1929 seven Teaching Fellowships in Chemistry, each with an honorarium of $500. These fellowships present the opportunity for graduate study and research in Chemistry, accompanied by a limited amount of instructional work. Holders of the fellowships will be expected to devote not more than fifteen hours a week to instruction, leaving ample time for research and work toward the graduate degree. The fellowships are open to men who have received a bachelor's degree from a college or university of recognized standing, and who have received thorough undergraduate training in chemistry and physics. Preference will be given to applicants who have studied calculus, German, and French. Summer Quarter 1927 Chemistry sB1-I: General Chemistry. First twenty days of quarter. 2 session-hours.

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President of the University James Morris Page, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences George Oscar Ferguson, Jr., M.A., Ph.D. Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission from Secondary Schools.âThe general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 129. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 131), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics (one and one-half in algebra, one in plane geometry), and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 130, but no credit will be given for less than two units in any foreign language. Candidates who expect to apply for the degree of B.S. in Architecture should offer Solid Geometry and Physics if possible. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry should offer Inorganic Chemistry and Solid Geometry when possible. In addition to the above requirements, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English, supplemented by a test of general scholastic aptitude. This examination will be held in Memorial Gymnasium at 10 A. M., Wednesday, September 12. Any candidate who does not take the qualifying examination at this time will be charged a delayed examination fee of ten dollars, and will be required to pass a later examination before his registration can be completed. (Note: Principals of secondary schools may make arrangements with the Dean to hold the qualifying examination at their schools on a designated day in April.) Any student who fails to maintain a reasonable standard of English in all of his college work will be required to take an additional course in English composition or to repeat a course in order to make up his deficiency Admission from Other Colleges.âNo student suspended from another college for scholastic deficiency or on probation in another college for scholastic deficiency will be admitted to the College of this University in the immediately succeeding session, unless he passes on at least three session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter of this University. No student from another college will be admitted to the College of this University if he has ever been suspended or on probation more than once, or if he has ever been both on probation and suspended. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Department a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of those certificates which are provisionally accepted is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this University; and the courses offered as major electives must all have been completed in residence in this University. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 130. A student who, while able to offer fifteen units, cannot offer fifteen units as defined in this list, may be conditioned on any two units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old, or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance units, of at least thirty session-hours (sixty semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. REGULATIONS (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach college student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided he is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College of Arts and Sciences may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating eighteen session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take three additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. (3) The grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent, or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass on six hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass on a number of hours six in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass on three hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass on a number of hours three in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least 12 hours of work or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least 15 hours of work or be placed on probation. Exception: A first-year student excluded from one course during the first term is not to be placed on probation during the rest of the term. But at the end of the term he is to be considered as having made a grade of less than 50 per cent on the course from which he was excluded. 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may re-enter the College. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the completion of three session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be re-admitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee is empowered to grant relief for just cause. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has passed his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A College student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent., but not below sixty-five per cent., may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and it should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) A candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a reexamination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted, in connection with both (I) and (II) above, that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Each unexcused absence from a class exercise will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. Exception: A second year student who has credit for at least 12 but less than 27 session-hours of work is allowed one absence without penalty per term in each course. A third year student who has credit for at least 27 but less than 42 session-hours of work is allowed two absences without penalty per term in each course. A fourth year student who has credit for at least 42 session-hours of work is allowed three absences without penalty per term in each course. A total of more than 15 unexcused absences, (in excess of absences without penalty), in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If, in any term, a student incurs both attendance probation and probation for failure in courses, he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than fifty per cent of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List or to holders of Intermediate Honors. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found on page 357. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. (14) The Dean's List.âAny student not in his first year, who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. (15) Physical Education Requirement.âAll first and second year students in the College of Arts and Sciences are required to take the course in Physical Education unless excused by the Dean. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students should enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 212. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty (60) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 30 hours of required subjects as stated below and must in addition, unless exemption is granted on a physician's certificate, complete the two years' course in Physical Training which is not evaluated in session-hours (see below). Of the 30 hours of required subjects not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages For the Bachelor of Arts.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either Latin or Greek. For the Bachelor of Science.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either French, German or Spanish. Mathematics For either degree.âThree session-hours. Natural Science For either degree.âSix session-hours. English For either degree.âSix session-hours, 3 of which may be in Biblical History, or Biblical Literature, or Public Speaking, the other 3 being in English or English Literature. Social Science For either degree.âThree session-hours in History B1 or B2, or Economics B1, or Government B1, or Sociology B1. Economics B1, or Sociology B1, if selected, cannot be taken before the candidate's second year. Philosophy For either degree.âThree session-hours in Philosophy B1, Philosophy B2, or Psychology B1. Physical Training For either degree.âTwo years' course required of all candidates, which must be completed during the first two years unless the candidate is excused on a physician's certificate. Note.âA candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete the above requirements (1) for the first and second sessions. (2) Electives-at-Large.âOf the remaining 30 session-hours required for the baccalaureate degree, 18 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. (3) Major-Electives.âThe remaining 12 session-hours required for either degree, shall be known as Major-Electives. The Major-Electives shall include at least one C course (which must require two B courses as a pre-requisite), and must all be offered from some one of the following Major-Groups of related subjects, except that when the Major-Group is Group III, the candidate may offer, in lieu of a C course, any six-hour B course in this Group, for admission to which another six-hour B course in the Group is prerequisite. The Major-Electives must all be completed in this College or in some professional department of this university. Group I.âLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts and Music. Group II.âSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group III.âMathematical and Natural Sciences. (4) Substitutions for Major-Electives.âThe first-year course in Law, or the first-year course in Medicine or 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Engineering or Education may be substituted for the 12 session-hours of Major-Electives in academic subjects. This work, which must be completed in one of the professional departments of this University, cannot be begun by the candidate until he has spent at least 2 sessions of 9 months each in successful work in this College, and has at least 45 session-hours to his credit. DEGREES WITH HONORS The courses required for the cultural B.A. and B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination satisfied the requirements for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without great difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there are a number who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors: Intermediate Honors A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University, has passed on not less than 30 session-hours, including all required A courses, without failure or reexamination on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more each session. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to the rules limiting absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class-standing, imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the honors were won in a given academic school. A student who wishes to attain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any student who has met the requirements for the Dean's List for two sessions may apply to become a candidate for Final Honors. Application must be made first to the Dean, and, if approved by him, must also be approved by one of the academic schools which offer work for honors. A list of such schools is published annually. Final honors are conferred on the basis of a final comprehensive examination, both oral and written, on some field of knowledge, and not for work done in any or all of the regular courses required for a baccalaureate degree. Honors work involves wide and independent reading for two years, under the general direction of the professors of an academic school. It does not require regular attendance upon lectures or the passing of any tests or examinations, except the final examination, though consultations and reports may be required. Its aim is the development of a capacity for scholarly work in a field of knowledge, rather than a mastery of required details of subject matter. The completion of work for Final Honors may be counted as credit towards a B.A. or cultural B.S. degree in lieu of six session-hours of electives-at-large or major-electives. In the event that the work for honors is not of sufficiently high quality for Final Honors to be conferred, six session-hours' credit toward a degree without honors may be granted upon recommendation of the academic school in charge. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN A SPECIAL SUBJECT. The degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty (60) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects: Candidates must complete 30 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, not less than 24 hours of which must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 not later than the third year.

      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President of the University John Calvin Metcalf, M.A., Litt.D., LL.D. Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE: The Dean and Professors Malone, Manahan, Mitchell, Williams, Benton; for the Summer Quarter, the Dean and Professor Faulkner and Kepner. HISTORICAL STATEMENT While the original organization of the Academic Schools of the University by Jefferson contemplated instruction of graduate grade in each School, the first "post-graduate department" in the modern sense was instituted in 1859-60 by Basil L. Gildersleeve, then Professor of Greek in the institution. The degree of Master of Arts continued to be conferred upon graduates in all six Schools of the University. Professor Gildersleeve conducted graduate courses in the School of Greek; shortly after the Civil War a "post-graduate department" was announced for the School of Latin. Graduate courses were offered in individual Schools, but there was no general department organization for graduate study until 1904. In that year the Department of Graduate Studies was established as a regular co-ordinate division of the University, with definitely prescribed regulations corresponding to the requirements of the Association of American Universities, in which the University of Virginia was the first Southern university to hold membership. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy had, however, been offered by the University as far back as 1880. The present requirements for graduate degrees, with minor modifications, have been in force since 1904. THE GRADUATE HOUSE The Graduate House, administrative headquarters of the Department of Graduate Studies, is on West Lawn. Besides the Dean's office, this building contains one large lecture-room for graduate classes and three seminar rooms on the second floor specially equipped for small groups of students and professors engaged in advanced graduate work. Each seminar room has a small library for the use of advanced graduate students in the courses conducted in that room. The building is therefore the administrative office of the Department and the workshop of its humanistic section. At present the class-rooms are used by certain C and D classes in the Schools of English, History, Philosophy, Economics, Biblical Literature, and Political Science. The central location of this house and its proximity to the General Library make it particularly adapted to departmental use. LIBRARY FACILITIES The University Libraries contain 151,333 volumes. Departmental libraries, notably those of the Scientific Schools, the Classical, the English, the Social Sciences, and the Heck Memorial Library of the Department of Education, have about 40,000 volumes. Graduate students may, through the office of the General Library, get certain books needed in research from other libraries on the interlibrary loan system. Library facilities for graduate study, both in arts and sciences, are excellent. GRADUATE CLUBS Several general meetings of the students and officials of the Graduate Department are held during the session for professional and social purposes. Addresses are delivered by members of the Faculty or by visiting scholars, followed by informal discussion. Besides these general conferences there are regular weekly or bi-weekly meetings of graduate students and professors for discussion of topics connected with graduate study. Papers are presented on the progress of certain investigations by the writers, some of which are published as monographs, or contributed to technical journals. These clubs are stimulating centers of research activity. The scientific society of Sigma Xi is an important organization for the advancement of technical knowledge. The University Committee on Research, while not specifically an organization of the Department of Graduate Studies, is a valuable auxiliary of the Department. This committee administers an annual appropriation for promoting research in the various Departments of the University, especially in the matter of the publication of the results of original investigation, and so aids the general cause of advanced scholarship. An annual volume, "Publications and Research," containing summaries of contributions by professors and students of the Graduate Department, is issued by the University. SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES Each Scientific School occupies a separate building with an extensive laboratory and a select departmental library. Statements in regard to laboratories and general scientific equipment in the Schools of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics may be found under the announcements of those Schools. ORGANIZATION The immediate direction of the Department of Graduate Studies is vested in the Dean and an Administrative Committee of seven professors, appointed by the President, two of whom serve only during the Summer Quarter. The Faculty of the Graduate Department consists of those professors in the Academic Schools who offer graduate courses. Courses marked C are for graduates and advanced undergraduates; those marked D are for graduates only. The prerequisites for each course are indicated, varying from six to twelve session-hours of college work. The various Schools, or departments, fall into three general divisions, or groups, as follows: Group IâLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Biblical Literature, Architecture, Music. Group IIâSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Commerce, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology. Group IIIâMathematical and Natural Sciences. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics. REGISTRATION Every graduate student, new or old, is required to register at the office of the Dean of the Department, Graduate House, West Lawn, who will advise him in regard to a program of studies. The first three days of the session are devoted to registration. Every applicant for admission to the Graduate Department as candidate for a degree must file with the Dean an official transcript of his college record. Admission to the Department does not necessarily imply acceptance for candidacy for a degree. All applications will be passed upon by the Committee on Rules and Courses of the Department of Graduate Studies early in the first term, and each applicant will be formally notified by the Dean of the tentative approval of his candidacy. The final approval of his candidacy will depend upon his record during the first term, or quarter, of his residence. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least six collegiate session-hours of foreign language credit are required. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the nolder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration, in the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by the professor of the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and one or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in the student's formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than October 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and one Minor Subject, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least two years of graduate study must be spent in residence. By special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia. Upon advancement to candidacy the Dean will appoint a special committee of not less than three Professors, under the Chairmanship of the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Committee on Rules and Courses. This committee will conduct the candidate's final examinations, and pass upon his dissertation. (2) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by passing examinations in French and German, set by the professors of these languages, in consultation with the Professor of the Major Subject, not later than Oct. 1 of the session preceding the final academic year of candidacy for the degree. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Committee on Rules and Courses, some other language may be substituted for either French or German. (3) A final examination, written, oral, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the special committee shall prescribe.

CLAUDE GRAHAM, B.A. Instructor in Secondary Education and Educational Sociology FLOYD FRANK SWERTFEGER, B.S., M.S. Instructor in Philosophy and Psychology HISTORY The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $0,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. It is the main purpose of the Department of Education to provide opportunity for such professional training. Since education is of great importance as an agency of Democracy and as an aspect of civilization, the Department also aims to provide courses of cultural value for citizens generally. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training, the Department, as a part of the State University, offers its services to school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical educational problems and in the furtherance of public education. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by some of the leading authorities on school architecture in this country. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift by Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A recent gift of $3000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City will enable the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of several thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Requirements for the Admission of Men.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, men must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering college should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register in the Department of Education. Requirements for the Admission of Women.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of college work aggregating thirty session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the summer quarter. Special Students.â(a) Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education and upon completion of the required courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Board of Education. (b) Men may be admitted as special students without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if they are Virginians, they are more than twenty years old or, if they are not Virginians, they are more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and give adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which they are registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. (c) Women, twenty-five years of age, giving satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to pursue courses in Education successfully, may be admitted as special students, even though they fail to show credit for the 30 session-hours of academic work required of women for admission to regular standing. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. This examination will be held on Monday of the first week of the session. Any student who fails to maintain a reasonable standard of English in all of his college work will be required to take an additional course in English composition or to repeat a course in order to make up his deficiency. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Department a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this university; and the courses offered as major electives must all have been completed in residence in this university. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 130. A student who, while able to offer fifteen units, cannot offer fifteen units as defined in this list, may be conditioned on any two units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. GRADUATE WORK IN EDUCATION Graduate work in Education leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy may be pursued in the Department of Graduate Studies. Graduate students who choose Education as their major for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must meet the entrance requirements of the Department of Graduate Studies, and, in addition, must pass, at least two terms prior to receiving the degree, preliminary written examinations in each of the following fields: History of Education, Educational Psychology, Educational Administration, Secondary Education, and Educational Sociology. The candidate must also pass a final oral examination upon his dissertation and the general fields of his major and minor subjects. The Department of Education offers the following graduate courses: Education C1, Advanced Educational Psychology; Education C2, Problems in School Administration; Education C3, Problems in Elementary School Supervision; Education C4, Problems in High School Administration; Education C5, Problems in High School Supervision; Education C6, Mental Measurement; Education D1, Seminar in Educational Psychology; Education D2, Seminar in School Administration; and Education D3, Seminar in Secondary Education. The Dean's List.âA student who passes on not less than fifteen session-hours during a session with an average of at least eighty-five per cent., and with no session grade less than seventy-five per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List, and will remain on the List as long as he receives an average of at least eighty-five per cent., on at least fifteen session-hours per term and receives no term grade less than seventy-five per cent. in any course. Any student on the Dean's List failing to maintain this standard of excellence will be automatically dropped from the List. A student once dropped from the List can again make the Dean's List by meeting the above standard for entire session. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone.

COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high-school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four three-session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. SPECIAL CERTIFICATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS Students who find it necessary to leave college to teach before completing their full course may be issued special certificates by the State Board of Education to teach any high-school subjects in which they have completed six session-hours of study of college grade. These students should plan to take two courses in Education during their second year in order to become familiar with school problems. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING Laboratory facilities for observation and directed teaching and for practical research in Secondary Education are made available through the co-operation of the school systems of the city of Charlottesville, the county of Albemarle, and the city of Winchester. Students of the Department of Education will do observation and directed teaching in the high school of the city of Charlottesville under the supervision of critic teachers selected from the city high school staff and the supervisor of instruction who is Assistant Professor of Secondary Education in the University of Virginia. The schools of the city of Charlottesville and the city of Winchester are also available for practical research and experimentation in the fields of school administration, secondary education and educational psychology. Certain well-qualified students will be assigned special problems to study under the direction of the Superintendent of Schools and the Education faculty. The schools of the city of Charlottesville are organized on the prevailing 7 â 4 plan of the State of Virginia and afford an accessible working laboratory which reflects the actual working conditions in high schools of the State. The school system of Albemarle County is now organized on the county unit basis. It consists of the following schools for white pupils: seven accredited four-year high schools, four junior high schools, five four-room schools, four three-room schools, fourteen two-room schools and twenty-one one-room schools. A number of the small schools are recognized by the State Department of Education as standard in their respective grades. The supervision of the county schools is under the direction of the county superintendent and three full time supervisors. Arrangements have been made with the Superintendent and School Board of the City of Charlottesville for members of the Faculty of the Department of Education to direct such studies in the fields of Educational Psychology, Secondary Education and School Administration as shall be requested by the Superintendent of City Schools. The school system of the city of Winchester is open for observation, research and experiment by students of the Department of Education. This school system is divided into four departments: Primary, consisting of kindergarten and Grades 1, 2 and 3; Elementary, consisting of Grades 4, 5 and 6; Junior High School, consisting of Grades 7, 8 and 9; and Senior High School consisting of Grades 10, 11 and 12. Each department is in charge of a supervisor who gives all of his or her time to supervision. The new school plant in Winchester, opened in 1923, provides many features in addition to the regular classrooms. For the elementary school division there will be a covered play court with fresh air ventilation for year-round use; a nature study court; outdoor classrooms for convalescent and anemic children; and facilities for hot lunch provided in the high school cafeteria. In the junior and senior high school division, besides the regular classrooms equipped with movable desks, there will be a business department with special equipment; science laboratories and science lecture rooms; sewing and cooking laboratories with special equipment; art studios; music studios; industrial shops for woodworking, metal working, electrical working and agriculture; library study and reference room; gymnasium and swimming pool; teachers' work room and library. For recreation and community service there will be provided an art gallery exhibit and history museum, auditorium seating twelve hundred, an athletic stadium, tennis courts, golf course, arboretum, and public park. These arrangements give to students in the Department of Education an excellent opportunity to study the problems of school organization and administration. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters or an equivalent time at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. On account of the increasing demand for graduate work in the Summer Quarter, the number of graduate courses will be enlarged in 1928. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 18th and ends July 28th. Second Term begins July 30th and ends August 31st. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, August 31st, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors Manahan, Windes, Smithey, Metcalf and Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments (J. L. Manahan, Director), University, Virginia. PHI DELTA KAPPA FRATERNITY A chapter of the national honorary educational fraternity of Phi Delta Kappa has been organized in connection with the Department of Education. Under the constitution of the fraternity, only those students are eligible to membership who expect to make teaching or administration of schools a permanent vocation, and who give evidence of superior qualities of character, scholarship and initiative. The standards of scholarship governing election to membership in the fraternity are similar to those prescribed for election to Phi Beta Kappa. The purpose of the fraternity as stated in its constitution is "to develop among the students of Education at the University of Virginia the spirit of `Research, Service and Leadership,' " and to endeavor by every worthy means at its command to create and foster fellowship and true fraternalism among the members of the society. EDUCATION CLUB An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts toward placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. SCHOLARSHIPS The Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships in the Department of Education and the College: fifty scholarships annually, each with a value of $100. Founded in 1918 by action of the General Assembly of Virginia. The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given at page 142. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia. EXPENSES The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $370 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States, $545 and upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found on page 136.</field>

He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but he must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. As the table of Entrance Requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. This course provides for Trigonometry, Solid Geometry and College Algebra in the three terms of the regular session, with the other work as outlined for the regular student, and in addition, in the two terms of the Summer School, Analytical and CoÃ¶rdinate Geometry are taken. Such a program will prepare the student for entrance with Sophomore standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester-hours) of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Sophomore year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credit on courses previously passed, except upon the explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class the student majoring in Chemical Engineering begins his specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year. On entering the Junior year each student elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year pre-supposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. The new five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION The Subjects of Instruction in Engineering are grouped into classes, each designated by a distinctive number for each term, the lecture and laboratory courses being likewise differentiated. This grouping follows the arrangement shown below: Humanities 1 to 99 Mathematics 100 to 199 Physics 200 to 299 Chemistry 300 to 399 Geology 400 to 499 Applied Mathematics 500 to 599 Experimental Engineering 600 to 699 Civil Engineering including Field-work 700 to 799 Mechanical Engineering including Shop-work 800 to 899 Electrical Engineering 900 to 999 Lecture courses are listed in the first fifty numbers of all classes; laboratory or practice courses are listed in the second fifty numbers of all classes.

Advanced Courses: A number of advanced courses in Chemistry, not listed above, are given and complete details are shown in the catalogue of the College. When time permits, students in Chemical Engineering, who are properly prepared, may take such of these courses as are approved by the Faculty of Engineering. Seminars will be offered in the different branches of Chemistry to students applying for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The courses will be offered only as occasion demands, and the subjects treated will vary. These courses will be designated as "D" courses, but owing to the flexibility which it is desired to secure in the subject matter, no definite statement of them will be made except that special phases of Physical, Inorganic, and Analytical Chemistry will be treated, including such subjects as radio-chemistry, the chemistry of the rare elements, colloid and surface chemistry, etc. Research work looking toward a thesis will accompany these courses.

Engineering (x-801-x) Engineering (526-715-800) Physical Chemistry (303-304-305) Mathematics (111-x-x) The examination days for the various classes are fixed by the hour of regular lecture period. The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the first or last columns, for the corresponding lecture hours in the middle column. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. Examination days change each term. A change in lecture for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 60 $ 50 Tuition 165 120 Laboratory Fees (average) 35 35 Living Expenses (for nine months) 400 400 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $750 $695 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $110 and all other Virginia students $60 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, Engineering Laboratories, and Shop-work is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing and written examination are combined for the term grade in such proportions as the several professors may determine. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. Any engineering student who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 9 term-hours will be placed on probation for the following term, probation to continue until at least 9 term-hours are passed in one term. No engineering student shall remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire engineering course. If probation is imposed a fourth time the student shall be suspended. 10. Any engineering student on probation who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Any engineering student who passes less than 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Suspension during a session continues for the remainder of the regular session. Suspension imposed at the end of a session holds for the whole of a subsequent session, except that such suspension may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. No engineering student suspended for a second time shall re-enter the department. 11. The Dean's List.âA student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's List. A student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, but who does not average 82 per cent, and who, in any subsequent term, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all 18 term-hours of not less than 82 per cent will be placed on the Dean's List. A student will be automatically dropped from the Dean's List, if, in any term, he does not pass on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent. A student dropped from the Dean's List will be again placed on it if he meets the above mentioned standard for a term. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. Students on the Dean's list must attend all laboratory classes and must perform all written problem work and take all written quizzes under the same conditions as all other students. DRAFTING ROOMS The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper layout of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. A vertical blue-printing machine with arc lamp, complete with trays, has recently been procured and installed. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS The Machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on. The wood shop is furnished with five small lathes, a large pattern-maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern-making, six cabinetmaker's benches, and an ample supply of hand tools. EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES Road Materials Laboratory.âThe apparatus for tests of non-bituminous road materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler.

Among this may be mentioned indicators, thermometers, gauges, planimeters, with standards for their correction and calibration; two types of Orsat apparatus; separating and throttling calorimeters, etc. FIELD WORK IN CIVIL ENGINEERING The outfit of field instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; a Gurley mining transit, one of the finest products of the instrument maker's art; a complete Gurley transit, graduated to 30 seconds, with solar attachment; hand-levels and clinometers for field topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. Substantial additions of machines, measuring instruments, control apparatus, and auxiliaries are being made regularly in order to keep the equipment in the best order for laboratory work. In addition to a supply from the University Power Plant the laboratory is furnished from the Virginia Public Service Company through a synchronous motor driving an alternator and three-wire direct current generator, with two exciters, all on a common shaft. A complete three-panel switchboard for the control of this set is equipped with full sets of instruments and controls including a voltage regulator for the alternating current generator. The entire laboratory wiring has been renewed and the floors have been treated to eliminate dust. Universal plug and receptacle-connections facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. For the machine testing there are available two direct-current motor generator sets with automatic push-button start and stop control complete, several direct current motors and generators, series, shunt and compound; steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternator with exciter and control switchboard; experimental test set for alternating current single or polyphase generator operation or induction motor testing; a second test set with modern switchboard control panel and driving motor with automatic start, stop, and reverse equipment; single-phase repulsion-induction motor; two-and three-phase induction motors; double-current generator; several pairs of constant potential transformers; current transformer for constant current service; mercury are rectifier set; Prony brakes for all motors; variable resistances; variable inductances and capacities; meters for measuring frequency, power factor, and indicators of synchronism and grounded circuits. A complete three-element oscillograph set with all accessories is available. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, Macbeth illuminometer, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. BUILDINGS The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are an office, a small drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the students' lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during recent years. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities for Freshman and Sophomore Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Shops are now temporarily housed in the Garage erected for the Motor Truck Training Detachment during the World War. This building gives a floor space of some 5,000 square feet and has allowed the rearrangement of wood and machine shop equipment for group drive by four electric motors. Space is also available in this structure for use in connection with the course in automobile construction and testing. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed near Peabody Hall in one of the Barracks taken from the Training Camp site and rebuilt and fitted for drawing. The building accommodates about 180 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. It contains the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horsepower. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. In addition to the University plants there are available by courtesy of the owners for purposes of inspection, study and tests such plants as the turbine station and railway and power substation of the Virginia Public Service Company, the water turbines and oil engine plant of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, and plants of the local ice companies and cold storage. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.</field>

Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-1895, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âThe Law School is accommodated in its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. There are on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Law Library.âThe Library contains more than twenty thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from income from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, and bound volumes of law magazines. Practically all the current legal periodicals are received. Law students have the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes. The Library is the beneficiary of three special endowments; one of $10,000, the gift of William W. Fuller, Esq. ('78); another of $10,000, the gift of Farrell Dabney Minor, Esq. ('83) and Mrs. Minor, in memory of their son, the late Lieutenant Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. ('11), who died in France (1918), from wounds received in battle; and one of $5,100, the gift of the Coolidge Family of Boston as a memorial to their distinguished ancestor, Thomas Jefferson. In 1922 the late Judge George Moffett Harrison (LL.B. 1870) judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia from 1895 to 1917, and president of the Court from 1916 to 1917, presented his entire well selected law library of several hundred volumes to the Law School; and the Honorable John Bassett Moore (1880), Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, is the donor of an especially fine collection of books on International Law, designated as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law, which is regularly receiving additions through the generosity of Judge Moore. In 1926, the Library was further augmented by the receipt of the extensive and well chosen law library of the late Judge George Curle Webb (LL.B. 1890), of Lexington, Kentucky, donated to the University by his widow, Mrs. Eleanor Graves Webb. In memory of the late Professor Raleigh Colston Minor the alumni and active members of Minor Inn of Phi Delta Phi have made a gift to the University for the establishment and maintenance of a section of the Law Library, on Legal Ethics and Legal History. Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of the Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from November to June inclusive. The Review is now in its fourteenth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. The Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools; is registered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York as meeting the requirements of the Court of Appeals regulating admission to the bar in that State; and is rated Class "A" by the Council on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, of the American Bar Association. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Students are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not as yet exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued in a standard college courses leading to a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least thirty session-hours.1. 1. Up to and including the session of 1926-'27, students offering 27 session hours were admitted on condition. This relaxation will be no longer in force after the session of 1926-'27. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Notice is given that two important changes in the requirements for admission are in contemplation, of which changes pre-law students should be forewarned. First: The exclusion, as subjects acceptable for admission to the Law School, of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education, Physical Training, Military Training, and Public Speaking. Second: The definite requirement, for admission to the Law School, of most of the following subjects, which are now recommended as desirable pre-law courses: English, Latin, French or Spanish, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Government, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Logic and Ethics. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session of 1920-21, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission are the same as in the case of male applicants. The High School Subjects for Admission to the College, and their values in units are indicated in the General Catalogue of the University, in connection with that department. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the work was done. Such certificate of College work must indicate the courses completed, the grades received, the time devoted to each course, and the credit, in session or semester hours, at which each such course is valued toward a baccalaureate degree. 2. Special Students.âA limited number of applicants who are at least 23 years old and who present proper evidence of good character and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as special students, and not as candidates for the degree.2. 2. The limitation of the number of special students conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association. Every applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean of the Law School not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent. of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. Admission with Credits.âNo advanced standing, or other credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence, and pursue all required courses in the curriculum, and pass the regular examinations therein.3. 3. After considerable experimentation with the prevailing custom of giving credit for work done in other law schools, this rule was adopted in 1904. From the beginning the practical results were so satisfactory that it has become a firmly established policy of the Law School. The rule does not rest on an assumed superiority of curriculum or methods, but on the practical impossibility of dovetailing the parts of two differently arranged curricula. It also avoids certain evils usually accompanying the advanced standing privilege. For an account of the origin of the privilege of advanced standing, and the undesirable results, reference is made to Bulletin Number Fifteen (1921 p. 168) of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, from which the following quotation is taken: "This is the origin of the `advanced standing' privilege almost universal in our law schools today, the abuse of which has done much to demoralize legal education. The suggestion sometimes made, that it is inherently advantageous for American law students to travel from one law school to another on the model of German University students, is not worth a moment's consideration. Each of our schools organizes in its own way its sequence of small courses and the relative weight attached thereto; it is a sheer loss to the student to be obliged to fit two fragmentary curricula together, even when he is acting in good faith. Notoriously, moreover, the bulk of advanced standing students are the `lame ducks' who hope to slide through the more difficult courses in the general confusion that results. Unless proper precautions are taken the professional college athlete is helped to ply his trade by this privilege. . . ." In the discretion of the Dean and of the professors in charge, an exception to the foregoing regulation may be made in the courses in Public Speaking and International Law, where these courses have been completed in an approved institution of collegiate rank before entrance into the Law Schoolâprovided credit for such courses has not already been utilized as a necessary credit on entrance requirements. GENERAL INFORMATION The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 21; the second, March 21; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No student may register for the work of the first term after October 15, nor for that of the second term after January 10ânor is registration in absentia permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those of the first year, should enter at the beginning of the session. Where this is impossible students may register at the beginning of the second term, but not later, save in exceptional cases. In case of such late entrance the student's chief handicap (often a serious one) will be lack of familiarity with preceding courses, on some of which his own work may be based. Entrance at the beginning of the later term, therefore, is not advised, but only permitted. Where the student has thus entered in a later term, he may not make up the work of the earlier term except by returning for such portion of a fourth year as is covered by the term omitted. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $500 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $600 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee for residents of Virginia is $175; for non-residents, $195. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is sought to be made as thorough as possible, and is given mainly through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in many of the courses by the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for practically a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses in teaching the student to work out for himself the principles involved, and in illustrating the practical application of legal rules. The present organization of the Law School gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the casebook is now used more extensively than heretoforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbooks and lectures. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses, in Draughting, in Forensic Debating, and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by lectures and demonstrations three times a week during the first term of the first year, accompanied by the assignment of practical work in the library, on which numerous oral and written tests are held; and in the third year briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be Virginia Pleading or Code Pleading. SCHOLARSHIPS The Louis Bennett Scholarship in the Department of Law, with a yearly income of two hundred and fifty dollars. Founded in 1920 by Mrs. Sallie Maxwell Bennett in memory of her husband, Hon. Louis Bennett, '71, of Weston, W. Va. The holder must be a deserving young man, preference being given to students from West Virginia. In case there are no applicants from West Virginia the award is to be made to a student from Virginia. Appointment will be made upon the recommendation of the Dean of the Department of Law. The Virginia Law Review Scholarship in the Department of Law, with an income of two hundred dollars. Founded in 1914. Annually awarded to the Editor-in-Chief of the Virginia Law Review. The William E. Homes Scholarship in the Department of Law, with a yearly income of sixty dollars. Founded in 1920 upon the bequest of Peter P. Homes, '13, in honor of his father, Judge William E. Homes, '69, of Boydton, Virginia. Annually awarded to the Notes Editor of the Virginia Law Review. The Daniel Harmon Scholarship in the Department of Law; emolument, the remission of the tuition and university fees. Founded in 1912 "in consideration of the distinguished service rendered by Daniel Harmon, '82, as a member of the Board of Visitors." The holder must be "a young Virginian of ability, character, and need." The Charles Minor Blackford Prize in the Department of Law was established through the liberality of the late Mrs. Susan Colston Blackford, of Lynchburg, Va., in memory of her husband, the late Charles Minor Blackford, a distinguished alumnus of the Law School. The prize consists of fifty dollars in cash, and is awarded each year to a student in the Department of Law for the best essay on some legal or sociological subject. General Scholarships.âThere are other scholarships applicable to all departments. These are described in the General University Catalogue. Special inquiries with reference to these scholarships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE FOUNDATION This Foundation was established in 1922 by a gift of $10,000 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons, of the late William H. White, a distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the University Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, who is specially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; and that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. The lectures under the William H. White Foundation were inaugurated during the session of 1923-24 by Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School, upon the subject of "Codification." OUTLINE OF COURSES The schedule, as outlined below, contemplates an average of fifteen lecture periods (of one hour each) per week. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term, except that the third term examinations in the courses of the third year are held one week earlier.

Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a proper certificate indicating that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance (1) at the office of the Dean of the Law School and (2) at the office of the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails without good cause, to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and one-thirty p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Carrying over Uncompleted Work.âStudents who are seriously deficient in the work of one year will be re-admitted on probation; and where the Law Faculty deems the deficiency serious enough the student must repeat the lectures in the courses in which he is deficient. No optional attendance is permissible in such cases, and only such a limited amount of new work may be taken as will not conflict with the previously incomplete work. 6. Probation.âStudents on probation are not entitled to leaves of absence except for imperative cause, nor are they permitted to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University. 7. Conditions of Readmission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 325 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session, with the privilege of returning, on conditions, the next session thereafter. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 8. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 9. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per cent. on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation will be required. 10. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 295. 11. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than thirteen periods per week. 12. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject but has failed on the examination, may, with the approval of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. Re-examinations are granted only in this form, or in that designated in Regulation 20, infra. 13. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 14. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 15. Dean's Privileged List.âAn average examination grade of ninety per cent. for the first two years will entitle the student to a place on the "Dean's List," which carries with it special privileges with respect to absences from lectures. The privilege will not exempt students from any required practical work, or review quizzes, and is subject to the control of the professors in charge of Forensic Debating and Draughting. The Dean may revoke the privilege if abused. 16. Extra-Curriculum ActivitiesâReports to the Dean.âStudents of the Law School who propose to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University, or who propose to devote a material portion of their time to work outside the Law School, are required to report their names and proposed activities at the Dean's office for official approval. In no case will such approval be given to a student on probation. See Regulation 6 foregoing. 17. Absence from the University is permitted on the written leave of the Dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organization. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 18. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or other imperative cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 19. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 20. Third Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âA candidate for the degree who in his third year is found deficient in one or more subjects, may return the following session and, without further attendance upon lectures, stand the regular examinations on such of his uncompleted subjects as the Dean and the professor or professors in charge may approve. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. In exceptional cases and for good cause this privilege may be extended to the student of any year. See Regulation 12. 21. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 22. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 23. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 24. Honor System.âAll quizzes and examinations are conducted under the Honor System.</field>

For other information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The session of 1928-1929 opens on September 13. The registration days are September 13-15. A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent, and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS The following are the minimum high school requirements of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges and must be satisfied for admission to all Class A medical schools. Students entering the College of the University of Virginia for their premedical college work must also satisfy the regular entrance requirements for admission to the college. (See General Catalogue.) These differ from the requirements stated below only in that 2Â½ units of mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra and 1 in Plane Geometry) are required. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least fifteen units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credits for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least eleven units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (Three units required) Literature and Composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (Two units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (Two units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (One unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, freehand and mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, Musicâappreciation or harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. PREMEDICAL COLLEGE COURSE The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than thirty session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking thirty-three or thirty-six session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least thirty session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course. Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in general physics is a six session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and six hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is four session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he is registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGIATE SUBJECTS (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. Four session-hours are required, including two session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in qualitative analysis may be counted as general inorganic chemistry. It is desirable that more time than this be given to general chemistry and especially that either the elements of physical chemistry be included in a 6 session-hour course in this subject or a supplementary course in elementary physical chemistry be taken. Students are also advised when their premedical work extends over more than two sessions to take at least four session-hours of qualitative analysis and two session-hours of quantitative analysis. (b) Organic Chemistry. Three session-hours are required of which at least one must be laboratory work. Four session-hours including two session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in organic chemistry. (c) Physics. Four session-hours required, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in trigonometry and solid geometry. (d) Biology. Four session-hours required, of which two must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of four session-hours in general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany, but not by botany alone. Courses in physiology and hygiene, sanitation, bacteriology, histology, and other similar work covered in the medical curriculum cannot be accepted as part of the premedical college requirements in biology. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects. Of the thirty session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least nine, including three session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biologic sciences. Although not required for admission to the medical school, premedical students are strongly urged to acquire the basic knowledge of French or Germanâand preferably of both French and Germanâwhich will enable them with a little practice to read with ease the medical literature published in these languages. Apart from the cultural value of the study of a foreign language and the use which may be found for French and German in the study of medicine, a reading knowledge of one or both of these languages is required for certain desirable post-graduate scholarships and fellowships. When the student presents for admission to the premedical college course 2 units of high school work in either language, the usual 3 session-hour "second year" college course will amply give this basic knowledge. When he begins the study of the language in college, he should take at least 4, and preferably 5, session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Training and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the thirty session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least three session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this university are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, mathematics (solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and advanced algebra), biology, and general inorganic chemistry the first year; and organic chemistry, physics, foreign language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics and general inorganic chemistry must precede organic chemistry. Those who have to take four or more session-hours of college work in foreign language may find it advisable to take foreign language both years and take the mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. The Committee on Advanced Standing will not in general consider favorably applications which are not accompanied by a distinctly good record in the school previously attended. Only in case of illness or equivalent cause will it admit a student to a year in which he has failed elsewhere and then only when, in the judgment of his previous instructors, he would have succeeded but for his illness. Whenever a student is admitted to advanced standing he must take and pass the full work of the class to which he is admitted unless by permission of the Dean he substitutes for one or more of the regular courses of his class other courses of approximately the same credit value. Students are not received with advanced standing to the fourth year class. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to sixty-five. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 13, 1928). Any applicant whose record has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the class to which he seeks admittance, may at any time after June 25 and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. By the deposit, under similar conditions, of the entire fees for the year a student may have a place reserved for him until 5 p. m. of the last day of registration. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION There are well-equipped laboratories for the study of biochemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year to the study of disease in living persons. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 5,800 cases. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Journal Club reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. Registrar's Records of Student's Work.âThe results of the work of each student are recorded in the Registrar's office in such manner as to show (1) the grade received on each course, (2) whether the student has or has not absolved the course and, if not, what is necessary to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects, and (3) a valuation in "honor points" of the results of the work for each session. 1. The grade received on each course. These grades with their percentage equivalents are as follows: 1 + = 95-100 per cent 1 = 90- 94 per cent 2 = 85- 89 per cent 3 = 80- 84 per cent 4 = 70- 79 per cent 5 = below 70 per cent The passing grade is 3. A grade of 4 entitles the student to a condition, as explained below. A grade of 5 means a failure for the course. No passing grades are reported to the Registrar's office on didactic work unless the laboratory or clinical part of the course is completed in a satisfactory manner; nor are any grades reported when the student is deficient until the deficiency has been made up. 2. Whether the student has or has not absolved the course, and, if not, what is required to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects. This is indicated in the following terms: Passed (P) indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned (C) means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient (D) indicates that part of the required laboratory or clinical work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed;" otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed (F) indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or equivalent cause gives a record of conditioned: if not excused, a record of failed. 3. A valuation of the general results of the work on each course and of the student's work for the entire session. Honor points. This is expressed in honor points. Each course is valued in the usual manner in terms of session-hours. An honor point (or simply a point) may be defined as the honor value of one-half session-hour of a course on which a grade of 2 has been received; the honor value becomes 2 for each half session-hour of a course on which 1 has been received and 2Â½ for each half session-hour on which a grade of 1+ has been received. Thus for each session-hour of a complete course: A grade of 3 gives no honor points. A grade of 2 gives 2 honor points. A grade of 1 gives 4 honor points. A grade of 1 + gives 5 honor points. A grade of 4 subtracts 2 honor points. A grade of 5 substracts 4 honor points. No honor points are given on a course on which a condition or failure has been received at the time of the final examination on the course; except that, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the results of re-examination or of repetition of the courseâinstead of the record on the completion of the courseâmay be made the basis of estimating honor points. Students who receive on the entire curriculum of any one year of medical study, or its equivalent, a total of 40 honor points have optional attendance on all the didactic work of the next session. * * The regulations governing advancement and registration are being modified, and in revised form will be in force for the session, 1927-1928. Special Regulations governing Advancement and Registration. Save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the contrary, the following records at the close of the regular session in June require withdrawal from the Medical School. For first year students: 1. Failure in two subjects. 2. Failure in one subject and Conditions in two subjects. 3. Conditions in four subjects. For second and third year students: 1. Failure in one subject and Condition in one subject. 2. Conditions in three subjects. Save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the contrary a clear record on all first and second year subjects at the time of registration is required for admission to the work of the third year. The clause in the above rules, "save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the Contrary" refers solely to "illness or equivalent cause." It does not refer to the necessity for summer occupation or to any other than the most weighty reasons for excuse from the operations of these rules. Generally the Faculty will take the initiative in allowing exceptions to these rules. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to an official statement under the seal of the University, showing all courses for which the student was registered each year as a medical student and the record (see above under "Regulations") with the grade received on each course for which he was registered. These statements will also contain any special faculty votes affecting the student's registration in this school. In no case will the University give an official certificate of the completion of a part of a course. The professor in charge may, at his discretion, make a personal statement by letter to the head of the same department in another medical school of the work done by the student in his course; but he must at the same time clearly state that this letter does not give credit in this medical school. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are required to take examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examinations agree to the change of date. For a special or condition examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student; one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical work in which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; in no case will the two grades be averaged. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work nor will any record be given on practical work until a clear record is obtained on didactic work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1928-1929 begin September 10 and close September 15. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean.

Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Sciences at the end of the year. For further information, see the General Catalogue of the University. The University offers also the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This degree has recently been placed in charge of the Medical Faculty. It is awarded on the recommendation of the Medical Faculty after the completion of the second year of the medical curriculum to students who (1) present 33 session-hours of acceptable work in premedical academic subjects (whether taken in this university or elsewhere) as specified below: (2) complete the first two years of the medical course in this University with grades in general higher than the lowest passing grade; and (3) demonstrate by examination a reading knowledge of medical French and German. (1) Premedical Academic Subjects.âThese must include: One year of College English 3 session-hours College Algebra, Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry 3 session-hours Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 24 session-hours With minimum requirements in each subject as follows: (a) General Chemistry (including in this term analytical or physical chemistry) 6 session-hours (b) Organic Chemistry 4 session-hours (c) General Physics 4 session-hours (d) Biological Science 6 session-hours Elective in subjects other than physics, chemistry and biology 3 session-hours (2) First two years of the Medical Curriculum, completed with a record of 30 honor points on first year subjects and 40 honor points on second year subjects. (3) Reading knowledge of Medical French and German.âThis will be tested by examination consisting of the translation of passages from textbooks of Anatomy and Histology, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pathology. No specific college work is required although the equivalent of 3 session-hour college courses in each of these languages is desirable and may be offered as part of the premedical credits. The vocabulary of medical French and German may best be acquired by using foreign text-books, etc., in the above medical sciences as parallel reading, or as summer reading after the completion of the above subjects in the regular medical course. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. One appointment was made in September 1927; another will be made in September 1929. Applications must be made not later than July 1 of the year of appointment. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Richard Whitehead Scholarships, founded by an anonymous donor in memory of Dr. Richard Henry Whitehead, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine, 1905-1916, are awarded to young men of promise who contemplate entering upon lines of medical work which will advance medical knowledge either pure or applied. They are usually awarded only to students who have completed at least two years of the medical curriculum. There are three of these scholarships. One appointment was made for the session 1927-1928, another will be made for the session 1928-1929. For further information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Seven Society Alumni Medical Scholarship, established in 1926 by the Alumni of the Seven Society with an annual emolument of $350.00, is awarded to a student in the Department of Medicine upon nomination by the Dean of the Department of Medicine. Other Scholarships and Fellowships open to medical students in common with students in other departments of the University are: The Valentine Birely Scholarship; the Thompson Brown Scholarship; the Isaac Cary Scholarship; the William C. Folkes Scholarships; the Bennett Wood Green Scholarships; the McCormick Scholarship; the Pi Kappa Alpha Scholarship; the Thomas Fortune Ryan Scholarships; the Virginia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy Scholarship; and the John Y. Mason Fellowship. Loan funds also are available. For full information regarding scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds, see the General Catalogue of the University. The John Horsley Memorial Prize in Medicine with the emolument of $1,000. Founded in 1925 by Dr. J. Shelton Horsley, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to his father, Mr. John Horsley, of Nelson County, Virginia. The prize will be awarded every two years by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia for the best thesis upon some subject in general surgery. The term "general surgery" is used in a broad way and includes the specialties commonly associated with general surgery such as orthopedic surgery, urology and gynecology but not the specialties of the surgery of the eye, ear, nose and throat. The prize is open to all graduates of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia of not more than fifteen years standing. The award for the first time was made at the final exercises in June, 1927, to Charles Bruce Morton, M.D. of the class of 1922. For further information address the Dean of the Medical Department, University, Va. The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919 a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. Since publication of the catalogue of 1927-1928 the following have been elected to membership: from the class of 1927, Edward Franklin Bland, B.S., Raymond Alfred Gandy, B.S., Andrew DeJarnette Hart, Jr., Katharine Fox Woodward, B.A.; from the class of 1928, James Robert Adams, Joel Wilson Baker, John Alfred Calhoun, Jr., B.A., William Riely Jordan, B.S. and Robert Leonard King. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR Anatomy 1.âTwenty-four hours weekly during the first term and twelve hours weekly during the second term.

Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offers many of the opportunities that an interneship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology, urology and orthopedics the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Voshell, Dr. Morton, Dr. Meade and Dr. Rollins. Orthopedics.âOne hour weekly throughout one-half the year for ward rounds. Dr. Voshell.

Obstetrics and Gynecology.âIn small groups throughout the year instruction is given in the practical observation of, and participation in, the care of the pregnant and parturient woman, in the Hospital wards and labor room. Ward rounds, and mannequin demonstrations and practice by the individual student. Dr. Calkins and Associates. Entire class throughout the year, one hour weekly. Case analysis, and discussion of special problems complete the training in these subjects. Dr. Calkins and Associates. Pediatrics.âStudents are instructed in the wards of the hospital twice a week in ward rounds. In addition all students serve as clinical clerks and have cases assigned to them for their personal care under the direction of the professor or instructor. Frequent clinics are held in the mountains, the students of the fourth year class being used as assistants in this work. Students are also required to go into the milk laboratory and acquire a knowledge of the preparation of formulae by practical experience. Dr. Royster and Dr. W. W. Waddell. Medical Jurisprudence.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. The application of medical knowledge and skill to the needs of the law is presented. References to literature are assigned for the fuller development of special topics. Dr. J. A. Waddell. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly during the first two terms, supplemented by regular two- to three-hour clinics three times a week throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Woodward. Hygiene and Preventive Medicine.âTwo hours weekly throughout the session. The course begins with a consideration of the main facts of hygiene as they bear on the practice of medicine. It then proceeds to the consideration of the natural history of contagious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Young. SUMMARY OF SCHEDULED HOURS OF INSTRUCTION (Exclusive of examination periods) 1.

Pharmacists. The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time five additional units including a service building. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The four pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 250 beds; of these, approximately 200 are available and used for clinical teaching. The north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designated series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the hospital. The recently opened south pavilion, made possible through the generosity of Paul Goodloe McIntire, houses the departments of obstetrics, pediatrics and orthopedics. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness.

Clinics are held six times a week for general medical, pediatric, surgical, gynecological, obstetrical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and five times weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service, and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student, under the supervision of an instructor, are a part of the organization of this department. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, lies within easy reach of the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director of the Sanatorium teaches phthisiotherapy in the Medical School, and the 270 beds of the Sanatorium afford excellent clinical material for first hand, practical experience for internes, medical students and nurses of the University Medical School. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course of the Medical School. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>

SUMMARY OF ATTENDANCE 1927 From Virginia 1992 From other states and countries 779 Total 2771 Less Duplicates 601 Net enrollment 2170 Number of University of Virginia students regular session 358 ANNOUNCEMENTS The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 18th and will close July 28th, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin July 30th, and will close September 1st, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take each term, is three courses aggregating three session-hours. A student may take four session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating fifteen session-hours or (b) is in his graduating year and needs four session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Dean of the Summer Quarter and all of the professors concerned. Physical training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. FEES For Non-Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 and a tuition fee of $20.00 for each term will be charged each undergraduate non-Virginia student. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue, except a few special courses which are so designated. For Virginia Students.âStudents from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged a tuition fee of $15.00. Tuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses leading to the professional certificates. To meet local expenses, the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $10.00 for a six weeks' term for all the summer schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, but not necessarily for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small extra fees are charged in laboratory courses. However, Virginia teachers will be charged an extra fee of $5.00 for each graduate course taken. EXPENSES Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 a week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $10.00 a week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the university grounds. The University Commons conducts a first-class cafeteria at which meals may be obtained at very low rates. The average cost per month for three meals a day last year was approximately $23.50. Two hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the university dormitories will be reserved for women in the order of application upon the following terms: For the term, $6.00 for each person, two persons assigned to each room. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied by the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason, and room released if application is made before June 8th. No refund is made after this date unless the room is re-rented. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. A dormitory room must be occupied by the person who applies for it, as there will be no transfers in the dormitory rooms this year. Please be sure of the room you desire when writing for accommodations. SUMMARY OF COURSES OFFERED The courses offered in the Summer Quarter of 1927 are listed under their respective subjects in the regular catalogue. They will, with slight changes, be repeated in the session of 1928. In addition to those so listed there were offered: 4 courses in Dramatic Art. 1 course in General Science, 5 courses in Industrial and Fine Arts, 3 courses in Library Economy, 2 courses in Household Economy, 29 courses in Music, 13 courses in Physical Education, 4 courses in Writing. A description of these courses may be found in the catalogue of the Summer Quarter. CREDITS AND DEGREES Degrees are conferred upon men and women for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published on page 219 are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters or an equivalent time at the University in order to meet the residence requirement. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified students in three Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. A larger number of graduate courses will be offered in the Summer Quarter of 1928 in order to meet the increased demand for graduate work. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. PRE-MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS Courses covering all the required subjects for entrance to the first year of the Medical School, as described on page 304 of this catalogue, are offered in the Summer Quarter so that it is possible for the student to meet the pre-medical requirements in two summer quarters and one regular session of the University. PRE-LAW REQUIREMENTS Courses are offered in the Summer Quarter covering all the required college work for admission to the Department of Law, see page 291 of this catalogue.</field>

Even before the term "university extension" came into popular use, the University was in numerous ways directing its thought and talents to the life of the state as a whole in addition to teaching its regular students. About 1915 conscious effort was made to coordinate these extra-mural activities and to establish within the institution an organization the purpose of which would be to make the University's resources more readily and effectively available to the life of the state. It was at this period that the Extension Division was established as an integral part of the University. In 1925 a full-time Director of the Extension Division was appointed. Since the establishment of the Extension Division, the University's conception of its function afield has enlarged and undergone modification. The University's present conception of its duties and responsibilities extramurally is due to its reflective thought on the problems no less than to the influence coming from sister institutions active in the field of Extension and to the reactions toward its activities carried on throughout the state. EXTENSION CLASSES Extension classes are courses of instruction corresponding closely with those regularly given in the University by members of the faculty, and conducted for the benefit of persons unable to follow courses in residence. The classes are under the administration, supervision and control of the University. Each course represents a definite amount of study corresponding to an equivalent amount of work done in residence at the University, and, when completed satisfactorily by persons meeting the entrance requirements of the University, receives the same degree of credit as if taken in residence. Extension classes will be organized upon application for them in as many centers as possible, if a sufficient number (a minimum of fifteen for each class) apply for them. Application for such courses should be made to the Director, University Extension Division, University, Virginia. A catalogue for 1927-1928 which also contains a report of Extension Courses for 1926-1927 is published for free distribution as Vol. XII, No. 2, University of Virginia Record, Extension Series. LECTURES AND SHORT COURSES Lectures of popular or technical nature or addresses for community and club meetings and other special occasions are furnished upon payment of a minimum charge. Speakers for commencement addresses are furnished to schools at a uniform charge of $15 to be applied toward the speaker's expenses. In 1926-1927, forty-two schools located in every section of the state were supplied with representatives of the University to deliver commencement addresses. The Extension Division offers a number of short courses or lecture conferences, with meetings on consecutive days or at weekly intervals, which are devoted to the study of some particular problem in which any group of persons may be interested. SCHOOL RELATIONS The Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League has been conducting interscholastic literary and athletic contests in Virginia schools since 1913. The operation and control of the League is now shared by the Extension Division, representatives elected by the schools in all sections of the state, and two supervisors of the State Board of Education. All public high schools of the state are eligible for membership in the League, while the private preparatory schools are invited to participate as a distinct class in some of the athletic and literary contests. In 1926-1927 by action of the Legislative Council of the League, membership dues were inaugurated and 162 public high schools of the state became membersâ9 in the Class A, or large city group; 37 in Class B, or intermediate city group; and 116 of the Class C, or county school group. In athletics, the program of contests includes football, basketball, baseball, tennis, and track; in literary work, debate, public speaking, public reading, essay, verse, short story, and publications. For determination of championships schools are classified according to size and divided into districts according to location. In 1926-1927, fourteen pennants and five banners were awarded to winners of district athletic titles; and forty-two bronze and silver trophies were awarded to schools whose representatives were successful in state and class literary and athletic championships. These trophies are awarded to the school and not to the individual representative, and must be won in two successive years for permanent ownership. A basketball tournament in the fall for county schools and a state track meet and tennis tournament and the final state literary contests in May bring together a large and select group of high school students. Local or intraschool competition is also sponsored. Through the co-operation of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, 234 gold, 225 silver and 94 bronze medals were awarded in the past year to pupils who achieved certain athletic standards or were winners in local literary activities. PUBLICATIONS For the purpose of disseminating information and carrying the results of study, research, and investigation of its faculty to as many people as possible, the Extension Division publishes twelve bulletins on various subjects each year. Most of the bulletins are issued free of charge, but for some a nominal price is set which covers only the cost of printing. The Extension Division also issues regularly a leaflet, "Extension Topics," which is chiefly a letter to Extension students serving as a bond between them and the University; and "Extension News" which is circulated widely as a medium of information about the classes, publications and activities of the Division. Special care is given to the task of placing the printed materials in the hands of those who most appreciate and profit by them. A leaflet published annually describes available Extension publications. CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION The services of the Bureau of Citizenship Education include the single lecture, the short course consisting of three to ten lectures in citizenship and government, citizenship institute, and the furnishing of information. The single lecture deals with citizenship in a general way unless some particular subject is requested. The short course begins with a general study of the mechanics of local, state, or national government and continues with their application to the life of the citizen. The institutes are arranged upon request in co-operation with the Virginia League of Women Voters or other state organizations. They deal with problems of a state-wide nature in the field of government and citizenship. Twenty-nine lecture trips were made in 1926-1927 and 2643 people attended the meetings. The cost of travel was borne by the organization requesting the lecture or course. In order to make the instructor's services available to all sections of the state alike, a flat charge of $10 will be made in 1927-1928 to each organization engaging her. Supplying answers to specific questions in the field of citizenship and government is a service of the bureau less conspicuous to report but no less important, inasmuch as it meets an immediate and pressing need of the individual. In addition to direct public services the instructor in charge compiles bulletins on phases of citizenship and government not only for the bureau but also for the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League when the subject of debate concerns government. Similarly the instructor compiles package libraries and bibliographies on governmental questions. PACKAGE LIBRARIES The function of this Bureau is to assemble information and reference material on subjects of current interest for the use of organizations or individuals requesting such data. The material is furnished at a nominal charge for postage and package. Clippings from a number of newspapers and magazines of general appeal are filed, and bulletins of national and state organizations collected. Especial attention is given to supplying the needs of members of the Virginia High School League for material on the subject of the state-wide debate. ART EXTENSION To create more general interest in Art and to facilitate a more universal application of artistic principles in the home and in the public life of the state, the Extension Division has established a Bureau of Art Extension. Thus far its offerings consist chiefly in the loan of exhibits of Medici Prints of famous paintings to schools, churches and other organizations throughout the state. The prints are arranged by schools and include reproductions from the Italian, Flemish, French, English, German and Spanish. Full descriptions of the exhibits together with the conditions governing their loan are given in Extension News, Volume IV, Number 13, a copy of which will be sent upon application to the University Extension Division. Although the exhibits were available for loan only during the spring of 1927, thirty-four exhibits went to sixteen communities in the state. According to reports from these communities, 3282 people visited the exhibits. Through the kindness of Mrs. Louise de l'Aigle Reese and the Southern Woman's Educational Alliance, the Division is permitted to announce for loan the Louise de l'Aigle Reese Collection of photographs and prints. This exhibit is under the direction of the Extension Division during 19271928 and 1928-1929. The exhibit contains photographs and prints of artistic buildings or works collected during Mrs. Reese's travels abroad. This collection should be of unusual value to teachers of Art. In addition to the Art exhibits there is now in process of preparation a series of bulletins treating in a popular manner the subject of the application of artistic principles in beautifying homes, schools, churches and other public buildings.</field>

B.S. Research Assistant in Economics Establishment.âThe announcement was made by President Alderman to the Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia during the commencement exercises in June, 1926, that the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial had made a grant of $137,500 to the University for research in the field of the social sciences: economics, government, sociology, history, psychology, philosophy and related subjects. The grant extends over a five year period, $27,500 becoming available each of the years from July 1, 1926 to July 1, 1931. The work under the provisions of the grant has been organized as an Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. The President of University, the Assistant to the President, the Dean of the Graduate Department, the members of the University faculty of professorial rank in the schools of History, Economics, Government, Jurisprudence, Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology and the employed personnel constitute the membership of the Institute. As outlined in the resolutions which were adopted by the Institute, "the duty of this Institute shall be to promote research effort, both individual and group, in the Social Sciences at the University of Virginiaâat the outset primarily in the field of Virginia problems. It shall further be the function of the Institute to consider any matter that concerns the development of the Social Sciences in the University of Virginia, making recommendations thereon to the President of the University." Social Science Building.âThe University of Virginia Institute for Research in the Social Sciences is housed in one of the original Jefferson buildings of the University formerly known as the Old Medical Building. The interior of the structure has been thoroughly repaired and put in excellent condition for the activities of the Institute. Provision is made for office space and equipment for the research workers, and also a general office has been set up where supplies and secretarial assistance are provided. Scope of Research Effort.âThe grant to the University of Virginia is being utilized at the outset primarily for research into a number of vital economic and social problems in the life of the State. It has chosen this field for two reasons. First because Virginia is in a changing period of its history, and needs full light on its problems to direct as wisely as possible the current of transition. And secondly, the University of Virginia realizes that it is a State University and desires to relate itself more and more intimately with the people and the life of the State in general, feeling that such a relationship will be mutually beneficial. However, the work of the Institute in its full development will not be limited to the field of Virginia problems but large provision will be made for scholarly research in the broader phases of social science research without respect to geographical boundaries. The research in the Institute is carried on as the professor's own research project assisted by well-trained research workers. The plan is to limit the number of problems to be studied, and to do these thoroughly, and in a way that will make the investigations of a practical immediate or ultimate value in the life of the State. A definite portion of the grant is being allotted for the publication of the studies when completed. Research Lectures.âIn addition to the research projects undertaken through the Institute, a series of lectures on the fundamental objectives and methods of research in each of the social sciences is being projected. Men of outstanding ability in their particular fields are secured. Two of these were given in 1926-27, and the remaining six are to be given in 192728 or soon thereafter. These lectures will be collected and published in a volume on "Objectives and Methods of Research in the Social Sciences" under the imprint of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.

      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED E. C. Carrington President E. S. Abernathy Vice-President W. Robert Martin Recording Secretary K. Brooke Anderson Active Secretary Mrs. Albert Edward Walker Hostess History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other state university in America. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:âto foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Through denominational clubs the organization seeks to relate the students to the churches of their choice and through voluntary service of its members materially assistsâand in some cases wholly mansâthe Sunday Schools and young people's societies of the churches in the community. In addition to this definite religious service in the community members of the Association work with Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Both religious and welfare activities are carried into the outlying districts under the supervision of the Extension Department of the Association; and free medical clinics which were originally established in these localities by the Association have increased in usefulness and importance through active cÃ¶-operation with the State and University medical staffs. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. In addition to these activities outside the University the Association, through its student Self-Help Committee, renders valuable aid to students seeking employment; and through receptions, entertainments, and "Open Houses" stimulates social intercourse among the students. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905 at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. In recent years Madison Hall has become the center of social and student activities of the University as well as of the religious; and offices in the building have been furnished gratis to the more prominent student publications and organizations. All the privileges including use of tennis courts, showers, reading room and library, rooms for meetings, services of the Hostess, * * Students desiring work should write immediately to Secretary, Employment Bureau, Madison Hall, stating qualifications, and kind of work desired. Employment Bureau, Information Bureau, handbook, student directory, etc., are open to any student without cost. About one-half of the budget for the support of the Association work and the maintenance of Madison Hall is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund, and a sum allocated by the University. As it is the student organization definitely devoted toward serving the religious, social and economic interests of the students, the remainder of the budget necessary for this work must come from the student body. A campaign is held in the fall for the remainder of the budget. At this time the opportunity of contributing to the service and upkeep of Madison Hall is given to each student. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the university grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. Services are conducted in it every Sunday evening during the regular session.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHYSICAL EDUCATION William Alexander Lambeth, M.D., Ph.D. Director of Physical Education Lawrence Theodore Ludwig, B.P.E. Associate Professor of Physical Education Paul Otto, B.S., M.P.E. Assistant Professor of Physical Education Robert Noble Hoskins, B.S. Instructor in Physical Education James Porter Baker, Jr., B.S. Instructor in Physical Education Eugene S. Groseclose Assistant Instructor in Physical Education Henry Haden Lannigan Instructor in Athletics The method of instruction pursued does not follow blindly any so-called system, but proper attention is given to all methods which in whole or in part have proved useful or effective. The importance of individual training is in every case recognized, especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue with safety or profit, general or concerted exercises. Students are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the director, and should take this examination at time of registration. The examination includes an accurate measurement of the student's physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs, and the strength of the principal muscular groups. Upon the basis of the facts thus ascertained, advice is given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances. The examination is repeated at intervals, note is taken of any improvement, and new exercises are suggested. In addition to individual work, daily instruction is given to classes in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure-running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubsâ adapted as nearly as possible to the needs of individuals of varying age and physical condition. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to others more complicated and difficult. During the winter months instruction in gymnastics which require great strength and agility is given to those who are fitted for it by previous training. The Memorial Gymnasium The Memorial Gymnasium was completed in 1924, and is situated between the athletic field and the university golf links, and offers facilities unsurpassed in any American university. The main exercise room is 180 by 96 feet, with a tenfoot running track gallery of twelve laps to the mile. There is also an auxiliary gymnasium 30 by 70 feet. The swimming pool is 30 by 75 feet, with a gallery for spectators. A general locker room provides for 1,700 full-length steel lockers, with two shower rooms. There are also spacious locker rooms and baths for home and visiting teams, as well as special rooms for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, and three hand-ball courts. The administration wing includes offices for the staff, examination rooms and a large lecture room. For the course in Physical Training with credit value for degrees, see page 201. ATHLETICS. The Athletic Park contains twenty acres, and includes two athletic fields, Lambeth Field and Lefevre Field. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained and fenced, for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about fifty thousand dollars, and involved the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A concrete stadium has been erected seating five thousand persons, and additional wooden stands provide seating space for four thousand. Intramural athletics are under the supervision of the Director of Physical Training and his staff. Intercollegiate Athletics are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to encourage this phase of physical exercise. The faculty exercises a general advisory control over all athletics, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise. The development of the general policies of the University in athletics is intrusted to the Athletic Councilâa body composed of three representatives of the student body, three representatives of the Alumni Association, three representatives of the General Faculty and the President of the University. The action of this body is subject to ratification by the General Faculty. The Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, composed of one of its student members, one of its alumni members, its three faculty members and the President of the University are responsible for the administration of any laws or regulations governing intercollegiate athletics whether originating from the Athletic Council, the faculty or from any Conference of which the University may be a member. The University of Virginia is a member of the Southern Conference. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS 1. The Athletic Council is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the university athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University, acting in his stead and by his request and with the approbation of the Director). 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University. 4. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 5. To be eligible for an intercollegiate athletic contest an applicant must be a bona fide student who is pursuing a course of at least ten hours of undergraduate work or a course of study certified by the proper faculty authority, and must not be on probation. (See page 215.) 6. Before any student can take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council and secure the endorsed approval of his application from the committee. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is eligible under Rule 5. 7. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, who shall appear before the committee and answer on his honor such questions as the committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, before it endorses an application, to require of the applicant a written pledge, certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the university teams. 10. It shall be the duty of the President of the General Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Graduate Manager, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 11. No coach or trainer of any athletic team shall be employed without the sanction of the Athletic Council. 12. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days' leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days' leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose, nor more than eight days' leave of absence during any one term. 13. Not more than four days' leave of absence from the University shall be given to those First-Year Athletic teams which are regularly organized by the General Athletic Association. 14. The football team is permitted to play games only on the home grounds of one of the contestants. 15. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any departmental faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team.</field>

Plays considered worthy of production will be staged by the Theatre Arts Guild of the University. Prerequisites. Only those students may enroll in this course who have had a personal interview with Mr. Pratt and have secured his approval of either a one act play or a scenario with several pages of dialogue to be submitted during the spring term prior to June 10th or between September 10th and 20th. No first year students admitted. Special students admitted under the usual regulations in the catalogue. All students must have taken or must take concurrently English B 2 or B 4 or B 5. (B. A. or B.

      <field name="fulltext">VIRGINIA PLAYERS H. R. Pratt, director and manager. Albert J. Barlow, secretary and treasurer. ADVISORY BOARD. President Edwin Anderson Alderman From the Faculty of the University: John Calvin Metcalf, James Southall Wilson, Atcheson Laughlin Hench, Francis Harris Abbot, William Harrison Faulkner, John Jennings Luck, Edmund Schureman Campbell, Walter Sheldon Rodman, James Cook Bardin. From the student body: Ted Dean, Beverley Middleton, E. A. Alderman, Jr. The Virginia Players is the University dramatic organization. It will be incorporated under the laws of the State of Virginia as a non-stock corporation; the trustees: President Alderman, professors Metcalf, Wilson, Faulkner, Rodman, Barlow, Pratt, and one member from the student body. Its purpose, as set down in the charter, is: "First, to promote and encourage a native dramatic art: Second, to serve as an experimental theatre for the production and publishing of original plays representative of the traditions and present day life of the people: Third, to stage revivals of classic and modern plays: Fourth, to extend its influence throughout the state." Besides those enrolled in the courses, members of the communityâ students, faculty and townspeopleâwill be invited to participate in the productions. Those who contribute their talents to any branch of the work will be elected to active membership in the Theatre Arts Guild. Others interested may become sustaining members by the payment of annual dues. All those attending the first performance of original plays will be asked to cooperate by sending in a written criticism of the plays presented. These criticisms should be constructively framed as they will be openly discussed in class. Mr. Pratt, Associate Professor of Music at the University, was engaged for ten years as musical director, actor and stage director of many leading American and English dramatic organizations. He played in support of John Drew at the Empire Theatre, New York in Pinero's "His House in Order" and the following season was one of the few Americans to be engaged for the first tour of the Ben Greet players in this country. He has played leading parts with the Coburn Players, Nance O'Neill, Robert B. Mantell and was leading man of several Stock Companies in New York and Boston. Mr. Pratt played in the original Broadway production of "The Three of Us" by Rachel Crothers and his last appearance on the professional stage was with Leo Dietrichstein in "The Concert" at the Belasco Theatre, New York. During the long run of this piece he assumed the roles of musician, actor and, as stage manager, received much valuable training through association with one of the greatest of all stage directors, David Belasco. Since coming to the University, Mr. Pratt has produced in Cabell Hall "The Merchant of Venice", "Twelfth Night" and several modern playsâand in 1925 and 1926 was director of the Little Theatre in Lynchburg, Virginia.</field>
