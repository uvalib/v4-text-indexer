      <field name="fulltext">CODE OF THE GENERAL ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE Whereas, there has been no general revision of the ordinances of the City of Charlottesville since 1909 and Whereas, it is deemed advisable by the City Council that the ordinances of the City of Charlottesville be amended and revised: THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Charlottesville that the following ordinances be now adopted by the City Council, and that the same shall be the Code of the City of Charlottesville, Va. CHAPTER I. The Council—Its Powers, Duties and Procedure. Sec. 1. The council—term and compensation. (a) The Council of the City of Charlottesville shall be composed of five members, to be elected at large from the qualified voters of the City as provided by Section 4 of the charter. Their term of office shall be four years, except that all elections to fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired terms. (b) Each member of the Council shall receive an annual salary of three hundred dollars ($300.00), except the president of said Council, who shall be Mayor and shall receive five hundred dollars ($500.00) per annum. Said salary shall be paid in equal monthly installments. Sec. 2. Oath of office—when taken. Each councilman shall, before entering upon the duties of his office, take the oath prescribed for councilmen by the laws of Virginia and qualify before the Corporation Court or the Judge thereof in vacation, a certificate of which shall be filed with the clerk of the Council who shall enter the same upon the journal thereof; but if any councilman shall fail to qualify as aforesaid, for ten days after the commencement of the term for which he was elected, his office shall be deemed vacant. Sec. 3. Time of meeting for organization. The Council shall meet for organization on the first day of September after their election (unless that day be Sunday or a legal holiday, in which case they shall meet on the following day), but in case of unavoidable absence from such meeting of any member elect it shall be competent to adjourn said meeting from time to time as they may deem proper. Sec. 4. Elections by council. At all elections by the Council the voting shall be viva voce, and each member shall be entitled to one vote. Only one person shall be elected at a time, except with the consent of all members present. If, on any vote, no one receives a majority of all the votes, the name of the person receiving the smallest number of votes shall be dropped, and shall not again be put in nomination until a vote intervenes. At each election the roll shall be called by the clerk in alphabetical order, and each member shall vote when his name is called, unless excused or disqualified by section 24, post. Sec. 5. Election of president—vice-president, duties of. The Council shall, at its first meeting in September after the regular biennial election of councilmen, or as soon thereafter as practicable, elect one of its members president, who shall continue in office two years. If a vacancy occur in the office before the end of the term, such vacancy shall be filled as provided by section 11. The president of the Council shall be the Mayor of the City, without veto power. At the same time the Council shall elect one of its members to be vice-president, who shall continue in office two years. If a vacancy occur in the office before the end of his term such vacancy shall be filled as provided by section 11. The president shall preside at the meetings of the Council, and when from any cause, he shall be absent the vice-president shall preside and in the absence of both a president pro tempore may be elected. The president, vice-president, or president pro tempore, who shall preside when the proceedings of the previous meeting are read shall sign the same. He may call any member to the chair, who shall exercise its functions for the time; and during such substitution he may participate in the debates. The vice-president in the absence of the president and while acting as president shall be vested with all the rights and duties of the president. The president or vice-president, as the case may be, shall be entitled to vote on all questions as any other member, but in no case shall he be entitled to a second vote on any question, though it be necessary to break a tie—that is to say, his office shall not entitle him to a vote. Sec. 6. Regular meetings—how special meetings may be called. The Council shall hold its regular meetings at the customary place for such meetings, or at such other place in the City as may be designated by the president of the Council, on the first and third Mondays of each month at such hour as may be agreed upon (unless such day be a legal holiday, in which event such meeting shall be held on the day following). The president of the Council or the vice-president, if acting in his stead, or any three members of the Council may call a special meeting of the Council at any time upon at least five hours written notice to each member, served personally or left at his usual place of business or residence. But special meetings may be held at any time without notice provided all members of the Council attend and unanimously consent to the transaction of all business transacted thereat. Sec. 7. Meetings—special—executive session. Every call for a special meeting shall specify the object thereof and no business shall be transacted at a special meeting except that for which it shall have been called, unless by a unanimous consent. The Council shall be open except when, by a recorded vote of two-thirds of those members present, it declares that the public welfare requires secrecy, in which case it shall go into executive session. Sec. 8. Quorum—reconsideration of votes. Three members of the Council shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of ordinary business, but no vote of a former meeting shall be reconsidered or rescinded at a special meeting unless there be then present as many members as were present when such vote was taken, and three-fifths of all members present vote in favor thereof. Sec. 9. Absence of quorum—how quorum secured. If a quorum fail to attend a meeting of the Council within a half hour after the appointed time for such meeting, those present may adjourn to such time as they deem proper, after the names of those present shall have been entered on the journal. At such meeting, two or more members shall have authority to compel the attendance of absent members by a process in writing signed by them and addressed to any policeman, directing him to summons such absent members to such time and place to which the meeting shall have been adjourned. Any member refusing to obey such summons may be fined by a four-fifths vote of the Council in a sum not less than five dollars nor more than twenty-five dollars. Sec. 10. Punishment of members. The Council may, by a majority vote of its whole number, punish one of its own members for disorderly behavior by a fine not exceeding $300; and, by a two-thirds vote of its whole number, expel a member of its own body for malfeasance or misfeasance in office. Fines imposed under this section shall be collected in such manner as fines imposed by the Civil and Police Justice. Sec. 11. Vacancies—office of mayor or councilmen, how filled. Whenever, from any cause, a vacancy shall occur in the office of mayor it shall be filled by the Council. A vacancy in the office of councilman shall be filled by the Council at its next regular meeting from the qualified electors of the City. The officer thus elected shall hold office for the term for which his predecessor was elected, unless sooner vacated by death, resignation, removal, or from other causes. An entry of said election shall be made in the journal. If the mayor or a councilman shall remove his residence from the City limits such removal shall operate to vacate his office. Sec. 12. Disqualification of members for certain offices. No member of the Council shall be eligible during his tenure of office, or for one year thereafter, to any office to be filled by the Council either by election or appointment. Sec. 13. Committees. The president of the Council shall, within ten days after the organization of the Council, appoint the finance committee consisting of three members to continue for a term of two years. The president of the Council shall also appoint all special committees unless otherwise ordered by the Council. Vacancies on committees shall be filled in like manner. Sec. 14. Finance committee—duties and powers. The finance committee shall investigate and report to the Council as to all matters relating to the finances, debts, revenues and assets of the City. After approval by the Council said committee shall have power to borrow money in the name of "the finance committee of the City of Charlottesville," signed by all the members of said committee. The finance committee shall approve all surety bonds of City officials and employees as provided for by sec. 41, post. Sec. 15. Rules and procedure. The Council shall determine the rules of its proceedings, except so far as the same are determined by the constitution and laws of the State and charter of the City. Sec. 16. Ordinances and resolutions. Every proposed ordinance and resolution having the effect of an ordinance shall be in writing. It may have immediate consideration, but objection by one member shall carry it over to the next meeting. Sec. 17. Annual budget and levy. The Council shall cause to be prepared by the City Manager an Annual Budget containing all proposed expenditures and estimated revenues and borrowing for the ensuing year, and at least 30 days thereafter shall order a City levy as provided for by State law and sections 13-17 and 18 of the City Charter and amendments thereto. The Council shall adopt said annual budget and shall make said City levy prior to June 30th in each year. Sec. 18. Ordinances appropriating money, imposing taxes, etc., vote necessary—when carried over. (a) Every ordinance or resolution appropriating money exceeding one hundred dollars, imposing or releasing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money, or creating a debt, or donating any property of the City, where the value of such property is one hundred dollars or more, a vote of a majority of all members elected to the Council shall be necessary, and the "Ayes" and "Noes" shall be entered on the journal of the Council. (b) No ordinance or resolution appropriating money exceeding the sum of one thousand dollars, imposing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money, shall be passed by the Council on the same day of its introduction; nor shall any such ordinance or resolution be valid unless at least three days intervene between its introduction and passage, but this paragraph shall not apply to the annual appropriations as provided in section 20, post. Sec. 19. Additional expenditures beyond annual budget. No money shall be expended on any department of the City government beyond the amount estimated in the budget for such department in the general appropriation ordinance for the fiscal year unless such expenditure be authorized by the recorded vote of three-fifths of all the members elected to the Council. Sec. 20. Annual, quarterly and special appropriations. (a) As soon as practical after the 1st day of September in each year, the Council shall make an annual appropriation covering all fixed expenditures provided for in the Annual Budget, which are approved. (b) At the last meeting of the Council in each quarter, said Council shall make quarterly appropriation covering all approved expenditures in the Quarterly Estimate of the City Manager as provided for in section 53, post. Said estimate together with the auditor's quarterly report shall be spread in the Journal immediately preceding the resolution making the quarterly appropriation, which shall be finally passed at the next succeeding regular meeting of the Council. (c) All other appropriations shall be deemed Special appropriations. Sec. 21. Ordinances appropriating money for outside highways. No ordinance or resolution appropriating money for the purpose of improving highways, airports and bridges located outside of the City, shall be passed by the Council except by a recorded affirmative vote of four-fifths of all members elected to the Council. Sec. 22. Granting aid to various associations. No ordinance or resolution granting aid to military, agricultural, literary, or benevolent associations, or to public charity shall be passed except by the vote of three-fifths of the members elected to the Council. Sec. 23. Disposition of public property and franchises. (1) No ordinance or resolution granting, leasing, selling or otherwise disposing of any public property or franchise, shall be valid unless the same be passed by the Council by a recorded affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members elected to the Council. No franchise, lease, or right of any kind to the use of any such public property in a manner not permitted to the general public shall be granted for a period of over thirty years. Before granting such franchise or privilege for a term of thirty years, except for a trunk railway, bids therefor shall be advertised once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper published in this City. Such grant, and any contract in pursuance thereof, may provide that upon the termination of the grant, the plant, as well as the property, if any, of the grantee in the streets, avenues and other public places, shall thereupon, without compensation to the grantee, or upon the payment of a fair valuation therefor, be and become the property of the City, but that the grantee shall be entitled to no payment by reason of the value of the franchise. Every such grant shall specify the mode of determining any valuation therein provided for and shall make adequate provision by way of forfeiture of the grant, or otherwise, to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good order throughout the term of the grant. All persons, firms or corporations to whom privileges or franchises have been or may be granted by the Council, shall pay in advance for the printing and advertising of all ordinances granting said privileges or franchises after the approval thereof and all of said printing shall be done under the supervision and direction of the Clerk of the Council.

Whenever any citizen or property owner desires to lay a sidewalk for themselves in a City street, he shall make application to the City Manager in writing who shall grant such permission upon condition that the applicant make such improvement at his own expense and do the work under the supervision of the City Manager.

If the applicant fails to resurface the street disturbed promptly and in a manner approved by the City Manager, the City Manager is authorized to cause said work to be done at the expense of the applicant. Any person found guilty of taking up any pavement, sidewalk, or street surface, or excavating in any street or alley in the City without the written permission of the City Manager shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than $5.00 nor more than $10.00 for each offense, and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 495(18). Existing non-conforming uses. (1) If, at the time of the enactment of this Code, any lot, building or structure is being used in a character or manner or for a purpose which does not conform to the provision of this section, and which is not prohibited by some other section, such character or manner of use or purpose may be continued, and no change of title or possession or rights to possession of any such lot, building or structure shall be construed to prevent the continued non-conforming use of such lot, building or structure as hereinbefore provided. Any such non-conforming use which is not otherwise unlawful may be hereafter extended throughout any part of a building or structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of enactment of this Code. (2) No building, structure or premises in which a non-conforming use is abandoned for a period exceeding two years or is superseded by a permitted use, subsequent to the enactment of this Code, shall again be devoted to prohibited use.

(3) Any persons who propose to construct or alter any building or to make some use of a lot, building or structure of any kind which proposed construction, alteration or use is apparently in conflict with the provisions of this section shall file with the Building Inspector his application therefor, which application shall furnish such information to the Building Inspector as may be necessary to enable him to pass on such application intelligently. If such proposed structure, alteration or use is in conflict with the provisions of this section, the Building Inspector shall refuse a permit for such construction, alteration or use, and from such decision of the Building Inspector an appeal shall lie to the Board of Appeals.
