      <field name="fulltext">ANNOUNCEMENTS. 1887-'88. The University of Virginia is in a picturesque and healthful location among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Virginia Midland, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. It has a post-office, with numerous daily mails; is in communication by telephone with the neighboring town of Charlottesville; and by telegraph is connected with every quarter of the world. The climate is invigorating and healthful, and at all times free from malarial conditions. The Sanitary Arrangements, recently improved and extended at great cost, are considered almost perfect. There is a copious supply of the purest water; the system of drains and sewers is complete; and the moderate Infirmary fee secures medical treatment by the Professors of the Medical Department, and in case of serious illness skilful nursing in a well equipped Infirmary. The Session begins on the 1st of October, and continues nine months, without intermission. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 3rd of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the public are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are Academical and Professional. The former are comprised in two departments, the Literary and the Scientific; the latter in the five Departments of Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various Departments there are altogether nineteen distinct Schools, each affording an independent course under a Professor, who alone is responsible for the system and methods pursued. ANNOUNCEMENTS. Elective System.âThis system of independent schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, so far as the times appointed for lectures and examinations permit. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity divergent. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Degrees.âBut even here it has been found advantageous to mark out in the several Departments carefully arranged groups of Studies leading to corresponding Degrees. And it is always best for the student, in either the Academical or the Professional Schools, to follow from the outset some definite plan of studies, formed under competent advice. Such a course will generally lead to one of these Degrees, although not necessarily limited by the requirements for any one of them. Preparation.âSome special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purposes of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome all disadvantages, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study.</field>

The School of Latin is divided into two classes, Junior and Senior. Junior Class.âA student who is able to read CÃ¦sar or Virgil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this class. The class begins with Sallust, or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The Syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Cicero, Livy, and Horace. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. There are two examinationsâthe Intermediate, held about the middle of the session, the Final, at its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. Senior Class.âThis class commences with Juvenal or Livy, and reads during the session selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus or a play of Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is LITERARY DEPARTMENT. taken up early in the session, and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition, as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the Language. Portions of the authors read in the Lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the Lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the Lectures. In this class there are two examinations â one occurring about the middle of the session, the second at its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the second or Final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In this class due attention is given to Roman History and Literature. Text-Books.âAny approved editions of the authors above named. Grammars:âGildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History:âLiddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature:âBender's, as a Hand-book and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. Sanskrit.âThe Professor will also give instruction in the elements of Sanskrit whenever a sufficient number of students desire it. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Prof. Humphreys. The School is organized in three classes, the Junior, the Intermediate, and the Senior. The method of instruction is by lectures, by daily examination upon the matter of the lectures and upon assigned portions of the text-books, and by written and oral exercises. A full knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translation are necessary as a preparation for the Junior Class. Two books of Xenophon's Anabasis, or some suitable equivalent, may be regarded as a proper amount of preparatory reading. Diligent students inadequately prepared often make good progress with the aid of a Licentiate. (See p. 75.) LITERARY DEPARTMENT. The Junior Class is intended to give a practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is rapidly but carefully reviewed; for translation into Greek, sentences are given out which involve the vocabulary and the idioms of the Greek texts studied. The authors read are Xenophon (parts of the Memorabilia and of the Cyropedia), and Lysias. The Geography and Political History of Greece are taught in this class. The Intermediate Class, for which the Junior course, or some equivalent, is the appropriate preparation, continues the study of Attic prose usage, and gives an introduction to authors of great literary importance who wrote in other dialects. Weekly exercises for translation into Greek are given, each a passage of simple but idiomatic English based on a Greek author. Selected portions of the Grammar are closely studied and the whole syntax is reviewed. The authors read are Lysias, Herodotus, and Homer. Instruction in Greek Antiquities is given in this class. The Senior Class demands such attainments as may be acquired in the two lower classes, or an equivalent. The main purpose of the instruction is to introduce students, as far as practicable, to the masterpieces of the literature of Athens. The authors read this session are Demosthenes, Plato, Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristophanes, and the fragments of the Lyric Poets. The Syntax of the Greek Verb is discussed, and courses of lectures are given upon Metres and the History of Greek Literature. The weekly exercises are partly based on ancient authors and partly taken from standard English writers. Text-books.âLiddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon, Veitch's Greek Verbs, Hadley's Greek Grammar, Goodwin's Greek Moods and Tenses, Smith's History of Greece, Fyffe's Primer of Greek History, Tozer's Primer of Ancient Geography, Mahaffy's Primer of Greek Antiquities, and the Teubner (or Weidmann) text editions of the authors read. The Junior Class uses Goodwin's Grammar. For each class a course of private reading is prescribed. The state of preparation of a student joining the school may often make it expedient to take two classes at once. In the examination of candidates for graduation, all the subjects taught in the School are involved, and the passages set for translation are selected from the classic writers at will. Hebrew.âElementary instruction in Hebrew is given when the demand for such instruction is sufficient. During the present session such instruction is given by Rev. James M. Rawlings, the Licentiate in Hebrew. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF MODERN LANGUAGES. Prof. Schele De Vere. The subjects taught in this School are as follows: 1. The French, German, Spanish, and Italian languages. A number of classic and of modern authors are read in the class, to practice the pronunciation, to acquire facility in prompt rendering of the foreign idiom, and to appreciate the literary beauties of eminent writers. A much larger number of works, mainly by modern authors, are expected to be read privately, in order to acquire that familiarity with foreign writers which enables the student to judge of the difference in style and diction in individuals, and in various periods of literature. At every meeting of the class, moreover, a lecture is delivered, and to a large extent illustrated by examples and quotations, written on the blackboard, so that the eye and the ear may mutually assist each other. In these lectures the Grammar and the Syntax of each idiom is discussed in a manner varying according to the state of preparation of each class. The treatment is mainly historical: the words, the sentences and the general structure being exhibited as they gradually developed themselves from the earliest efforts made by the infant nation to the highest results obtained in its so-called Golden Age. These lectures are again accompanied by weekly exercises, translations from the vernacular into foreign idioms. They furnish the Professor with evidence of the success or want of success with which he has tried to explain the rules and the usages of each language. After having been carefully marked, they are returned to the student, and then written, in correct form, on the blackboard. The Professor, as he writes there, accompanies them with a running commentary on the various rules that have been violated or misunderstood. At stated intervals the Professor reads aloud, so as to train the ear; at others, he dictates extracts from foreign writers for the same purpose. After the classes have become somewhat familiar with the language they are given a series of lectures treating of the History of the idiom. Its forms, its structure and its spiritual characteristics are carefully traced through the different periods of their history, and minutely compared with each other. This gives an opportunity for instruction in the fundamental rules of the Science of Language, to which much attention is given. These lectures are followed by another course on the Literature of each idiom. The different periods of the literature are LITERARY DEPARTMENT. explained and illustrated by sketches of the lives and criticisms on the works of the principal writers of each age. The parallelism between the national growth of a people and its literary proficiency is constantly pointed out. After each lecture the Professor remains some time in the lecture room to meet informally such students as desire additional information. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in each of the four languages named above; and upon the student who succeds in French and German a diploma of graduation in the School of Modern Languages is conferred. 2. The study of Anglo-Saxon is mainly pursued in its aspect as the mother of English, furnishing the student the means of tracing the history of his native tongue from its earliest beginning. Much attention is given to the illustration of the history of words, their birth, their fate under the rule of the Norman, and their subsequent modifications. Whilst the student is furnished with a key to the rich and historically invaluable literature of our forefathers, he is at the same time given an opportunity to learn the inner nature, the inherent power and the right to supremacy awarded to his native tongue. Extracts from Anglo-Saxon writers are read, and the bearing of their works on the history of our race is explained. Certificates of Proficiency are conferred in Anglo-Saxon. The following text-books are used in the several languages: French. Junior Class.âThe Professor's Grammar and First Reader, Whitney's Grammar, TÃ©lÃ©maque, Saintine's Picciola, Masson's Dictionary. Senior Class.âThe Professor's Grammar, Brachet's Grammar, MoliÃ¨re, Racine, Voltaire, Taine's L'Angleterre, Masson's, Gasc's, or LittrÃ©'s Dictionary. A course of private reading is prescribed.

Instruction in this School is given in three classes: I. The Class of Early English.âIn this class the historical and philological study of the language is pursued, the class beginning with its oldest forms, and tracing the language, by the study of specimens through its different periods to the formation of modern English. After a thorough study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read, both in class and privately, with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English. Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages, and on the history of the language, are also given, Text-books.âSweet's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English, Parts I and II, or Sweet's First and Second Middle English Primers. For reference.â Cook's Sievers's Grammar of Old English; Kington-Oliphant's Old and Middle English. II. The Class of Modern English.âIn this class the study of the later language, i. e., from Chaucer, is pursued, and Shakspere is made a special subject of study. The critical study of a play of Shakspere, with private reading of about one-third of the plays, is followed by similar study of selected works of later authors. Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama and on the history of the later language are given. Text-books.âFor 1888-'89, Romeo and Juliet (Rolfe's edition); Dowden's Shakspere Primer; Abbott's Shaksperian Grammar; Hale's Longer English Poems, Lounsbury's History of the English Language. For reference.âThe Globe Shakspere and Fleay's Shakspere Manual; Keltie's British Dramatists. III. The Class of Rhetoric and English Literature.âIn this class the principles of Composition and Rhetoric are first studied, and then the study of the history of English Literature is taken up. Along with study of the text-books, selected works of authors are assigned LITERARY DEPARTMENT. for private reading. Essays are required at regular intervals. Lectures on each subject are given in connection with the text-books. Text-books.âGenung's Practical Elements of Rhetoric; Nicoll's Landmarks of English Literature; Ward's English Poets. For reference.âMinto's Manual of English Prose Literature; Saintsbury's Specimens of English Prose Style. Each class meets twice a week, and may be attended separately; but graduation in I. and III., or II. and III., will be necessary for a diploma in the School. N. B. Books marked "For reference" are used at the option of the student. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Prof. Holmes. In this School are two classesâone of General History, the other of the Processes of Historical Change. Either class may be taken separately, or either branch of the latter class. I General History.âIn this class the story of advancing civilization is followed through the succession of the leading nations, from the commencement of authentic and continuous history to the Age of Revolution still in progress. An effort is made to impress the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development. The rise, the decline and the fall of States are referred to their causes. The political, intellectual and social condition of the people in the more prominent periods is carefully expounded; and the sources of their power and prosperity, or of their weakness and impoverishment are noted, so far as the necessary limitation of the subject will permit. The object contemplated is to present the human family in History as an organic unity, all of whose parts at all times, and through all successions, are thoroughly interdependent. Text-books.âSmith's History of Greece; Merivale's History of Rome (abridged by Puller); Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of Rome (abridged by Smith); Lodge, Modern History; Labberton's New History and Historical Atlas. II. The other class embraces Political Economy and the Science of Society, Political Economy being considered as a subordinate branch of social investigation. I. Political Economy.âIn the treatment of this department of knowledge, there is no rigid adherence to the school of Smith, Ricardo, and LITERARY DEPARTMENT. Mill. The modification of older doctrines necessitated by the increase of productive inventions and productive operations is steadily regarded. Attention is paid to the inquiries and criticism of Thornton, Cairnes, Jevons, etc.; and the altered views propounded by Laveleye, Walker, and the school of the Cathedrists are duly considered. Text-book.âMill's Political Economy (abridged by McLaughlin). For consultation.â Walker's Political Economy (advanced course). 2. Science of Society.âThe latter half of the course in this class is devoted to the Science of Society. In this is prosecuted the investigation of the laws and movements, the growth, decay and constitution of Societies, in the different phases and stages of social development. The necessary organic functions of society are studied in their several forms. They are also regarded in their reciprocal relations and in their conjoint action in successive forms of civilization. All systems are interpreted: no ideal constitution is contemplated. The course is descriptive of processes by which experienced results have been obtained: not speculative in advocacy of theoretic dreams. The Class is dependent on notes on the Lectures, as no text-book exists. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Davis. There are two classes, best taken in two successive sessions: I. The class in Logic studies Deductive Logic, Inductive Logic, and Applied Logic. Two lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Logic, Mill on Induction, Whately's Rhetoric, Jevons's Principles of Science. II. The class in Philosophy studies Psychology, Ethics, and History of Philosophy. Three lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Psychology, Hamilton's Metaphysics, Janet's La Morale, Lotze's GrundsÃ¤tze der Praktischen Philosophie, Kant's Theory of Ethics, Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Latin.âThis work is intended for students who desire to pursue their Latin studies beyond the requirements for graduation. The value of the course to a student who proposes to teach, or who desires to equip himself for original investigation in the language, cannot LITERARY DEPARTMENT. well be overstated. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize him with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The Lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which cannot be considered to any great extent in the course for graduation. School of Greek.âThis course is designed primarily for those who intend to become teachers of the classical languages, and who desire a thorough introduction to Greek philology as a part of their professional equipment. With such students the professor will read and discuss the more difficult Greek authors. Courses of private reading are marked out, including important text-books and monographs; and by systematic lectures, as well as by constant supervision and advice, the professor will aid and direct the student's endeavors. As an exercise in the independent investigation of philological problems, each student is from time to time expected to prepare a paper, discussing thoroughly some topic selected by himself. Constant practice is given in Greek composition. School of Modern Languages.âGraduates in this school who wish to extend the study of any one of the idioms there taught (including Anglo-Saxon) beyond the limits of the under-graduate course, and candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, are expected to do the following work: They will read additional foreign authors, pursue the study of Comparative Philology till mastery is secured, and write monthly essays on kindred subjects, which must give proof of original research. A thorough knowledge of at least one ancient language, and graduation in two modern languages, are deemed prerequisite. Candidates for honors will, however, have the choice between the two methods of comparing idiomsâeither by tracing out the kinship LITERARY DEPARTMENT. existing between several languages, or families of languages, such as the Romance, the Germanic or the Slavic, in their lexical, grammatical or psychological nature; or by comparing with each other the different aspects borne by one and the same idiom in its successive periods of life. The writings of Diez, Hovelacque, Sayce, Max MÃ¼ller, and others, are carefully studied; and the final result of the whole course of study is to be shown in a concluding dissertation specially written for the degree, and evidencing original thought. School of English.âIn this School two separate graduate courses will be arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further either philological or literary studies. The former will comprise the further study of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English works, especially of Anglo-Saxon poetry, or the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. The latter will comprise the study of some distinctive period in English literature, or of some particular writer, or writers, including the political, social, and literary characteristics of the age under consideration. In each course a thesis will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued, in addition to such examinations as may be advisable. The selection of the course and subject is left to the student himself, under guidance of the Professor. School of Historical Science.âThe graduate course in this School for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the accompanying social, political and intellectual development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render these pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. School of Moral Philosophy.âThe history of philosophy, ancient and modern, with a special study of Aristotle and Kant. N. B. Graduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M.

Senior Class.âThis class meets three times a week (4Â½ hours) and studies Analytical Geometry of three dimensions, through the discussion of the Conicoids and some Curves in Space; Differential and Integral Calculus, with various applications; a short course in the Calculus of Variations; the Theory of Equations; and lectures on the History of Mathematics. Text-books.âThe Professor's Notes on Solid Geometry (Analytical); Todhunter's Differential Calculus; Williamson's Integral Calculus; Todhunter's Theory of Equations. Candidates for graduation in Pure Mathematics are required to pursue in the University the studies of both the Intermediate and Senior Classes. II. Mixed Mathematics. This course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of Pure Mathematics. It embraces an extended course of reading under the instruction and guidance of the Professor on the applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Mechanics, Physical Astronomy, and selected portions of Physics. The class in Mixed Mathematics meets twice a week (3 hours). Text-books.âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vols. II. and III.; Cheyne's Planetary Theory. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The progress of the student in each class is tested constantly by his being called upon to apply the principles acquired to the independent solution of selected problems. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This school includes two courses, as follows: I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists, that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Members of the Junior Class are admitted at convenient times to the Physical Laboratory, where they may repeat and extend the experiments of the lecture-room. Such exercise is entirely optional. Experience shows that this privilege is highly valued and extensively used. Text-books.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants; Daniell's Physics. Senior Class.âThis class studies selected portions of Mathematical Physics, and Spherical Astronomy. The members of the class are required to spend from one to two months in the Physical Laboratory.

The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured with much expense and pains in this country, England, France, and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. (See page 68.) In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. Prof. Dunnington. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is arranged in two divisions, as follows: I. A regularly arranged course in Chemical Manipulation is first given. This is followed by Blowpipe Analysis and Fire Assays of ores of lead, silver, and gold. A systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis follows with practice in the analysis of mixtures of salts, alloys, ores, and so on, and in Determinative Mineralogy. Instruction in the elements of Quantitative Analysis completes this division of the course. II. The work of the second division is an extended course of Quantitative Analysis, both gravimetric and volumetric. The student determines the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, building stones, manures, technical products, and so on. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. As he advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assisted in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this sort is considered as having great weight. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative an Quantitative Analysis; Greville Williams's Handbook of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Von Kobell's Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mine. ralien (also in English translation); Odling's Practical Chemistry for Medical Students; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. Five lessons are given each week, and the Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the Full Course or for the First Course; but candidates for graduation are required to complete the Full Course. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers or Teachers of Chemistry. In addition to the foregoing the following Special Courses are given in this School. They are open without additional charge to the regular students of the School. For fees to others see page 70. 1. A laboratory course of sixteen lessons on the Medical Applications of Chemistry; the detection of poisons, the chemical and microscopical examination of urine and blood, and so on. 2.

Special Courses 1 and 2 are of especial interest to students of Medicine and Pharmacy. Special Course 3 is open free of charge to farmers who are not students of the University. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF GEOLOGY. Prof. Fontaine. In this School there are two regular classes: Geology and Mineralogy. I. Geology.âThis subject is taught during the entire session, and three lectures a week are devoted to it, until the examination in Mineralogy, which takes place usually in the latter part of February; thereafter five lectures a week are given to Geology, until the final examination, which takes place late in April. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Text-book.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology. For referenceâDana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThis subject is studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures a week are devoted to it. Special attention is paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy, the mode of occurrence, the geological importance and relations of the species are made prominent. Text-book.âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For referenceâDana's Textbook of Mineralogy. III. Botany.âFor the present session (1887-8) the class in Botany, usually attached to the School of Biology and Agriculture, has been transferred to this School. The general principles of the science are taught and the time of the student is mainly occupied in the study, analysis and determination of flowering plants. Text-book.âGray's School and Field-book of Botany. The large and carefully selected collections of geological, mineralogical, and botanical objects found in the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History (see page 67), afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing special courses of study in Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany. The foregoing subjects are taught mainly by lectures. These are supplemented by portions of the text-books. In order to give the members of the classes in Geology and Mineralogy an opportunity to study the method of field work, the Professor, when a sufficient number desire it, organizes a field party. The University has hitherto borne a portion of the expense of the party. The field work is done in the month of July, and is entirely optional with the students. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy may, although not members of the University class, with the consent of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Prof. . . . . . . [To be elected].

A previous knowledge of French and German will not be insisted upon; but both of these languages are continually employed in the work of the school. For other courses in Astronomy, see Mixed Mathematics, p. 30, and Senior Natural Philosophy, p. 31. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Mathematics.âThe graduate course includes: The course of Mixed Mathematics, (p. 30); Advanced Studies in the Modern Higher Geometry, the Infinitesimal Calculus, and in the Higher Algebra. For those candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who select the Mathematics as their chief study, the graduate course will extend through two sessions. School of Natural Philosophy.âThe graduate studies are those of the Course in Practical Physics, (p. 31). School of General and Industrial Chemistry.âThe principal part of the graduate course will consist of practical laboratory work on subjects of original investigation. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry.âThe course for graduates in this school consists of laboratory work in an advanced course of analysis, comprising practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, study of methods of analysis, and original investigations in the composition of rare or unusual minerals, and technical products presenting scientific or economic interest. School of Natural History and Geology.âIn this school subjects will be selected from one or more of the branches included in the School, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen. School of Practical Astronomy.âA prescribed course in this School, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, will be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates of these schools. N. B.âGraduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School. For admission to a graduate course in the School of General and Industrial Chemistry, or in the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. COURSES OF LIBERAL STUDY. The courses leading to Academical Degrees, the requirements for which are shown elsewhere (p. 64), differ in character as well as in extent. The Bachelors' degrees are arranged so as to furnish a desirable preparation for professional studies and are the natural introduction to the advanced studies required for the Doctorate. Of these there are four: 1. The Bachelor of Arts degree admits the greatest freedom of selection and arrangement. Of the very considerable number of possible combinations the following judicious groupings are given as examples. Each has a distinctive educational tendency as indicated in the table. B. A. Course inâ Graduations inâ Proficiencies inâ Distinctions inâ Classics. Latin, Greek. Mathematics, Physics, Logic, English, History. Mathematics. Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, French or German. English, Logic. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek. Physical Science. Mathematics, Natural Philosophy. Logic, Geology. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek, General Chemistry. Natural Science. Natural History, General Chemistry. Mathematics, Physics, Logic. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek. Modern Languages English, Modern Languages. Mathematics, Physics, Logic. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek. History and Littrature. English, Historical Science. Mathematics, Physics, Logic. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek. Philosophy. Moral Philosophy, Modern Languages. Political Economy, Mathematics, Physics. Senior Latin, Junior &amp; Int. Greek. 2. The Bachelor of Letters degree is the terminus of a specifically literary course. The subjects of Latin, Greek and Moral Philosophy are required; to these must be added one of the following: Modern Languages, English, Historical Science. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. 3. The Bachelor of Science degree is the terminus of a purely scientific course. All four of the subjects are fixedâMathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and Natural Historyâso that there is no election. 4. The Bachelor of Philosophy degree supplies a course which is partly literary and partly scientific; but with a distinct leaning to the literary side. Any three of the six schools mentioned in (2) may be elected, and to them any two of the four schools mentioned in (3) may be added. The number of combinations is 120. The requirement for the degree of Master of Arts is rigid, and permits no election. It includes Ancient Languages (Latin and Greek, Modern Languages (French and German), Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and Moral Philosophy. These constituted all the schools of the Academical Department, as originally established; so that the requirement for this degree has an historical as well as an educational significance. The degrees of Doctor of Letters, of Science, and of Philosophy are designed for students who have chosen a vocation which demands extensive acquirements and original investigation in some special field of letters or of science. Candidates for these degrees must possess that amount of general culture and exact training which is attested by a baccalaureate degree from this University, or its equivalent from some other chartered school of higher learning, and must elect, for advanced studies, two schools in either the Literary or the Scientific Department, one as a principal and the other as a cognate study. The work on the principal study will ordinarily extend over two sessions; that in the cognate study can generally be carried on parallel with the former, and be completed in the same time. In addition to the studies and investigations pursued during this period the candidate is required to submit a thesis on some branch of his principal subject. This thesis must exhibit not breadth and accuracy of information only, but must show capacity for original and independent research into questions that will advance the bounds of human learning. The especial attention of students who propose to devote their lives to teaching, to literature, or to scientific research is invited to these degrees. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. STUDENTS FROM VIRGINIA. In compliance with the Statute [Act of Assembly, 15 March, 1884,] the University offers to white male students from Virginia over the age of sixteen years instruction without charge for tuition in all the Academical Schools except the Laboratory courses in Chemistry and Physics and the Observatory course in Astronomy. These eleven schools furnish instruction from the elements to the most advanced stages in the following subjects: 1. The English, Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Anglo-Saxon Languages and the literature and rhetoric of them. 2. Ancient, MediÃ¦val and Modern History and Political Economy. 3. Logic, Philosophy, Ethics and History of Philosophy. 4. Pure and Mixed Mathematics. 5. Experimental and Mathematical Physics. 6. Theoretical Astronomy. 7. General and Industrial Chemistry. 8. Geology and Mineralogy. 9. Biology and Agriculture. They lead to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Letters, Bachelor of Philosophy, Master of Arts, Doctor of Science, Doctor of Letters, and Doctor of Philosophy. The total University fees of an Academical Student from Virginia are only $47; his necessary expenses amount to but $180, exclusive of books and stationery; of this about $100 must be paid on entrance. The Faculty are required by law to be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant or by a certificate from some college or preparatory school that he has made such proficiency in the branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages afforded by the University. Examination is required for admission to the School of 1. Latin on inflections, syntax and Books I, II of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Catiline. 2. Greek on inflections, syntax and Books I, II of Xenophon's Anabasis. 3. Mathematics or Natural Philosophy on Arithmetic, Plane Geometry and Algebra through quadratics. For the other subjects a good knowledge of English and Arithmetic is alone required. The diploma of a college or the certificate of a high school has great weight with the examiners. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. SPECIAL COURSES OF INSTRUCTION FOR TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. White male teachers and superintendents of the Free Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academical Department of the University without payment of fees. Applicants will present certificates from the State Superintendent, or from their respective County Superintendents, that they have been teachers or superintendents in the Public Free Schools. The members of the Faculty will give the following special courses of instruction to students matriculated under the foregoing provisions. Latin: 1. Special course in CÃ¦sar (or Ovid) and Latin Composition. [3 a week.] 2. Regular course in Cicero (or Horace) with Junior Class. [3 a week.] Greek: Special course in Xenophon's Anabasis.

Students matriculated under the above provision may also attend any of the regular classes in the Academical Department of the University without charge. At the conclusion of the courses certificates of attendance will be given by the several Professors to those students whose work is approved. Applicants for admission are requested to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 15. University dormitories will be assigned free of rent, in the order of application, as far as the vacant rooms will serve. Lodgings can also be had near the University, or in Charlottesville. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights and washing, which will together cost from $3.50 to $5.50 a week. For further information address the Chairman of the Faculty. LOCAL EXAMINATIONS. The annual written examinations for boys and girls will be held on Thursday, April 26, 1888, and the two following days at different centres by examiners appointed by the University. Centres will be established wherever an examination is desired by a sufficient number of candidates of either sex. The examinations, which are of two grades, will cover the subjects usually taught in the higher public and private schools. Candidates who pass with credit will receive certificates to that effect; and twenty gold medals will be awarded in 1888 for distinguished merit. Every candidate admitted to examination will be required to pay a fee of two dollars to defray necessary expenses. The latest day of entry is April 16, 1888. Teachers and others interested will please apply for further information to the Chairman of the Faculty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. JAS. H. GILMORE, Professor of Constitutional and International Law, Equity, &amp; This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both A Moot-court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. Minor. Junior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I., The Rights which Relate to the Person. Vol. II., The Rights which Relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Blackstone's Commentaries. Senior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV., The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III., The Rights which Relate to Personal Property. Stephen on Pleading. For reference.âVirginia Code (1888); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, MERCANTILE LAW, EVIDENCE, AND EQUITY. Prof. Gilmore. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, with Lectures; Lectures on ; Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams's Equity, with Lectures. For reference.âStephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence, (Chase's edition preferred.) In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, including the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the course must be completed here, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest, as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete should imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, not to attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully), he is admitted to the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to the degree. LAW DEPARTMENT. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the Law Department are for the session of nine months as follows: University Feesâ Matriculation, $ 25 Infirmary Fee, 7 Dormitory Rent [two in a room], 15 Tuition, 80 Total of Fees, 127 Living Expensesâ Fuel, Lights and Washing, 25 Board at $12 a Month, 108 Total necessary expenses (board at $12) $260 Payable on entrance, $180 The sum payable on entrance includes a contingent deposit of $10 which is credited in final settlement, and hence forms no part of the necessary expenses. This deposit is assessed for damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on. To the above total must be added the cost of books and stationery, about $80 for the entire course, and the cost of a degree which if taken is $15. The board at $12 is plain but wholesome and abundant. Better board can be had at $14, $16, $18 a month. At $18 the total necessary expenses will be $314 of which $198 is payable on entrance. For the entire course, if taken in one year, the total necessary expenses, including books, will be $340 to $394, according to the price paid for board; if taken in two years they will be $600 to $708. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. A., M. D., LL. D., Professor of Physiology and Surgery. J. W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., F. R. S., Professor of General Chemistry. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., Professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica. WILLIAM C. DABNEY, M. D., Professor of Medicine, Obstetrics, etc. RICHARD H. WHITEHEAD, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. COURSES OF STUDY IN GENERAL. The session of the Medical Department continues through the full nine months of the University session. This arrangement enables five professors to do thoroughly the work which is often allotted to a larger number in institutions whose session is much shorter. The importance of a knowledge of Chemistry, Anatomy and Physiology, before commencing the study of the more practical branches, is fully recognized; and the course of study is so arranged, that during the first half session the instruction is in these important elementary branches. During the same time the subjects of Medical Jurisprudence and Obstetrics, especially the mechanical features of the latter branch, are studied by the class. The courses and methods of instruction in the several Schools of the Department are as follows: SCHOOL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. In this School the students are taught thoroughly Chemical Physics and the principles of Chemistry; and their attention is directed, when ever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to the practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology and Sanitary Science. (See p. 32.) Text-book.âFownes's Chemistry. For reference.âCharles's Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Prof. Towles. I. Anatomy.âThe instruction in Descriptive, Surgical, and Topographical Anatomy is given both by didactic lectures and in the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; scarcely a statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection; the effort being to convey knowledge in the so-called natural method; i. e., by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the school for this purpose is most ample; and, in addition to the numerous preparations and dissections, there are models and anatomical paintings, representing the greater part of the anatomy of the body. For the course in Practical Anatomy, dissecting material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Each medical student, however many sessions he may have attended, is required to dissect, under the constant and careful supervision of the Demonstrator. Attendance in the dissectingroom is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the oral examination, which precedes each lecture, and the other examinations to be mentioned hereafter, each student is required to stand seven practical examinations on anatomy, one upon osteology, four upon different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being examined alone. They consist of the identification of the truths of anatomy on the bones, the cadaver, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of the student's acquaintance with the structure of the human body. II. Materia Medica and Therapeutics.âThe lectures on Materia Medica occur in the latter half the session, after the student has obtained the knowledge of the primary branches, prerequisite to the proper understanding of the subject. Particular stress is laid upon the physiological action and rational therapeutical applications of drugs. The physical properties of drugs are taught by requiring the student MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 4 to learn them from specimens, a complete collection being provided, which contains specimens both of all the crude drugs and of all their preparations, which have been dealt with in the lectures. Text-books.âBruce's Materia Medica and Therapeutics; Index of Materia Medica. The student should provide himself, if possible, with specimens of all the bones. SCHOOL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Prof. Cabell. I. In Physiology the lectures are illustrated by plates, and the students are instructed in Histology as well as in Physiology proper. Much attention is given throughout the course to the practical bearings of physiological and histological facts on pathology, and their relations to the nature and treatment of disease. Extra lectures are given, commencing about the middle of December, at which the students are questioned on all that part of Physiology which they have studied previously. It has been found that these "review lectures" are very useful to the students as a preparation for the final examinations. II. In Surgery especial attention is given to the causation and pathology of the various surgical affections, and the lectures are illustrated by excellent paintings and by morbid specimens. The applications of splints and apparatus for the different fractures and the details of minor surgery are practically exhibited to the class. Text-books.âYeo's Manual of Physiology; Power's Human Physiology, (American edition); Wilson's Manual of Hygiene and Sanitary Science (fifth edition, 1884); Ashurst's Surgery; Klein's Histology. For occasional reference: Foster's Physiology; Landois's Physiology; and a few monographs on special subjects. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OBSTETRICS, AND MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Prof. Dabney. I. In Medical Jurisprudence the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and is taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. II. In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained and illustrated by the MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. use of suitable preparations and models. The student is drilled in this part of the subject during the early part of the course, and attention is subsequently called to the diseases and accidents incident to pregnancy and the puerperal state. Each student is also taught practically the various manipulations, both manual and instrumental. III. In Practice of Medicine especial attention is given to the principles of the subject, the aim of the teacher being to instruct the students as thoroughly as possible in the causation of diseases and the morbid changes which occur in the different tissues. The lectures are illustrated by morbid specimens, both coarse and microscopic, and each student has the opportunity of examining these specimens for himself Each student furthermore is taught the method of making a physical examination of a patient, and is required to learn by actual examination; under the supervision of the Professor, the normal appearances and sounds in the different regions of the body and over the different organs. IV. Classes have also been established in Practical Microscopy Attendance in these classes is optional, but the desire to make good use of the opportunity thus offered seems to be general. Each student is taught practically how to use the microscope, to cut and stain sections of tissues, to examine urine and blood, etc. In addition to a knowledge of microscopic manipulation thus obtained, it is found that students can get a far clearer idea of morbid anatomy and pathology in this way. Text-book.âReese's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology; Playfair's Midwifery last edition); Strumpell's Practice of Medicine; Flint's or Loomis's Physical Diagnosis; Grees Pathology; Friedlander's Practical Microscopy. INSTRUCTION IN THE DISPENSARY. A Free Dispensary is now in operation at the University, under the charge of the Medical Professors. Here the students are taught the methods of examining patients, and the changes which occur in the normal functions of the body as a result of disease. In recognition of the impossibility of giving practical instruction by the ordinary clinical lectures, the class is divided into sections, so that each student may have the opportunity of examining patients for himself, under the guidance of the Professor. In addition to the patients who come to the MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Dispensary, others who are too sick to attend there are visited at their homes. ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. The attention of students of Medicine is called to the great value of the course in Analytical Chemistry (p. 33) as a desirable enlargement of their professional training. The Special Courses in Medical Chemistry and Practical Pharmacy are designed particularly for students of Medicine, and the latter is given without additional charge, except for laboratory material, to such of them as engage to attend the entire course. EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of two sorts; oral examinations (daily), and written examinations (Intermediate and Final.) The value of the daily examination or recitation on the subject of the preceding lecture is very great. On the one hand students who would not otherwise take advantage of their opportunities for instruction are thereby stimulated to increased exertion. On the other the recitation gives the Professor an opportunity of finding out difficulties which the student may have encountered in the previous lecture, and of correcting erroneous impressions which he may have formed. The intermediate written examinations stimulate the student to frequent reviews, and familiarize him with the form of the examinations for graduation, and the best methods of preparing for them. The examinations for graduation are rigid written examinations, in which the answers to the questions must be full and comprehensive. Besides these examinations, there is a general oral review at the very close of the session on all the different branches on which the student has graduated during either that session or some preceding one; this is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. The Faculty have introduced these oral reviews partly to prepare students more thoroughly for the State Examinations in Virginia, and the other States which hold such examinations, as well as for entrance into the Medical Corps of the Army and Navy and the Marine Hospital service. REQUISITES FOR GRADUATION. Graduation in Medicine, as in the other Departments and Schools of the University of Virginia, does not depend upon the time which has been spent in the study of medicine, but upon the preparation of the MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. student, as indicated by rigid examinations, which he is called upon to stand. Hence it is possible for a diligent student to graduate in one session. But the severe and protracted labor necessary for this purpose is attended with evils of which the medical faculty is fully conscious; and it is considered far better for a student to attend lectures for two sessions, giving his attention during the first session to the subjects of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physiology especially, and endeavoring to obtain only such a general knowledge of the other branches, as will better enable him to complete the course and to profit by the instruction of the second year. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the Medical Department are for the session of nine months as follows: University Feesâ Matriculation, $ 25 Infirmary Fee, 7 Dormitory Rent [two in a room], 15 Tuition, 110 Total of Fees, $157 Living Expensesâ Fuel, Lights and Washing, 25 Board at $12 a Month, 108 Total necessary expenses (board at $12), $290 Payable on entrance, $210 The sum payable on entrance includes a contingent deposit of $10 which is credited in final settlement and hence forms no part of the necessary expenses. This deposit is assessed for damage to property, violation of Library rules and so on. To the above total must be added the cost of books, stationery and dissecting instruments, about $45 for the entire course, and the cost of a degree, which if taken is $15. The books purchased will be of permanent value to the student as part of his professional library. The board at $12 is plain, but wholesome and abundant. Better board can be had at $14, $16, $18 a month. At $18 the total necessary expenses will be $344 of which $228 is payable on entrance. For the entire course if taken in one year the necessary expenses including books will be $335 to $389 according to the price paid for board; if taken in two years they will be $625 to $733. DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY. J. W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., F. R. S., Professor of General Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. W. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Acting Professor of Botany. W. B. TOWLES, M. D., Professor of Materia Medica. This Department is designed to furnish thorough and practical instruction in the practice of Pharmacy and in the sciences on which its principles rest. For this purpose ample facilities are provided in the Scientific and Medical Departments, both in the way of teaching and in material equipment. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The following classes constitute the complete course in Pharmacy. The work of each will be found described in detail elsewhere in this catalogue, on the pages referred to. General Chemistry:âThis coincides with the class in General Chemistry described at page 32. Analytical Chemistry:âThis coincides with the work of the First Course in Analytical Chemistry (page 33) substituting practice in the Preparation of Medicines and the Detection of Adulterations for Fire Assaying and Determinative Mineralogy. Candidates for the degree in Pharmacy are also required to take the Special Courses in Medical Chemistry and Practical Pharmacy. For these no additional charge is made. Botany:âThis coincides with the class in Botany described at p. 36. Materia Medica:âThis coincides with the class in Materia Medica described at page 48. The method of instruction is by systematic lectures, daily oral and periodical written examinations. With this is combined the study of assigned portions of suitable text-books, and in the laboratory courses a large amount of practical work performed under the supervision of the professor. DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY. EQUIPMENT. The equipment consists in a very complete collection of chemical and apparatus for illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry; large and well arranged chemical laboratory with all the necessary fittings and apparatus; a museum of Botany and an extensive herbarium; and a full set of specimens of Materia Medica. DEGREE. Candidates for the degree of Graduate in Pharmacy are required to complete the work of all of the above classes. A well-trained and laborious student will be able to do this in a single session of nine months. But it is generally advisable to devote two sessions to the work, in order to secure additional practice in the laboratory courses. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Pharmacy are for the session of nine months as follows (page 69): University Feesâ Matriculation, $ 25 Infirmary Fee, 7 Dormitory Rent [two in a room], 15 Tuition, 115 Total of Fees, $162 Living Expensesâ Fuel, Lights and Washing, 25 Board at $12 a Month, 108 Total necessary expenses (board at $12) $295 Payable on entrance, $215 The sum payable on entrance includes a contingent deposit of $10 which is credited in final settlement, and hence forms no part of the necessary expenses. This deposit is assessed for damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on. Virginians save $40 in tuition. To the above total must be added the cost of books and stationery, and of the degree if taken. The board at $12 is plain but wholesome and abundant. Better board can be had at $14, $16, $18 a month. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT W. M. THORNTION, Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. JAMES S. MILLER, Instructor in Pure Mathematics and Physics. This Department is designed to furnish intending, engineers thorough and practical instruction in the principles of Engineering and the sciences connected therewith. For this purpose, in addition to the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Natural History and Geology, and Analytical Chemistry, the School of Mathematics Applied to Engineering has been established. For the first five Schools the courses of instruction are given in detail in the Scientific Department. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Prof. Thornton. The Course of Instruction in this School embraces the following subjects. In each there is an elementary or Junior Course and an advanced or Senior Course distinguished by numbers. In the Junior courses only elementary mathematical methods are employed. In the Senior courses use is made to a limited extent of Coordinate Geometry and the Infinitesimal Calculus.

[The course in Mining is not required for the degree of C. E.; the course in Public Works and the Senior course in Construction are not required for the degree of M. E. The courses marked with * constitute the course in Agricultural Engineering.] ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. Instruction in the foregoing subjects is conveyed by a course of systematic lectures, combined with assiduous practice in the field and at the drawing-board, continued throughout the course. In the Lecture Course, after careful elucidation of fundamental principles, the rules of construction are deduced, and applied to the criticism of existing structures and the design of proposed works. Typical examples are selected, based usually on engineering works in course of actual construction; the loads upon these are determined, the straining actions accurately computed, and the structures designed complete in every detail. In the Field Course the adjustments and use of the instruments are carefully taught, and the student, after a thorough drill in the methods of measuring and estimating lengths, altitudes and angles, is required to execute for himself surveys of lands, buildings, and topography; to locate lines for railways, highways and canals; and to set out earthworks and masonry. In the Course of Design the easy and accurate use of pen and brush is first acquired by exercises in projective and topographic drawing. The student is then required, from assigned data, to compute the dimensions of proposed structures, and on the basis of his computations to prepare bills of material, and general and detailed drawings of the works; to draw up specifications and furnish estimates of quantities. To facilitate the instruction in this department, the University has provided a commodious and well-lighted lecture room and drawing hall, a liberal supply of field instruments of the best construction, and models and drawings of a large variety of structures, illustrating the best practice of modern engineers, American and foreign. The preparation essential for students who desire to enter this School is a good working knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Geometry, both Plane and Solid, and Plane Trigonometry. And in the course of instruction elementary mathematical methods are mainly employed. Nevertheless students of engineering are encouraged to take the complete course in Pure Mathematics (p. 29) and those who acquire this sound mathematical training will find their powers of dealing with the more complex questions of their profession greatly augmented thereby. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. DEGREES. The requirements for the degrees of Civil Engineer and Mining Engineer will be found elsewhere (p. 66.) By a well-trained and diligent student either of these two courses can be completed in two sessions. But in most cases the distribution of the work over three sessions will be exceedingly advantageous, especially to students whose mathematical training is imperfect. For the first-year course in any case Junior Applied Mathematics, Junior and Intermediate Pure Mathematics and Chemistry are recommended. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student of Civil Engineering who proposes to complete the course in two sessions are for each session of nine months as follows: University Feesâ Matriculation, $ 25 Infirmary Fee, 7 Dormitory Rent [two in a room], 15 Tuition, [average charge] 100 Total Fees, $147 Living Expensesâ Fuel, Lights and Washing, 25 Board at $12 a Month, 108 Total necessary expenses (board at $12), $280 Payable on entrance, $200 The sum payable on entrance includes a contingent deposit of $10 which is credited in final settlement, and hence forms no part of the necessary expenses. This deposit is assessed for damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on. Virginians save $50 in tuition. To the above total must be added the cost of books and stationery. The board at $12 is plain but wholesome and abundant. Better board can be had at $14, $16, $18 a month. At $18 the total necessary expenses will be $334 of which $218 is payable on entrance.

The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in rust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture in the University, this Department was organized in 1869. The above-named Professors constitute the Faculty of the Agricultural Department. The Courses of Instruction in this Department are two: an Introductory or Junior Course and an Advanced or Senior Course. Junior Course: 1. Biology [page 36.] 2. Physics [page 31.] 3. General Chemistry [page 32.] 4. Geology and Mineralogy [page 35.] Senior Course: 1. Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry [page 33.] 2. Industrial Chemistry [page 32.] 3. Scientific and Practical Agriculture [page 36.] 4. Agricultural Engineering [page 56.] AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. The Method of Instruction is by systematic lectures, daily oral and periodical written examinations. With this is combined the study of assigned portions of suitable text-books, and in the laboratory courses a large amount of practical work performed under the supervision of the professor. Miller Scholarships:âIn honor of the founder of the Agricultural Department there is awarded at the end of each session the Miller Agricultural Scholarship, tenable during the two following sessions. The emoluments consist of $250 a session with free tuition in the Schools of the Agricultural Department. The scholarship is awarded to that student who in the year of his candidacy obtains distinction in all the classes of the Junior Course of Agricultural Studies and receives the highest aggregate of marks in that course. During his tenure of the scholarship the Miller Scholar must give evidence to the Faculty of good conduct and suitable progress in study. He must pursue during the first year of his Scholarship studies selected from the Senior Course. During his second year he must complete the remaining studies of that course, and may add under direction of the Faculty other University work proportioned to his powers. Degrees:âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture are required to complete all the studies of both courses They are advised to take the studies of the Junior Course for the first year and to distribute the studies of the advanced course over two more years. The Chair of Biology and Agriculture will be filled at the approaching meeting of the Visitors in June, 1888, and the details of the courses of instruction will be announced as soon as possible after the appointment of the professor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">EXAMINATIONS. EXAMINATIONS. Besides the daily examination upon the previous lecture, two General Examinations of each class are held during the session, which every member is required to stand. The Intermediate Examination occurs near the middle of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the first part of the course. The Final Examination occurs near the end of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the second part of the course only, or upon those of the entire course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions have numerical values affixed. If the answers at any general examinatiod amount in value to three-fourths of the aggregate value of the questions, a Distinction is awarded to the student, and the fact published at the close of the session. Examination for a Proficiency or for Graduation usually coincides with a general examination. The general and graduating examinations are conducted in each School by the Professor, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for that School. They are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for a student, without steady diligence, to attain a Distinction, and candidates for a Proficiency or for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures and correlative text. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at both daily and general examinations are taken into account in estimating his qualification for the certificate or diploma. No entrance examination is required except for Academical students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirements for these examinations are stated elsewhere [page 41.]</field>

      <field name="fulltext">EQUIPMENTS. EQUIPMENTS. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since much enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 48,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the library for six hours daily, to attend to their wants. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult the library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, the copying of titles, or passages from authors, etc. A letter on this subject, addressed to James B. Baker, Librarian, will receive attention. LEWIS BROOKS MUSEUM. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the subjects of Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology and Botany. Its primary object is to serve as an aid in teaching Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, while at the same time, it offers a large variety of subjects for special study. In Geology the collections are large and well selected. The specimens of rocks show all the different kinds classified according to mineral character, and the formations in which they occur. The collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc, is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. The science of Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of objects, such as mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc; the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. EQUIPMENTS. LEANDER McCORMICK OBSERVATORY. The astronomical observatory is situated upon a elevation, known a Mt. Jefferson, which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda, surmounted by a revolving hemispherical dome 45 feet in diameter, constructed by Warner and Swasey, and contains a Clark refractor of 26 inch aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a 3 inch Fauth transit and a 4 inch Kahler equatorial. [See page 37.] CHEMICAL LABORATORY. A building planned and erected for the purpose is exclusively used as a chemical lecture-room and laboratory. It is completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. A very large number of specimens, constituting a Museum of Industrial Chemistry, has been collected, at much expense and pains, in this country, England, France and Germany, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the Arts and Manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. (See page 32.) PHYSICAL LABORATORY. A suitable room has been assigned to this object by the Board of Visitors. The needful fittings have been partly provided, and its thorough equipment will be pushed forward as rapidly as funds for the purpose can be obtained. (See page 31.) UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. The unfinished Chapel, built by general subscription, will be completed as soon as the necessary funds are in hand; about $2,000 remain to be raised. EXPENSES. EXPENSES.

Thereafter he may change his boarding house at the end of any or every month. EXCHANGE OF SCHOOLS. Students are permitted to exchange Schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission. Thereafter no exchange is allowed except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. WITHDRAWAL FROM A SCHOOL. No student can drop a class in a School without the permission of the professor of that School. Nor can he give up any School without the permission of the Faculty. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY. No portion of a student's University fees is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health. ABSENCE FROM LECTURE. A student is not permitted to absent himself from any lecture or examination without valid excuse, nor from the University without special leave from the Chairman. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may especially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest or prompt in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administed with a view to confirm REGULATIONS. integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They strictly forbid drunkenness, gaming, dissoluteness, swearing, habits of expense and the introduction of wine or other intoxicating drinks into the University. They require a decorous observance of Sunday, and forbid all outdoor sports on that day. They forbid the use or possession by a student of fire arms or other weapons, and the introduction of them into the University precincts. EXCLUSION OF A STUDENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY. If in the opinion of the Faculty any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfil them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes or from habitual idleness or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defence. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited, (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing), to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the students. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited . . . for the benefit of the University of Virginia . . . The State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safe keeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." LEGAL TITLE OF THE UNIVERSITY. "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia."</field>
