ANNOUNCEMENTS. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted primarily for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional and life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. There were 1,350 regularly registered students in the session of 1911 besides a large number of visitors. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 A. M. to 1:30 P. M., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 P. M. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopÃ¦dias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics, by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, and a brief prayer and song service. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday Chapel service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used in this service is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director, who will give daily systematic instruction in physical culture. No fee will be charged for these courses nor for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Cavern; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On all clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 15th and July 20th will be devoted to the study of problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication; improved methods of cooperation; the improvement of sanitary conditions; good roads; etc. Especial emphasis is to be placed on woman's work in the country, and the country preacher. Distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in these conferences. There has been no more helpful, interesting, and vital enterprise connected with the Summer School than this conference. It is of interest not only to the students attending the Summer School, but to county superintendents, progressive farmers, and citizens' improvement leagues. The proceedings of the Conference for last year were published and distributed and there was a wide-spread demand for copies. Many similar conferences have been organized as the result of this one. SUPERINTENDENTS' CONFERENCE.âBeginning June 24th and ending July 6th, there will be held a conference for county and city superintendents. This will be more of a school than a conference because regularly organized work will be offered and a full course of instruction in school administration and its related problems will be provided. Besides regular members of the Summer School faculty, a number of the most successful superintendents of the country will be secured as instructors in this course. Among others, Miss Jessie Field, superintendent of schools, of Page County, Iowa, will spend a week telling of her methods of work. A detailed program will be mailed later to any superintendent who will write for it. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates. At a meeting of the Conference Committee of the Southeastern Passenger Association, the individual lines announced that they would authorize fares for the University Summer School on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 for the round trip. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the applicant should write promptly to the Director of the Summer School. Reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following dates. June 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 24th and 25th, and July 2nd and 3rd. The Southern Railway Company, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, the Norfolk and Western Railway Company, and all railways within this territory will co-operate in the sale of these reduced rate tickets. Application has also been made to the Trans-Continental Passenger Association for similar rates, from the territory west of the Mississippi, and teachers coming from the western states should write to the Director of the Summer School for instructions. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. Announcement of dates will be made later by the Department of Public Instruction. Application has been made to have them correspond with the above. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.00 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred and seventy-five single rooms and fifty double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $4.50 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $7.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 18th. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed-clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of an experienced matron and chaperone. Some member of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.50 week. Those occupying the dormitories are expected to take their meals at the Commons. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee, to Mr. P. M. Chichester, University, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, see page 59. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Thursday, June 20th, at 8:30 A. M. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday unless arranged for by individual instructors, except possibly on Saturday, July 6th, when classes will meet at the usual hour. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Wednesday, July 31, Thursday and Friday, August 1st and 2nd, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to five buildingsâCabell Hall, Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory, Rotunda and the Law Building. REGISTRATION.âWednesday, June 19th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 20th will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours until June 24th. The Registrar's office, located in the southeast rooms of the Rotunda, will be open continuously June 19th, 20th, and 21st, from 8:30 a. m. until 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 26th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 1st and August 1st and 2nd, may enter at any time during the session. Promptly at 9:30 Wednesday morning, June 19th, all applicants for registration will assemble in Cabell Hall for instructions in regard to filling out their cards, the location of lecture rooms, and for consultation with members of the faculty in regard to the courses of study they desire to pursue, or any other matters upon which information is desired. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive a card with space for name and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be presented to the Registrar, after it has been filled out, for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive two cards filled out and signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, together with the fee for each course. The Bursar will sign and return one card to the student, who should present it to the instructors in charge of the courses prescribed on the card. The student, after presenting the card to the various instructors for enrollment in the classes, will retain the same as a receipt from the Bursar, and for future use. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit students to any course not mentioned on their registration cards, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. A tuition fee of five dollars will be charged for admission to each course in the groups denominated on page 18 as receiving University credit or credit on the Summer School Professional Certificate or credit on the Special Certificate. A single fee of ten dollars will be charged for the courses (not more than five) taken in one summer from the group counting towards the Professional Elementary CertificateâGrammar Gradesâ or the Professional Elementary Certificate Primary Gradesârespectively, to all students from other states than Virginia. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by special appropriation that Virginia teachers shall pay only six dollars for the courses (not more than five) from these groups. A single fee of six dollars will be charged for the courses (not more than six) taken from the group of elementary courses which prepare for the First Grade Certificate examination, to all students from other States than Virginia. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by special appropriation that Virginia teachers shall pay only three dollars for the courses (not more than six) selected from this group. Students not desiring credit will be charged at the same rate. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. When all of the certificates issued by the Director, which are required for any State certificate applied for, have been received, the Department of Public Instruction should be notified, and the appropriate state certificate will be issued in exchange for the individual certificates noted above. Notice of the completion of courses counted towards University credit should be made to the Registrar of the University of Virginia. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. (f) Courses which, satisfy the conditions above stated will be credited toward the B. A. and B. S. degrees offered in the College of the University of Virginia as follows: 1. Courses in which not less than thirty (30) hours of lecture instruction are given will be credited as one session hour. 2. Courses in which not less than thirty hours of lecture instruction and not less than sixty (60) hours of laboratory instruction is given will be credited as two sessional hours. (g) No student wishing University credit will be permitted to take more than three courses in one session except by special permission of the Director upon the recommendation of the professors offering the courses he desires to take. The Summer School Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to the Summer School Professional Certificate have been passed by the State Board of Education: "That the work for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall not be given at any of the summer schools except at the University of Virginia Summer School. Entrance to the work leading to the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be restricted to those holding First Grade Certificates or to those holding High School Certificates who have had at least six months teaching experience. To procure such certificate the applicant shall study at the University of Virginia Summer School or one of similar rank for at least two sessions of six weeks each and shall make an average of 75 per cent on class work and examination in six courses other than elementary school subjects. Such certificates shall continue in force for seven years, subject to renewal from time to time. The six courses required shall include at least four subjects. One of the six courses required for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be taken in the subject of English, another shall be taken in Education. The other four courses shall be chosen from any of the following groups, provided that not more than two of the six courses shall be chosen from any one group; Subjects in Industrial Education; Science; Mathematics; History; Education and Philosophy; Language." Note.âIndustrial Education includes Agriculture, Manual Training, Drawing, and Domestic Economy. Special Certificate.âAny teacher who complies with the entrance requirements for the Summer School Professional Certificate as given above, and who attends the University Summer School for two sessions of six weeks each and completes satisfactorily at least one course in Educational Psychology, and in addition three courses in any one subject, to be selected from courses prescribed for this certificate in the University Department, will be given a Special Certificate to teach the subject in which she has specialized. This certificate will be good for five years and renewable from time to time. Professional Elementary Certificates.âTwo Professional Elementary Certificates will be issued by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction: The Professional Elementary CertificateâPrimary Grades; and the Professional Elementary CertificatesâGrammar Grades. These certificates will be issued for a term of seven years and will be renewable for a similar period from time to time. The requirements for entrance to the work leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates are the same as those for the Summer School Professional Certificate as outlined above. In addition to the completion of the courses below leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates, a teacher must have had at least nine months successful experience in Primary or Grammar Grade school teaching, as certified to by her superintendent and principal, before the certificate can be issued. The courses for the Professional Elementary CertificateâPrimary Gradesâmay be selected from the following: Principles of Teaching with special emphasis on "How to Study" (30 periods); Hygiene (30 periods); Music and Games (60 periods); Drawing (30 periods); Primary Industrial Work (30 periods); Observation Work or Practice Teaching (30 periods); Primary Methods in Reading (30 periods), in Language (30 periods); in Arithmetic (30 periods); in Physical Nature Study and Home Geography (60 periods). Note.âThree hundred recitation hours are required for this certificate, i. e., one hundred and fifty hours, or five daily recitations, each summer. Those registering for a course in Music and a course in Games will be credited with sixty hours. The same credit will be allowed those taking Nature Study and Geography. Those taking one section of Education 12 and one of Education 13 will be given credit for sixty hours and may be credited with the fulfillment of the requirements in Reading and one other thirty period course of those required. The same course may not be taken twice for credit. Applicants for this certificate must make at least 75 per cent on class standing and examination in each subject. Special attention is called to the outlines found elsewhere in the catalogue for the work leading to these certificates, and to the carefully selected corps of instructors offering them. The management has endeavored to make the work leading to these certificates an especially strong feature of the Summer School in the belief that it will appeal to the very large number of primary and grammar grade teachers of the South who desire additional professional training for their work. The courses leading to the Professional Elementary Certificateâ Grammar Gradesâmust cover the following: Principles of Teaching including "How to Study" (60 periods); Hygiene (30 periods); Practice Teaching or Advanced Observation (20 periods); Language including Reading and Literature (60 periods); Methods of Teaching the followingâArithmetic (60 periods); Geography (30 periods); Civics and History (30 periods). Thirty periods may be selected from any one of the following: Drawing, or Elementary Agriculture and Schools Gardens, or Manual Training, or Domestic Economy. Songs and Games may also be taken at the option of the student, but without credit. Applicants for this certificate must make at least 75 per cent on class standing and examination in each subject. Note.âThree hundred recitation hours are required for this certificate, i. e., one hundred and fifty hours, or five daily recitations, each summer. The number of hours to be taken in each subject is given above. The same course may not be counted twice.

The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated should be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily exercises will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth.

DRAWING. The classes in drawing are planned to give the teachers of the primary, grammar and high-school grades and supervisors of drawing, a practical knowledge of drawing as now taught in the most modern and progressive schools. The purpose will be to give not only facility in representation but to teach the fundamentals that underlie design, composition, pictorial and imaginative drawing. More emphasis will be placed on composition than on representation and every step will be taken up in turn and definite ways suggested for use in the school room with each lesson. An attempt will be made to suit the courses to the needs of all applicants and especially to the needs of those teachers who fancy they cannot draw. Drawing 1.âThis course is intended for the teachers of grades from one to four, inclusive. This is so arranged that the lessons will be in progressive order, following as closely as possible the development of the child. The classes will be conducted in the following manner: First, the careful explanation of design, its intent and processes: Second, an exhibition of fine examples of work by teachers and children who have already taken the course: Third, processes carried out by the class under the supervision of instructors. First YearâFirst Grade: Cut paper to paste, outline filled in with color, play with water color, copy color natural objects, pose drawing with brush, illustration, doll house furnishing (make wall paper, etc., repeating design).

Educational Psychology and the Principles of Teaching.âInasmuch as the principles of teaching are based upon a working knowledge of the fundamental processes of consciousness the first half of this course is devoted to the study of the facts of mental growth and development as presented in Thorndike's Elements of Psychology with special emphasis upon that portion of the text dealing with Functional Psychology. To control human nature the teacher needs to know it. The second half of this course is devoted to studying how the teacher may best produce and prevent changes in his pupils and thus preserve and increase the desirable qualities of body, intellect and character and get rid of the undesirable. Since the basis of a mind's actionâthe starting point of the life of intellect, feeling and conductâis its equipment of instincts and capacities, its native or unlearned tendencies; especial emphasis is put upon the study of the methods of their control and utilization for ideal ends. Since the mind assimilates knowledge by means of knowledge already acquired many detailed applications of the General Law of Apperception are presented and discussed.

ENGLISH. The courses in English are designed to meet the needs of the following groups of students: present or prospective high school teachers; professional or technical students who have entered upon their professional courses and found that their training in English is so defective as to interfere with their prospects in their chosen professions; students preparing for college entrance examinations; students conditioned on their entrance examinations or in their college courses at other institutions; college professors and instructors who may be especially interested in methods of teaching English; teachers in elementary schools who are interested in language study for small children. It is desirable that all students of English take advantage of the work in composition, upon which special emphasis will be laid. Private conferences for criticism and personal supervision of theme writing will be arranged for by the instructor. 1. English Grammar and Composition.âThis course is designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods of teaching it. An attempt will be made to suggest standards of instruction in grammar and composition. Text-Books.âMeiklejohn's English Grammar (D. C. Heath &amp; Co.); Joyne's Notes on the Parts of Speech (R. L.

Rhetoric and Composition.âThe purpose of this course is three-fold: first, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the text-book, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage among teachers and pupils alike good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. Short themes will frequently be called for and several longer papers required. Weekly personal conferences will be held at hours to be appointed. Text-Books.âEspenshade's Composition and Rhetoric (D. C. Heath); Nutter, Hersey, and Greenough's Specimens of Prose Composition (Ginn &amp; Co.). Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Myers.

It is recommended that any series of language books, and professional works on teaching language, be brought for reference. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Miss Andrews. Cabell Hall, Room 2. 10. Elementary Grammar.âThis course aims primarily at giving teachers a deeper, surer knowledge of the subject matter of grammar, and those completing the work satisfactorily should find themselves thoroughly, prepared for the State examination in this subject. The instruction will cover the work of the seventh and eighth grades. Language will be considered mainly from the functional side, and presented so as to provide training in the actual process of thinking. There will be a condensed study of the essential features of descriptive grammar, with especial emphasis upon the more difficult points âthe abstract noun, the comparison of adjectives, the function of case, the personal pronoun, all phases of analysis, and, above all, the verb and the verbals. Frequent touches of comparative and historical grammar will be employed for the sake of the new light and interest to be gained therefrom. There will be, in addition, some consideration of the historical development of grammar teaching, the function and purpose of grammar, the place of grammar in the elementary schools, the relation of grammar to language work, and grammar as a record of usage rather than a law of usage.

(a) Origin and History of Story Telling.âWork of Scald, Gleeman Rhapsodist and MinstrelâFolk cultureâPrior to Book-Culture. The world's great story books were handed down by word of mouth âthe growth of agesâSiegfried, Beowulf, Hiawatha, Homer's Iliad and OdysseyâKing Arthur, Bible Stories, Folk and Fairy Stories, Uncle RemusâStories from History and Modern Life. (b) Use of the Story.âIn grades, high school, kindergarten, library, Sunday school, play-ground, home. The form and expression of the spiritâretelling dramatization. Culture of ear and tongueâ sensuous beauty of speechâcomposition that comes from heart and imaginationâWe write as we speakâThe larger resultsâSoulâPersonality. (c) How to Tell a Story.âPsychic lawsâImaginationâVivid picturesâSee clearlyâFeelingâEffect on voice and mannerâFeel deeply âThe dynamic in life. Story teller creates anew the story each time. Story telling not reading, reciting or acting, but a creative process. A field of its ownâis one with all art expressions. Speaker and audience become one mind and heart. The value of healthâeffect of social songs and folk-games on the story telling. A lost art revived.âThe most profound method of teaching, and the most natural and universal means of entertaining. Story telling has in it something for every part of education.

The National Story Tellers' League of America has plans on foot to hold here during this session of the Summer School its eighth annual meeting, to which all local leagues are invited to send representatives. WRITING. 1. Muscular Movement Penmanship.âThe teaching of rapid easy business writing is dependent on the proper training of the large tireless muscles of the forearm instead of the incapable little muscles of the fingers. The Palmer Method of Business Writing, which will be used in this course, provides explicit instructions in muscular movement writing and its application to the actual writing of letters and words. The work will be graded to meet the needs of teachers of all grades. Daily, Sections I, II, and III. Mr. Locker. Hours and place to be arranged.
