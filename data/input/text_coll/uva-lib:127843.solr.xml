JOSEPHINE McLEOD, B.A., Diploma, Johns Hopkins Hospital Training School for Nurses, Baltimore, Md., Assistant Professor of Nursing Education. HISTORY The movement to endow a Chair of Nursing at the University of Virginiaâthe first step in the foundation of the Schoolâwas launched in the spring of 1923 by the Graduate Nurses' Association of Virginia. Through the zealous and praiseworthy efforts of this group of women, the sum of $50 000.00 was raised and presented to the University. The chair of Nursing Education was named in honor of Sadie Heath Cabaniss, Virginia's outstanding pioneer nurse. In April, 1928, the first Cabaniss Memorial Professor of Nursing Education was appointed. The school was then placed under the Department of Education and organization begun. Beginning with the academic year of 1928-29, the Cabaniss Memorial School of Nursing Education has offered courses of university grade for graduate nurses. PURPOSE The purpose of the School is to give further preparation to well qualified nurses who desire to better fit themselves as supervisors, administrators or teachers in hospital schools for undergraduate students. There is a very urgent need for more and better-prepared women to fill the hospital positions, not only in Virginia but over the entire country. And the demand for nurses who have prepared themselves by special study for these executive and teaching positions is far in excess of the supply. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training to the individual student, the School of Nursing Education, as part of the State University, offers its services to nursing school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical problems and in the furtherance of nursing education in the State. GENERAL STATEMENT Professional programs are arranged for three groups as follows: 1. Teachers in Schools of Nursing. 2. Supervisors and Head Nurses in Schools of Nursing. 3. Administrators in Schools of Nursing. The courses are planned on a three-year basis leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. Applicants meeting all entrance requirements may secure the maximum credit of a year's work for their course in an approved school of nursing. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS To be admitted to regular standing in the School of Nursing Education, applicants must be registered nurses, graduates of schools of nursing of approved standards and in addition must meet the regular entrance requirements of the University by certificate from an accredited high school or private secondary school, giving the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high school work, or by examination. Furthermore, at least one year of graduate experience in some educational or executive work in schools of nursing is highly desirable for all prospective students. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the School not later than September 1, a Certificate of Preparation made out on a blank form furnished upon request. And a special blank giving applicant's professional training and experience will be required of all students. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. Special Students.âA limited number of graduate nurses of more mature age whose general education has not included a complete high school course may be admitted as special students. But they must present evidence of satisfactory professional and personal qualifications and ability to pursue the courses in Nursing Education successfully. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for the degree, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. College Credit.âA maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work and 33 hours for two years. In no case will credit be given on more than 33 session-hours of work done in another college, and any student who receives this maximum amount of credit must take the remaining 15 session-hours required for her degree in residence in a regular session of nine months in this University. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE IN THE SCHOOL OF NURSING EDUCATION The School of Nursing Education offers only one degree, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. The specific degree requirements, together with a suggested curriculum, are herewith presented: I. Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. A. Required Subjectsâ18 session-hours distributed as follows: 1. Natural Scienceâ6 session-hours in one science. 2. Social Science: (a) Historyâ3 session hours. (b) Sociologyâ3 session-hours. 3. English: (a) English A1â3 session-hours. (b) English B1, or English B2â3 session-hours. B. Education. 6 session-hours which must be Education B1 and Education B2. C. Nursing Education. 12 session-hours, which must include N. Ed. B1 and N. Ed. B2. D. Elective-at-Large. 12-18 session-hours, which may include additional courses in Natural Science, Social Science, English and Education or courses in Foreign Language, Economics, Ethics, Psychology and Hygiene. The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work.

For those students who may wish to pursue graduate work at some future time in the University it is advised that they include a foreign language in their programs for the baccalaureate degreeâas at least six collegiate session-hours of foreign language credit are required as a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree. DESCRIPTION OF COURSES Nursing Education B1: History of Nursing: A study of the development of nursing and the care of the sick from ancient times under religious, military and secular forms of organization, up to the presentâincluding the beginnings and growth of modern professional nursing in England and America and a survey of nursing in foreign countries.

OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING Laboratory facilities for observation and practice teaching are made available through the close proximity and coÃ¶peration of the University of Virginia Hospital School of Nursing. Students of the School of Nursing Education will do observation and directed teaching under the supervision of a member of the University faculty. It is likewise planned that a limited amount of field work in supervision will be made available for those wishing to specialize in this branch of nursing. By these arrangements between the University and the Hospital a very close coÃ¶peration is made possible which should result in mutual benefit to the School of Nursing Education and the Hospital School of Nursing. BOARD AND LODGING There are no University dormitories for women students, but satisfactory arrangements can be made in approved boarding houses near the campus. A list of these private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Bursar. EXPENSES The figures in the following table may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. The necessary expenses included here are University, athletic and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. The student who shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, may possibly reduce expenses below the low estimate.

LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. SCHOLARSHIPS There are a number of scholarships in the University, some of which may be made available for students of Nursing Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. The Isabel Hampton Robb Memorial Fund provides annually a number of scholarships to nurses taking advanced professional work.
