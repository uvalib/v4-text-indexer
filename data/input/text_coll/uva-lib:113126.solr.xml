Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine, Session 1916-1917.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having a four years' course, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course; and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion of at least one year's work in Inorganic (General) Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, at an approved institution of collegiate rank. Candidates for admission will be required also to present satisfactory evidence of a reading knowledge of at least one modern language besides English, preferably German; this requirement may be satisfied either by the presentation of certificates showing the completion of one year of college work following upon two years of high-school work in the same language or by an examination which will test the candidate's reading knowledge of the language. The completion of a year's work in ZoÃ¶logy or Botany will be accepted as satisfying the requirements in Biology. A student may be admitted conditioned on any one of the above subjects except Chemistry, this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in Biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. The number of students in the first-year class is limited to thirty-six. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine beginning with the Session 1917-18.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to furnish evidence of the completion of a four-year course at a recognized public or private high school, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course, and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion at an approved institution of collegiate rank of two years of work of not less than fifteen session-hours each. This college course must include a year's work in each of the following subjects: English (rhetoric, composition, and literature), mathematics (solid geometry and trigonometry), inorganic (general) chemistry, physics, biology, and either German or French. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. A student otherwise qualified may be admitted conditioned upon one of these subjects, the condition to be removed before admission to the second year of the medical course; but no condition may be allowed in chemistry, English, or mathematics. The modern language (German or French) course must be based upon two years of high-school work in that language or its equivalent; but a candidate may absolve the requirement in this subject by demonstrating on examination the possession of a satisfactory reading knowledge thereof. A year's work in either general biology, zoÃ¶logy, or botany will be regarded as satisfying the requirement in biology. ZoÃ¶logy is considered preferable to botany; and it is desirable that the course should include the dissection of a mammal. Facilities for and Methods of Instruction.âIn recent years many additions have been made to the laboratory facilities of the Department, so that there are now well-equipped laboratories for the study of Organic and Physiological Chemistry, Gross Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Bacteriology and Pathology, Physiology, Pharmacology, Materia Medica, and Clinical Diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to the laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Dispensary are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced, in the third year, to the study of disease in living persons. In the dispensary and in the hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, text-books, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course; if it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 2,400 cases. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the Department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Section of the Philosophical Society reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass the next examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth-year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record "conditioned" is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or the third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this University, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Organic Chemistry, 15 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Physiological Chemistry, 8 points. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points; Pharmacology, 8 points. Whenever in the judgment of the faculty a student is receiving too many records below the grade of "Passed," the faculty may prescribe special conditions upon which the student may remain in the Department of Medicine, or may require his withdrawal therefrom. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of "failed") more than two times. A second record of "failed" on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this department in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the subsequent paragraph on Examinations. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record of "conditioned" on a course taken in this University. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, who satisfy the requirements stated under "Advanced Standing," and meet the above conditions of this section. The Fall Examinations for 1916-1917 begin September eleventh and close September sixteenth. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe tuition fees for students entering the Department of Medicine prior to September, 1912, are $110 for the first year, $100 for the second year, $80 for the third year, and $60 for the fourth year. For students entering after September 1, 1912, the tuition fee for each year is $100. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the University fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $265 for living expenses, and $30 for books. In the courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this University. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. One will be awarded in September, 1917, and another in September, 1918. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labour, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least two hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR Anatomy 1.âSix hours weekly until November 1st; twelve hours weekly from November 1st to the end of the winter term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part (either the head and neck with the upper extremity and thorax, or the lower extremity and abdomen) is assigned to each student for dissection and study; for this purpose each cadaver is considered as composed of four parts. On the completion of this course and Anatomy 3 each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. Emphasis is placed upon the benefit to be derived by the student who obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. While practical dissection and the consideration of topographical relations make up the essential features of the course, there are occasional lectures and frequent recitations, followed by a final written examination in March. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Whitehead. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the spring term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. For the purposes of the course the laboratory is well equipped. Fresh brains are obtained each year from the dissecting material of the department; and several excellent series of sections of the cord and brain both of infants and adults stained by the Weigert-Pal method are thoroughly used. The laboratory work is supplemented by recitations and occasional lectures. Dr. Whitehead. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the fall and winter terms. The student's record in the course will depend upon his recitations, laboratory drawing books, and final examinations, both written and practical. The course aims to acquaint the student primarily with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues, and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied; and the relation of the whole subject of histology to pathology is never lost sight of. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. The laboratory is excellently equipped with microscopes, paraffin baths, microtomes, a micropolariscope, a projectoscope and other accessories essential to the most favorable presentation of this course. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan, assisted by Mr. Pagenstecher. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the spring term. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) is accompanied by lectures, recitations, and the study of models and text-books. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and maliormations. The close correlation of obstetrics is recognized, and a correct knowledge of the fetus and its membranes is taught from the embryological approach. The course is made as practical as possible for the student and practitioner of medicine. It begins with a consideration of maturation phenomena, fertilization, segmentation, and the development of the germ-layers. The study is made chiefly upon the ova and early stages of an invertebrate, followed by a comparison in an amphibian. The chick is used for the primary relations of the systems to one another; and this is followed by the study of pig embryos, where each system is taken up separately and the organology and histogenesis of its parts are studied. Finally, the fetal membranes and their relations to the fetus and uterus are studied in their variations among the amniota. Dr. Jordan, assisted by Mr. Pagenstecher. Organic Chemistry.âLectures and recitations three hours weekly, laboratory work six and eight hours weekly respectively during the fall and winter terms. This course includes the systematic study of organic chemistry or the chemistry of the compounds of carbon, with special reference to substances of importance in their relation to medicine. The object of this course of study is to familiarize the student with the more important organic compounds and with the methods at present employed in chemical synthesis and to lay the foundation for subsequent work in Physiological Chemistry, Pharmacology, etc., etc. During the second term certain qualitative and quantitative work of immediate importance in physiological chemistry is introduced into the course. This includes, among other things, the reactions of carbohydrates, the quantitative determination of sugar (Fehling and Benedict), total nitrogen (Kjeldahl), uric acid (Hopkins-Folin), ammonia (Folin, and formaldehyde methods), chlorids, and total acidity of urine (Folin). A record of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiological Chemistry. Dr. Edgar and Dr. Pratt. Physiological Chemistry.âThree lectures, three recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the spring term. This course has for its object to afford instruction in the fundamentals of physiological chemistry, especially the chemical structure, properties, and reactions of the more important compounds with which the student must deal in his subsequent studies of physiology. The laboratory work, continuing that upon the carbohydrates and the quantitative methods given in the laboratory of Organic Chemistry, consists of the thorough study of the properties of the fats, soaps, fatty acids, and proteins, and of the more important members of each of these groups; the composition of blood, milk, and bile; the action of the more important digestive enzymes and of the bile; and the chemistry of the urine. Accurate quantitative determinations are required of creatinin (Folin), creatin (Benedict), and of urea, ammonia, uric acid, etc., by the microchemical methods of Folin. After this the class in sections carries out analyses of 24-hour urines, these analyses including, in duplicate, all the quantitative determinations which have previously been learned. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough and assistant. SECOND YEAR Anatomy 3.âTen hours weekly from October 1st through the fall and winter terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. Dr. Reeves. Physiology.âFour hours weekly of lectures, recitations and demonstrations throughout the year; six hours weekly of laboratory work in the fall and winter terms. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition; excretion; the sense organs; and the central nervous system. The laboratory is equipped with kymographs, induction coils, signals, muscle and heart levers, tambours, manometers, apparatus for gas analysis, etc., for thirty men work at one time in pairs. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures and is an integral part of the study of each subject. The student becomes practically acquainted with the methods of modern physiological investigation and is required to hand in tracings or other records, together with full description of his experiments. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work is necessary to a clear record on the course, as is the passing of the final examinations. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of seventy per cent. in Histology and in Physiological Chemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough and Mr. Neff, assisted by Mr. Setzler. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the year, and two additional hours a week in the third term. In Bacteriology the student is taught to prepare culture media and to employ the usual methods necessary for the isolation and identification of bacteria, and he studies the microÃ¶rganisms concerned in the common bacterial diseases. After a few days have been spent in making culture media, sterilization, etc., the general technique is learned by isolating the bacteria from the air, soil, water and milk, and from exposed body surfaces. Bacterial counts are made from water and milk. Following this, the pathogenic bacteria are taken up serially. Those receiving special attention are the bacteria concerned in wound infections, in respiratory and intestinal diseases, and in tuberculosis. At intervals mixed cultures are given out to the class and the students are required to isolate and identify the bacteria in the mixtures. Experimental work upon infection and immunity accompanies the course in Bacteriology and Pathology. The students inoculate animals with certain pathogenic bacteria and report to the class upon the course of disease resulting from the inoculation. In fatal cases the students perform autopsies upon the experimental animals and attempt to recover the bacteria in cultures. Sections are made from the organs of the animals which succumb to inoculation and are studied by the students. Groups of students prepare vaccines and immunize animals. The serum of these animals is employed by the class in studying the technique of the more important immunity reactions. In this way the work in Bacteriology is integrally combined with the work in Pathology, the two courses overlapping. The lectures and quizzes which accompany the laboratory work are designed to set forth clearly the relations existing between bacteria and disease and to give a knowledge of the fundamental facts and theories of immunity and of the important principles of preventive medicine. The course in Pathology extends from January to June. The greater part of the practical work is devoted to the study of the microscopic changes occurring in disease. This is supplemented by the study of autopsy material and museum specimens. Selected types of diseases are studied experimentally. The practical work includes the consideration of the vascular disturbances, degeneration, inflammation, regeneration, and of benign and malignant tumors. The diseases produced by animal parasites are considered briefly. During the course the student has an opportunity to learn the standard methods employed in preparing tissues for examination, and he is called upon to witness and assist in the autopsies. Both in Bacteriology and Pathology frequent recitations are held and the standing of the student is determined largely upon these and from the character of his daily practical work. In addition to the regular course outlined above, opportunity is afforded for qualified students and doctors to engage in advanced work. A special room is reserved for this purpose. The work in Pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of eighty per cent. in Histology. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Haralson, assisted by Mr. Moore and Mr. Gilmore. Pharmacology.âFive hours of lectures, recitations, and demonstrations and six hours of laboratory work during the third term. In this course a study is made of the chemical characteristics and physiological action of representative drugs from the different pharmacological groups. An average grade of seventy per cent on the first two terms of Physiology together with the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell and Mr. Neff. Journals.âIn connection with the work in Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology the second-year students meet with their instructors for one hour each week from the first of December to the end of the session for reports and discussion of the current literature of the above sciences. Three reports are made at each meeting by the students. Physical Diagnosis.âFour hours weekly during the spring term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is especially given to study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin. THIRD YEAR Materia Medica.âThree hours of lectures and recitations and four hours of laboratory work weekly during the first half of the third year. The more important drugs and preparations of the Pharmacopeia, together with newer non-official remedies which bid fair to attain or have attained considerable use, form the subject of study. In the laboratory the student becomes familiar with the peculiarities and methods of preparation of the different preparations of the pharmacopeia, as well as with the solubilities and other characteristics of the more important drugs. Especial attention is paid to chemical and pharmaceutical incompatibility. Prescription writing is dealt with by lecture and frequent practical exercises. Dr. Waddeli. and Mr. Faris. Toxicology.âThree hours of lectures and recitation and three hours of laboratory work weekly during the last half of the second term. This course is, to a considerable extent, a review of the pharmacological actions of poisons and their antagonists. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Some attention is given to the methods of separation and identification. Dr. Waddell and Mr. Faris. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the fall and winter terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those modern laboratory methods which are practically helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the systematic examination of blood, sputum, urine, gastric contents, feces, exudates, transudates, and milk. The student is not only required to understand the methods employed in such examinations, but by practice to acquire the skill necessary for accurate results. The instruction is given in the Clinical Laboratory, situated in the north wing of the hospital. This laboratory is well equipped with instruments and apparatus, and the wards of the Hospital furnish ample material for the proper presentation of the subject. Dr. Bray and Dr. Duggins. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the year; nine hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the dispensary and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the dispensary and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater for the third- and fourth-year students. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Magruder, and Dr. Nelson. Surgery and Gynecology.âFive hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session, with six hours weekly in the dispensary for one-half the session. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the Principles and Practice of Surgery, Surgical Diseases, Surgical Diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialties, Orthopedics, Genito-urinary Surgery, etc. The dispensary course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia, and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the dispensary affords practice in palpation, diagnosis, and treatment. Dr. Watts and Dr. Goodwin. Obstetrics.âThree hours weekly of lectures, recitations, and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with living subjects in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position, and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. FOURTH YEAR Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. The records thus obtained are kept up by the student assigned to the case, which he is expected to follow until its discharge. The accuracy and completeness with which this is done constitutes a large element in the determination of fitness for graduation. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time between them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly supplemented by clinical work during the fall term. In this course is given also instruction in electro-therapeutics. Dr. Davis. Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly supplemented by clinical work during the winter term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. Instruction in the practical details of the subject is given by the work at the dispensary and in the wards of the hospital. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Dermatology.âA brief course of lectures is given on this subject embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical practice. After a brief review of the anatomic and histologic structure and of the physiology of the skin, the diseases most commonly met with are discussed. The clinical material available at the University Dispensary is utilized to the best advantage to give the students a practical working knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of affections of the skin. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the spring term. Dr. Davis. Therapeutics.âTwo lectures weekly during the fall and winter terms, with five hours weekly of ward rounds for one-half the session. The treatment of internal diseases is discussed in a systematic course of lectures and practically demonstrated in the wards of the hospital. Especial attention is given to the clinical side of the teaching of this subject, the student being required to suggest treatment for cases assigned to him and to follow closely and make a record of the results of the therapeutic agents employed throughout the course of the disease. The course includes a discussion of the preparation of food for the sick; demonstrations of the preparation of stupes, plasters, and poultices; and the methods of giving therapeutic baths, electric treatment, massage, and other therapeutic measures. Dr. Flippin Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; three hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take, make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complication, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available, and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offer many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting, witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and recording the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts and Dr. Goodwin. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery. Surgical Pathology.âTwo hours weekly during one-half of the year. The work in this course comprises lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, with especial emphasis upon the clinical diagnosis of tumors and inflammations, the examination of microscopic sections, and the study of fresh tissues in the gross, obtained from the operating room. The purpose of the course is to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery, and to acquaint the student with the appearance of fresh pathological material from surgical cases. Dr. Goodwin. Clinical Pathological Conferences.âOne hour weekly is assigned for the study of pathologic material in connection with the clinical aspects of cases coming to autopsy. A history of the case is presented by the student in charge, the autopsy is reviewed, the tissue and microscopic sections are examined, and all the information thus derived is collated and contrasted. Dr. Marshall. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, is required to prepare the history of patients, and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. Dr. Macon. Forensic Medicine.âOne lecture weekly during the term of the fourth year. Dr. Waddell. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly from the beginning of the session to the first of March, supplemented by regular clinics twice weekly throughout the year and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. No attempt is made to train specialists, but every effort is made to render the class familiar with such common diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat as the general practitioner meets in his daily work. To this end the class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head-mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. At the operations in the hospital only as many students are allowed to be present as can really see and appreciate what is being done. Valuable work is also given in the dissecting room, where the technic of operative work is shown in a way that can not be employed with the living patient. Students do this work as far as possible for themselves, especially in tracheotomy and intubation of the larynx. Finally the attempt is made so to ground the student in the anatomy, physiology, general pathology, and in methods of examination and treatment that he may diagnose and treat intelligently many of the cases that can not afford to go to a perhaps distant specialist; that he may treat successfully that large class of emergency cases that first come to the general practitioner and in which immediate treatment is imperative; and, lastly, that he may recognize and intelligently refer those cases that need the services of one especially trained to this branch of work. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. Hygiene.âThree hours weekly throughout the year. The course begins with a historical sketch of the development of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL This hospital is the property of the University, and is under the exclusive control of its medical faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, devoted to the purposes of administration, and two wings. The administration building contains, on the main floor, reception and consultation rooms, an amphitheater and private operating rooms, with sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms attached, and an X-ray room. The upper floors furnish accommodation for the nurses of the training school, while the basement contains the heating plant, laundry, kitchen, etc. From this building corridors in three stories lead out to the wards. These wards, having a capacity of about eighteen beds each, are beautifully lighted, have direct indirect hot-water radiators, and forced ventilation. Opening from each ward on the east is a large protected porch, of great value to convalescents. The south wind has been in use for several years; the north wing, completed in 1907, gives the hospital a capacity of about 100 beds, 80 of these being in the public wards. A new wing, now in process of construction, will be occupied by the session 1916-17, and will add materially to the capacity and equipment. The equipment throughout is new, and conforms in all respects to the best usage of the day. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated dispensary, constitutes a valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Medical School. The variety of cases presented, and more especially the opportunities offered for a thorough study of the individual case, afford unusually satisfactory conditions for clinical instruction. HOSPITAL STAFF Hospital Board: Drs. Whitehead, Davis, Watts, Hedges, Macon, Marshall, Compton, Flippin, Goodwin. Visiting Staff: The visiting staff consists of the Hospital Board and the Clinical Instructors in the Dispensary. Director of the Hospital: Dr. Watts. House Surgeon: Dr. Neff. Assistant House Surgeon and Roentgenologist: Dr. Woodberry. Internes: Drs. Anderson, Fitchett, Gage and Howard. Acting Superintendent of Nurses: Miss T. S. Grier. Assistant Superintendent: Miss M. L. Hamner. Night Superintendent: Miss Clarissa Canfield. In Charge of Operating Room: Miss Dorothy Stranger. Dietetic Nurse: Mrs. G. G. Montague. Pathologists: Dr. Marshall and Dr. Haralson. THE DISPENSARY CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS Dr. Flippin, Chief of Dispensary. Dr. Magruder. Dr. Compton. Dr. Hedges. Dr. Goodwin. Dr. Davis. Dr. Rea. Dr. Nelson. During the summer of 1913 the dispensary building was remodeled and the service reorganized. Separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients have been provided and the floor space has been arranged to provide additional rooms for the different services and separate examination rooms for male and female patients. The chief of dispensary is present each afternoon during the regular hours to receive and properly refer patients and to arrange for the work of the students. The students are divided into sections and are required to examine, record, treat, and follow each case that comes to the clinic. The work is done under the close personal supervision of the clinical instructors. Each third-year student attends the medical and surgical clinics every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons, and each fourth-year student the eye, ear, nose and throat clinics on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons throughout the session. A nurse is detailed from the hospital each afternoon to be present at the examination and treatment of patients, as required. The coÃ¶peration of the district nurse in Charlottesville has been secured and the dispensary has in this way become an integral part of the charitable work of the community. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES This school was established in 1901, and its first class was graduated in June, 1903. Its aim is to give young women, desirous of acquiring the art of nursing, the same care and thorough training in their calling which is now afforded young men studying the science of medicine. Instruction in the primary branches of medicine is given to pupil nurses by the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, while the clinical instructors at the University Hospital give lectures upon their respective courses. Three years is the required time for graduation, and all candidates must enter prepared to go through the full course of instruction and hospital training. Candidates for the school should apply in their own handwriting to the Superintendent of Nurses, University Hospital, University, Va. These applications must be accompanied by certificates of good character, good health, and sufficient education to profit by the instruction offered. No candidate under twenty-one years of age or over thirty-five will be received. REGISTER OF STUDENTS FIRST-YEAR CLASS Albert, Richard Edward Portsmouth, Va. Bailey, Benjamin Franklin Ft.
