Every student may select the schools he will attend; but, in the academic department, he is required to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission; thereafter, no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the first of October, and continues, without interruption, until the Thursday before the fourth day of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. CATALOGUE. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. I.âSCHOOL OF LATIN. PROF. PETERS.

Butler's Analogy and Sermons. Three lectures each week are given. V.âSCHOOL OF HISTORY, GENERAL LITERATURE AND RHETORIC. PROFESSOR HOLMES. This School is divided into two distinct classes, one of History, and one of Literature and Rhetoric. To each, two Lectures in the week are regularly devoted; but exercises in literary composition are required from the members of the Literary class. Each study may be pursued separately. In the Historical Class the successions, revolutions and various aspects of the principal nations of the world are considered in such a manner as to afford a general and connected view of the progress of political and social organizations. Institutions and laws are noted as the manifestations of different phases of society; an attempt is made to discover and elucidate the conditions of historical advancement and to refer the changes of nations and governments to the operation of regular principles. In the abs nce of appropriate text-books, the following are employed for study and reference: Schmitz's Manual of Ancient History; Smith's History of Greece; Gibbon Abridged by Smith; Taylor's Manual of Modern History. For reference: Long's Ancient Atlas; Appleton's (College) Atlas, or Chamber's Atlas; Blair's Chronology, (Bohn's edition.) In the Class of Literature and Rhetoric, the English Language, English Composition, Rhetoric and the English Classics, with the History of English Literature, are studied. The origin, growth and philological peculiarities of the Language will be considered; the various influences, domestic and external, by which it has been brought to its present condition, will be explained; the general principles of Rhetoric and Criticism will be taught; the lives of the most eminent authors in the language will UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. be studied in their historical order and connection; and the critical examination and appreciation of their chief productions will occupy much of the time of the student. The class will also be required to practise Literary Composition. Text-Books in this department are very deficient. The following will be used for the present: Angus's Hand Book of the English Tongue; Jamieson's Grammar of Rhetoric; Shaw's Complete Manual of English Literature, Ed. Smith and Tuckerman; Student's Specimens of English Literature, Ed. Shaw and Smith, London. Shakspeare's Complete Works; Milton's Poetical Works. POLITICAL ECONOMY. In the Class of Political Economy, temporarily connected with this school, the Text-Books heretofore and still used are Say's Political Economy, Mill's (J. S.) Political Economy. Two Lectures a week are given. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. VI.âSCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR VENABLE. In this school there are four classes: In the first, or Junior Class, the subjects of study are Arithmetic and Theory of Notation, Algebra, Geometry and Geometrical Conic Sections. Though Algebra and Geometry are commenced in this class, it is very desirable that those who enter it should have previously pursued the study of Algebra through equations of the second degree, and of Geometry through the first four books of Legendre. In the second, or Intermediate Class, the subjects of study are Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with applications to Navigation and Nautical Astronomy, Descriptive Geometry, Analytical Geometry of two Dimensions and Theory of Equations. In the third, or Senior Class, the subjects of study are Analytical Geometry of three dimensions, the Differential and Integral Calculus, and Calculus of Variations. Lectures are given to this class on the History and Philosophy of Mathematics. CATALOGUE. The fourth class, that of Mixed Mathematics, is designed for the benefit of such of the more advanced students as may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of Pure Mathematics. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may select, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. Text-Books.â1. Junior ClassâTodhunter's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry, Taylor's Conic Sections. 2. Intermediate ClassâSnowball's Trigonometry, Church's Descriptive Geometry, Puckle's Conic Sections and Algebraic Geometry. 3. Senior ClassâCourtenay's Calculus. 4. Class of Mixed MathematicsâPratt's Mechanical Philosophy. In this school a prize has been established by the authority of the Board of Visitors, consisting of a gold medal, named in honor of the late Professor Courtenay This prize is given for the best original solutions of problems proposed at competitive examinations held during the session in the Senior Class. VII.âSCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR SMITH. There are three classes in this school. 1. The Junior or General Class, which meets three times each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion and force. These doctrines are established, and their leading consequences are traced, without the use of mathematical symbols. Guided by these truths, the teacher discusses, in the light of experiment, the structure of matter according to the received atomic hypotheses, and the equilibrium UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. and motion of solids and fluids. These topics, with various applications, occupy the first half of the course of lectures. The remainder of the course is devoted to Molecular Physics, and treats of Capillarity, Osmose, Wave Motion, Sound, Light, Heat and Electricity. In this, as in the previous portion of the lectures, the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made so to present and discuss the phenomena as to convince the student that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Throughout the session constant reference is had to the wants of students in the several departments of Applied Science. Text-Book.âSilliman's Physics. 2. The Senior ClassâThis class meets twice a week, and studies Mechanics and Astronomy. Text-Books.âJackson's or Smith's Mechanics, Norton's Astronomy. MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY. 3. These subjects are assigned to a separate class, which the members of the other classes in the school may attend without payment of an additional fee. In this class the lectures commence with General Mineralogy, which is treated with especial reference to Geology, to which it is designed to be an introduction. In the lectures on Geology, the specific identity of ancient and modern Geological causes is pointed out; the present action of these causes, whether atmospheric, aqueous or igneous, is considered, and their effects in the past history of our planet are examined. The illustrations are drawn, as far as practicable, from the Geological structure of Virginia. The students have an opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the minerals, rocks and fossils exhibited in the lectures. Text-Books.âDana's Manuals of Mineralogy and Geology. VIII.âSCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR MAUPIN. The course of lectures in this school commences with an exposition of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light and Electricity, to the extent rendered necessary by their relations to Chemistry. The subject of Inorganic Chemistry is then taken up. The nomenclature, chemical symbols and notation are explained, and the history of the non-metallic elements, and their combinations with each other, very fully presented. Then follows a discussion of the general principles of Chemical Philosophy, including the laws of Combination, the Atomic Theory and Theory of Volumes, and Simple and Current Affinity. CATALOGUE. The consideration of the Metals comes next in order. After preliminary notices of their general properties they are taken up individually and very fully considered, together with their compounds, with the non-metallic elements and their saline combinations. The concluding part of the course is devoted to Organic Chemistry, embracing the consideration of Organic Analysis; the Neutral Principles and their transformations by the action of ferments and other agencies; the Doctrine of Compound Radicals; the various in which such radicals have been traced; the Vegetable Acids; the Alkaloids, &amp;c. The processes for detecting Poisons, and the means of counteracting their effects, are presented in their proper connections; and throughout the course the applications of the facts and principles of the science to Medicine, Agriculture and the Arts are duly noticed. Books recommended.âFownes' Chemistry, as a text-book; Graham's Elements, Regnault's Elements, Miller's Elements, and Abel &amp; Bloxam's Hand Book of Chemistry, for reference. IX.âSCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS, ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE. ADJUNCT PROFESSOR BÅCK. The school is divided into three classes. 1. Junior ClassâTheory and use of Engineering Instruments, Land Surveying and Levelling, Construction of Roads, Railroads and Canals, Elements of Spherical Astronomy and Geodesy, General Theory of Projections, Orthogonal Oblique and Axonometric Projections, Field Practice, Topographical Drawing, Constructive and Free-hand Drawing, Drawing of Ornaments, etc. Text-Books.âMahan's Civil Engineering.

Notes of the Professor. X.âSCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR MALLET. This school having been created recently in order to carry out a part of the design of the Board of Visitors in reference to the growing demand for scientific knowledge in its applications to the useful arts, the endeavor is made to render the teachings of the Chair as practical as possible, while basing them upon sound principles of general science. The system of instruction consists of a course of Lectures upon Technical Chemistry, and a course of Practical Work in the Chemical Laboratory. A.âLectures. In connection with this course there is but one class, the students attending which hear three lectures each week throughout the session. Amongst the more prominent subjects discussed are: The production of Materials of very general application, including the Metallurgy of Iron, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Tin, Silver, Gold, &amp;c., the preparation and properties of Alloys, and the processes of Electro-Metallurgy, the manufacture upon the large scale of Acids, Alkalies, Salts, Glass and Porcelain; the production and preservation of Food, including the Chemistry of Agriculture, the processes of Bread Making, Wine Making, Brewing and Distilling, the manufacture of Sugar and Vinegar, the curing of Meat, the examination of Potable Water, &amp;c.; Chemical arts relating to Clothing, such as Bleaching, Dyeing, Calico Printing, Tanning and the preparation of Indian Rubber; the Chemistry of those arts which afford us Shelter, embracing the examination of Building Materials, Lime Burning, the manufacture of Mortar and Cements the Explosive Agents used in blasting, as Gunpowder, Gun Cotton, Nitro-Glycerine, &amp;c., Paints and Varnishes, Disinfecting Materials, &amp;c.; Heating and Ventilation, the different kinds of Fuel and modes of Burning them; Illumination by artificial means, Candles, Lamps, the preparation of Petroleum, the manufacture of Illuminating Gas, Matches; the Chemistry of Washing, the preparation of Soap, Starch and Perfumes; the Chemical CATALOGUE. relations of Printing and Writing, the manufacture of Paper, Ink, Artists' Colors, Photographic Materials, &amp;c. The lectures are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, &amp;c., as the various subjects require. Amongst books which can be usefully referred to in connection with different parts of this course may be mentioned: MusprattâChemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Richardson and Wattsâ Chemical Technology; UreâDictionary of Arts and Manufactures; DumasâTraite de Chimie AppliquÃ©e aux Arts; WagnerâDie Chemische Technologie; JohnstonâAgricultural Chemistry. B.âLaboratory Course. This is arranged for three classes: 1. The First Class meets twice each week during the session, on each occasion spending from two to four hours in practical experiment in the Laboratory. A regularly arranged course of practice in Chemical Manipulation is first pursued; Qualitative Analysis is then taken up, and, the means of detecting the most important chemical substances having been learned, students are required to find out for themselves by analysis the constituents of unknown materials presented to them. Special attention is given to substances having useful applications in the Arts or connected with Agriculture. Towards the close of the session the elements of Quantitative Analysis are taught, so far as the limitation of time will permit. 2. The Laboratory will be open to the Second Class on five days of each week during the whole of the working hours of each day. A full course of instruction in Practical Chemistry, including the Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Ores, Soils, Manures, Technical Products, &amp;c., will be given; and students will be assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. 3. The Third Class is one specially intended for students of Medicine, and will meet for lessons of two hours each once in the week for four months of the session. To this class the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine will be taughtâthe detection of Poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of Animal Products, urine, blood, &amp;c. Amongst the works recommended to laboratory students are: PreseniusâQualitative and Quantitative Analysis; H. Roseâ Handbuch der analytischen Chemie (also in French translation); Greville WilliamsâHandbook of Chemical Manipulation; WÃ¶hlerâExamples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; BolleyâHandbuch der technisch-chemishen Untersuchungen; OdlingâPractical Chemistry for Medical Students. The Diploma of Graduate in this school will be conferred upon such students as attend with diligence the Course of Lectures and the First and Second Classes of Laboratory Instruction, and give UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.5 evidence on examination of satisfactory attainments in the same. For the requirements in this school for the degrees in Mining and Civil Engineering, &amp;c., reference is made to the general notice of Degrees. The present Annual Catalogue of the University should not appear without some notice of the very ample and liberal provision which has been made by the Board of Visitors for the material means of illustration of the teachings of this Chair. A new Laboratory building, of one hundred and twenty feet in length by forty-five feet in width, specially designed for the purposes it is to serve, has been erected, and is rapidly approaching completion. It contains twelve roomsâa lecture-room, rooms for general analytical work, for furnace operations, for evaporations and experiments with gases, balance rooms, private laboratory, store-rooms for apparatus and reagents, &amp;c.âis fitted with double windows for the preservation of uniform temperature, and will be amply supplied with gas, water and all proper laboratory fixtures. Large orders have been sent to England, France and Germany for all necessary apparatus, for chemicals, minerals, models, &amp;c., and for specimens illustrating the various arts and manufactures as practiced on the great scale. It is expected that in March, 1869, the building and its contents will be fully ready for use, when it may safely be said that the University of Virginia will in this department be inferior in material preparation for instruction to no institution of learning in America, and in some respects will probably be superior to any.

DEMONSTRATOR OF ANATOMY. J. E. CHANCELLOR, M. D. The Medical Faculty invite the attention of physicians to the peculiar features of the Medical Department of this Institution. 1. Length of Session.âNearly all the Medical Schools of this country are located in our cities or large towns, and have only a nominal connexion with the colleges from which they borrow their names and chartered privileges. In these schools the usual length of a session is from four to five months. In order to embrace all the important branches of Medical Science in a course of instruction compressed into so short a term, it is found necessary to employ the services of six or seven Professors, who deliver six lectures a day. Under this arrangement, the students, if they take all the tickets, are required to spend nearly the whole of the day in listening to lectures delivered in rapid succession and treating of diverse topics. None but those who have had personal experience in this matter can fully appreciate the troubles and difficulties which beset a student when he first enters the school, the fatigue of body and perplexity of mind which he inevitably experiences in his painful efforts to hear every lecture and master every subject. In attempting, after the close of the lectures for the day, to bring in review the topics discussed by his teachers, he finds links in the chain here and there broken; he flies from one subject to another, without adequately mastering any, and confounded by their number, and the utter impossibility of keeping pace, in his private reading at night, with the lectures of six Professors, he despairs of doing more than retaining such portion of the facts stated in the lectures as may happen to make the strongest impression on his mind. In the Medical Department of this Institution, the length of the session, which is nine months, enables four Professors to perform all the duties which are elsewhere assigned to six. The students attend but two lectures a day, and thus have ample time for private reading and for pursuing their Anatomical dissections. The supply of sub- UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. jects is ample, and the Demonstrator devotes the whole of every afternoon to his duties. He guides the labor of those who are at work, and explains to them the structures which are successively exposed, 2. System of Daily Examinations.âImmediately before each lecture, the students in every school of the University are subjected to a rigid examination on the subject of the preceding lecture, or on portions of some approved text-book. Experience has shown that this is an almost indispensable adjunct to the system of teaching by lectures; and the recognition of its importance is so general, that students in other Medical Schools, where its efficient introduction is precluded by want of time, often resort to the expedient of employing the services of private instructors by whom they may be examined at night on the topics discussed each day in the lecture room. The fee paid by the students for this necessary, but extra-collegiate instruction, varies from $30 to $50 for the term of lectures, and is usually about $100 for the whole year. The enactments of the University prescribe that no Professor shall engage in pursuits unconnected with its service, or shall receive from the members of his class any compensation besides that provided for by the laws. They further require every Professor to reside within the precincts, for the purpose both of assisting to enforce the discipline of the college, and of being accessible to the students who may seek aid in their hours of private study. These students, then, enjoy advantages here which elsewhere are purchased at a high price over and above the necessary collegiate expenses. 3. Order of Studies.âAll medical colleges aim to place medical education on a scientific basis. Indeed, if the practice of the healing art is not based on general principles, embodied in the fundamental sciences of Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology Pathology and Therapeutics, these branches of medical science might as well be omitted in a course of Professional education. If, however, this relation does exist, the propriety and necessity of laying a good foundation before the superstructure can be reared, are too obvious to need illustration. This cannot be done in schools where the courses on the different branches of medicine are carried on simultaneously. Their system assumes that the students have "read," as it is termed, with a preceptor for a year, at least, before they commence their attendance on lectures. Such, however, is not always the case, and when it occurs, is of comparatively little benefit; for the paramount duties of the practitioner absorb his time, and the fundamental branches of medical science are precisely those demanding for their illustration the appliances which are only to be found within the walls of Colleges. The Anatomical Department, CATALOGUE. for example, is here enriched by a collection of about two hundred large paintings, executed to order, with great fidelity and beauty. It is one of the peculiar advantages of the University Medical School, that it unites, as may have been inferred from the preceding remarks, the plan of instruction by private pupilage with that of public lectures; while the length of the session enables the Pro fessor to pursue a philosophical order of studies, and thus to afford the students an opportunity of mastering the elementary branches before attention is directed to their practical application. 4. Conditions of Graduation.âThe regulations for graduation elsewhere require that the students shall have attended two full courses of Medical lectures, and shall have been the private pupil, for at least a year, of a respectable practitioner of Medicine. At this University, a consecutive course of nine months being at least equivalent to two courses in most other schools, in respect to the time employed and the advantageous distribution of the subjects of study, the students are permitted to take their diplomas at the end of one session, if they show themselves qualified. The severity of the examinations deters a large majority of the class from making the trial, and none but the perseveringly diligent attain the honor. The importance of the advantages thus claimed for the Medical Department of this Institution has been tested by the experience of forty years, during which several thousand medical students have been educated here. 5. It will be noticed that those students who prefer taking their diploma at a city school will yet find it highly beneficial to attend the first course at an Institution organized on the plan of the Medical Department of the University, where the lengthened term, the consecutive arrangement of studies, and the thorough drilling, prepare them to appreciate and improve the advantages they may afterwards enjoy. 6. In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, a special course, for such medical students as may desire to pursue it, of sixteen (16) lessons in the practical applications of chemistry to medicine (the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopic examinations of animal products, urine, blood, &amp;c.,) will be given by the Professor of Applied Chemistry, at a charge of $20 tuition fee and $5 for laboratory material consumed. Attendance on this special course is optional with the student. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. LAW DEPARTMENT. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text books and partly through lectures, with daily examinations upon both. A Moot-Court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies, by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at Law and in Equity from their inception through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and in short to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. PROF. JOHN B. MINOR, L L. D. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries, Chitty on Contracts. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading, Kents Commentaries, Law of Executors, &amp;c. ? For Reference.âVirginia Code (1860); Brightley's Digest of United States Statutes. SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. PROF. S. O. SOUTHALL. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Barton's Suit in Equity, Adams' Equity. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the Classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law; and of the Science of Government, a certificate of Proficiency is awarded. CATALOGUE. The expenses of a Law student, as will be seen from page 42 of Catalogue, amount to about $365 for a Session of nine months, commencing 1st October, 1869. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection and compensation of any such Licentiate is left to the option of the students.

The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. 1.âDAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lecture of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 2.âGENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session, in the presence of a committee of Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing week of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have, each, numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the students are valued, in the aggregate, at not less than three fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the first division; if less than three fourths and more than one-half, in the second division; if less than one-half and more than one-fourth, in the third division; and if less than one-fourth, in the fourth division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced in the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively, in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. 3.âEXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted, in each school, by the Professor thereof, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties, as well as the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are carried on chiefly in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. ? As a due acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the institution, all candidates for graduation are subjected to a preliminary examination to test their qualifications in this respect. CATALOGUE. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are academic, professional and scientific. The ACADEMIC DEGREES are: 1.

Honorary degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the fourth day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hallâwhither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, certificates and diplomas awarded, and addresses delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. CATALOGUE. EXPENSES. The following is an estimate of the expenses of an Academic student for the session of nine months, exclusive of the cost of textbooks. Matriculation and library fee $25 Room-rent, if two occupy the same room, each 15 Contingent deposit 10 Tuition fees in three schools, the usual number attended 75 Board, including diet, furniture of room and attendance 180 Deposit for fuel and lights 35 Washing, $1 50 per monthâper session, say 15 Infirmary fee 5 $360 This statement will be slightly modified if the student enter more or fewer schools than indicated. The charge for board may also be considerably reduced by joining clubs formed by students, who prefer messing together. Law students pay $80 per session for tuition, and Medical students $110; consequently the estimate for the former is $365, and for the latter $395 per session. Students in the department of Applied Mathematics pay $40 per session for tuition. Students in the department of Analytical and Industrial Chemistry pay: For the full course a fee of $100, and a charge of $25 for laboratory material consumed; For the course of elementary instruction a fee of $50, and a charge of $10 for laboratory material consumed; For the special course, for Medical students, a fee of $20, and a charge of $5 for laboratory material consumed. Each laboratory studentâin whatever course of instructionâwill be required to furnish himself with the more common and generally necessary articles of apparatus. The cost of a suitable set need not exceed $15. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third ($60) of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly, as the service is rendered. The Contingent deposit is designed to cover contingent charges and assessments. These are generally small. The residue of this deposit is refunded to the student in the settlement of his account, at the close of the session. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. The Infirmary fee secures, in case of sickness, prescriptions at the University Infirmary, and, if needed, nursing by professional nurses, lodging, board, and medical attendance by the physicians of the institution, free of additional charge. No abatement is made in the matriculation and tuition fees and room-rent, on account of late entrance, except for those who enter after the 1st Januaryâand no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal before the close of the sessionâunless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel and lights and washing are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance. Therefore, prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the courses of instruction. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise, in writing, requests) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians, will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University, without the payment of fees to the Professors. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on the following conditions: (1.) He shall submit for the consideration of the Faculty an application, accompanied by testimonials, relating to the fact of his being a bona fide candidate for the ministry, to his good standing in the Church of which he is a member, to his intellectual capacity, and his inabilily to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. (2.) No Professor shall be required to form a new class or assume any other additional labor for the exclusive benefit of this class of students. (3.) In order to entitle such a student to the privilege of gratuitous instruction in any school of the University during a second session, he must prove his ability to profit by such continued instruction, by exhibiting such evidence of proficiency during the first session as shall be satisfactory to the Professor of the school. CATALOGUE. The faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students, except only that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and University charges, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty at any time, when in their opinion, it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly report may suggest. LIBRARY. The library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 35,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books, under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This Association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have been elected members at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. The Society holds its meetings at the close of the session. An orator or an essayist is annually appointed by the Society from among its members, and the oration or essay is delivered in the Public Hall on the day preceding the Public Day. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies, of long standing, connected with the University. Most of the students become members of one or the other. They meet weekly in their respective Halls, for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. MORALITY AND RELIGION. These are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is, to forbear the employment of coercion to enforce attendance on religious exercises, which is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the Chapel, and divine service is performed on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected, in turn, from the principal religious denominations. By means of a Young Men's Christian Association, new comers are shielded, as much as possible, from vicious connections, and the energies of students willing to engage in the Christian enterprises of the neighborhood are called into active exercise. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University accessible to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made by the Legislature for the admission of one student from each Senatorial District of the State, without payment of matriculation and tuition fees and rents. This provision is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not, in a situation to incur the expense of their education at this Institution, without aid. State students are appointed by the Faculty upon satisfactory testimonials of fitness. The term of appointment is for two years, but for extraordinary proficiency it may be prolonged. They stand in all respects, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the aid afforded them, they are CATALOGUE. required, on admission, to sign an engagement to teach in some public or private school in Virginia for two years after leaving the University, the emoluments of such service enuring, of course, to their own benefit. The applicant for a State appointment should state his age (which must be at least seventeen,) and designate the schools of the University he may wish to enter. He should submit satisfactory testimonials of irreproachable moral character and of capacity, as well by partial cultivation as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University. It should also appear that neither he nor his parents are able to incur the expense of his education without aid. The Faculty will proceed on the 3d of July next to make appointments of State students for vacant districts. The following are the districts, all of which with the exception of the 7th, 8th, 11th, 16th, 20th, 22d, 25th, 28th and 31st, will be vacant at the close of the present session: I. Accomac and Northampton. II. City of Norfolk. III. Norfolk Co., and Princess Anne. IV. Isle of Wight, Nansemond, Surry and Southampton. V. Sussex, Prince George and Dinwiddie. VI. Louisa, Henrico and Hanover. VII. Mathews, Gloucester, Middlesex, King &amp; Queen, King William and Essex. VIII. Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, Westmoreland, Caroline and King George. IX.
