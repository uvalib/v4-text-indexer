      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President Richard Heath Dabney, M.A., Ph.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Registrar. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration, in the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in the student's formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than October 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and may include one, or two, Minor Subjects, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject, or Subjects, if any, must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least one full year of graduate study, which must be the last year of the student's candidacy, must be spent in residence; but by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia. Upon advancement to candidacy the Dean will appoint a special committee of not less than three Professors, under the Chairmanship of the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Committee on Rules and Courses. This committee will conduct the candidate's final examinations, and pass upon his dissertation. (2) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by passing examinations in French and German, set by the professors of these languages, in consultation with the Professor of the Major Subject, not later than Oct. 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Committee on Rules and Courses, some other language may be substituted for either French or German. (3) A final examination, written, oral, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the special committee shall prescribe. No candidate can be admitted to the final examination until his dissertation has been accepted. Preliminary examinations may in addition be required by individual schools, as stated under the announcements of these Schools. (4) A Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's Major Subject, submitted to the Special Committee not later than April 15 of the last year of candidacy. The copy submitted shall be typewritten upon paper of prescribed quality and size, and shall be substantially bound. The cover shall bear the title of the dissertation and the name of the writer, and the title page shall bear the words: A Dissertation presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Upon approval of the dissertation the candidate must arrange for the publication, at the earliest practicable date, of the whole or such portions of the dissertation as the special committee shall direct. If publication prior to the conferring of the degree be impracticable, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to cover the cost of 50 copies, which shall be the property of the University Library. Two copies, in addition, must be placed in the office of the Dean of the Graduate Department. Grade.âA Graduate Student's standing in a course is indicated not by a numerical grade, but by one of the following terms: Distinguished, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory. EXPENSES.

All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions. The privileges of the club are extended to all members of the University and others who are interested in the progress of Chemistry. The Chemical Laboratory, recently completed, is of brick, fire-proof construction, and the three floors afford 30,000 square feet of space.
