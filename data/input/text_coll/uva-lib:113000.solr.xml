Required for Admission to the Department.âA candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. Required for Admission as Applicant for a Degree.âIn order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work, (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for the successful prosecution of those courses. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiencies. REGULATIONS. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Grade Required for ReÃ¶xamination.âA student whose grade for the session in any course falls below seventy-five per cent, but not below sixty-five per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to reÃ¶xamination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each reÃ¶xamination is five dollars, and must be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. An applicant for a degree in any given session, whose grade for that session in not more than one of his courses falls below seventy-five per cent, but not below sixty-five per cent, is entitled to be reÃ¶xamined before Final Day upon that course or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine. In such cases no reÃ¶xamination fee is charged. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. Change of Schools can be made only with the consent of the Dean and of the professors concerned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School. The Master's Degrees. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from this university, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements, is entitled to a Master's degree upon his successful completion of four graduate courses, chosen in accordance with the restrictions detailed below. No C course may be counted for a Master's degree unless preceded by a B course or courses in the same subject aggregating at least six session-hours; or, in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject, by one B course in that subject and a second B course in the same Group, chosen with the approval of the professor in charge of the C course in question. No C course which a candidate has offered as part of the work credited for a baccalaureate degree may be counted for a Master's degree. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses during the last year of his work for a Master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the Academic Faculty. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has successfully completed four graduate courses, chosen with the approval of the Academic Faculty. These four courses must be in at least three distinct subjects, and in three different academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty. Three of the subjects must be cognate, which means that they must be selected from kindred groups of subjects, such as, for example, languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics, and philosophy, or philosophy, education, and biology. The degree of Master of Science is conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science, who has successfully completed four graduate courses chosen in accordance with the regulations prescribed for the Master of Arts above. The degree of Master of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is conferred upon a holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, who has successfully completed four graduate courses selected from among those offered in his special subject, or from among other courses which meet with the approval of the professor or professors in charge of his special subject. Doctor of Philosophy. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts or the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in three subjects, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. These subjects must be cognate, and must be chosen, with the approval of the Committee on Rules and Courses, from at least three academic Schools. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. No C course may be counted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy unless preceded by a B course or courses in the same subject aggregating at least six session-hours; or, in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject, by one B course in that subject and a second B course in the same Group, chosen with the approval of the professor in charge of the C course in question. Any student taking a D course in any subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's major subject. The dissertation must be submitted to the Academic Faculty not later than April fifteenth of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the Faculty's approval shall be written (typewritten, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size, shall be bound, and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If the dissertation is accepted by the Faculty as satisfactory, the copy submitted shall immediately become the property of the University. Before the degree is conferred the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. EXPENSES. The figures in the following table may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are given,âa low, an average, and a liberal, estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry,âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. By sharing a room with another student, and by practising the strictest economy, a student's expenses may possibly be reduced below the low estimate. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under the conditions above stated, are required to register each year during such period of non-residence, and to pay the annual university fee ($10 for Virginians, $40 for students from other States).

The examination date of any course corresponds to the hour set, as shown in the above schedule. 1915-1916. Any change in the lecture-hours of a course involves a corresponding change in the examination dates.

In Language: History of the Latin Language (Whitney's Life and Growth of Language, Grandgent's Vulgar Latin), with oral and written exercises (Moore, Bennett, Nettleship). II. In Literature: Historical and epistolary, Tacitus' Histories and Pliny's Lettersâdramatic and satirical, Plautus' Mostellaria, Terence's Andria, and Juvenal's Satires, with study of the meters of the dramaâphilosophic, Lucretius, De Rerum Natura and Cicero's De Natura Deorum. III. In Life: The philosophic life of the Romans (Mackail's Latin Literature, Mayor's History of Ancient Philosophy from Thales to Cicero, and Pater's Marius the Epicurean). Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 12-1. Cabell Hall. Professor Fitz-Hugh, Adjunct Professor McLemore. For Graduates. Latin D1: Latin C1 or C2, or the equivalent of either, prerequisite.â This course extends through three years and is intended for those who desire to specialize for one, two, or three years in classical philology. It contemplates especially the needs of those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Roman civilization is the vital link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's major elective be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and life of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's major elective be Romanic, the technical Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman popular vernacular, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into an acquaintance with the authors illustrating the Vulgar Latin in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective), and life of the Romans. The following is, therefore, an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles, supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin Language. II. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of textsâelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnston, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat), numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Petersen, Huelsen, Mau. Strack, FurtwÃ¦ngler). III. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâ reading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâ study of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen, Marquardt-Mommsen, Wissowa, Preller-Jordan, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband, Sandys). Friday, Saturday, 12-2. Cabell Hall. Professor FitzHugh, Adjunct Professor McLemore. Aids.âFor the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is urged to acquire a good reading knowledge of German, French, and Italian. Such a mastery of German and French is imperative. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. Professor Echols. Professor J. M. Page. Mr. Oglesby. Mr. Graybeal. Mr. Browne. Mr. Tucker. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Mathematics C1: Mathematics B1 and B2 prerequisite.âThis course begins with the study of Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions.

Mathematics D2: Differential Equations: Mathematics C1 prerequisite.âIn this course there will be presented a study of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations. In the discussion of the Ordinary Differential Equation particular attention is paid to the theory of integration of such equations as admit of a known Transformation Group, and the classic methods of integration are compared with those which flow from the Theory of Continuous Groups. A similar method is adopted in the study of the Linear Partial Differential Equation of the First Order. As far as the time admits, the theories of integration of the Complete System, as well as those of the General Partial Differential Equation of the First and Second Orders, will be discussed. Hours by appointment. Professor Page.

Philosophy C1: The History of Philosophy: Philosophy B1, or B2, or B3, or the equivalent, prerequisite.âThis course is intended primarily for those who wish to know something of the history of thought and the influence which philosophical ideas have exerted in the development of civilization. The lectures will give a general account of philosophical speculation from its beginnings among the Greeks to the present time. The endeavor will be made to present the various philosophical systems in their relation to the science and general civilization of the ages to which they belong, and to estimate their social and political significance. A large part of the year will be devoted to the theories and problems of modern times. Reading of texts and commentaries, lectures, discussions, and essays. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 10-11. Rotunda, N. E. Professor Lefevre. Philosophy C2: Social Psychology: Philosophy B1, or B2, or B3, or the equivalent, prerequisite.âIn this course, general psychological principles will be applied to the study of the social relations of the self, and the influences which determine feeling and action in the individual as a member of the group, e. g., the sentiments of religious, political, and social crowds. The attempt is made to approach social facts from the mental side. The study of social consciousness, as involved in the genesis and growth of social institutions, the psychology of education, the psychology of religion, and the evolution of social consciousness, will engage the attention in this course. Reading of texts, lectures, discussions, and reports. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 9-10. Rotunda, S. E. Adjunct Professor Balz. For Graduates. Only one of the following courses will be given in any one session. Philosophy D1.â(Open to students who have taken or are taking Philosophy C1.) Empiricism and Rationalism.
