      <field name="fulltext">NEW UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS. The completion of the main Academic building and the adjacent Rouss Physical Laboratory and Mechanical Laboratory, as also the restoration of the Rotunda and additions thereto, were announced in the last Catalogue. JOHN W. AND BELINDA L. RANDALL BUILDING. At a regular meeting of the Board of Visitors June 16th, 1898, a communication was received from Henry L. Higginson, Treasurer of J. W. and Belinda Randall Charities Corporation, enclosing a check for $20,000, a gift voted the University of Virginia by the Trustees, June 10th, 1898, on the following condition: "Voted that the sum of twenty thousand dollars be given to the University of Virginia on condition that it shall either be used for the erection of a building to be known as the `John W. and Belinda L. Randall Building,' or be invested by said University and held as a permanent fund to be known as the `John W. and Belinda L. Randall fund,' the income only to be used, either for Randall Scholarships, or for other needs for said University." At a subsequent meeting October 13th, 1898, the Board of Visitors, desirous to expend the gift in the manner most helpful to the University and at the same time to create a lasting memorial of the liberal spirit which prompted the benefaction, resolved that the $20,000 be expended in the erection of additional dormitory facilities at the University to be known as the "John W. and Belinda L. Randall Building." It has been completed and is a large and handsome building of forty-three student rooms, heated by steam, lighted by electricity and furnished with four bath-rooms and water-closets. HOSPITAL. Though the University has for several years possessed a commodious dispensary with additional clinical facilities, one of the great needs of the institution has been a well equipped hospital. With gratification announcement is made that work has been begun on an ample hospital building. For particulars see page 134.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Announcements. 1990-1901. Charlottesille, the seat of The University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary Arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above the sea-level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles off; the system of drains and sewers is complete; the new Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in cases of illness students receive treatment from the members of the Faculty of Medicine, with skillful nursing when necessary, in a well-equipped infirmary. The Session begins on the 15th day of September, and continues nine months. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 19th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither the public also are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in five Departments—the Academic, and those of Engineering, Law, Medicine, and Agriculture. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-two distinct schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction of professors who are responsible only to the Board of Visitors for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.—The system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and examinations permits. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Equipment.—The equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in the Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the new Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, and the Pathological Laboratory. The Engineering Department possesses a newly-equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. In addition to the Law, and other Departmental Libraries, the general University Library is common to all the Departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present about fifty thousand volumes.* * At the time of the fire in 1895, the Library contained some fifty-three thousand volumes. By generous contributions from sister institutions of learning, and from publishing firms and private individuals, the number of volumes has already been nearly restored to what it was before the fire. It is confidently expected that liberal money appropriations will be made by the Visitors in the near future toward further enlarging the library. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for six hours daily to attend to their wants. Preparation.—Some special preparation for the courses taught in the schools of Latin, Greek, Modern Languages, English Literature and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning, which he may not wish to pursue here. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purpose of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome the disadvantages of inadequate training, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. Admission.—To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement. If the applicant has been a student at any other incorporated institution, he must produce a certificate from such institution, or other satisfactory evidence, of general good conduct. Conduct.—The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. Discipline and Religious Worship.—Morality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every evening, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations. Entrance Examinations are not required except from Academic students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirements for these examinations are stated elsewhere (page 154). But applicants for admission to the different classes in the several Schools are required to exhibit to the Professors suitable evidences of adequate preliminary training. The Method of Instruction in all departments of the University is partly by lecture, partly by the study of appropriate texts. The regulations require that at each meeting the Professors shall examine the class orally on the subject-matter of the previous lecture before beginning the new lecture. Associated with this instruction in the class is a large amount of practical laboratory work in the scientific courses, and of private parallel reading and essay writing in the literary courses. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are merely auxiliary to the written examinations, which are the main test of the student's proficiency. The standard is in no case less than three-fourths, and the student who attains this standard is entitled to a certificate to that effect. No special examination is granted except upon physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty may accept as adequate ground. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three Professors, one of whom is the Professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make report to the Faculty of the results of the examination. The committee, not the Professor, is responsible throughout. Honor System.—For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution which the Faculty adopted with apparent unanimity: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this place. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the Faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of Faculty-action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examination-room, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, or indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in presence of a committee of the Faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Candidates for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the specific details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures, the correlative text, and the prescribed courses of private reading. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at the daily oral examinations, as well as at the written examinations, are taken into the account. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in the B. A. course of each Academic School, and students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. course in any school are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, Bachelor of Science, Doctor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Law. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No merely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.—Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such Licentiate is a matter of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.—At the beginning of the next session printed notices containing useful directions for the guidance of new students in matriculating, choosing boarding-houses, etc., will be posted on the University bulletin-board, and will be distributed as generally as possible among the new students upon their arrival.</field>

The Academic Department is composed of the Schools of Languages, Literature, History, Philosophy, and the Sciences. Each of the included schools offers one or more undergraduate courses of instruction, comprising the work required of students who elect the course in question as one of the requisites for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. These are followed in each School by graduate courses, the completion of any one of which, together with that of the undergraduate course preceding it, entitles the student to a diploma of graduation in the School in question. A certain number of these graduations is required of Bachelors of Arts who proceed to the degree of Master of Arts. Subsequent work of a still more advanced and specialized character is offered in the various Schools of the Department as preliminary to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A detailed account of the courses and equipment of the Schools is given, followed by a specific statement of the requirements for academic degrees. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Peters, Mr. Wright. B. A. COURSE. A. First Year.—A student who is able to translate Cæsar or Vergil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this course, which begins with Sallust or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Ovid, Curtius, and Vergil. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. These examinations are conducted in writing. B. Second Year.—The work of this year will be directed to the acquirement of readiness in translation and syntactical interpretation, with as little specialistic investigation as is consistent with a general but sound and permanent knowledge of the language. As an indispensable auxiliary to this end, written exercises in translating English into Latin and Latin into English will be required. Proper attention will be given to Roman History and Literature. The metrical work will be limited to the structure and accurate recitation of the Dactylic, Anapæstic, Trochaic, and Iambic verses, with the verses occurring in the odes of Horace. Translation will be confined to Livy, Horace, Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus. Selections from each author will be assigned as parallel reading. The student who completes the work of this year will be entitled to a diploma of graduation in the B. A. course in Latin. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course commences with Juvenal or Livy, and includes selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is taken up early in the session and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the language. Portions of the authors read in the lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the lectures. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the third or final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In Roman History and Literature the work is that of the B. A. course. The completion of the work of this year entitles the student to a diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in Latin, if the work of the B. A. course has been completed. Text-Books.—Any approved edition of the authors above named. Grammars.—Gildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History.—Liddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature—Bender's, as a Handbook and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. PH. D. This course is intended for students who propose to teach, or desire to equip themselves for original investigation in the language. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize them with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which can not be considered to any great extent in the undergraduate course. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys, Mr. Young. In this School there are three courses: B. A. COURSE. I. A general course, comprising what is deemed essential to a liberal classical education. This course extends over two years. A. First Year Class.—As a preparation for this class an accurate knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translating are necessary. A thorough study of three books of Xenophon's Anabasis may be regarded as a minimum of preparatory reading. The work of the class is directed to the acquirement of practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is carefully reviewed, and weekly exercises, based on Greek authors, are written. The authors read are Xenophon and Lysias. B. Second Year Class.—This class, for which the work of the preceding year, or some equivalent, is the necessary preparation, continues the study of Attic prose, and enters upon the study of Epic and Ionic Greek and the Drama. The Syntax is reviewed, and weekly exercises are given for translation into Attic prose. The authors read are Plato, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus, and Homer. Instruction is given in History, Literature, Antiquities, and the simpler Meters. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of B. A. In preparing students for the B. A. course teachers are urged not to use Homer, but to confine the instruction to Attic prose. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. II. An advanced course, adapted specially to the requirements of those who desire to become teachers of the classics. It extends through one session of nine months. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required; but, when sufficiently prepared, students may be allowed to pursue both courses simultaneously. In this course the Syntax of the Verb is thoroughly studied, and weekly exercises, including passages from modern English authors, are given to be translated into idiomatic Greek. Lectures are given on Rhythm and Meters, and the students are practiced in reading rhythmically the lyric parts of the Drama and the works of the Lyric Poets. The authors read are Demosthenes, Æschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Pindar, and other Lyric Poets. The course will be varied and modified as occasion may require. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of M. A. PH. D. III. A higher course, designed for those who wish to devote themselves to classical scholarship. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course, or equivalent preparation, is required, but in special cases students may prosecute both courses at the same time. At present it consists of four special courses, each comprising two hours per week during a half session. A third year's course will be adapted to the aims of the students. The lectures will be employed chiefly in directing the private study of students. The recent acquisition of the library of the late Professor Hertz has greatly increased the facilities for philological research, and in connection with each course special topics will be assigned to each student for investigation. In each course, in addition to the special objects of study, attention will be given to the literary aspect of the authors read and to the subject-matter involved. The courses offered are as follows: I. A course of selected readings extending over the whole field of Greek literature in the order of historical development. This course is intended as a general survey. II. A course in Attic prose, especially the orators, directed partly to questions of grammar, and partly to the artistic form and the style. III. A study of the Attic drama, including the special study in class of the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophocles and the Frogs of Aristophanes. IV. A study of the Greek poets, with special reference to music, rhythm, metre, and structure. The ancient doctrine of metre and rhythm will be carefully examined, and portions of the Lyric poets, including Pindar, read in class. For all the classes of this School private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. HELLENISTIC. Instruction will be given in New Testament Greek. This course will extend through one session of nine months, the class meeting three times a week. The preparation should be equivalent to that required for the second year B. A. course. The instruction will be free from sectarian bias, and will be specially adapted to ministerial students intending to prosecute further studies at a theological seminary, though others will not be excluded. The course will begin with the study of the Gospel according to Matthew, for which purpose any recent text will suffice. Other needed works will be indicated after the session opens. Text-Books.—Goodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Hogue's Irregular Verbs; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (intermediate, and in Courses II and III, unabridged seventh edition); Meyers's History of Greece; Jebb's Primer of Greek Literature. Any editions of Greek authors may be used, except when particular ones are specially prescribed; but students should always have at hand Teubner's texts for reference, and for use on examinations. At present Rhythm and Metres and some other subjects are taught wholly or partly by lecture. HEBREW. The Instructor, Mr. Young, will conduct a course in elementary Hebrew. No knowledge of the language will be required for admission to this course. The text-books needed will be made known at the opening of the session. SCHOOL OF TEUTONIC LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison. The subjects taught in this school are the English and German languages (including Old and Middle English, Gothic, Old and Middle High German). I. English. B. A. COURSE. The B. A. course in English is designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the historical (philological) and the literary sides. The opportunity is seized from the beginning to interest the student in the history and etymology of current English words and phrases, to point him by a general course of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and Middle English to the gradual evolution of Modern English as we have it now, and to furnish him with ample material for the prosecution of further study and research in one of the most delightful fields open to the modern student. A carefully graded series of texts and text-books will lead the student from the language of Alfred through Chaucer and the Elizabethans to the English of Victoria; and practical weekly or fortnightly exercises in English composition on assigned topics will, it is hoped, shape his style and enlarge his knowledge of contemporary English. Three times a week. Text-Books.—First Term: Sweet's Anglo-Saxon Primer; Harrison and Baskervill's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Lounsbury's English Language; Williams's Composition and Rhetoric. Second Term: Morris's Chaucer's Prologue and Knightes Tale; Harrison-Baskervill (completed); Williams's Composition and Rhetoric (continued); Brooke's English Literature (begun); Craik's English of Shakespeare. Third Term: Anglo-Saxon, Brooke, Morris and Williams, completed; Hales's Longer English Poems; the Arden Shakespeare (for careful verbal and structural analysis of at least one play). Note: It is desirable that students entering this class should have studied at least a standard English Grammar and a standard Rhetoric. No previous knowledge of Old English is required. Parallel reading is required. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course is a more specialized form of the B. A. course on the same general lines; a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon is essential to its profitable prosecution. The historical study of the language is pursued in greater detail; the student's attention is concentrated on the history and origins of English; lectures on the Poetry and Life of the Anglo-Saxons are given; Fourteenth Century English receives detailed attention, and selected works of the Elizabethan period will be examined and studied critically. The effort will constantly be made to make these courses in the English Language run parallel on the linguistic side with the courses in English Literature, so that the two may profitably be taken together. Three times a week. Text-Books.—First Term: Sweet's or Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader (Prose); Morris and Skeat's Specimens, II; Skeat's Principles, I. Second Term: Skeat's Principles, I (continued); the Student's Chaucer; Brooke's History of Old English Literature; Professor's Lectures; Anglo-Saxon continued (Poetry). Third Term: Beowulf; Skeat's Principles, II; Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (completed); Moulton's Literary Study of the Bible; Brooke (completed); The Mermaid Series; Corson's Introduction to Shakespeare. Note: In 1899 the M. A. class discussed once a week in the English Seminary, second term, written reports on points connected with Chaucer's language, vocabulary, proverbs, learning, versification, etc. During the third term the English Bible formed the center of the Seminary work. A piece of technical work, such as the construction of a vocabulary, the examination of particular points in syntax or grammar, or the discussion of a particular author, may be required of the M. A. graduate. Parallel reading is required. PH. D. Here only general hints and suggestions can be given, the course adapting itself to the preferences of the student. The foundations will be laid in a thorough knowledge of Gothic, Old and Middle High German, and Old French to the Sixteenth Century; phonetics will be carefully studied; and the principles of comparative grammar and syntax will be duly explained. Frequent conference, stated examinations, and original research will form essential parts of this course. The Professor's large and choice collection of Anglo-Saxon, English, German, and French philological works is open to the students. II. German. B. A. COURSE. The B. A. course in German is, like the corresponding course in English, designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the philological and the literary sides. To accomplish this purpose successfully an accurate knowledge of English grammar and a few months' familiarity with the rudiments of German are necessary as preliminary to entering the class. A carefully selected series of text-books will gradually introduce the student to the pronunciation, grammar, syntax, and translation of the language, exercises once a week in German script will familiarize him with grammatical analysis; and appropriate texts on the history and literature of Germany will introduce him to these important sides of the study. Parallel reading is required. Three times a week. Text-Books.—Thomas's Practical or Whitney's Compendious German Grammar; Joynes's Introductory German Reader; Otis's Grimm's Haus-Märchen; Von Klenze's or Buchheim's Deutsche Gedichte; Von Jagemann's Undine; Buchheim's Peter Schlemihl; Schiller's Wilhelm Tell; Goethe's Egmont; Hosmer's History of German Literature. Dictionaries: Whitney's or Heath's. Scientific German. Students taking this course will study thoroughly Part I of Thomas's Practical or Whitney's Compendious German Grammar and will read Gore's, Hodges's, Dippold's or Brandt's Scientific German Reader (at least two of these). A student successfully passing his examination on these four scientific books, together with exercises, Hosmer's Literature and the Grammar, would be doing about the equivalent of the literary B. A. German course and would be recommended for the B. A. diploma. A lighter course (suggested above) would be valuable to Medical, Biological, and general scientific students, but would lead to no degree. Dictionary: Tolhausen's Technological (English, German and French definitions). M. A. COURSE. This course is a more specialized continuation of the B. A. course in German on the same general lines, and is open to students who have completed the B. A. or its equivalent. The historical study of German is taken up; the masterpieces of German literature are systematically studied in critical annotated texts; exercises oral and written continue throughout the year; and the literature and life of Germany are studied in some detail. Parallel reading is required. Three times a week. Text-Books.—Whitney's Compendious Grammar; Behaghel's Historical Grammar; Stein's German Exercises; Goethe's Meisterwerke (Bernhardt); Lessing, Schiller, Heine (annotated editions); Wenckebach's Meisterwerke des Mittelalters; Francke's or Scherer's History of German Literature. Dictionary: Whitney's, Heath's, Adler's or Flügel-Schmidt-Tanger. Note: The work in the B. A. and the M. A. courses is so conveniently divided and distributed by the three-term system that the student gets over the ground without hardship or difficulty. PH. D. COURSE. A student of German, having completed the B. A. and M. A. courses as above outlined, is now prepared to enter upon studies more advanced still. German and English combine admirably for the doctorate as "major" and "cognate minor" to each other, either from the German or from the English point of view. Conference with the Professor is requested for the purpose of arranging the student's studies. If German is elected, Gothic, systematically studied through Wright's Primer, Bernhardt's Gotische Bibel and Skeat, is the foundation. Behaghel's Hêliand (Saxon) may well follow this. A course in Old and Middle High German, studied in the works and editions of Braune, Wright, Sievers, Erdmann, and Henry, connects the Gothic and modern High German, and gives ample philological as well as literary training to the German specialist. Frequent conference, stated examination, and original research form essential parts of this course, which culminates in a dissertation on some special linguistic or literary point connected with the study, handed in before May 1 of the graduating year. Ph. D. combinations suggested: German (major), English Language (cognate minor), English Literature (second minor); English Language, English Literature, German; English Literature, English Language, German, etc. SCHOOL OF ROMANCE LANGUAGES. Associate Professor Wilson. GENERAL STATEMENT. In this School are taught the Romanic Languages. These are the languages into which Latin developed after the fall of the Roman Empire. Three of these idioms, French, Spanish, and Italian, have influenced profoundly and are abidingly interwoven with the fabric of our modern civilization. Others, like Portuguese and Roumanian, have the future still before them and seem destined, especially Portuguese, to assume no unimportant rôle among the languages of the earth. Others, still, like Provençal, flourished for a moment, colored literature for all time, and, then, waned to the importance and dimensions of a dialect. ADVANCED COURSES. In accordance with the traditions of the University, this School will be conducted with the view of developing advanced work rather than with a view of increasing the number of undergraduate classes. By advanced work in Romance, is meant such courses as enable the student to penetrate into the philosophy of the subject and draw therefrom the culture-influences of a science. Such courses are, at present, given in cycles of three years each and lead to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.). The following cycle is, at present, being pursued. 1899-1900. 1. Twenty lectures on the Outlines of French Literature. Private study: Gaston Paris, La Littérature Française au Moyen Age; Dowden, A History of French Literature; Faguet, Seizième Siècle, Dix-septième Siècle, Dix-Huitième Siècle, Dix-Neuvième Siècle. 2.

Readings in Old Provençal: weekly. 5. Romance Seminar. Weekly: Italian and Provençal syntactical developments of the Latin preposition ad. UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES. Two undergraduate classes are conducted in this School; one, to satisfy the requirements of the bachelor's degree; the other, those of the degree of Master of Arts. Because of its inherent importance and on account, too, of existing pedagogical conditions, French is held to be that one of the Romanic languages best fitted for accomplishing the purposes generally implied in a collegiate course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The B. A. Course in Romance (three hours a week) furnishes to those students who may have already studied French several years (a) a course of rapid reading, such as will increase the vocabulary to a point where written Modern French will be understood with ease; (b) a course in French Composition, which is intended to ensure an accurate knowledge of ordinary forms; (c) dictation exercises which would educate the ear to French sounds and cultivate the habit of good pronunciation. While this is distinctively and essentially a linguistic course, Literature receives its share of treatment (a) in the comparatively large number of texts read, arranged with the view of presenting, as far as possible, a general idea of the more important phases of Modern French literature; (b) in histories of French literature assigned for examination. The programme for 1899-1900 was as follows: 1. French Grammar and Composition. Weekly: Grandgent's Grammar and Composition. 2. French Literature of the Nineteenth Century. Twice weekly: Béranger, Chansons; Hugo, Hernani; Mérimée, Colomba; Daudet, La Belle-Nivernaise; Theuriet, Bigarreau; Rostand, Cyrano de Bergerac. 3. Private study: (a) French Texts.—Corneille, Le Cid and Horace; Racine, Athalie and Les Plaideurs; Molière, L'Avare and Le Misanthrope. (b) French Literary History and Criticism.—Pellissier, Le Mouvement Littéraire au XIX Siècle; Saintsbury, A Short History of French Literature. The M. A. Course in Romance (six hours a week) deals especially with Spanish and Italian. French, however, is used continually in this course as a unit of comparison and, when the capabilities of the class permit, as a means of class-room communication. Students are not required to have a previous knowledge of Spanish and Italian; but they are supposed to have had that thorough training in French which gives, as it were, a Romanic base of procedure and which enables a student to overcome, at sight, many of the primary difficulties of Spanish and Italian. The M. A. course in Romance intends to do for Spanish and Italian respectively what is practically done for French in the B. A. course. The following is an outline of what has been accomplished in 18991900: 1. Spanish Grammar and Composition. Weekly: Manning's Grammar; Exercises based on texts read in class. 2. Spanish Literature of the Nineteenth Century. Twice Weekly: Tamayo, Un Drama Nuevo; Alarcón, El Sombrero de Tres Picos; Galdós, Doña Perfecta; Espronceda, El Diablo Mundo; Breton de los Herreros, La Independencia; Pereda, La Puchera. 3. Private study: (a) Spanish Texts.—Cervantes, Rinconete y Cortadillo; Tirso de Molina, El Burlador de Scvilla; Moreto y Cabana, El Desdén con el Desdén; Lope de Vega y Calderon de la Barca, Obras Maestras. (b) Spanish Literary History and Criticism.—Fitzmaurice-Kelly, History of Spanish Literature. 4. Italian Grammar and Composition. Weekly: Grandgent's Grammar and Composition; Fornaciari, Sintassi Italiani. 5. Italian Literature of the Nineteenth Century. Twice weekly: De Amicis, Alberto; Barrili, Una Notte Bizzarra; Farina, Fra la Corde di un Contrabasso; Del Testa, L'Oro e l'Orpello; Pellico, Francesca da Rimini; Capuana, Homo. 6. Private study: (a) Italian Texts.—Goldoni, Un Curioso Accidente; Manzoni, I Promessi Sposi; Selections from Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio and other writers of the Fourteenth Century, in D'Ancona e Bacci, Manuale della Letteratura Italiana, Volume I. (b) Italian Literary History and Criticism.—Fenini, Letteratura Italiana; Garnett, History of Italian Literature. LINDEN KENT MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. Professor Kent. B. A. COURSE. This course includes practical instruction in composition and in the critical analysis of prose and poetry, but its general aim, held steadfastly in view, is literary. The double purpose of the course is: first, to aid the student in learning the principles of good writing and in acquiring by practice the power of expressing himself correctly and clearly, if not with facility and literary finish; second, to raise the standard of reading by cultivating the student's literary taste and by interesting him in the splendid achievements of English and American literature. In order to pursue this course with full profit the student should have, in addition to maturity of mind and general mental training, an accurate knowledge of the principles of English grammar, including punctuation and orthography, and familiarity with the foundations of rhetoric. Previous practice in composition is well-nigh essential to the successful prosecution of the work of this class, while general information as to the history and contents of English and American literature will add materially to the student's appreciation of the lectures.* * In this connection the earnest attention of those charged with the direction of academies, high schools, and schools of lower grade is called to the sad and disastrous want of adequate elementary training in English, manifested by many of their representative students. This B. A. course includes: 1. Rhetoric.—This will comprise a rapid review of the principles of style as illustrated by the Sentence and the Paragraph, and a careful study of invention in prose discourse. There will be frequent written and blackboard exercises, and particular attention will be given to the critical analysis of selected specimens of Descriptive, Narrative Expository, Argumentative, and Persuasive Prose. This course, based on the Professor's notes, will be supplemented by lectures, outlines, diagrams, etc. Text-Books.—To be assigned at the beginning of the course. 2. Poetics.—This course, following the general outline of the textbook, will comprise the mechanism of verse, the artistic elements of poetry, history of important verse forms, poetic style, kinds of poetry, etc. Class exercises in the analysis of poems, in the composition of verse, and in recognition of forms, etc., will be assigned from time to time. English and American Literature.—This course will consist of general history of English and American literature, of which the text-books will serve as outlines; of the study of standard English poems and of representative American prose. The entire course is supplemented by class explanations, graphical representations, assigned and suggested readings, and lectures. Text-Books.—Pancoast's Introduction to English Literature; Pancoast's Introduction to American Literature; Pancoast's Standard English Poems; Kent's Graphic Representations of English and American Literature; Carpenter's American Prose. Essays.—Besides the frequent written exercises, four essays will be required of each student applying for graduation in this B. A. course. These will be due October 16th, December 8th, March 2d, April 6th. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. To this class will be admitted such students as have finished the B. A. course here, or have had such training here or elsewhere as to warrant the belief that they would pursue the course with profit. But, because of the written work required in each class, the Professor strongly advises young men not to undertake to pursue the B. A. and M. A. courses both during the same session. M. A. COURSE. In this course there will be occasional lectures, but in general the exercises of the class will be conducted by questions, conversation, and conference. Readings will be assigned, independent investigation insisted upon, and written reports required from time to time. The students will be encouraged to form their own judgments and to express them orally or in writing. References for each author, period, or subject studied will be given, and the free use of the library in this and all courses is cordially recommended. COURSES HERETOFORE OFFERED. I. Representative Writers of English Prose. II. History of Lyric Poetry from 1560 to 1800. III. British Essayists from Bacon to Burke. IV. Victorian and American Poets. V. Tennyson, the Representative Poet of the Nineteenth Century. VI. The British Essay in the Nineteenth Century. VII. Shakspeare, as a Dramatic Artist. VIII. Chief English Literary Tendencies in the Nineteenth Century. COURSES ANNOUNCED FOR 1900-1901. IX. Milton, and his Times. This course, extending from September 15th to December 15th, is intended primarily to lead to a careful and thorough study of Milton's poetry and prose but, as a full appreciation of Milton's work involves a knowledge of the times in which he lived, the course will be supplemented by a more rapid study of contemporaneous authors. Text-Book.—Cambridge Edition of Milton's Poetical Works; any good edition of his Prose. I. Representative Writers of English Prose. This course extending from January 2d to March 16th, is intended to acquaint the student with specimens of the best prose and to give him practice in criticism. The essays assigned may be read in editions available in the University Library. Text-Book.—Clark's Study of English Prose Writers. This will serve as a syllabus of the course. X. American Poets, with a Special Study of Southern Poetry. This course, extending from March 25th to June 1st, will comprise a somewhat rapid examination of American poetry and a closer study of certain Southern poets. Among the Southern poets thus closely studied will be Poe, Lanier, Timrod, Hayne, Father Ryan, Hope and Thompson. Text-Books.—Stedman's Poets of America; Stedman's Anthology of American Poetry. Essays and Dissertation.—Besides the written exercises and studies in this course there will be required two essays and a dissertation. The essays, due October 21st and February 15th, respectively, will treat some literary themes preferably such as are suggested by the class work. The dissertation must show independent and original investigation of some limited theme selected with the Professor's approval. The subject of the dissertation must be recorded by January 15th, and the dissertation itself be handed in by May 15th. PH. D. This course will be as far as possible adapted to the needs and prospective careers of the students desiring to pursue it. Its purposes will be to cultivate more fully the love of letters, to encourage independent and scholarly research, and to further the art of literary expression. It will include a study of some writer or school of writers, or of some period or movement of literature, and will take into consideration the political, social, and literary characteristics of the time under discussion. For 1900-1901 the course proposed will be an investigation of the Literary History of the Southern States prior to 1860. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL AND ECONOMICAL SCIENCE. Professor Dabney. In this School two distinct sciences are taught. For, although economic conditions have profoundly influenced the history of nations, and although there is such a thing as the history of Economics (just as, for that matter, there is a history of Mathematics, and as there has been a decided influence of mathematical discoveries upon History), still History and Economics are distinct subjects, and are investigated by different methods. HISTORY. The study of History, like that of other great subjects, has its own peculiar charms and advantages. It cannot equal the study of language in cultivating the habit of minute accuracy and attention to details. Nor can it compete with mathematical study in accustoming the student to habits of clear and rigidly consecutive thought. But on the other hand, there is no other subject that surpasses History in its power to broaden and deepen both the mind and the heart. Its charm lies in its human interest. For its theme is man—"the proper study of mankind"—a theme that must ever be more attractive to the majority of human beings than either the asymptotes of the hyperbola or the subjunctive mood. But, while History deals with man, it should not be confounded with biography, which deals with individual men. Biography is an invaluable adjunct to History, but History deals with the life of societies, nations and states. Fully, fairly, and impartially to comprehend this life in all its marvelously varied social, political, religious, moral and intellectual manifestations, is totally beyond the power of any human brain. Yet the earnest student, who seeks the truth and resolutely turns his back upon partisanship in every form, can learn enough of even so vast a theme to reward him richly for his pains. But let him not yield credence to the common delusion that History is "easy" to learn,—a mere collection of entertaining anecdotes concerning eminent men. To understand the life of nations— the evolution and dissolution of organized masses of men—is a fascinating, but immensely difficult task. Such a task is, very properly, not attempted in primary schools, children being taught the rudiments of History with other purposes in view. Nor is it wise for the younger students at a university to attempt the task. The greater their maturity, the greater also will be the benefit they may derive from historical study; and they are therefore advised, as a general rule, to defer its pursuit until they have had at least one year's training in other university work. Two courses in History are offered: one in General History and one in English and American History. B. A. COURSE. General History.—In this course, which comprises the historical work required for the B. A. degree, great stress is laid on the view that the career of man as revealed in History, is not a mere jumble of disconnected dates and facts, but a continuous stream, having its sources and tributaries in the far-off past, its outlet in the remote future. No attempt is made, however, to traverse in the class-room the entire length of this stream; for, although constant efforts are made to demonstrate the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development, the lectures are confined to the more important periods, the student being required to fill the gaps by private reading. These periods, and therefore, the text-books studied, may be more or less varied each year. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.—Fisher's Outlines of Universal History; Grant's Greece in the Age of Pericles; Froude's Caesar; Capes's Age of the Antonines; Thatcher's and Schwill's Europe in the Middle Age; Seebohm's Era of the Protestant Revolution; Gardiner's Thirty Years' War; Longman's Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War; Dabney's Causes of the French Revolution; Morris's French Revolution and First Empire. GRADUATE COURSE. M. A. English and American History.—In this higher course, which will consist of English History up to Christmas, and of American History the rest of the session, the principles taught in the course preceding will be applied to a more special field; and, in order that the students may be encouraged to exercise independent thought and judgment, they will be required to write essays on assigned topics. Moreover, it should be distinctly understood that the text-books are by no means regarded by the Professor as infallible authorities. On the contrary, some of them contain much that is emphatically rejected by him. And yet such books may be exceedingly useful; for to educate a man is not to stuff him full of cut-and-dried opinions, but rather to draw forth and develop his own judgment by presenting to his mind opinions that oppose and even clash violently with each other. Graduates in General History will derive most benefit from this course. It may be taken, however, by others; and, as considerable attention will be paid to constitutional development, students intending to study Law will find the course of advantage. Candidates for the M. A. degree selecting History as one of their four subjects must graduate both in this course and in the preceding. Three lectures a week. Text Books.—Oman's History of England; Creighton's Age of Elizabeth; McCarthy's Epoch of Reform; Gardiner's Atlas of English History; and a number of works on special periods of American History to be announced later. ECONOMICS. In its value both as a mental discipline to the student, and as a subject of practical interest to the citizen, it is difficult to over-estimate the importance of this science. As a mental discipline the study of Economics combines to a certain extent the advantages of linguistic, mathematical and historical training. One of the most serious difficulties of the subject is the fact that many of its technical terms are also used in loose popular significations; and a close study of Economics teaches a man to be very careful in the exact and discriminating use of words. The rigid reasoning, too, by which economic laws are deductively derived from a few simple and fundamental facts in human and physical nature is as relentlessly logical as that by which the properties of triangles or circles are deduced from the axioms of Geometry. And, finally, the historical investigation of economic phenomena with a view to the verification, modification or refutation of the laws deductively ascertained, or to the inductive discovery of other laws, is attended with the advantages of other historical study, as above set forth, and sheds a flood of light upon many questions in social, political, or even religious history. B. A. COURSE. Like Mathematics, Economics is treated as Pure and Applied. In the first term of the session the whole field of Pure or Deductive Economics, an abstract science which deliberately and properly ignores, for the sake of clearness and simplicity, many important phases of social life, is traversed in outline; and a few brief practical applications are made to special topics. In this term, too, the principles of Public Finance are studied. In the second term a thorough deductive, as well as inductive and historical, investigation of the principles of Money and Credit is undertaken; while a few lectures are devoted to the consideration of protective tariffs. A third term is devoted to a discussion of the periodical commercial panics and crises of the nineteenth century, and to the history of the vast changes in production, transportation and industrial organization that have taken place throughout the world in recent years. Text-Books.—Laughlin's Elements of Political Economy; Plehn's Introduction to Public Finance; Horace White's Money and Banking; selected pamphlets from the Sound Currency series published by the N. Y. Reform Club, viz: Nipher's The Appreciation of Gold, Warner's The Currency Famine of 1893, Watkins's Cotton and the Currency, White's Coin's Financial Fool, and the Report of the Monetary Commission of the Indianapolis Convention of 1897; Philpott's Tariff Chats; Porter Sherman's Tariff Primer; Hyndman's Commercial Crises of the Nineteenth Century; Wells's Recent Economic Changes. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Davis. There are two classes arranged for two successive sessions. The First Class studies during the first half-session, Deductive and Inductive Logic; during the second half-session, Psychology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.—The Professor's Elements of Deductive Logic, Elements of Inductive Logic. Theory of Thought, and Elements of Psychology. The Second Class studies during the first half-session, Ethics; during the second half-session, Philosophy. Two lectures a week. Text-Books.—The Professor's Elements of Ethics; Janet's La Morale; Lotze's Grundzüge der praktischen Philosophie; Külpe's Introduction to Philosophy; Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. Professor Echols, Associate Professor Page. The work of the School of Mathematics is divided into two parts: Part I.—The Undergraduate Course, leading to the degree of B. A., is designed with a view of giving an intelligent comprehension of the fundamental principles of mathematics to those who pursue it as a component part of a general education, and as a preparation to those who desire a working knowledge of the subject for use in subsequent studies in Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering. Part II.—The Graduate Course, leading to the degrees of M. A. and Ph. D., has a twofold design. In the first place its object is to require a thorough and systematic study of the chief branches of pure mathematics as exhibited in the writings of the best authors; and in the second place, to inculcate a serious and thoughtful contemplation of pure mathematics as an art, a science, and a branch of philosophy. In this school, as at present designed, there are six classes. B. A. COURSE. In this course there are two classes, each of which meets three times a week throughout the session. Class A.—This class meets three times a week (three hours), and devotes about three months to each of the three subjects, Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. In Algebra the class begins with Ratio and Proportion, proceeding to the progressions, the Binominal Formula, Convergence and Divergence of Series, Logarithms, Determinants, and the Theory of Equations. In Geometry the work begins with the Solution of numerous original exercises in Plane Geometry, proceeds through Solid Geometry, with exercises, and terminates with a short course in Geometrical Conic Sections. The year is closed by a course in elementary Plane Trigonometry, embracing the Solution of Triangles by means of Logarithms, the usual applications to the problems of Heights and Distances, etc. The preparation necessary to enter this class is a good knowledge of Arithmetic, of Algebra through Simultaneous Quadratic Equations, and of Plane Geometry. Text-Books.—Charles Smith's Algebra; Venable's Legendre's Geometry, with Exercises; Venable's Notes on Geometric Conic Sections; Wells's Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. Class B.—The preparation for this class consists in a thorough knowledge of the topics worked over in Class A. This class devotes about three months to each of the three subjects, Trigonometry, Analytical Geometry, and Calculus. Four and a half hours each week. The subject of Trigonometry, plane and spherical, is carefully worked over and followed by the study of the Conic Sections analytically. The last three or four months of the session are devoted to the study of the elementary principles and applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus. Text-Books.—Loney's Trigonometry, Part I; Charles Smith's Conic Sections; Echols's Calculus. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. Class C.—This class meets three times a week (four and a half hours) throughout the session. It begins with the study of Analytical Geometry of three dimensions, and takes a systematic course in the Differential and Integral Calculus, and completes the course with a study of Differential Equations. Text-Books.—Charles Smith's Solid Geometry; Williamson's Differential and Integral Calculus; Murray's Differential Equations. This course is required for graduation in the M. A. course of Mathematics. PH. D. Class D.—This class meets three times each week throughout the session. The topics discussed are: The Theory of the Number System; Determinants; the Infinitesimal and Finite Calculus and the general Theory of Functions. Reference Books.—Scott's Determinants; Laurent's Traité d'Analyse; Chrystal's Algebra; Boole's Finite Differences; Tannery's Théorie des Fonctions d'une Variable, and Harkness and Morley's Theory of Functions; Picard, Traité d'Analyse. Class E.—The first half-year will be devoted to a course on the Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Geometry, with special reference to the Theory of Surfaces—and Curves on Surfaces. During the second half-year a course in Pure Geometry, beginning with Projective Geometry and proceeding to elementary Higher Geometry, will be offered. This class, and the following one, meet three times a week, and the subjects will be presented by lectures. Reference Books.—Joachimsthal's Anwendung der Differential und Integralrechnung auf die Allgemeine Theorie der Flächen, und der Linien Doppelter Krümmung; Salmon's Geometry of Three Dimensions; Darboux's Théorie Général des Surfaces; Reye's Geometrie der Lage, Klein's Höhere Geometrie Volume I; Page's Differential Equations. Class F.—In this class will be presented a course in Lie's Theory of Transformation Groups, with Applications to Differential Equations and to Higher Geometry. Reference Books.—Lie's Works on Transformation Groups; Klein's Höhere Geometrie, Volume II. The candidate for the Ph. D. degree is required to complete the work of all the classes in the graduate courses, and to present a thesis which shall be acceptable to the faculty. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Professor Thornton. The work of this School is divided between the Academic and the Engineering Departments. In the former the following courses are offered, each of three lectures a week: B. A. COURSE. General Mechanics.—In this course, which comprises the work in Mechanics for the B. A. degree, the subjects studied are Statics, Strength of Materials, Graphical Statics, Hydrostatics, the Elementary Dynamics of a Particle, and of a Rigid Body. Elementary mathematical methods are employed, but no student is prepared to undertake the course who has not a sound working knowledge of Algebra, Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry, with the elements of Analytical Geometry. Text-Books.—Jessop's Applied Mathematics; Jacoby's Graphical Statics; Greene's Structural Mechanics; Lectures. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. Advanced Mechanics.—This course comprises the work in Mechanics for the M. A. degree. Free use is made of the methods of the Infinitesimal Calculus, and only suitably prepared students will be admitted to it. The subjects studied are the Dynamics of a Particle, and of a Rigid Body, Hydraulics, and Thermodynamics. Text-Books.—Williamson's Dynamics; Bovey's Hydraulics; Peabody's Thermodynamics. PH. D. For candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, two courses are offered. 1. Analytical Mechanics.—Minchin's Statics, Routh's Rigid Dynamics, Lamb's Motion of Fluids. 2. Theory of Elasticity.—Love's Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. Clebsch's Theory of the Elasticity of Solid Bodies (Saint Venant's edition). SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Professor Stone. Mr. Eastwood. B. A. General Astronomy.—The primary aim of this course is to give such a knowledge of the facts, principles, and methods of Astronomy as every well-educated person should possess. The preparation required is a good working knowledge of Arithmetic, Algebra through Quadratics, Plane and Solid Synthetic Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry through the Solutions of Triangles. In this preparation thoroughness is of more importance than extent. The instruction is given by oral examinations, by lectures, and by the assignment of problems. The mental discipline of the student is kept constantly in view, and an earnest effort is made to create a habit of clear and logical thinking. Text-Books.—Young's General Astronomy; Berry's A Short History of Astronomy. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. The courses mentioned in the paragraph following this, although primarily designed to meet the wants of candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, are also open to candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, who are required to satisfactorily complete, in addition to the work of the B. A. course, a year's work in the more advanced courses. PH. D. Theoretical Astronomy.—The courses vary from year to year. During the year 1899-1900 the subjects considered have been: Formation and integration of the differential equations of motion for an undisturbed body, determination of the position of a planet from known elements, of an elliptic orbit from three complete observations, of an orbit from four observations of which only two are complete, of an orbit from any number of observations employing the method of least squares. During the year 1900-1901 lectures will be given on the determination of orbits of double stars, meteors, and comets, on mechanical quadrature, and on the methods of computing special perturbations. Practical Astronomy.—Laboratory courses are offered each year, in which systematic training is given in numerical computation, and in the use of Astronomical instruments. Students are also encouraged to engage in such original work as their time and attainments may permit. For information in regard to Fellowships in Astronomy, application should be made to the professor in charge of the School. The Astronomical Observatory is situated upon an elevation known as Mount Jefferson which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda forty-five feet in diameter, and contains the great Clark refractor of twenty-six inches aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining, and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a three-inch Fauth transit and a four-inch Kahler equatorial. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Smith, Dr. Humphreys. This School offers the following courses: 1. Experimental Physics.—This course is intended to include Elementary Mechanics, Heat, Electricity, Sound and Light. Instruction is given by lectures and text-books, with illustrative experiments. The members of this class are expected to perform a graded set of simple exercises in the Physical Laboratory, the hours for which are accommodated, as far as possible, to the convenience of each student. 2. Mathematical Physics.—In this course selected portions of the preceding one are more fully developed by the aid of mathematics. The subjects studied may be changed from session to session, according to the preparation or the needs of the student. The utmost possible freedom, consistent with a proper standard as to amount and quality, is afforded to him. The Laboratory work in this class is more advanced and extensive than in the preceding class, and aims at the more exact measurement of physical quantities. 3. Electricity.—This course is distinguished from the preceding, in being adapted of design to the needs of such as intend to pursue Electrical Engineering. The book work and the Laboratory exercises have therefore a practical character. They are intended to cover the first half of a four years' course of Electrical Engineering. 4. Graduate Work is offered to candidates for the Doctorate of Philosophy and to others who, for special reasons, may wish to do advanced work in Physics along special lines. This work will be mainly experimental and, as far as our resources allow, will be accommodated to the preferences and special preparation of the student himself. More detailed information respecting the advanced work may meanwhile be obtained by correspondence or personal interview. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, electing this School, are only required to pass in the class of Experimental Physics. The course for Master of Arts in this School is that given in the class of Mathematical Physics. THE ROUSS PHYSICAL LABORATORY. This building is now completed, and occupied. The equipment is such as to offer unusual facilities for both elementary and advanced practical work. The working rooms are remarkable for stability, light and uniformity of temperature. Electricity, gas and water, as well as steam-heat, are supplied to each of them. The structure was specially designed to meet the requirements of Practical Physics, and is convenient within while it is sightly without. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School the following courses are offered: General Chemistry.—This course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws expressing the facts of chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present developed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, the foundations of our knowledge of chemical structure, and a general survey of the Descriptive Chemistry of the elements, and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in the arts and manufactures of the facts mentioned. Text-Books.—Fownes's Chemistry (last edition): Syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. Recommended for reference.—Roscoe and Schorlemmer's Elements of Chemistry; Lothar Meyer's Outlines of Theoretical Chemistry (English translation); Bernthsen's Text-Book of Organic Chemistry, translated by McGowan; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry; Ernst von Meyer's History of Chemistry. Industrial Chemistry.—This course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, is concerned with the applications of chemistry to the purposes of human life. It examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which the development of the natural resources of the country in large measure depends, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar-refiner, etc. Text-Books.—Wagner's Chemical Technology or F. H. Thorp's Outlines of Industrial Chemistry. Recommended for reference: Richardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; T. E. Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry; Girardin's Leçons de Chimie Elêmentaire appliquée aux Arts Industriels; W. E. Roberts-Austen's Introduction to the Study of Metallurgy; Sadtler's Handbook of Industrial Organic Chemistry, etc. The lectures in both courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good; among the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. Graduate work is offered in either course, and either or both may be taken by the candidate for the Ph. D. degree. Laboratory work will be required on subjects involving original investigation. It is desirable that the student shall, himself, as far as possible, select subjects for investigation, but when he can not do so, suitable questions will be presented to him, and he will be encouraged to work them out for himself, with only such aid and guidance as may prove to be indispensable. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. Graduation in General Chemistry is required for the B. A. degree, graduation in both General and Industrial Chemistry for the M. A. For admission to a graduate course in the School of Chemistry or in the School of Analytical Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is divided into two courses, as follows: 1. This course consists of three lessons a week throughout the session, on each occasion the student spending three or four hours in practical experiments in the Laboratory. A course in Chemical Manipulation is first given, then Blowpipe Analysis, Fire Assaying of Ores of Lead, Gold and Silver, and a systematic course in inorganic Qualitative Analysis followed by practice in analysis of salts, alloys and ores, determination of minerals and the examination of potable water, coal, clay, and so on, together with some simpler quantitative determinations. 2. The work of the second course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session, each being followed by four hours or more of practical laboratory work. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, the class pursues volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, technical products, and so on. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assist in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. The Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the first course, or for both courses at the same time; candidates for graduation are required to complete both courses. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, Druggists, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (2d ed.); Greville Williams's Hand-book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-book of Mineralogy; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. PH. D. The graduate course is designed for those seeking the degree of Ph. D., and also for such students as desire to increase the range of their experience as analysts and to cultivate their powers for original investigation. It is required of those who enter this course that they shall have previously graduated both in this School and in General Chemistry, or that they shall have previously made equivalent attainments elsewhere. Laboratory work will be conducted daily, and suggestions and due assistance will be given in its prosecution. While the work is adapted to the special aims or taste of each student, it will in all cases comprise some practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, ultimate and proximate organic analysis, some study in analytical methods and some original problems, also the reading and the summarizing of extracts from current journals, and for all who are seeking the degree of Ph. D., a dissertation embodying the results of some original research. SPECIAL COURSE. In addition to the foregoing, the following Special Course is given in this School: A course of twenty-four lectures on Agricultural Chemsitry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life so far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and so on. This course is open without charge to farmers who are not matriculated students. For reference: Johnston's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, 17th Edition: London, 1894. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-room attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchases and importation. The Museum of Industrial Chemistry, contained in the same building, consists of a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country and abroad, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two courses—first, a course embracing the requisites of Geology for the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts; and second, a course covering what is required in Mineralogy and Geology for the degree of Master of Arts. B. A. COURSE. Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.—Dana's Revised Text-Book of Geology and Notes of the Professor's Lectures. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.—The course in Mineralogy closes with the examination which takes place in December. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Text-Books.—Dana's Manual of Mineralogy and Petrology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. Geology.—This division of the course begins after the completion of Mineralogy in December. Three lectures a week will be given. A knowledge of the principles taught in the B. A. course will be assumed. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Palæontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Ph. D. Text-Book.—Dana's Manual of Geology. For reference: Geikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. PH. D. The course in this School is intended to give the student as large a stock of useful information as possible, to teach him methods of investigation, and to train him in habits of observation. Original research will be insisted on, and opportunity will be given for the student to concentrate his efforts in some line of special study. Topics for study will be taken from both of the subjects taught in this school. The abundant material in the Lewis Brooks Museum, mentioned below, gives unusual facilities for the pursuit of graduate work. Descriptive Mineralogy.—The course of Mineralogy is so selected as to give the student a good knowledge of as wide a range of the principles as possible, and at the same time to cause him to acquire a practical knowledge of the various mineral species. In the practical study, the more common minerals, and those of more importance from an economic and geologic point of view, will have preference. A practical knowledge of the crystal forms and of the characteristic groupings and massive forms of minerals, will be required. Special attention will be paid to the relations of minerals, their association in nature and their geological occurrence. The student will be trained to determine minerals, as far as possible, by their obvious characteristics, without the help of tests, and practical examinations will be held, from time to time, to test his skill. One or more theses will be required. Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy, and Weisbach's Mineral Tables will be used, and topics from various authors will be assigned for study in special cases. Geology.—In Geology the aim will be to fit the student for independent and original research. He will study as thoroughly as possible the broader problems of the science, involving the knowledge of stratigraphical principles. Special attention will be given to imparting a practical knowledge of the various rocks, and of the animal and plant fossils of the different eras, with the view of using them in determining unknown formations. Stress will be laid upon field-work, and the methods of determining and describing the geology of new regions. To impart such knowledge, the student will be required to work up some particular region or formation, and report his results. Topics involving a knowledge of the literature and growth of opinion in relation to particular questions, may be assigned to form the subjects of theses. Dana's Manual of Geology, and Geikie's Text-Book of Geology, will be used as text-books, and selected books of other authors will be used when necessary. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionably fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. Zoölogy is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-maché models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc. The bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing graduate courses of study in Geology and Mineralogy. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Professor Tuttle, Mr. Miller. The work of this School is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of Biology to Agriculture. B. A. COURSES. Two introductory courses are offered, each of which is intended to serve as a means of rendering the student familiar with the method, the aims, and the fundamental laws of Biology while he is engaged in the one case with the study of plants, in the other with that of a large and important group of animals. Each course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session, the lectures being associated in each case with laboratory exercises dealing with the organisms under consideration. Graduation in either of these courses may be offered as one of the electives for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. I. Botany.—The course begins with the study of the anatomy, both gross and microscopic, of a series of representative plant forms, beginning with the highest and passing to the lowest plants; this is followed by a discussion of the elements of vegetable physiology. The second portion of the course begins with the consideration of the principles of classification, followed by the study of the characteristics of the leading divisions of the vegetable kingdom, and particularly of those which include non-vascular plants. The concluding portion is devoted to the more specific study of the classification and distribution of the higher plants and of the local flora. To the student who seeks a knowledge of the principles of Biology as a part of a general education, this course is particularly commended. All the fundamental laws of Biology are well illustrated in the study of the morphology and physiology of plants, and in most instances in such a manner as to cause them to be more readily apprehended by the beginner than is the case in the study of animals. Text-Books.—The Bonn Text-Book of Botany (Porter tr.); Gray's Manual. II. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology.—This course is devoted to the study of Anatomy and Histology of Vertebrates, and to the principles of Animal Physiology. During the first part of the session several representative forms are dissected, the relations and functions of their constituent organs being at the same time discussed in the accompanying lectures. This is followed by a study of their histology, particular attention being paid to mammalian histology as understood by the aid of that of the lower vertebrates; the work is done in the laboratory, the associated reading and lectures being accessory thereto. This course is particularly recommended to students who contemplate the study of medicine here or elsewhere. It is included in the required work of the first year of the course in Medicine, and students passing it with the required grade will there be credited with it. Text-Books.—Martin's Human Body (briefer edition); Parker's Zoötomy; The Professor's Elements of Histology. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. In addition to the introductory or B. A. courses above described, the following advanced courses are offered to students prepared to undertake them. In each the work will be chiefly done in the laboratory, the student being in large measure independent of his associates; such lectures will be given from time to time and such reading indicated as will aid the student in an independent investigation of the subject in hand. The relation of these courses to degrees is indicated below. III. Vertebrate Morphology.—An advanced course based on Course II, the completion of which, or its equivalent, is required as preliminary. The work of the course begins with a study of Vertebrate Embryology: this is followed by the detailed comparative study of the structure and development of one or more systems of organs as existing in the vertebrates and in those forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically related to the vertebrate stock. The library of the department contains a large amount of standard and periodical literature bearing on the subject-matter of this course, and the reading of the student will be directed as far as possible in accordance with his individual needs. Text-Books.—Marshall's Vertebrate Embryology; Wiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates (Parker tr.). IV. Zoology.—This course, open to graduate students only, includes the study of Animal Morphology, as illustrated by the anatomy, histology and, as far as possible, the embryology of a series of representative species chosen from the principal divisions of the animal kingdom, the principles of classification, and the arrangement of the various orders and classes of animals in larger groups as indicated by their structural affinities. Text-Book.—McMurrich's Invertebrate Morphology. For reference: Parker and Haswell's Text-Book of Zoölogy; Lang's Text-Book of Comparative Anatomy; Korschelt and Heider's Embryology of Invertebrates. The completion of Courses I and II and either III or IV will be required of candidates for a diploma of graduation in the School of Biology, and of those offering Biology as one of their electives for the degree of Master of Arts. Courses III and IV will not both be given the same year at present. PH. D. The more advanced work in Biology will be devoted chiefly to Vertebrate Anatomy and Morphology, each of the systems of organs being in turn critically studied; it will in substance be an extension of the work of Course III. Such lectures will be given and such reading assigned as may be deemed advisable, but the larger part of the work will be done in the laboratory of the University and at such seaside or other laboratories elsewhere as may be designated, the principal object of the course being to train the student in methods of original investigation while he is becoming acquainted with the present state of our knowledge of the vertebrates and their allies. A knowledge of the subject-matter of Course IV will also be required of students who elect Biology as their major subject for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. In addition to the Courses in Biology above described, provision is made in this School for discussion, when called for, of one of the most important of the practical applications of Biological Science. In this connection the following course is offered: V. Practical Biology and Agriculture.—The relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the diseases or the parasites of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic Zoölogy (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). The topics discussed in such a course will be, to some extent, selected in accordance with the objects in view of those electing it in any year. The following suggested course will indicate a possible arrangement of subjects. Text-Books for 1900-1901.—Sorauer's Physiology of Plants (Weiss tr.); Tubeuf's Diseases of Plants induced by Cryptogamic Parasites (Smith tr.); Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals (Fleming tr.). Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete Courses I, II, IV, and V. Substitution of work fully equivalent in amount and character may be made for the subjects published as requirements for either of the graduations in this school from year to year in the case of any students whose previous training or special aptitude give good reasons therefor. The Biological Laboratory, newly domiciled in a convenient suite of rooms in the middle of the new Academic building, is well provided with instruments for the gross and minute dissection of animals and plants; microscopes, microtomes, reagents, and materials for the staining and mounting of preparations; apparatus for photography and microphotography, and other necessary appliances, not only for student work, but for investigation and research as well. In addition to the large and valuable collection of the Brooks Museum, an abundant supply of other necessary specimens and material is furnished. A library of reference is attached to the Laboratory, and students have access to a number of leading biological and agricultural journals, thus acquiring practice in the intelligent use of current literature.

The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed for students who desire to extend their work in certain departments of learning, so as to lay a broader foundation for professional study, to equip themselves for the work of teaching, or to prepare for specialized lines of research in letters or science. It is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has been graduated in each of four Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty. The utmost freedom of election will be encouraged in the arrangement of these courses, subject to the condition that the four lines of advanced work chosen shall be so related as to form a rationally connected whole. It is expressly ordered, however, that none of the work done for the B. A. degree shall be counted again as part of the advanced work required for the M. A. degree, nor shall the advanced work done for the M. A. degree be counted also for the B. A. degree. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the M. A. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree shall be submitted for approval to the Faculty, who have absolute power to accept or reject the degree offered. The candidate must in all cases be graduated in the B. A. course in each school before he is admitted to the M. A. course in that school. But this last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of the candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the M. A. course simultaneously with the B. A. course of the school. A Bachelor of Arts of any other chartered institution of learning who enters this University as a candidate for the M. A. degree, must submit to the Faculty a statement showing the four major studies in which he proposes to pursue the M. A. courses, and five associated minor studies, which would complete the requirements for the B. A. and M. A. degrees. Under the regulations of the Visitors, he will be required to pursue here both the B. A. and M. A. courses in the four major studies. But in any or all of the five minor studies he will be excused from attendance upon the regular B. A. courses upon presenting his diploma and passing a SPECIAL EXAMINATION at this University in such studies. This examination, which shall be held in writing, will, in all cases, be of a practical character, designed to test the permanent acquisition by the student of a sound general knowledge of the several subjects. Bachelors of Arts who are deficient in any of the minor studies may fill cut their schemes of study by attending the regular B. A. courses at this University in those subjects and passing the regular examinations. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia is offered to students who propose to devote their energies to special study and research in some of the various departments of letters or the sciences. The candidate for this degree must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, or other degree of like value from this University or from some other college or university of good standing, or must exhibit to the Faculty, by examination if necessary, satisfactory evidences of having a collegiate education equivalent to that represented by the degree of Bachelor of Arts of a college or university of good standing. In the case that the applicant received his collegiate education at an institution other than this, the Faculty will pass, if necessary, upon the standing of the institution in question. The preparation of the candidate for entrance upon Ph. D. courses in the particular subjects selected shall be passed upon by the Academic Faculty on the basis of a report from the professors in charge of the schools involved. These professors may satisfy themselves of such preparation by any test they see fit to apply, including a formal examination if they deem this necessary. The work required for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia shall in all cases embrace three subjects, viz., a major subject, in which a dissertation is to be prepared, a cognate minor, and an independent minor. The election of subjects shall in all cases be submitted to the Academic Faculty for its approval at the beginning of candidacy. No time limit is set for the acquisition of this degree, except a minimum time limit of three years of study therefor, after the acquisition of the B. A. degree. The major subject shall be pursued during the whole time, the first minor during at least two years, and the second minor during at least one year.

The Department of Engineering embraces the schools of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, and Geology. It offers in each of the four great divisions of engineering—Civil, Mining, Mechanical, and Electrical—a complete course of instruction in the scientific principles as well as in the present practice of the profession. The Preparation needed for the successful prosecution of the course is an accurate knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Plane and Solid Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry. For students possessing this minimum of training the arrangement of the courses shown on the scheme of studies given below is recommended.

The Method of Instruction is by systematic lectures combined with the study of suitable text-books, daily oral examinations on the contents of lectures and text-books, and periodical written examinations on the same. Associated with this formal instruction is a large volume of practical exercises in the drawing-room, the field, and the various laboratories and shops attached to the department—No student is admitted to examination as a candidate for graduation until these exercises have been duly performed. The Equipment for the work of instruction is extensive and of the best and most modern type. It embraces the laboratories of Chemistry and of Physics, the museums of Geology and of Industrial Chemistry, the Mechanical Laboratory, shops for work in wood and in metal, a commodious drawing-room, and a fine selection of field instruments. The outfit of hand and machine tools, including provision for forging and founding, and of machines for tests of strength, elasticity and rigidity, together with all the appliances for measurements of power and efficiency, is new and carefully selected. The Courses of Study in the general scientific subjects have been fully explained in the earlier pages of this catalogue. In addition to these a complete series of technical courses is offered, the details of which are given below. In each of these, three lectures a week are given and with the lectures suitable practical exercises are associated. Each course is divided into three sections, terminating at the times of the mid-winter, spring, and summer examinations. For graduation the student is required not only to attend the lectures and perform all the practical exercises but to pass the examinations also with a grade not less than seventy-five per cent. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY. This course, which is required of all students in the Department of Engineering, is intended to familiarize the student with the use of drafting instruments and the conventions of mechanical drawing, to train him to accuracy and readiness in the constructive processes of Plane and Solid Geometry, and to give him a large amount of thoughtful exercise in the practical processes of machine design and building construction. 1. Mechanical Drawing and Descriptive Geometry. The work of the first term is devoted especially to the training of the student in Mechanical Drawing, the use of drawing instruments and practice in the solution at the drawing board of geometrical problems in the plane and in space. It begins with the systematic study of the constructive geometry of the plane, including problems on lines and angles, triangles and quadrilaterals, the construction of regular polygons, the division of lines and arcs, and the construction of similar figures. The rules for the projection of prisms, pyramids, cones, cylinders, and spheres are then studied, and their sections and intersections are constructed. The descriptive geometry of the line and the plane is next taken up, and the fundamental problems of tangencies and intersections are solved for ruled surfaces and revolutes. At the conclusion of the course the processes of graphical arithmetic are explained and the methods of graphical addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, involution and evolution, and differentiation and integration are carefully taught and practised, and instruction is given in the theory and use of the planimeter. 2. Building Construction. The second term is devoted to a systematic exposition of the principles and methods of general Building Construction. The subject of foundations is discussed and illustrated by examples, and exercises in the design of ordinary foundations, pile foundations, raft foundations, coffer-dam foundations, and pneumatic foundations are carefully worked out. The materials and processes of masonry construction are then considered; the properties and preparation of building stones and bricks, of limes and cements, of mortars and concretes are explained; the specifications for stone and brick masonry are critically considered and the methods for estimating quantities of material and cost of workmanship are explained and practised. A similar discussion follows for timber construction, and the carpentry of floors and partitions, framing, roofs, ordinary timber bridges, trestles, and the woodtrim of buildings is carefully criticised. The next section of the course deals with iron and steel in their structural uses, the sources and properties of the materials, the methods of manufacture, and the assembling and fireproofing of modern skeleton steel structures. The final division of the course is devoted to a discussion of the materials and processes employed for roofing, plastering, painting, glazing, paper-hanging and so on. Numerous exercises in drafting and design accompany the course and are worked out in detail by the student. In connection with these suitable instruction is also given in the theory and practice of perspective and axonometric projections, and of shades and shadows. 3. Machine Drawing and Design. The third term is given to study and practice in Machine Drawing and design. The conventional methods of representation for rivets, bolts, screws, keys, gibs and cotters, and other fastenings are explained and illustrated. The principal elements of machines are then taken up and discussed in order, and the rules for proportioning shafts and their journals, pulleys, toothed gears, cranks, connecting rods, crank and wrist pins, cross-heads and their guides, pistons, cylinders and so on are developed and applied. As in all other parts of the course the exercises of the lecture room are paralleled by practical examples at the drawing board, and each student is required to execute a sheet of machine details designed by himself. ENGINEERING GEODESY. This course is required of all students of Civil or Mining Engineering. Its aim is to teach the construction and use of the standard field instruments of the engineer, the methods of field work, the best arrangement of field notes, the construction of maps and profiles and their use in the location of lines for roads, railways, sewers, waterpipes, and so on, the mathematical processes for estimating quantities—as lengths, angles, areas, volumes, velocities—the location and construction of roads and railways, and the execution and maintenance of works of municipal engineering. 1.

The class takes up in order, the chain and tape, the level and levelling rod, the compass, the plain transit, the complete transit with vertical arc, stadia wires and gradienter, and the current meter, studies their details in the class-room and practises their use in the field; the arrangement of the field notes and the methods of recording observations are taught at the same time. The methods for reducing the field notes are next taught and practised; elevations and profiles are obtained, lengths and angles are computed, areas are estimated from the notes and determined graphically and mechanically from the map, volumes and discharges are computed, and the methods of subdividing areas and determining the values of inaccessible lengths, heights, and directions are taught. This section of the course is concluded by the discussion and solution of the chief problems of geodetic astronomy—the location of the true meridian and the determination of the declination of the needle, the determination of latitude, the determination of local time and of longitude, with a degree of precision sufficient for the needs of the engineer. Suitable attention is given at proper points in the course to field instruments of minor importance, such as the hand level, the barometer, the plane table, the sextant, and so on. 2. Railway Engineering. The next term is devoted to the subject of Railway Engineering. from the field notes of a preliminary survey, furnished by the methods of surveying already discussed, the student is required to construct a map of the line, to interpolate the contours, and to complete the paper location. The methods of field location are then carefully developed and abundant exercise is given in determining the elements of simple, compound, and reverse curves, in the location of transition curves, and in the computation and setting out of frogs, switches, and turnouts. Methods of construction are then studied and the details of earthwork, rockwork, tunneling, and trestling are carefully discussed. Finally the problems connected with track work are considered, and the cross-section of the roadbed, the ballast, the ties and tieplates, the rails and their fastenings, the method of tracklaying and ballasting, and the general questions connected with track construction and maintenance are carefully reviewed. 3. Municipal Engineering. The last division of the course deals with the chief topics of Municipal Engineering. The questions connected with street pavements are first examined and a careful exposition is given of the principles of construction of driveways and sidewalks for city and suburban streets, and incidentally for country highways. All the standard forms of paving material are discussed with reference to their technical and economical features, and the rational methods of constructing the road bed, laying the pavement, and maintaining its surface are developed. The problems of location and construction of street railways also receive due consideration. The subject of water supplies for cities is next taken up. The sources of supply and their sanitary values are considered, together with the methods of collection, the construction of storage and distributing reservoirs and their dams and outlet-works, the processes of filtration and their economic and sanitary relations, the design and construction of aqueducts and pipe lines, and the distribution and measurement of individual supplies. Finally, the sewerage and drainage of cities is discussed. Methods are investigated for the removal of house sewage and of storm drainage, and the rules of design of separate and combined sewers are carefully expounded. The construction of pipe and brick sewers is then explained, together with the manholes, flush tanks, syphons, tide outlets, and other accessory works embraced in a sewage system, and the problems of maintenance are considered. In conclusion the questions of sewage disposal are concisely investigated and the principles of the various methods in use with their sanitary and economic relations receive due attention. GENERAL MECHANICS. This course is required of every student in the Department of Engineering. The object is to convey such a knowledge of rational and technical mechanics, as is essential for the correct understanding of the problems of construction, and such facility in the analytical and graphical methods of solution, and the processes of the testing laboratory as will make the young engineer a competent guide in questions of design. 1. Rational Mechanics. The work of the first term is devoted to a careful survey of the fundamental principles of Rational Mechanics. The synthetic method is followed and only elementary mathematical processes are employed, the object being to convey a sound knowledge of dynamical principles, disentangled from extrinsic mathematical difficulties. For this purpose a good text-book is minutely studied, several hundred simple exercises are solved, and the progress of the student is tested by constant examinations, oral and written. The course covers statics, the elementary dynamics of a particle, hydrostatics, and hydraulics. 2. Strength of Materials. The subject of Strength of Materials is taken as the work of the second term. A careful analysis is made of the problems of stress and strain for the cases of simple tension, compression, bending, shearing, and twisting with due regard to all the normal arrangements of load. The fundamental rules for strength and elasticity furnished by this analysis are then applied to actual tests of materials in the laboratory. The student performs for himself under the guidance of the instructor actual tests of steel and iron, cast iron, timber, cements, bricks, and building stones, and is required in addition to plan occasional independent investigations, devise apparatus, execute the tests, and report in writing his results. The problems of compound stress are next examined and the more important of these are discussed in detail; the shearing action in beams, the strength of columns, the resistance of shafts to combined twisting and bending, and the strains in compound and trussed girders are examined. Finally, the elements of machines are considered and the rules of design for rivets, pins, bolts, keys, journals, axles, cranks, connecting rods, pipes, cylinders, cross-heads, guide bars, and so on, are deduced and applied. 3. Graphical Statics. During the last term the attention of the student is directed to the determination of the straining actions in the elementary members of structures, and the practical design of the simpler examples. Use is made of analytical processes, but especial attention is given to the methods of Graphical Statics. The determination of stress in the ordinary classes of foundations is first taken up. Next follows the study of the strength and stability of walls and piers, of reservoir dams for water, and of retaining walls for earth. The design of stone arches and their abutments for both highway and railway bridges is next studied. The course then passes on to deduce the constructive rules for simple beams as employed for the floors of buildings and bridges, either as joists or girders, and in both timber and steel. The construction and design of roof trusses, both of timber and of steel, is next taken up. Finally, as complete a study is made as the limitations of time will permit of the ordinary forms of bridge construction for both highway and railway bridges, under both uniform and locomotive wheel loads, and complete designs are worked out in class for a timber-trussed bridge, a plate-girder bridge, and one or more steel-trussed bridges. In addition to the work done in the class-room every student is required to make for himself an independent analysis of one example of each type of structure discussed. Illustrations are drawn through the entire course from current engineering practice and an abundance of such practical exercises serves to add vitality and utility to the instruction given. ADVANCED MECHANICS. This course, which is required of students of civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, gives a fuller and more analytical treatment of rational mechanics, and is extended to cover its application to thermodynamics and the thermodynamical theory of heat engines, and to hydrodynamics and the theory of hydraulic motors. 1. Analytical Mechanics. The work of the first term consists of a course in Analytical Mechanics, developed by the aid of the higher mathematical processes, with especial reference to the dynamics of a particle and of a rigid body. The laws of motion, force, and energy, already studied under a more elementary aspect, are restated in the forms furnished by the infinitesimal calculus, and applied to produce the general equations of motion and equilibrium for the particle, for the material system, for rigid bodies, and for elastic bodies. From these general equations are developed the more interesting special problems of advanced mechanics—the theories of projectile motion in vacuo and in air, of planetary and other orbital motions, of the rotation of rigid bodies about fixed axes, and fixed centres, of the potential and of attractions, and of elastic equilibrium. 2. Thermodynamics. During the second term the subject of Thermodynamics is studied. The general equations of heat energy are established and are first applied to the investigation of the thermal behavior of air and other so-called permanent gases. The forms of the various thermal curves for such gases are studied, the theories of the hot air engine, the compressed air engine, and the air compressor are developed, and the laws of efflux of air from orifices and through pipes are investigated. The same methods are next applied to the study of steam and other vapours, with particular reference to the theories of the steam engine and the ice machine. The processes for tracing the heat losses in the various stages of the steam engine cycle are minutely studied, the effects of jacketing, superheating, and compounding are analyzed, and their results upon steam engine economy are exhibited. Practical laboratory methods for determining the humidity of the steam, the indicated power of the engine, the brake horse-power, the steam consumption, and the rejected heat are developed and applied in actual tests by the student. Finally the thermodynamic analysis is applied to the internal combustion motor. The cycles of all forms which have received successful practical development are minutely studied. The methods for testing the available energy, the indicated and the useful work of the actual gas engine, and the heat losses are explained, and the use illustrated by experimental application. 3. Hydrodynamics. A course in Hydrodynamics constitutes the work of the last term. The principles of hydrostatics are first restated in more comprehensive form. The general equations of fluid motion are then developed in their classical forms, and applied to investigate the more interesting cases of irrotational, wave and vortex motion. The fundamental principles of hydraulics are next established and the laws of flow from orifices, notches, nozzles, pipes, and canals are studied, with due regard to the data of experiment and the conditions of practice. Finally the laws of impact and reaction between fluids and solids are studied, the rules of construction and operation of water pressure engines, water wheels, turbines, centrifugal pumps and reciprocating pumps are developed, and the results obtained are applied to the problems of utilizing natural water powers and designing hydraulic machinery. CIVIL ENGINEERING. This course is devoted to the development of subjects of peculiar importance for the civil engineer, which have not been adequately treated in the earlier sections of his studies. These are the statical analysis of structures, especially of the more intricate types, the design of structural details, and the problems of river engineering. 1. Roofs and Bridges. The work of the first term is devoted to the statical analysis of structures. The principles of analysis, already developed in the course of General Mechanics and applied to the simpler forms of roofs and bridges, are restated and extended. The continuous girder, the cantilever, the swing bridge, the braced arch, and the suspension bridge are studied and their straining actions are determined. Complete analyses of strain for a number of typical forms are worked out in the class, examples being selected by preference from the current practice of engineers. The collateral questions growing out of the location of bridges are also examined and the principles involved in determining the strength of the foundation, the stability of the stream bed, the amplitude of the water way, and discharge of the flood waters are reviewed. 2. Structural Details. The second term of the course is directed to the design of structural details in the constructions analyzed in the earlier division of the work. Riveted connections, pin joints, column sections, stiffened tension members, standard types of portal and sway bracing, plain and expansion pedestals, and all the usual details of roof and bridgework in timber and steel are critically studied. Complete bills of material are prepared for a number of structures, and each student is required to develop independently an entire design and to offer as part of his graduating work a descriptive memoir, giving all the requisite calculations and accompanied by the usual general and detailed drawings. In the preparation of such details a standard practice of our best American designers is carefully observed, and the student is familiarized with their established conventions. 3. River Engineering. During the third term the attention of the class is directed to the great problems of river engineering and its modern developments. The methods of gauging the flow of streams and determining the normal and flood discharges are first discussed. The problems of flood control, levee construction and maintenance, rectification of the stream bed and protection of the banks are next considered. The subject of canalization of rivers is then taken up, and the design and construction of locks and their appurtenances, of movable dams and navigation passes, and of fixed weirs, are expounded in the light of rational theory and standard practice. The location and construction of artificial canals and river diversions are treated in this connection and illustrated from the great enterprises of recent engineering history. The methods for the improvement of the mouths of tidal and tideless rivers are next explained and the relative utilities of training walls, jetties and dredging operations are defined. Finally the subjects of the reclamation of swamps and the irrigation of arid lands are taken up and treated with as much completeness as the limitations of time permit. MINING ENGINEERING. In this course such adequate knowledge of mine surveying, road and railway construction, and pure and applied mechanics and hydraulics, as has been given by the earlier sections of the mining courses is presupposed, and the student is carried forward to the immediate consideration of those technical subjects which belong to the exclusive domain of the mining engineer. 1. Exploitation of Mines. The studies of the first term may be included under the general title of the Exploitation of Mines. They begin with a general survey and classification of ore deposits, especial reference being had to the mineral wealth of the United States. The subject of prospecting is next taken up and a full account is given of the methods of sinking exploratory borings and the machinery used for that purpose. The operations connected with shaft sinking are next studied, including the methods of excavation, the use of timber for sustaining the walls, the construction of permanent masonry linings, and the methods of sinking shafts through highly aquiferous strata. The processes of tunneling are then reviewed in the same manner and the location of shafts and tunnels is explained. Finally the various methods of extracting the ore and timbering the workings are discussed in full, both for underground mines and for surface workings and placer deposits. 2. Mining Machinery. During the second term attention is directed to those mining operations which involve the use of the various classes of mining machinery. The question of transportation is first studied and the various methods of hauling by chutes, carts, locomotives, stationary engines, and cable conveyors are explained. Hoists and hoisting machinery are then discussed, the mechanical principles involved are developed, and rules for design are deduced. The problem of mine drainage is next examined, the economic advantages of drainage tunnels are weighed, and the construction of mine pumps and the general design of pumping machinery are taught.

Finally, the principal types of prime movers employed for operating the machinery of mines are discussed, the general lay-out of the works is illustrated, the rules for estimating the power of the motors are developed, their economic advantages compared, and the methods of power transmission are reviewed. 3. Ore Dressing. The processes of ore dressing constitute the general topic for the remainder of the course. The appliances used for washing the ore are first discussed and their mode of action and utility are explained. The various methods for drying the ores or roasting them, if desired, are next considered and their effects are studied. Machinery for crushing the ore is then taken up and the processes by which it is brought to the requisite degree of fineness are examined. The appliances used in picking, sorting and screening the ores are next described. Lastly the methods of concentration and the devices employed to effect it are explained and discussed. In each section of the course illustrations as copious as possible are introduced, drawn by preference from the practice of American engineers, and in concluding the lectures a series of descriptions of complete ore-dressing plants is given. These are arranged to cover the chief developments of mining enterprise in the United States and to make clear to the student the approved methods of coördinating the various operations which have been already separately analyzed and described. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. The subjects embraced in this course are those which may be considered as belonging especially or exclusively to the province of the mechanical engineer. They are treated under the following divisions: 1. Steam Power Plants. The topics assigned to the first term are such as relate to the general organization and layout of modern steam power plants. The analysis of fuels, their heating power, their combustion, and the furnaces in which they are burned, are first considered. The construction of boilers is next taken up and the forms of setting, the materials used in their construction, the design of the joints and attachments, and the determination of the proportions of the boiler for a given duty are carefully studied. The principal types of steam engine are then discussed, the conditions determining the choice of high or low speed, simple or compound, condensing or non-condensing engines are developed, and the rules for fixing their general proportions are investigated. The design of the condenser is next studied, its standard forms are described and illustrated, its proportion established, and the conditions of its utility are defined. Finally the methods of testing a power plant are given, the principles of the construction of the pyrometers, thermometers, gauges, calorimeters, indicators, dynamometers and so on employed in the tests are discussed, and the methods of standardizing and using them are established. A complete set of laboratory exercises in the performance of such tests is given, and the student is made familiar with the standard methods of testing, and practised in the reduction and analysis of the results. 2. Steam Engine Design. The work of the second term consists in a systematic study of the problem of steam engine design. A type of engine having been selected from the results reached in the first division of the work, rules are developed from rational principles and experimental data for the correct proportions of all its details—cylinders and cylinder ends, pistons and piston rods, wrist pins, crank pins, connecting rods, shafts, cranks, cross heads, guides, and so on. The indicated diagram of the projected engine and the resulting energy curves are next studied, the weight and proportions of the fly-wheel are determined, and the inertia strains on the frame and foundations of the engine are ascertained and allowed for. The laws of construction and operation of the governor are next developed and rules are worked out for the design of governors of all the standard types. The problems of valve gearing are then approached and solved by both analytical and graphical processes, all the usual forms of gearing being minutely discussed. In conclusion the internal resistances of the engine are investigated, together with the methods of lubrication, and the losses of energy from friction, and the probable brake horse-power is determined for various steam pressures and speeds. The course in design is followed by the student not only in the lectures, but in practical exercises at the drawing board, so arranged as to furnish by their results a complete set of steam engine details. 3. Transmission of Power. In the last section of the course are considered the problems connected with the transmission of power. Shaft transmissions are first studied, their proportions are determined, the losses of energy to which they are subjected are estimated, and the methods of testing these by means of suitable transmission dynamometers are explained. Like investigations follow for belt, rope and teledynamic transmissions; for transmission by toothed gear; and for hydraulic and pneumatic transmissions. Illustrations drawn from current engineering practice are used to give definiteness to the student's conceptions of these important applications of engineering theory. The attempt is made also to define the proper field for the employment of each type of transmission and to fix the economic limits of its application. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The course in electrical engineering presupposes such a knowledge of the fundamental principles of electricity and magnetism as is furnished by the studies of the School of Natural Philosophy. It relies on the Physical Laboratory also for practice in the more refined methods of electrical testing, and for the use of the more delicate forms of electrical apparatus. The work undertaken in the engineering department is directed to the analysis and design of dynamo-electric machinery in its ordinary commercial forms, to the construction and maintenance of electrical power plants and transmission systems, and to those practical methods of testing which are of primary value and constant use in electrical engineering. 1. Constant Currents and Constant Current Machinery. The work of the first term deals with the constant current dynamo, basing itself upon the accepted definitions and laws of electrical phenomena without aiming to review their experimental foundations or their mathematical proofs. A practical study of resistances, currents, and electro-motive forces in simple and compound circuits, introduces the student to the analysis and design of the constant current generator. Rules are developed for determining the proportions of the armature and its winding, the dimensions and windings of the field magnets, the size of the magnet frame, and the commutators and brushes, and for computing the probable electrical and commercial efficiencies of the finished machine. These rules are applied to various standard types of dynamo and made the basis of practical detailed designs. A similar study is made of the constant current motor, illustrations being drawn here also from the details of actual machines. Parallel with the lecture room course on dynamo design will be given a laboratory course on testing constant current dynamos, determining the characteristic curves of the machines, measuring their electrical and commercial efficiencies, analyzing the losses of energy, and investigating resistances and leaks on electrical circuits. 2. Alternating Currents and Alternating Current Machinery. Attention is next directed to the study of alternating currents and alternating current machinery. The investigation of the laws of the alternating current is first pursued, and the analytical and graphical methods of determining current and potential are worked out in a series of cases of gradually increasing intricacy, and applied to the solution of actual problems of distribution. The theory of the alternate current transformer is next approached, and the laws of the mutual interaction of the primary and secondary currents are fully developed. These laws are then applied to the analysis of standard types of transformer, to the development of rules for testing transformers, and to the design of transformers for a given output. Finally the study of alternating generators and motors is attacked, and the methods of design, construction, and test for the leading types of these machines are developed. 3. Transmission of Electrical Energy. During the last term the various problems arising out of the transmission of electrical energy and its utilization are considered. The general organization of electrical power plants, the arrangement of the engines and dynamos, and the appliances for registering the output are discussed. The layout of the electric light system is studied, the dimensioning of the cables, the disposition and balance of the lamps, and the economic relation of the several systems of transmission are considered. The subject of electric traction for railways is next taken up, and the construction of the motors and cars, the dimensioning and erection of the cables, and the efficiency of the systems are examined. Electrical systems for the distribution of power in mills and factories are then investigated and compared as to efficiency and economy with the older methods by use of shafting, belting, gears, and so on. Finally, the subject of long-distance electric transmissions is studied and the economic and scientific features of this method of utilizing the powers of nature are carefully investigated.

W. DUKE, Jr., Secretary. The Department of Agriculture is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va.; this sum having been given to establish a fund, the income of which should be applied, as far as practicable, to the maintenance of experiments in agriculture, training in the art of farming, and instruction in those sciences which underlie that art, as well as in their practical relations thereto. Since the income in question is manifestly inadequate to provide for all these important ends in an efficient manner, it has become necessary for those directly charged with its administration to decide how it can be most usefully applied within the limits indicated. The establishment and maintenance, by the national government, of large and well-equipped experiment stations in each State has made far better and more extensive provision for the first of these interests than could here be afforded were the whole revenue of this Department to be so applied. The work in this direction which was begun here before the establishment of the Virginia Experiment Station at Blacksburg, and for some time maintained, has therefore been discontinued. As regards the second of these objects above named, experience has shown that those who desire training in the details of the various processes involved in the art of farming do not seek it at institutions of learning. Throughout the whole country excellent facilities for such instruction exist, far in excess of the demand. Here, again, the field is now well occupied by a State institution, established, equipped, and maintained for this and kindred purposes. The University has not now, rarely if ever has had in the past, and is no more likely to have in the future, any students pursuing or desirous of pursuing courses of instruction in the routine work of farming. For these reasons it seems wiser, as well as more consonant with the other functions of the University, to apply the income of this fund to the enlargement, as far as possible, of the opportunities here afforded those who desire to acquire a knowledge of the sciences on which the art of agriculture is based and of which it is the practical application, to understand their theoretical principles as well as their economic relations, and to be capable of following their progress in all its bearings. Young men who desire such a scientific education in order that they may intelligently pursue the vocation of a planter have sought the University for this purpose in the past and will doubtless do so in the future, although at the present time this calling does not loudly invite followers, either educated or uneducated. Instruction is therefore offered in this Department to all who desire such training in the Descriptive and Experimental Sciences as this would imply, together with a knowledge of the closely affiliated Mathematical Sciences, and of the Modern Languages of immediate importance to the scientific student. The degree of Bachelor of Science will be conferred upon compliance with the following conditions: The completion of one B. S. course each in Botany, Physics, General Chemistry, Comparative Anatomy, Geology, and Analytical Chemistry, together with graduation in two of the schools represented by these courses: of one B. S. course, to be selected by the student from the group of Mathematical Sciences, viz., Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Astronomy, and the completion of the B. S. courses in French and German. The B. S. courses are the same or the equivalent of the B. A. courses, described in a preceding portion of this catalogue; that in Analytical Chemistry is the first course of that School. The conditions of graduation in the scientific Schools have also been previously stated. The hours of lectures will be found in the Academic schedule on page 94. Hours for laboratory work, where the course in question calls for them, are adapted as far as practicable to the other work of each student. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Agriculture may be estimated at from $290 a year upwards, according to the mode of living. This is considerably diminished in the case of Virginia students by the provisions made for their free tuition in certain schools. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia students are entitled to free tuition, may be found in a subsequent section. MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. A scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the candidate which at that time passes the graduation examinations in the B. S. courses of Botany, Chemistry, and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for the following two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department of Agriculture. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure. Candidacy should be announced at the beginning of the session.</field>

SESSIONS AND COURSES OF STUDY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Attention is called to the fact that the course has been extended to four years, and provision has been made for the erection and equipment of a Hospital, with extension of clinical instruction in connection therewith. Attention may also with propriety be directed to the fact that while those giving clinical instruction are in every case active practitioners of medicine and surgery, who in each instance devote special attention to the subjects immediately assigned to their care at the clinics, the great majority of the professors and instructors in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia owe their entire time throughout the session to the University, and devote it to lecture and laboratory teaching; and that in consequence of this fact the instruction given to medical students has always been characterized by a marked degree of efficiency. It is largely to this feature, which has been peculiar to this institution since the opening of its Medical Department in 1827, that the recognized high standing of its graduates is due. It is also noteworthy that the large personal element entering into the methods of teaching here in vogue, render auxiliary instruction at the hands of private parties unnecessary. While carefully selected and competent licentiates are appointed by the Medical Faculty and empowered by that body to give private lessons to those who desire them and choose to pay for them, no intelligent and industrious student need be at any expense whatever for instruction beyond the payment of the regular tuition fees. Any one who faithfully performs, day by day, the work assigned him, will, unless wanting in capacity, succeed in satisfying the conditions for his degree. The work of each of the four years of the course in Medicine continues through the full nine months of the University session, beginning on the fifteenth day of September and closing on the Saturday immediately preceding the fifteenth day of the following June. The studies included are arranged as follows: During the first session: Chemistry (with an introductory course upon the principles of Chemical Physics); Biology (Comparative Anatomy and Normal Histology); Descriptive Anatomy; and Practical Physics. During the second session: Physiology; Bacteriology; General Pathology; Regional Anatomy; Hygiene; and Practical Chemistry. During the third session: Embryology; Obstetrics; Practice of Medicine; Surgery; Special Pathology and Clinical Diagnosis; Materia Medica; and Dispensary Clinic. During the fourth session: Practice of Medicine; Therapeutics; Clinical Surgery; Dermatology; Diseases of the Eye and Ear; Gynecology and Medical Jurisprudence; Dispensary and Hospital Clinic. An examination of this system will show that the work of the first year is given to those sciences which are fundamental to the entire work of the remaining part of the course; that of the second year includes the study of those sciences, more distinctively medical, which are based upon the work of the previous year, while they in turn underlie the more strictly professional subjects of study; these latter are begun in the second year, while the third and fourth years are devoted wholly to them. The larger part of the work of the first year is accompanied by practical work in the laboratory and the dissecting-room; the same is true in great measure of the work of the second year, while in the third, and especially the fourth year, the time of the student is devoted largely to practical clinical instruction. The facilities afforded by the University for such work will be more fully described in the statements which follow concerning the different subjects included in the course. Methods of Instruction.—The instruction is given by systematic lectures and frequent oral examinations, with associated practical work in Anatomy, Physics and Chemistry, Histology, Bacteriology, Pathology, and Obstetrics. The oral examinations on the subjects of the previous lectures are of great value in stimulating the student to regular and systematic habits of study, and furnishing the professor an opportunity of discovering and removing difficulties met with by the student. Admission to the First Year of the Course.—The policy of the University of Virginia has not hitherto included formal entrance examinations as a condition of admission to the work of either of its principal Departments. In conformity, however, with the usage of the leading Medical Schools throughout the country, and in coöperation with the general movement among those interested, looking toward the requirement of a liberal education as a prerequisite to entrance upon the work of the medical profession, the Faculty of the Department of Medicine announce their intention of requiring in future evidence of adequate preparation for the work of this Department of the University. They will for the present ask of each applicant for admission to the first year in the course in Medicine proof of a good general education, to be demonstrated by the presentation of a baccalaureate degree from an institution of collegiate rank, or a certificate of good standing in the classes of such an institution; a diploma of graduation from a good high school, either public or private, or a personal testimonial from the principal of such an institution; or, if necessary, by actual examination. Candidates for admission who fail to satisfy this condition by one of the methods above indicated, will be excluded, except in doubtful cases when they may be admitted by a special vote of the Faculty of Medicine, subject to the condition that any deficiency shall be removed before the student so admitted proceeds to the work of the second year. Students who present a baccalaureate degree on entrance will, for the present, be entitled to the privileges of undertaking the studies of the second year together with those of the first year. Students entering the Medical Department of this University from other medical schools are considered students of the first year until they have passed the examinations mention d in the following paragraph. Relations of the Student in the Second and Succeeding Years. Students who pass a satisfactory examination on the subjects studied during the first session are not required to attend the lectures or stand the examinations on these subjects the second year; but if a student fail to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time on one or more of the subjects included in the first year's course, he will be permitted to take such subject or subjects over during the second year, without the payment of any additional fee. Like rules apply to the passage of the student from the second to the third, and from the third to the fourth session. Provided, however, that no student whose failure to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time shall extend to all the subjects of a given year will be permitted to go on to the work of the succeeding year; he will be required to confine himself to a repetition of the work of the year on which he has failed— and no student will be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until he has completed that of the first, save in both instances by special consent of the Medical Faculty based in each instance on a careful examination of the student's real interests. Certificates of Attendance.—No one will receive a certificate as a regular student of the Department of Medicine in this University unless he has attended the whole regular course of one or more of the four years. Requirements for Graduation.—No student is permitted to graduate from the University of Virginia with the degree of Doctor of Medicine till he shall have attended the regular course of not less than four years in this institution, and passed a satisfactory examination on all the subjects included in the Medical course, unless, in lieu of either the first or second year's study here, he shall have attended one course of lectures of not less than seven months, or two courses of less than seven months each, in some other reputable medical school, in which case he may apply for graduation at the end of his third or second session in this institution; but in order to obtain the degree he must pass a satisfactory examination at this University on all the subjects heretofore mentioned as included in the medical course. A student who is already a graduate in Medicine of some other reputable medical school may be received as a student in this University of the fourth year. The Graduating Examinations are in writing (accompanied in some subjects by individual practical examinations) and of a rigorous character. Two sets of these are held each year—one near the close of the session, after the completion of the lecture courses; the other at the beginning of the next session. To the latter are admitted— (a) Students of the previous session who from illness or other cause approved by the Faculty were unable to present themselves for examination. These may be examined on any part of the course, and will not be required to matriculate anew. (b) Students who at the close of the preceding session have passed satisfactory examinations on at least one of the studies pursued during that session, and have attained on one or more of the remaining subjects such a grade (but little lower than that required for graduation) as the faculty may approve. This slightly lower grade must have been reached on the particular subject or subjects on which the student presents himself for re-examination. (c) Students who present certificates of attendance on one or two seven-months' courses or their equivalent at some other reputable medical school. Students falling under classes (b) and (c), after first matriculating and then passing the Fall examinations on the studies of the preceding one or two sessions, may proceed to the work of the second year, or to that of the third year, without attending the lectures on or passing further examinations in, the studies of the preceding session or sessions, except the general examination which immediately precedes graduation. ?These Fall examinations begin within one week from the opening of the session, and are to be completed not later than the first of October. Written notice of intention to stand these examinations must be filed with the Chairman of the Medical Faculty on or before the eighteenth of September. No special examination will be given in the Department of Medicine except under extraordinary circumstances, to be carefully weighed by the Medical Faculty. Any professor of the Medical Department may exclude from his examination any student whose irregularity of attendance or neglect of practical work warrants, in the professor's judgment, such exclusion. A General Examination is held each year prior to graduation (at the close of the session) on all the different branches on which the candidate for graduation has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet, Professor Dunnington. Dr. Humphreys. In this course the students are taught Chemical Physics and the general principles of Chemistry, and are carried through a course of Descriptive Chemistry, inorganic and organic; their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to Physiology, the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology, and Sanitary Science. Text-Books.—Witthaus' Chemistry; Syllabus of the Professor's lectures. For reference: Charles' Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. A course of laboratory exercises in Practical Physics with especial relation to the needs of the medical student is given by Dr. Humphreys, and a like course in Practical Chemistry is given by Professor Dunnington. These form a part of the prescribed general course in Medicine. MEDICAL BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle, Dr. Wholey, Dr. Skeen, Mr. Robertson, Dr. Burrow, Mr. Sinclair. Under this title are grouped, for convenience, the lectures in the courses described below, the whole forming a continuous series of three lectures a week throughout the first year of the Medical course. Each lecture is accompanied by two hours of practical work in the laboratory illustrative of the topics discussed. The laboratory is convenient, well lighted, and amply equipped; forty-eight desks are provided with microscopes, accessory apparatus, and all necessary reagents, and the class is divided into working sections not exceeding that number; desks are assigned by lot at the opening of the session, and apparatus issued as needed from time to time. Each student is required to provide himself with a set of dissecting instruments, and with slides, covers, and labels for microscopical preparations; all other appliances are provided by the laboratory without charge. Comparative Anatomy.—The lectures of the first three months are devoted to the discussion of the comparative anatomy of vertebrates, the thoracic and abdominal viscera being chiefly considered; the student, in the meantime, dissecting and studying a series of animals representative of the principal sub-divisions of the group. The objects of the course are to give such fundamental morphological conceptions and such general anatomical knowledge as shall pave the way for the detailed and specific study of Human Anatomy; to familiarize the student with the normal appearance of healthy organs and tissues as seen immediately after death; and to lay the foundation for the subsequent intelligent study of Histology and of Physiology. The dissections are supplemented by demonstrations and the study of permanent preparations illustrative of features of importance. Text-Book.—None is required at present. Parker's Zoötomy is recommended for laboratory use, and Wiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates (Parker's Translation) for collateral reading. Histology.—The lectures of the ensuing months are devoted to the allied subjects of Histology and Histological Anatomy. In the first part of the course the tissues and their component elements are carefully examined, both singly and in their primary aggregates, as are also those organs which consist largely of one form of tissue. The remainder of the course is devoted to an examination of the more complex organs and systems of organs, their constituent tissues and the relations between them being studied. While the primary object of the course is the imparting of clear and accurate knowledge of the minute structure of the body, due attention is paid to the technique which is necessary as a means to that end; students are therefore carefully trained in the use of the microscope and in histological processes, including the selection and preparation of material, the making and mounting of sections, and their subsequent study. Text-Book.—The Professor's Elements of Histology. For reference: Schaefer's Essentials of Histology; Piersol's Normal Histology; Clarkson's Text-Book of Histology. The attainments of the student in each of the divisions of the course are tested by both written and practical examinations; his standing for the year is determined by an average of all the marks received. Diligent use of the opportunities afforded in the laboratory is essential to the successful completion of the work of the year, and students who are persistently irregular and negligent of their work will not be admitted to the examinations. ANATOMY. Professor Christian, Dr. Lyman, Dr. Bullitt, Dr. Livermore. Descriptive Anatomy.—The instruction is given by didactic lectures, combined with the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; no statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection, the effort being to convey knowledge by the so-called natural method—that is, by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made thereform. The equipment of the School for this purpose is most ample. Particular attention is called to the fact that in describing the more minute anatomical structures—such as brain, cranial nerves, etc.—cuts and diagrams are not relied upon, as is too often the case, but careful dissections are yearly made and demonstrated to the class. Practical Anatomy.—For this course dissecting material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Attendance in the dissecting room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Every student is required to dissect on all parts of the human body. Two subjects are dissected; the first for muscles and fascias; the second for arteries and nerves. Not more than five dissecting clubs (of eight men each) are admitted to the hall at one time. A Demonstrator for each club superintends the dissections, directing the work of the individual student; and, afterwards, accurately and carefully explaining every dissection to his club. After this careful preparation, besides the ordinary oral and written examinations, each student is required to stand nine practical examinations, one upon osteology, four upon different parts of the muscular system, two on the viscera, one on the ligaments, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being questioned alone, and required not only to state the origin and insertion of muscles, the beginning, termination and relations of blood vessels, nerves, etc., but to point out or demonstrate each fact. They are thus a perfect test of the student's practical acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body. Regional Anatomy.—This subject is taught to second course students by the same practical methods as are described above. The important bony landmarks, lines of blood vessels, nerves and muscles are carefully described and their positions verified by dissections made before the class. Special attention is paid to the study of the landmarks of the skull, neck, chest, and abdomen, and all the structures in, or bearing relation to, the more important joints. Inguinal and femoral hernia, the perineum and pelvis, are described with special reference to the surgery of these parts. Cross sections of the upper and lower extremities of the neck are made at different levels and described to the student, who are afterwards required to stand practical examinations on these parts. The course, in fact, is a comprehensive review of the facts taught in Descriptive Anatomy, but with special reference to their application to Medicine and Surgery. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Barringer. The study of Physiology is not begun until the second year, at which time the student having completed the courses in Chemistry, Anatomy, and Histology, is well prepared to appreciate the broader principles of this subject. The work of the school is designed with reference to its practical bearings, especially on the subsequent studies of Pathology and Therapeutics. While only the usual amount of time is given to the general functions, to the study of the nervous system an amount of time is allotted fully commensurate with its importance to the practitioner. In the later study of the functions of the eye, and the ear, an attention to detail is required which it is believed gives an excellent preparation for subsequent specialism in this line. Text-Books.—The Professor's Abstract. For reference: Landois', Foster's, Hall's or Stewart's Physiology. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle, Dr. Burrow, Dr. Skeen, Dr. Wholey. Bacteriology is taught by lectures accompanied by practical work in the laboratory. The instruction given at the University in this subject differs from that given in most schools of medicine in several important respects. It is very commonly the case that the student is brought almost at the very outset into relation with the bacteria of disease, the whole or the larger part of the course of instruction being given to their specific study, the technique involved in their culture and determination, and the specific products of their activity. These are all matters of the highest importance, and should by no means be neglected; but exact and extensive knowledge of them may be and too often is associated with entire ignorance of the real nature and affinities of the Bacteria, the general principles of vegetable physiology of which their characteristic activities constitute a special case, and of the essential conditions on which their culture depends. Believing that the educated physician should, as far as possible, know the scientific principles on which his professional knowledge rests, provision has been made for a short course which deals with the Bacteria from the botanical standpoint, discussing the general morphology and physiology of plants to an extent sufficient to give the student an intelligent idea of the place of these organisms in the vegetable kingdom and of the relation of their life to that of other plants. This knowledge is made the basis of the farther discussion of their economic relations, of their action as causes of disease, and of the methods resorted to for their manipulation, the most important processes of bactericultural technique, being as far as possible, fully illustrated and demonstrated in the laboratory. The whole course is intended to form a proper preliminary to the specific discussion of the pathogenic bacteria which finds its regular place in the course in Pathology. Text-Book.—The Professor's Introduction to the Bacteria. For reference: Sternberg's or Crookshank's Manual of Bacteriology. PATHOLOGY. Professor Davis, Dr. Burrow, Dr. Skeen, Dr. Wholey. The principles of General Pathology are discussed by lectures and illustrated in the laboratory. The processes of disease are studied in detail, with the unaided eye and with the microscope, upon selected specimens. Instruction is given in the method of conducting an Autopsy, in which the object of preserving for future investigation desirable parts is kept particularly in view. This involves pathological technic, in which students receive a thorough drill and are allowed to retain the preparations they make. Practical exercises are given in Clinical Diagnosis, in which examinations of blood, sputum, urine and faeces are required. Each student has also to recognize by the aid of the microscope the nature of tumors submitted to him, as a distinct test in addition to the regular written examination covering the entire work of the course. Fidelity to the laboratory work is an indispensable condition of success. Under the study of Infections the Bacteria concerned are considered in detail and made the subject of investigation in the laboratory, which is equipped with approved modern apparatus. A series of lectures upon the symptoms and therapeutics of Surgical Diseases follows closely the course upon General Pathology. In the third year Special Pathology is taken up and illustrated by appropriate laboratory exercises, in which the lesions of the chief diseases of each system are carefully studied. Text-Books.—The Professor's Syllabus; Stengel's Text-Book of Pathology; Warren's Surgical Pathology and Therapeutics; Abbott's Principles of Bacteriology. HYGIENE. Dr. Lambeth. In this course the chemical and bacterial comtamination of food, water, air, and soil first engages the attention of the student. With this preparation he takes up the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, school-houses, etc., with especial reference to modern methods of heating, ventilating, and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in Military and Naval Hygiene. Text-Book.—Rohé's Text-Book of Hygiene, or Egbert's Hygiene and Sanitation. EMBRYOLOGY. Professor Tuttle, As a preliminary to the course in Obstetrics there is given a course of lectures upon Embryology in which are discussed the formation and maturation of the reproductive elements; the fertilization of the ovum; the formation of the germ-layers and of the embryo and foetal appendages; and the development of the tissues and organs of the body. While the final object sought is a clear conception of these processes as they are known or believed to take place in the formation of the mammalian and especially the human body, the whole subject is treated from the comparative standpoint, as that best adapted to give intelligent and comprehensive ideas thereof; to this end the development of a series of representative vertebrates is discussed and as far as possible made the subject of practical study. Text-Book.—Schaefer's Embryology (Vol. I, Part I of the tenth edition of Quain's Anatomy). For reference: Marshall's Vertebrate Embryology; Hertwig's Embryology of Vertebrates (Mark tr.); Minot's Human Embryology. OBSTETRICS. Professor Buckmaster. In Obstetrics the subject is presented to the student by lectures with frequent oral examinations, by a series of manikin demonstrations, by work with the living subject in the wards of the Annex and by attendance on patients in the out-patient obstetric service connected with the Dispensary. In this department it is the aim of the didactic teaching to enable the student to classify his knowledge for examination and to learn the relative importance of the subject matter. In no branch is the student required to make earlier use of his knowledge and a text-book is used that may afterwards serve as a book of reference. The manikin course forms an important part of the work not only for teaching presentation position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor. A thorough knowledge of operative procedure may be acquired by this means; for instance, the application of the forceps, the packing of the puerperal uterus, the delivery of the arms caught above the after-coming head, version, and many other procedures. Cleansing of the hands forms a part of the drill. In fact the student is required not only to describe but to carry out the technique of the lying-in chamber. The class is divided into sections of five each and a knowledge of the manikin work will form a part of the examination for graduation in this department. After the section has finished the manikin course it is taken into the wards of the Annex where the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation are practiced on the living subject. Each section is required to fill up a carefully prepared form so that all the details of the case of the patient before labor, is made familiar to the student. The number of out-patient cases is increasing year by year and is becoming an important part of the teaching. The clinical assistant in obstetrics is prepared at any time to accompany a student to the home of a patient and is provided with the necessary armamentarium for conducting a case. The large negro population in the neighborhood of Charlottesville affords a class of patients which present all the difficulties to clean work that are offered by ignorance and poverty. No better practice can be had for one who is trying to educate an "aseptic center." If asepsis can be secured in a hovel it can be preserved in a palace. The student is thus taught how to manage cases by himself and at the same time avoids falling into the slovenly habits he is sure to form without proper guidance. Text-Book.—The Practice of Obstetrics by American Authors. Lea Brothers &amp; Co. SURGERY. Professor Christian, Dr. Humphreys. In Operative Surgery the first aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles and technique of modern aseptic surgical procedure. All amputations and ligations, the application of splints, bandages and apparatus for different fractures, are shown upon the cadaver. To insure a practical knowledge of the subject, each student will be required to perform the operations upon the cadaver as a part of his examination for graduation. Radiography.—A brief course of lectures accompanied with ample laboratory work is given to the students of the fourth year, with the purpose of making clear the principles of X-ray phenomena and of giving to each student such practical experience with the necessary apparatus as will enable him to make professional use thereof with skill and safety. This course is given in the Rouss Physical Laboratory, whicl is unusually well equipped for this work. MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Barringer, Mr. Brenneman, Assistant. In Materia Medica particular stress is laid upon the physiological action of drugs as furnishing the only basis for a rational system of therapeutics. The Department is provided with a good collection of drugs, both crude and prepared, with which the students are made familiar as dealt with in the lectures. Exercises in prescription-writing are given weekly for several months, these exercises being required both in the ordinary English or apothecary system and the French or metric system. Text-Books.—White's Materia Medica and Therapeutics. For reference: Brunton's Pharmacology, Wood's Materia Medica. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Buckmaster. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching at the Dispensary. In the year 1898-99 about three thousand patients were treated, thus affording ample material for elementary teaching. In the didactic lectures the author's syllabus is used as a guide for the essential points to be considered in a careful study of the textbook. The student is earnestly advised to use the syllabus and textbook before hearing the lecture, as experience has shown this to be the most effective means of obtaining a knowledge of the subject. Text-Books.—A Hand-Book of Physical Diagnosis, etc., by R. C. M. Page; The Principles and Practice of Medicine, by William Osler; a Treatise on Mental and Nervous Diseases, by Landon Carter Gray; The Diseases of Infancy and Childhood, by L. Emmet Holt. THERAPEUTICS. Professor Barringer. The subject of Therapeutics is taken up among the studies of the fourth year. The range of the work will embrace both general and special therapeutics, whether rational or empirical, but a constant effort will be made throughout to trace those general underlying principles the existence of which alone enables this subject to be called a science. The method pursued will be that of taking up in order the perversions of the various organs and functions rather than the specific forms of disease. Text-Book.—(To be named hereafter). For reference: Brunton's Pharmacology. DISEASES OF THE EYE AND EAR. Professor Barringer. The study of the Diseases of the Eye and Ear is here solely from the standpoint of the general practitioner. No attempt is made to prepare a "specialist" and no instruction is given in refraction. In the belief, however, that a good practitioner should have a reasonable knowledge of any disease he is likely to meet, a two months' course on the above subjects is given. The elementary use of the ophthalmoscope as an instrument of diagnosis, as well as the use of the head mirror, etc., is practically taught. Text-Book.—Nettleship's Diseases of the Eye. For reference: Carter &amp; Frost's Ophthalmic Surgery, or other approved hand-book. GYNECOLOGY. Professor Buckmaster. In Gynecology instruction is given by lectures and recitations, and the plastic operations necessary to repair injuries of the pelvic structures are shown during the course. Practical training in the details of gynecological treatment is given at the dispensary. Text-Book.—The Professor's Syllabus. For reference: Principles and Practice of Gynecology, by T. A. Emmet; Treatise on the Diseases of Women, by A. J. C. Skene. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Professor Buckmaster. In this course the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. Text-Book.—Chapman's Medical Jurisprudence. CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. Dr. Buckmaster, Mr. Ebersole, Dr. Nelson, Mr. Wertenbaker, Dr. Magruder, Mr. Cocke, Dr. Randolph, Mr. Powell, Dr. Hedges, Mr. Toole, Mr. Brenneman, Mr. Hawes. The opportunities for clinical instruction at the University have within the last few years been very greatly increased. The erection and equipment of the University Dispensary and the careful consideration of the needs of the community in this respect have built up an out-patient department vastly in excess of the apparent possibilities of the city; moreover, this material is utilized for purposes of instruction to a much greater extent than is usually done in clinical teaching. The amphitheatre is so arranged that no student is over fifteen feet from the clinical chair or operating table (as the case may be), and each can thus understand and appreciate all that is shown him. For the purpose of still more definite instruction, the whole class is called up in successive small sections to examine special cases and conditions, the students being questioned later on the knowledge so obtained. There is a daily clinic at the Dispensary, in each case occupying the entire afternoon, distributed through the week as follows: Monday, Dr. Buckmaster, Medical. Tuesday, Dr. Nelson, Surgical. Wednesday, Dr. Buckmaster, Medical. Thursday, Dr. Magruder, Physical Diagnosis. Friday, Dr. Hedges, Ophthalmic. Saturday, Dr. Randolph, Genito-urinary. During the past year nearly three thousand distinct cases were treated before the students at the clinical lectures. Of these, about six hundred each were medical, surgical, or eye and ear cases, some five hundred were gynecological cases, and over four hundred were cases of genito-urinary diseases. In addition to the work at the Dispensary, the class have seen in sections numerous important surgical operations outside under the care of the clinical teachers, and a large number of the class have been in a similar manner brought into intimate contact with cases of serious illness of various kinds. In obstetrical work, about fifty per cent. of the class have been able to see at least one case each, while some members have had as many as eight or nine cases; it is believed that more systematic arrangements can now be made, and that in the future each member of the class can have one or more cases during the session. Regular attendance upon the daily clinics is required in the last year of the course. There are appointed each year from among the best students of the senior class in medicine a limited number of young men to serve as clinical assistants at the Dispensary. While there is no pecuniary emolument connected with these positions, they afford exceptional opportunities for the acquisition of valuable practical knowledge. HOSPITAL. Action was taken by the Board of Visitors during the last session providing for the erection of a hospital at the University, to be occupied chiefly by charity patients, and to be so conducted as to give the largest amount of clinical experience possible to each member of the upper classes in the Department of Medicine. The services of a competent architect were secured at once, and plans were prepared by him, under the advice of the Medical Faculty, which have since been adopted. These provide for a central administration building, three stories in height, which will contain reception and consultation rooms, offices, accommodations for internes and nurses, kitchen, laundry, etc. Attached to this is a convenient and well-lighted operating-room with an ample amphitheatre. Connected with it on either side are one-story wards which afford space for sixty beds. The plan is such that these can at any time readily be so extended as to double their capacity. The hospital has been located upon the vacant space to the eastward of East Range, sufficiently remote from the rest of the University, yet readily accessible to patients and students alike. While the importance of the undertaking has rendered it necessary, under the existing circumstances, to proceed with deliberation, bids have been received and work begun, and it may be confidently expected that a portion at least of the hospital will be completed and ready for occupancy by patients at the beginning of the coming session. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of students in the Department of Medicine may be estimated at from $305 upward, according to the mode of living, for the first year; the expenses of succeeding years are somewhat less. A fuller statement of expenses may be found in a subsequent section (page 152). SCHEDULE OF DAYS AND HOURS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, 1900-1901. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday.

      <field name="fulltext">Department of Law. WM. MINOR LILE, B. L., Professor of Law. CHARLES A. GRAVES, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Law. RALEIGH C. MINOR, M. A., B. L., Professor of Law. JAMES B. GREEN, B. L., Licentiate in Law. Among the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia, was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since, even during the four years of the civil war. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduation— the degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high positions to which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is confidently believed that the enlarged course now offered will enable those who complete it to more surely maintain that rank at the bar which the alma mater has always expected of her sons. Formerly it was possible for the law student to begin and complete his professional studies in the office of some friendly member of the bar—Blackstone's Commentaries and the code of his State forming the main portion of his curriculum. Then the authorities were few, the leading principles alone were settled, and their application was comparatively simple. In more recent times, so widened is the scope of the law, so complex its principles, so nice and yet so important its distinctions, so numerous and conflicting the authorities, that it is scarcely practicable for even the most diligent student to master the subject, in its multiform phases, without the systematic instruction of skilled teachers. Furthermore, the increased and increasing scope and rigor of the examinations for admission to the bar in the several States, call for a more extensive course of study than was afforded in former days by the law school, and a wider and more intimate knowledge of legal principles than can generally be acquired by private study. These considerations have led to a general conviction among the leaders of professional thought throughout the country, that no student should essay the practice of the law who has not spent at least two years in close and attentive study in a law school. Indeed, the tendency is toward requiring even a longer period of study, as essential either to graduation or to admission to the bar. At the annual meeting of the American Bar Association held in August, 1897, the following resolution on this subject was adopted: "Resolved, That the American Bar Association approves the lengthening of the course of instruction in law schools, to a period of three years, and that it expresses the hope that as soon as practicable, a rule may be adopted in each State which will require candidates for admission to the bar to study law for three years before applying for admission." COURSE OF STUDY. The course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures (on some subjects with the addition of illustrative cases), with careful daily examinations upon both. The daily quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconceptions of legal principles on the part of the student. The course occupies two years. And since future professional success depends upon complete mastery of elementary principles, it is not advisable for the student to devote less time to preparation for practice, even though he be not a candidate for graduation. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough knowledge of the elements of the law, thought as well as reading is requisite; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One can not expect to gorge himself with legal principles and to digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, must accompany the reception of knowledge. ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES. The course of instruction in the Law Department comprises twelve separate classes. Six of these classes constitute the first year's studies, and six the studies of the second year. In the first year's course there are eight lectures, and in the second, nine lectures, weekly. The lectures occupy an hour and a half each. The first year's course therefore calls for twelve hours of class work a week, and the second for thirteen and a half hours. The following table exhibits an outline of the course: First Year. 1. The Law of Persons; Personal Property (including Sales); Wills of Personalty and Administration. 2. The Law of Contracts. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. 4. Mercantile Law: Negotiable Paper; Partnership; Insurance. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Second Year. 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. 8. Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases. 9. The Law of Real Property. 10. The Law of Corporations. 11. The Law of Evidence. 12. The Conflict of Laws. FIRST YEAR COURSE. 1. Law of Persons; Personal Property; Wills and Administration. Professor Lile. The preliminary lectures in this class are devoted to the nature, sources and evidences of the law; the absolute and relative rights of persons, and their constitutional guaranties; citizenship and naturalization; and subordinate magistrates. This is followed by a thorough drill in the subjects of principal and agent; husband and wife, including their common law property rights, with the modern statutory modifications; parent and child; and guardian and ward. Later, the study of the law of personal property (including the law of sales) is pursued in its various phases, followed by that of wills of personalty, and administration. Under the latter classification are included the execution of wills; the qualification of personal representatives and the settlement of their accounts; the law of legacies and of distribution; and the complete administration of estates.—September 15 to March 1—Three times a week. Text-Books.—1 Minor's Institutes (4th edition). Benjamin's Principles of Sales. The Professor's Printed Notes. (Others to be announced.) 2. The Law of Contracts. Professor Graves. In this class, coming appropriately at the beginning of the Junior year, an effort is made to give a thorough, though elementary, course in the fundamentals of contract law—the formation, operation, and discharge of contracts—with a full discussion of the doctrine of consideration, the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, and the consequences of the various kinds of illegality, whether at common law or by statute. The important subject of Quasi-Contract also receives adequate attention. The text-book on Contracts (Clark, following the analysis of Anson), is accompanied by a volume of Illustrative Cases, and is supplemented by the professor's Printed Notes, explaining obscurities in the text, and calling attention to the recent cases in Virginia and elsewhere.—September 15 to December 23—Three times a week. Text-Books.—Clark on Contracts. Clark's Cases on Contracts. The Professor's Printed Notes. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. Professor Minor. In the study of this subject the student is made familiar with the general principles enforced by the courts in the administration of criminal justice. He is instructed as to the nature and elements of the more important crimes, both common law and statutory. Attention is given rather to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the leading principles than to the less important details, which, with a knowledge of the former, may readily be acquired. The course of instruction further embraces a study of the forms of procedure, the nature, organization and duties of the courts, and grand and petit juries; arrests and bail; indictments, informations, presentments, and the various defenses, by way of plea or otherwise; together with the ordinary incidents of a criminal trial, such as challenges of jurors, motions for a new trial, bills of exceptions, motions in arrest of judgment, and writs of error.—September 15 to December 5—Twice a week. Text-Book.—Synopsis of Criminal Law: Minor. The Professor's Notes. 4. Mercantile Law. Professor Lile. Under this head are grouped the subjects of Negotiable Instruments, Insurance and Partnership. The instruction is made as practical as possible, by frequent use of the various mercantile instruments, as exhibits, in the course of the lectures. In the study of the law of negotiable paper, constant reference is made to the Negotiable Instruments Law, recently enacted in several States, including Virginia, and likely to be adopted generally, throughout the country. In addition to the study of the general principles of the law of insurance, attention is devoted to particular clauses most usual in life, marine and accident policies, and the New York Standard fire policy is studied, clause by clause, in the light of judicial construction.—March 1 to May 20—Three times a week. Text-Books.—Bigelow on Bills and Notes (Student's Series). Richards on Insurance. Mechem on Partnership. The Negotiable Instruments Law. The Professor's Notes. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. Professor Graves. By a recent change, these subjects have been separated from the Law of Contracts, and now constitute a distinct class, the instruction in which continues, with recitations three times a week, from the beginning of January until the end of the session. The Law of Torts (or Non-Contract Law) is first taken up, and is studied in the order of Professor Bigelow's analysis, viz.: (1) Breach of Duty to Refrain from Fraud or Malice; (2) Breach of Absolute Duty; and (3) Breach of Duty to Refrain from Negligence. In connection with the text-book, a volume of cases is used, which serve to illustrate and impress the abstract principles by concrete examples. On the completion of Torts, the subject of Bailments is entered upon, and after an outline of the doctrines concerning the several kinds of Bailees (including Innkeepers), the Law of Carriers (of goods and of passengers) is begun, and is considered with the fulness and thoroughness due to this important topic. No case-book is used, as the text and notes of Hutchinson's excellent work on Carriers furnish abundant illustrations.—From January 2 to June 2—Three times a week. Text-Books.—Bigelow on Torts (6th ed.). Chase's Cases on Torts. Hutchinson on Carriers (2d ed.). The Professor's Printed Notes. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Professor Minor. The first lectures of this course will be devoted to the Theory and Practice of Government. It is traced from its generally accepted origin—the family—through its various stages to the modern forms, and effort is made by reasoning and comparison to point out the benefits of good government, the dangers of the bad. This is followed by Constitutional Law, in the study of which close attention is given to the judicial interpretation of the Federal Constitution, and to the great constitutional principles prevailing throughout the Union. As occasion demands, attention is called to the policy of various acts of legislation, and the student is warned against such as tend to exceed the limits of safe and constitutional restrictions. The checks and balances of the constitution are pointed out, and by comparing it with other constitutions, notably that of England, its weak as well as strong points are developed. Especial attention is given to such important subjects as ex post facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contracts, due process of law, trial by jury, power of taxation and of eminent domain, the police power, inter-state commerce, etc. In the lectures upon Public International Law are considered the various rules which regulate the intercourse of one nation with another—such as the principles governing the origin, recognition and equality of states; their rights in time of peace, and the means whereby they peaceably procure the enjoyment of those rights; the laws of war, and the rights and duties of belligerents, and the rules regulating the relations of neutral and belligerent states.—December 5 to April 25—Twice a week. Text-Books.—Principles of Constitutional Law: Cooley. International Law: Davis. The Professor's Notes. SECOND YEAR COURSE. 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. Professor Lile. After consideration of the origin and rise of the chancery jurisdiction, the student is led carefully through the usual subjects of equitable cognizance, and thence into the methods of procedure, as recognized in the High Court of Chancery in England, and as modified by statute or by rules of courts in America. The contrast between legal and equitable principles and procedure is constantly adverted to, and the student is incited to the appreciation and cultivation of the fine sense of moral right underlying the doctrines of technical equity. The procedure in the Federal courts of chancery and in the chancery courts of Virginia (where the distinction between legal and equitable procedure is still maintained) is made the basis of instruction. Practical work is required in draughting the various forms and pleadings, from the subpœna to the final decree. In the law of Bankruptcy, sufficient instruction is given to afford to the student a fair working knowledge of its general principles, and effort is made to secure as great a familiarity as possible with the specific provisions of the National Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and the prescribed rules of procedure thereunder.—September 15 to February 1— Three times a week. Text-Books.—Bispham's Principles of Equity. Text-books on Equity Practice and Bankruptcy (to be announced). The Professor's Notes. 8. Pleading and Practice. Professor Graves. In this class the subjects are Pleading and Practice at common law, and under the Virginia Statutes; Code Pleading; and Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure. These are all confined to civil cases at law; criminal procedure and equity jurisdiction and procedure being taught elsewhere in the course. An outline of the instruction in this class may be given as follows: (1) The principles and rules of pleading, at common law and under the codes; an intimate acquaintance with the common law rules and principles being insisted upon as essential to a proper knowledge of pleading under any system. (2) The organization and jurisdiction of the Virginia courts, and the proceedings in a lawsuit from beginning to end, including appellate proceedings; and the law of attachments, executions, homestead exemptions, etc. (3) The organization and jurisdiction of the Federal courts, removal of causes from State to Federal courts; the conformity or nonconformity of the procedure at law in the Federal courts with that in the courts of the State wherein they are held; and appellate proceedings in the Federal courts.—September 15 to March 9—Three times a week. Text-Books.—4 Minor's Institutes (3d edition). Bryant's Code Pleading. Dabney's Federal Jurisdiction and Law Procedure. The Professor's Printed Notes. 9. The Law of Real Property. Professor Minor. The instruction in this class covers a detailed and careful study of the subject of Real Property Law, in all its branches. The nature and several kinds of real estate, and the various interests therein, with the principles appertaining to each, curtesy and dower, the relations of landlord and tenant, co-tenancies, the feudal tenures and principles, uses and trusts, the far-reaching effects of the Statute of Uses, the conditions, covenants and other qualifications attached to conveyances of land, are reviewed at length. The historical connection between ancient and modern doctrines of conveyancing, with the statutory changes, are carefully traced. Remainders, reversions, and executory limitations, and the principles governing their creation, validity, and effect, together with the sources of title to lands, whether by descent or by the manifold forms of purchase, and the principles controlling each, the subjects of conveyances, contracts to convey, wills of lands, adverse possession, the registry of instruments of title, and the principles regulating the acquisition and validity of tax-titles, are investigated in detail. Throughout this course, emphasis is placed on common law principles, and effort is made to give the student a clear comprehension of these, by tracing them to their feudal or other sources, and by following them into the modern forms they have assumed under the guiding hand of the courts and of the legislature.—September 15 to March 25— Three times a week. Text-Books.—2 Minor's Institutes (4th edition). Tax Titles: Minor. The Professor's Notes. 10. The Law of Corporations. Professor Lile. In view of the recent development of the law of corporations, both in extent and importance, increasing attention is devoted to this branch of the curriculum. Among other subjects of lesser import, the lectures embrace the promotion, organization and management of business corporations; the formation and enforcement of subscriptions for shares; corporate duties, powers and liabilities; the relations between the corporation and the State, between the corporate body and its shareholders, officers, agents and creditors, and the reciprocal relations of these with one another; the consolidation, dissolution, and winding up of corporations; and the appointment, duties and powers of receivers. The principles applicable to municipal corporations, whether in their public or their proprietary characters, are fully elucidated; the subjects of municipal taxation, municipal bonds, franchises, rights and liabilities in connection with streets, as affecting the municipality, the public generally and the abutting proprietors, are dealt with in detail.—February 1 to June 1—Three times a week. Text-Book.—Taylor on Corporations. The Professor's Notes. 11. The Law of Evidence. Professor Graves. The principles of this difficult subject are sought to be elucidated by the aid of the latest and most philosophical expositions of evidence, notably those of Professor James B. Thayer, of Harvard University, to whose recent work, "A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law," constant reference is made. The text-book used— Volume I of "Greenleaf,"—is edited by Professor Wigmore, and in it have been incorporated the results of the historical research and scientific analysis of Professor Thayer and others. But while great attention is paid to the rationale of the law of evidence, as indispensable to a mastery of its principles, the practical character of the rules of evidence is not overlooked, and an earnest effort is made, by careful consideration of the statutes and decisions, to give the student such a working knowledge of the subject as will enable him to apply its principles in the course of judicial investigations.—From March 9 to May 25—Three times a week. Text-Books.—Greenleaf on Evidence (16th ed.), by Professor Wigmore. The Professor's Printed Notes. 12. The Conflict of Laws. Professor Minor. As the facility of commerce and intercourse between the various states and countries of the world increases, this subject becomes of graver importance, though as yet it has received rather scanty recognition at the hands of text-writers and law-schools. The course includes a discussion of the nature and various kinds of domicil; the law governing status, and the conveyance of personal property abroad; the execution, construction and effect of foreign wills, successions and administrations; foreign marriages and divorces; and transactions relating to real estate; the execution, interpretation and validity of foreign contracts; the law governing the effect of foreign judgments in rem or in personam; the recovery of damages for foreign torts; the application of the lex fori; and the modes of proving foreign laws.—March 25 to May 10—Three times a week. Text-Book.—Conflict of Laws: Minor. The Professor's Notes. LAW DEBATING SOCIETY. This Society, which bears the honored name of John B. Minor, has been organized by the students in the First Year's course, for the discussion of legal questions. Its meetings begin at the opening and continue to the end of the session, with such interruptions only as are incident to the proximity of the examinations. Attendance is entirely voluntary, as presence during the debates is intended to be a privilege and not a burden. The questions are chosen by the Law Faculty, one or more of whom preside over the discussions. Four students are appointed for each debate, two on each side; and after a decision by a bench of judges, consisting of five students, called the Supreme Court, an appeal is taken to the whole body of students, constituting the Court of Appeals. The members of the Faculty present then express their opinions, and endeavor to throw light on the subject which has been under consideration. Students in the Second Year's course are honorary members of the Debating Society, and are entitled to speak on voluntary debate, and to vote as members of the Court of Appeals. MOOT COURT. The Moot Court, which is presided over by the Law Faculty, is organized October 1st, two weeks after the beginning of the course in Pleading and Practice. Its sessions are held weekly, throughout the Senior year. Attendance is obligatory on all members of the class in Pleading and Practice, and on all candidates for graduation. The object of the Moot Court is to afford to the student practical facility in the procedure which he will be called on to apply at the bar, and to familiarize him with the whole proceedings in actions at law, suits in equity and in criminal cases. In addition to this, when important questions, whether of practice or of substantive law, are developed by the pleadings, oral argument of such questions is required, with or without written briefs as may seem best. Interest and life are added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whose diffidence prompts them to silence. The Moot Court is also utilized in connection with the course on Real Property, as a school of conveyancing; the student being required to prepare contracts, deeds, wills, powers of attorney, etc., to construe written instruments of all kinds, to examine and pass upon titles; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of practising counsel. PRIZES. Through the liberality of several of the leading law publishers, the department is able to offer a number of valuable prizes for excellence in the work of the Moot Court. During the session of 1898-99 the following prizes were awarded: 1. The WEST PUBLISHING COMPANY Prize—American Annual Digest, 10 volumes—To I. J. Hofmayer, A. B., B. L., of Albany, Ga. 2.

The Law Library is accommodated by its own library room, separate from the general University library, and is located with special reference to the convenience of the law students. While the student is not encouraged to venture for himself into either cases or textbooks, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, he is incited to familiarize himself not only with the leading cases to which his attention is called, but especially with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To the latter subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are specially devoted. The student is taught that books are the working tools of the lawyer, and that facility in handling them, in the office and in the court-room, is an indispensable professional acquirement. He is instructed how to consult authorities, and to run down cases; to distinguish doctrine from dicta; to analyze, criticise and compare cases; to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar.

The degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon such students as have attended two full sessions (of nine months each) of the law school, and who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing all written examinations, and who have satisfactorily performed the Moot Court and other assigned work. Any one of the classes of the first or second year may be completed separately. Upon the satisfactory completion of any class, a certificate is issued to the student, followed by the diploma of graduation when (and not until) all the examinations have been successfully passed. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations, as shall be prescribed. After the session of 1900-01, the privilege of standing special fall examinations, heretofore extended to students who have fallen slightly below the required standard, will be withdrawn. MISCELLANEOUS. Admission to Advanced Standing.—For several years past, students from other approved law schools have been privileged to apply for advanced standing, upon passing a satisfactory entrance examination. The experiment having proved unsatisfactory, hereafter no credit will be given for attendance at another law school or for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend both the Junior and Senior year in residence here. Entrance Examinations.—No entrance examinations are held. Special Students.—Students who can attend but a single session are advised to take special courses, which the arrangement of the classes readily permits. Overzealousness, by which an ambitious student is beguiled into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a single year, leads to cramming and inaccuracy, and often to complete failure. With this admonition, the special student is free to select his own work. The following course is suggested for students who are not candidates for the degree: First year classes 1, 3 and 4 (see page 138), and second year classes 8, 9 and 11; or, if the student has already had some legal training, numbers 7 and 10 of the second year may be added. The first course suggested would require 13½ hours, and the second 18 hours, of class-work a week. Late Entrance.—The work of the Law Department begins promptly September 15, and continues until the middle of June. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress, though the matriculation books are open throughout the session and it is permissible to enter at any time. The course of study is arranged, however, with a view to its being taken up at the beginning of the session. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the course has advanced at the time of his entrance, and any material loss of time by late entrance will disqualify him for graduation the next year. Seats in the Law Lecture-rooms are assigned in the order of matriculation. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at from $320 upwards, according to the mode of living, for each session. A fuller statement regarding expenses may be found on page 152. SCHEDULE OF LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. 1900-01. LAW DEPARTMENT. (Subject to change as circumstances may require.) LECTURES. Monday.

      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES. A student's expenses consist of the following: (1) University charges which are the same for all students; (2) School Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; (3) Cost of living, board, etc. 1. Under the first head are included the University fee, $40, and the contingent deposit, $10. The University Fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the members of the Medical Faculty in case of illness, including, if needed, care and nursing in a well-equipped infirmary maintained on the University grounds for students only. It also covers all examination and diploma fees. The Contingent Deposit is liable for any damage to the University property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library or other University rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is, therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. 2. Under the second head, is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper, and in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials for laboratory work. In the Academic Department the tuition fee for one school is $50; for two, $30 each; for three or more, $25 each; except that in Analytical Chemistry the charge for tuition and materials for one course is $50 and for apparatus about $10, and for both courses pursued the same year for tuition and materials, $100, and for apparatus, about $15; the charges for a graduate course in Chemistry are, tuition $50, materials about $10, apparatus about $10; the fee for Agricultural Chemistry is $15, but this course is free to students in the Schools of Chemistry, to Virginia students and to unmatriculated farmers; and in Comparative Anatomy there is a laboratory fee for materials of $10 in the B. A. course and $20 in the M. A. course. The tuition fees in the Academic Department are remitted to Virginia students, to public school teachers of the State, and to ministers of the gospel, under conditions which are stated at length at the close of this section. In the Department of Engineering the fee for Applied Mathematics is $50; for other subjects, the same as in the Academic Department. In the Department of Agriculture the fees are the same as in the Academic Department. In the Department of Medicine the fee for the first year is $110; second year, $100; third year, $80; fourth year, $60. The special fees for single subjects are, Medical Chemistry, $30; Biology (including materials), $35; Anatomy (including materials), $45; Regional Anatomy (including materials), $10; General Pathology, $25; Pathogenic Bacteriology and Surgical Diseases, $35; Physiology, $30; Materia Medica, $20; Therapeutics, $10; Embryology, $10; Obstetrics (with manikin work), $20; Gynecology, $20; Surgery, $20; Practice of Medicine, $30; Special Pathology and Clinical Diagnosis, $10; Dermatology and Diseases of the Eye and Ear, $15; Hygiene, $10; Medical Jurisprudence, $10; Clinics (collectively), $30. In the Department of Law the fee for each regular year's course, or for any six classes, is $100; more than six classes (combining first and second year's courses), $115; five classes, $85; four classes, $75; three classes, $60; two classes, $45; one class, $25. 3. Under the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take his meals with a Mess Club, or in a University Hotel, or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding-house, in which case he pays no room-rent nor servant's hire to the University. The price of University rooms ranges according to their desirability, from $25 to $40 for the session: the large majority rent for $30; but there are a few single rooms at $25, and a few whose price is above that of the majority. If two students occupy one room each pays half the rent; the University charge for service is $9 per session for each student, whether there be one or two in a room. The minimum cost of furnishing a room may be placed at $20; fuel and lights combined cost about $25 for the session, and washing from $1.50 upward per month. With strict economy the cost of board, fuel, lights, service, and laundry can be brought within $18 a month as an average for the session. Rooms and board may be had in private families or boarding-houses at varying prices, but good accommodations can not be obtained at a cost materially below the estimate just given. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire two years course, it amounts to about $90. But in this Department, as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. The following table will enable the prospective student to form an approximate estimate of the cost of a year at the University. It of course makes no account of clothing and other personal expenses, or of the cost of travel. The contingent fee is omitted, as not necessarily involving expenditure. Univ. Fee. Tuition. Books, etc. Living. Total. Academic: $40 * * The remission of the tuition fee to Virginia students would reduce the estimated total by that amount (i. e., $190 as a probable minimum). $ 75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 *$265 to $400 (for three schools) Engineering: $40 $100 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $290 to $425 Agriculture: $40 $ 75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $265 to $400 Medicine: $40 $88 $20 $135 to $270 $283 to $423 (average) Law: $40 $100 $45 $135 to $270 $320 to $455 University fees, the contingent deposits, rents of rooms in the University buildings, and the service for the same, are payable upon entrance. Tuition fees are payable, one-half on entrance, and the remainder the first week in January. Students from Virginia.—In compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, sec. 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction without charge for tuition in all the Schools of the Academic Department (excepting the laboratory courses in Chemistry), subject to the conditions stated below. Such students are required to pay the University fee and make the usual Contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in courses of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the University grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $60 to $100 according to the number of Schools elected. The Faculty are required by the law mentioned above to satisfy themselves in the case of each applicant, either by actual examinations or by a diploma or certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission in accordance with the terms of this law are required as follows. The examinations are held at the beginning of the session; due announcement is made of the hour and place of each: 1. For admission to the School of Latin, on forms, syntax, and Books i, ii of Caesar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Catiline. 2. For admission to the School of Greek, on forms, syntax, and three Books of Xenophon. 3. For admission to the School of Mathematics, Geometry, Algebra, and Plane Trigonometry. For admission to the other Schools, a good English education is alone required. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student it is necessary that the applicant's parents be bona fide residents of the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority it is necessary that he be a bona fide resident. A resident of the State is one who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intentions of removing therefrom in the future. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Privileged Students.—Ministers of the gospel may attend any of the Literary or Scientific Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. White Male Teachers and superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Department of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching Spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission are required to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarships and Fellowships. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. At their meeting on December 10th, 1897, the following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the University were adopted by the Board of Visitors: A. For every five academic students in any one session sent to the University by any private school from its pupils of the preceding session, said school shall be entitled to a scholarship the next session in the Academic department of the University, eligible to white male students, said scholarship exempting the recipient, if he be a Virginian, from the payment of the matriculation fee, and if he be from any other State, from the payment of tuition fees, but in neither case exempting him from payment of fees for laboratory courses in Chemistry. These scholarships shall be awarded under the following conditions: 1. The recipient must be selected from the pupils of the session preceding that in which they are to enter upon the scholarship. 2. Candidates shall stand examinations on Latin, Mathematics, and the English Language. In Latin and Mathematics the examinations will be on a course equivalent to that of Course A in the University, and in English on a course that shall insure adequate preparation for the B. A. course. The examination questions shall be sent from the University to the head-masters of the schools, who will hold the examinations on certain specified days about the middle of May, and will send the papers to the Secretary of the Faculty, signed with a pledge, the head-master in addition certifying that to the best of his knowledge, the candidates received no assistance in the examinations. The papers will then be read by the professors of the respective subjects, and such of them as reach the standard required by the University will be sent back, with numerical percentage marks attached, to the head-masters, who will then select one of the pupils thus passing the examination to receive the scholarship, but if none of the papers attain the University standard, no scholarship shall be awarded. B. The same privileges under the same conditions and limitations shall be extended to the public schools of the whole country. C. The University offers to the public schools of Virginia six academic scholarships, two of which are to be filled annually (except when the occurrence of vacancies leads to a modification), and each is to be held no longer than three years by the incumbent, who shall receive $200 per annum from the University, and shall be exempted from the payment of the matriculation fee. Any scholar holding a scholarship under this provision who does not pass in at least one of his classes for the whole of any year shall forfeit his scholarship thereby. In case of a vacancy occurring during the term of any incumbent at the beginning of the session, it shall be filled by the appointment, for the unexpired term, of the person receiving the next eligible mark, at the preceding examination, to those regularly appointed at that time. Should a vacancy occur during the session, it shall be filled for the remainder of the term, if any, in a similar manner, from the candidates at the following May examination. Each public school shall be allowed to name three, or less, of its white male graduates of the current session or candidates for graduation (who shall not be eligible unless they graduate that session) as candidates for scholarships, and these shall stand examinations in Latin, Mathematics, and English, under the same regulations as stated above. The University professors shall read and value the papers, and the scholarships shall be awarded to the candidates who receive the highest marks, provided these marks reach the University standard, and provided that not more than one candidate from any one school shall receive a scholarship the same year. Each successful candidate must enter upon his University course at the beginning of the session following his last session at the public schools, and if he voluntarily chooses not to avail himself of the privileges of his scholarship before his three years expire, he can not be reinstated. The subjects assigned for the University Scholarship examinations in May, 1898, are as follows: I. Latin: (I) Paradigms; Rules of Gender; Force of Tenses of the Indicative, Subjunctive, and Infinitive; Force of Cases. (II) Translations from Cornelius Nepos, or Cæsar De Bello Gallico, Books I and II; Cicero's I and II Orations against Catiline. (III) Exercises involving the application of the leading principles of Syntax, with questions on the same. For translation two extracts within the limits above given. The student will be expected to know the historical references in extracts given for translation. II. Mathematics: Venable's Geometry; Wells's Plane and Spherical Trigonometry; Charles Smith's Algebra (omitting Interest and Annuities, Continued Fractions, and Probability). III. English Language: The applicant will be examined as to his knowledge of English Grammar, the elements of Composition, the principles of Rhetoric, and, in general, as to his ability to express his thoughts in writing. In the latter test great weight will be given to spelling, punctuation, legibility of handwriting, neatness of form, etc. In preparation for this examination, the following books are suggested: Baskervill and Sewell's English Grammar; Emerson's History of the English Language; Genung's Outlines of Rhetoric. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. These Scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. The incumbents shall be appointed by the local Alumni Associations now organized throughout the country and appearing in this catalogue; and by such other local Associations as may hereafter be organized, and who, by consent of the Board of Visitors of the University, become entitled to the privilege. Provided that no association shall be entitled to make such appointment, except upon the terms and conditions hereafter mentioned. 3. No incumbent shall hold such scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the University in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These scholarships shall be confined to those classes in the Academic Departments of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the course in Analytical Chemistry). The scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition and matriculation fees. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the Association making the appointment, be able to attend the University. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the University. 7. These provisions shall be applicable only to such associations as are already organized and appear in this catalogue; and to such of these only as may have twenty or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. See page 173. But any local Association hereafter organized, having twenty or more such active members, may apply to the Board of Visitors, and upon obtaining the consent of the Board, shall be listed among those entitled to fill the Scholarships hereby created. 8. Every local Alumni Association, as above described, having twenty or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University; if hereafter such Association ceases to have as many as twenty active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 9. Every such local Association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, as long as they shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as they shall have reached that number. 10. But no Association shall be entitled to make such appointment for any session, except such as, through their Secretaries, shall have mailed to the General Secretary of the Alumni (at the University), on or before the first day of May preceding the session for which the application is to be made, a complete list of the active members of such Association, with their correct post-office addresses at that time, and the names of the officers of such Association. 11. By "active" members as herein used, is meant Alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the Association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No Alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one Association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an Alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one Association, at the same time. But graduation in any Department or School of the University is not hereby required. 12. Only one Association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the Scholarships hereby created. 13. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole Association, a majority of the active members voting of record for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the Association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the Association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the Association. 14. A copy of the minutes of the meeting, which shall include the final result of the vote of the Association, the candidates who are voted for, with their post-office addresses, and the name of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance with the conditions contained in Sections 5, 6, 10 and 13, must be certified to the Chairman of the Faculty of the University of Virginia, attested by the signatures of the presiding officer and the secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the Chairman of the Faculty on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed, and the Chairman of the Faculty is hereby authorized to print forms of such certificate, which may be sent to the officers of any Association desiring the same. 15. The above requirements having been complied with, the person or persons so appointed shall be entitled to attend the University for one session without payment of any matriculation or tuition fees, and shall enjoy the same privileges and be subject to the same restrictions as other academic students. 16. To guard against any possible ill-feeling or sense of injustice on the part of the local Associations in respect to the construction of these provisions, all such matters shall be referred to the Executive Committee of the General Society of the Alumni, the decision of which, when approved by the Faculty, shall be final. SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. One of the Miller Scholarships is awarded, on the recommendation of the Faculty, at the close of the session, to the candidate who passes, with the highest aggregate of marks, in Physics, Chemistry, and Botany. The tenure is for two years, and the emolument is $250 a year with free tuition in the Scientific Schools. Other conditions are stated in connection with the Department of Agriculture. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. Leander J. McCormick. The emoluments are free tuition and matriculation. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by the founder. The Isaac Carey Scholarships are awarded by the Carey Trustees. The Birely Scholarship, founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Md., is awarded by the Visitors to some student from the State of Maryland. The John Y. Mason Fellowship, founded upon the gift of Archer Anderson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., is awarded by the Visitors to some competent and deserving graduate student. The Vanderbilt Fellowships are supported out of the working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory. They are assigned to advanced students who take Astronomy as their major subject and occupy a portion of their time in work connected with the Observatory. They are appointed upon the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory, to whom applications for further information should be made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Regulations. 1. Admission.—The age of the student must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended, or other evidence of general good conduct, is required. The student must matriculate in at least three academic schools, or their equivalent, except by special order of the Faculty. 2. Dormitory.—The occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Proctor before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Proctor on or before September 1, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sub-let or used for other than its proper purpose. 3. Boarding.—Students may board and lodge either in the University precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the Chairman to withdraw the license from any house, in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Chairman's office. 4. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, can not be made except by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same school with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. 5. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Chairman, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. 6. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses should be rendered at the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lecture render the student liable to be disciplined by the Faculty. 7. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by the physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. In such cases a special examination will be granted, but in no other. 8. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Chairman. When a permit is granted upon the physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. 9. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault, which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. 10. Conduct.—Drunkenness, gambling and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the chairman is instructed to dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them. Profane swearing, habits of expense, visiting bar-rooms or gaming tables, the use or possession of fire-arms or other deadly weapons, the unauthorized contraction of debts, and the use by the student in his lodgings or in the University precincts of intoxicating drinks, except on prescription of the University physician, are also violations of University law, and punishable by admonition or suspension. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. 11. Prohibition of Credit.—An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. 12. Athletic Teams and Musical Clubs.—The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical Culture (page 164). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of musical clubs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Physical Culture. WILLIAM A. LAMBETH, M. D., Director of the Gymnasium. The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficacy; for, however valuable any system may be, it can not be maintained in its entirety without a consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical condition and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encouraged in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury or inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the University are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnastics—marching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. The Faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the University athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by making the following strength tests, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1100 points. The points are reckoned as follows. The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletic Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room and the various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the baths—needle, shower, spray, tubs and plunge— supplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The Gymnasium is open from 7 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other University duties. The campus adjacent to the Gymnasium, and the Athletic field on the southern side of the grounds, furnish ample playground for football, baseball, tennis, and track athletics. The former contains a well-drained and ballasted running track, four laps to the mile; on the latter, which is enclosed, the exhibition games of football and baseball are held. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercise only a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or unwise excess in physical exercises, while giving to the student as far as possible entire liberty of management.

      <field name="fulltext">Religious Worship. J. M. Brodnax, University Pastor. I.—YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. Object.—The Young Men's Christian Association, founded in 1858, is the largest student organization in the University. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.—The distinctive work of the Association consists in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night from 7:30 to 8:15, in conducting, through some of its most active members, several Sunday Schools in the University and vicinity; in arranging various Bible Study Classes, and in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters. The English Bible.—The Young Men's Christian Association offers the following courses in Bible Study, open to all students: Lecture-Studies of the life of Jesus of Nazareth.—Noah K. Davis, Professor of Moral Philosophy. The Acts and Epistles and the Prophets of Israel.—Charles A. Young, Assistant Instructor in Hebrew. Historical Study of the Life of Christ.—J. M. Brodnax, University Pastor. In harmony with the International Committee of the Y. M. C. A. on Bible Study, the Association will offer hereafter the following progressive courses of study: First Year Course.—The Historical Study of the Life of Christ. Second Year Course.—The Records and Letters of the Apostolic Age. Third Year Course.—Old Testament Characters. Under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. and on the basis of the University Bible Lectureship Fund, being raised by Mr. Charles A. Young, the following courses of lectures will be given during the current year: Bible Characters.—Rev. A. Coke Smith, D. D., Norfolk, Va. Some Old Testament Prophets.—Rev. W. W. Moore, D. D., Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Va. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.—The Campus, situated just outside the University grounds, and adjoining the handsome Fayerweather Gymnasium, is fitted up for tennis, baseball and football, has a graded and ballasted running track, and is now opened to the free use of all students. Y. M. C. A. Hall.—The northwest wing of the Rotunda, assigned by the Faculty to the Association for its exclusive use, consists of a spacious and conveniently situated assembly-room, with two offices adjoining. This hall has been handsomely furnished with carpet and opera chairs, and is now being used for its various purposes in Christian work. Membership.—The membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate members; any member of an evangelical church, who is in good standing, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member upon payment of the annual dues. Indorsement.—The Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the University. II.—CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the University consist of a daily prayer service of fifteen minutes, just before the supper hour; and the regular preaching services in the Chapel on Sunday morning and evening. The daily prayer services are conducted by the University Pastor and members of the Faculty. The Sunday services are conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent States. All the details of this plan are entrusted to a committee on Religious Exercises composed of three members of the Faculty and three students selected from the officers of the Young Men's Christian Association. The general oversight of the Christian work is entrusted to the University Pastor. The list of the University preachers for the current session may be found on page 8.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Student's Literary Societies. There are two Literary Societies of long standing—the Jefferson Society and the Washington Society—connected with the University. They hold weekly meetings in their respective halls and give public exhibitions at intervals during the session and at its close. There is an annual contest during the session between the two societies for the Harrison Trophy. The society winning this trophy retains it until it is recaptured by the other society. Each society offers several medals; the one for the best orator is presented by the society, but the medal for the best debater in each society is presented by the Rector and Visitors and is known as the Rector and Visitors' Debating Medal. The two societies jointly maintain the University Magazine. For excellence in composition in this Magazine several prizes are given. First, a medal is awarded for the best contribution to the University Magazine by a member of either society. Second, a prize of twenty dollars in gold for the best original poem published in the Magazine during the session 1899-1900. This prize, offered by Professor James A. Harrison, will be continued if the results are favorable. Third, a twenty dollar gold double-eagle is offered for the best translation in prose or verse from any of the languages taught at this University. This is open to all matriculates of the University, provided the translation appears in the Magazine. This prize, also given by Professor Harrison, is offered for a period of five years beginning with the session 1895-96. At the close of each session the Societies invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them. MEDALISTS. 1898-99. Jefferson Society, Orator George P. Bagby, Richmond, Va.

      <field name="fulltext">Society of the Alumni. Alumni Hall.—One of the University Buildings (on East Range) has been recently set aside by action of the Board and fitted up for the accommodation of visiting Alumni. Here they will find comfortable lodging and sitting-rooms as well as some one ready to show them around the University and introduce them to professors and students. This is a temporary provision for the accommodation of the Alumni until the necessary funds can be collected for the erection of a permanent Alumni Hall, subscriptions for which are now being taken. It is hoped that this will form headquarters for those of the Alumni who from time to time visit the alma mater. Some of the Alumni have already taken advantage of it.
