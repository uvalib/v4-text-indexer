ANNOUNCEMENTS The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional or life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School each year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. In addition to courses for high school teachers, the demand for courses for primary and grammar grade teachers is fully met. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June 71.4 July, 76.8. Summer rates are given by the railroads to this point. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, and the large new Education Building with laboratories for Manual Arts and Domestic Arts. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopedias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, and a brief prayer and song service. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used when held in the chapel is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. When the weather permits the service is held out of doors on the north steps of the Rotunda. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director. No fee will be charged for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with baseball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. A party will be organized for the Panama Exposition to leave about August 6. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Coburn Players will present three plays: The Yellow Jacket, an Imaginary Sick Man, and Macbeth. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give three plays: She Stoops to Conquer, As You Like It, and a Modern Drama. The Ernest Gamble Concert Party will give one recital; Jennie Dufau, one recital; and negotiations are pending for a number of other high class attractions. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Besides there will be moving pictures regularly in Peabody Hall. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 5 and 10 will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and the rural church in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of country ministers and laymen, and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates which have been granted by the Southern Passenger Association on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 cents for the round trip. Tickets will be on sale June 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28, with privilege of extension of final limit to September 30. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. Announcements of dates will be made later by the Department of Public Instruction. Application has been made to have them correspond with the above. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 21st to July 1st, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. A committee of ladies from the Y. W. C. A. will assist in welcoming teachers attending for the first time. Teachers arriving at Charlottesville from points on the C. and O. are advised to have their baggage checked to Union Station, Charlottesville. This will save a great deal of time in having trunks delivered to destination. Teachers are advised to hand their baggage checks to the committee. If handed to others a receipt should be taken. Teachers arriving before 6 a. m. and later than 10:30 p. m. will be met, provided they notify the Director. Only trains from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. are met, unless notified to the contrary. A YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION CLUB, open to every woman in the Summer School, is organized for the purpose of promoting a pleasant social atmosphere, giving an opportunity for social service and religious development, and for the study of methods in club work and church work. The activities include "stunt parties," camp breakfasts, Camp Fire Girls demonstrations, weekly meetings on religious and social questions and special lectures on rural life questions. A secretary devotes her entire time to the work and has charge of the club headquarters at Madison Hall. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the University and of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. Four monthly issues, beginning with February, will be printed and circulated in addition to the twelve regular numbers. The subscription price for the whole sixteen issues is the moderate sum of twenty-five cents. Subscriptions should be sent to the Business Manager, Summer School News, University, Virginia. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single rooms and one hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 21st. Each room is lighted by electricity, has stationary wash stand and running water and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Double rooms will be furnished with two single beds complete, unless a double bed is especially desired; one chiffonier, except where there are more than two in room; one rocking chair or one morris chair and two single chairs. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $4.00 a week, $16.50 a month or $25.00 for the session of forty-six days. The University Commons will be managed this year by Mr. Charles Jaimes, a caterer and restaurateur of wide experience. A Restaurant a la Carte and lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 73. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of twelve dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.00 for a four weeks' term and $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and these fees will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the committee. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Wednesday, June 23, at 8:30 a. m. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday except possibly on Saturday, June 26th, when classes will meet at the usual hours. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Tuesday, August 3rd, Wednesday and Thursday, August 4th and 5th, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to six buildingsâPeabody Hall, Cabell Hall, Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory, Rotunda, and the Law Building. REGISTRATION.âTuesday, June 22nd, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 23rd will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall will be open continuously June 22nd, 23rd, and 24th from 8:30 a. m. until 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 30th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, must enter twenty days prior to July 21st. Promptly at 9:30 Tuesday morning, June 22nd, all applicants for registration will assemble in the auditorium of Peabody Hall for instructions in regard to filling out their cards, the location of lecture rooms, and for consultation with members of the faculty in regard to the courses of study they desire to pursue, or any other matters upon which information is desired. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit students to any course not mentioned on their registration card, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. IMPORTANT NOTE.âEvery teacher who is applying for a Virginia State Teachers' Summer School Professional Certificate of any kind should bring with her and before registering have whatever certificate she holds and which she desires to use as a basis of entrance on such professional work, approved by a representative of the Department of Public Instruction who will be present for that purpose. NON-VIRGINIA TEACHERS.âThe regulations in regard to teachers' certificates and the requirements for entrance to certain courses in the Summer School do not apply to teachers from other states than Virginia unless they desire to apply for a Virginia teachers' certificate. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his boarding place or the number and location of his room in the University. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. At the close of each session every teacher who expects to apply for a Virginia Summer School Professional Certificate should fill out and file with the Director one of the application blanks (Form S. S. 7-10) furnished by the Department of Public Instruction. When all of the courses required for any certificate are completed, the Department will issue the certificate and mail it to the applicant direct. In no case should the certificates given by the Summer School be sent to the Department. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations.

BIOLOGY The courses in biology have been organized with two ends in view: First, to give teachers adequate training to carry courses in botany, zoÃ¶logy and biology in their public school work and to give them instruction that will supplement their work in physiology, hygiene and agriculture. Second, to enable premedical students to fulfill the medical entrance requirements as prescribed by the American Medical Association in June, 1913. It is to be noted here all premedical students are required to take course 3 with their course in either Botany or ZoÃ¶logy. 1. Botany.âThis course is outlined primarily to give the student a knowledge of how plants live, grow and propagate themselves, and of their structure. An introduction to the systematic study and naming of ferns and flowering plants will be included in this course. The teacher completing this work will be prepared to place an introductory course of botany in his or her high school curriculum. This work will also supplement, in a helpful manner, his or her work in drawing, geography and physiology. No text-book required. Laboratory fee for teachers $1.00, for premedical students and for those seeking University credit $10.00, which fee includes the registration fee.

Experimental Biology.âThis course consists of a series of laboratory experiments, on plants and animals, supplemented with a limited number of explanatory lectures. Its object, on one hand, is to give teachers of both Botany and ZoÃ¶logy a series of experiments that they can use as demonstrations in their class work. On the other hand it supplements the premedical students' work in either Botany or ZoÃ¶logy by giving them some idea of experimental Biology. No text-book or laboratory fee required. Daily, 11:30 to 12:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional Certificate Advanced GradeâBiology, 1, 2, and 3; Summer School Professional CertificateâCollege GradeâBiology 1, 2, and 3. University Credit.âStudents who complete the work of courses 1 and 3 will be given credit for one term's work in Botany B1. Those who complete the work in courses 2 and 3 will be given credit for one term's work in ZoÃ¶logy. Fee.âStudents not registered in either Biology 1 or 2 will be charged a registration fee of $5. FIELD BOTANY The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The hours for daily exercises will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth.

ENGLISH The courses in English are designed to meet the needs of the following groups of students; present or prospective high school teachers; professional or technical students who have entered upon their professional courses and found that their training in English is so defective as to interfere with their prospects in their chosen professions; students preparing for college entrance examinations; students conditioned on their entrance examinations or in their college courses at other institutions; college professors and instructors who may be especially interested in methods of teaching English; teachers in elementary schools who are interested in language study for small children. It is desirable that all students of English take advantage of the work in composition, upon which special emphasis will be laid. Private conferences for criticism and personal supervision of theme writing will be arranged for by the instructor. 1. Advanced English Grammar for High School and College Teachers.âThis course is designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transition stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods of teaching it. An attempt will be made to suggest standards of instruction in grammar and composition. Text-Books.âMeiklejohn's English Grammar (D. C. Heath &amp; Co.); Jovne's Notes on the Parts of Speech (R. L. Bryan Co.). Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Wauchope. Law Building, Room 2. 2. Rhetoric and Composition.âThe purpose of this course is three-fold: first, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the text-book, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage among teachers and pupils alike good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. Short themes will frequently be called for and several longer papers required. Weekly personal conferences will be held at hours to be appointed. Text-Books.âEspenshade's Composition and Rhetoric (D. C. Heath); Nutter, Hersey, and Greenough's Specimens of Prose Composition (Ginn &amp; Co.). Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Myers. Law Building, Room 2. 3. English Literature.âThis course may be outlined as follows: (1) A study of the principal periods of English Literature through the life and work of (at least) one of the great writers of each period. (2) Special lectures on the books set for "Study" (English B) in the college entrance requirements, and also on a few of the most important set for "Reading" (English A). (3) A brief course in poetics including the ballad, sonnet, ode, dirge, epic, and romance forms; with the study of illustrative selections. Parallel reading and written reports. In this course the value of oral interpretation of literature will be emphasized, and as much interpretative reading will be done as time will permit. Suggestions for oral work in High School English Literature, and a number of outlines for written work will be given. Text-Books.âManly's English Poetry (Ginn and Co.); Metcalf's (B. F. Johnson and Co.) or any other good history of English Literature; and texts of classics set for study in college entrance requirements. Daily, 10:30 to 11:30. Professor Reade, Law Building, Room 2. 4. American Literature.âThis course is a study of the lives and writings of the principal authors from Washington Irving to Mark Twain. It will consider the various aspects of American life as they have found expression in literature. Special attention will be given to the literature of New England. Text-Books.âMetcalf's American Literature (B. F. Johnson &amp; Co.); Page's Chief American Poets (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.). Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Metcalf. Law Building, Room 1. 5. American Literature.âB. This course will be a survey of the whole field of American literature not by authors but by types. There are eleven of these and the question that we shall try to answer will be: What is the best that our country has done in (1) the epic, (2) the drama, (3) the ballad, (4) the lyric, (5) history, (6) biography, (7) the essay, (8) the oration, (9) the letter, (10) the short story, and (11) the novel? The distinctive contributions of the different sections of the United States will be appraised and the effort made to find out what Americanism in literature means. The opinion of noted foreign critics will be consulted wherever accessible. Text-Books.âA. W. Long's American Poems (American Book Company); G. R. Carpenter's American Prose (The Macmillan Company). Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Smith. Law Building, Room 2. 6. Shakespeare.âThe work of this course embraces a critical study of the development of Shakespeare's mind and art. Lectures on fifteen plays best representing his work at different periods will be given. Other plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries will be read as parallel. Text-Book.âAny complete standard edition of Shakespeare such as Neilson's, The Globe, or Leopold editions. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Wauchope. Law Building, Room 1. 7. Tennyson and Browning.âA careful study of representative poems of Tennyson and Browning. Lectures and interpretative readings will make clear the elements of their art and its relation to the important movements of the nineteenth century. Parallel reading, references, and written reports. Text-Books.âThe Cambridge or Globe edition of Tennyson's Poems and Browning's Poems (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. and Macmillan Co.). Daily, from 4:30 to 5:30. Professor Metcalf. Law Building, Room 2. 8. Advanced Composition: Narration and Exposition.âThis course in writing is designed for students whose work in general rhetoric and composition has advanced sufficiently to justify specialization in the types of discourse. Those who at a previous session have had the course in Rhetoric and Composition, No. 2, or its equivalent, will be prepared for this advanced class. The work will proceed by a study and discussion of the principles of narration and exposition, especially the short story and the short essay, by critical reading of some of the best specimens from recent American authors, and by exercise in both types. Text-Books.âEsenwein's Writing the Short-Story (Hinds, Noble, &amp; Eldridge); Canby's English Composition in Theory and Practice (Macmillan); specimens of stories and essays from the best current magazines. Daily, from 4:30 to 5:30. Professor Myers. Law Building, Room 1. 9. The Books of the New Testament.âWhen you say "Hamlet" or "Les MisÃ©rables" or "Evangeline" or "David Copperfield" the hearer not only recognizes the name but recalls the distinctive contents. He has read these works as wholes, has thought of them as wholes, and remembers them as wholes. But try the same test with "Mark" or "Ephesians" or "Colossians" or "First Thessalonians." Could you give as clear an outline of the contents of any one of these as of any one of the others? Yet you have read them and heard them read far more frequently. The difference is that you have read these Bible books and heard them read by piecemeal, "here a little and there a little;" and the sixty-six books of the Bible are the only pieces of world literature that we approach in this hop-skip-and-jump way. In this course we are going (1) to read each one of the books of the New Testament as far as possible at a sitting, (2) to find its central or nuclear thought, (3) to view it as if it were all of the New Testament that had come down to us, and (4) to remember that the writers wrote not because they had to say something but because they had something to say. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Smith. Assembly Room, Cabell Hall. 10. Oral Expression.âIn view of the larger requirements of the English course of study of today, the need of thorough training in the art of expression becomes a matter of vital interest to teachers of literature. Instruction in elocution is twofold in its nature; on its negative side, it aims to correct faults which would detract from an otherwise good rendition of the masterpieces of literature; while on its positive side it endeavors to bring out individual talent and to inspire such sympathy with the text as may result in a simple, natural and effective reading. Above all things, the aim of any course in public speaking should be to develop the personality of the student, not to make him a mere imitator. The lessons will be divided into two parts: First, a lecture on some phase of the subject with illustrative readings, followed by individual and class exercises bearing upon the matter under discussion. Assignments will be made each day of selections to be studied which will be read or recited by members of the class. This will be followed by criticisms by the instructor. The lectures will deal with such subjects as thought-reading, emphasis, breaking, articulation, phonetics, expression, reading of poetry, quality, pitch, force, time, the tunes of speech, gesture, dialogue, dramatic reading, and impersonation. Students who intend to take the work in American and English Literature are especially urged to avail themselves of the opportunity offered by this course. Daily from 3:30 to 4:30. Professor Reade. Law Building, Room 3. Text-Books.âShoemaker's Practical Elocution. The following are recommended for reference: Murdoch-Russell's Vocal Culture; Kofler's Art of Breaking; Lanier's Science of English Verse. 11. Elementary Language.âThis course is planned to give teachers of the elementary schools a brief, concentrated study of the essentials of matter and method for the language work of all grades below the sixth. The topics discussed will include the following: the purpose and plan of language study; vital points in language teaching; language environment; relation of language to other subjects; the child's own activities and experience as a basis for language work; language and character; language and the community; the teacher of language; literature and language; importance of oral language training; types of oral lessons; language work based upon nature study, geography, literature, history, pictures, games, and hand work, giving the various topics of the course of study re-impression through language expression, while providing a reasonable basis for language itself. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Miss Brooks and Miss London. Law Building, Room 3. 12. Elementary Grammar.âThis course aims primarily at giving teachers a deeper, surer knowledge of the subject matter of grammar, and those completing the work satisfactorily should find themselves thoroughly prepared for the State examination in this subject. The instruction will cover the work of the seventh and eighth grades. Language will be considered mainly from the functional side, and presented so as to provide training in the actual process of thinking. There will be a condensed study of the essential features of descriptive grammar, with especial emphasis upon the more difficult points âthe abstract noun, the comparison of adjectives, the function of case, the personal pronoun, all phases of analysis, and, above all, the verb and the verbals. Frequent touches of comparative and historical grammar will be employed for the sake of the new light and interest to be gained therefrom. There will be, in addition, some consideration of the historical development of grammar teaching, the elementary schools, the relation of grammar to language work, and grammar as a record of usage rather than a law of usage. Text-Books.âEmerson and Bender's Modern English, Book II. Section I, daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Law Building, Room 3; Section II, daily from 12:15 to 1:15; Law Building, Room 3. Mr. Shewmake. 13.

This work is based on the aural recognition of the scale and scale successions up and down in varying order, followed by the written expression of the same. Ear training and eye training are then combined so that power may be gained to think tones and to sense meter and rhythms and at the same time acquire a practical knowledge of scale relations and the application of the Italian syllables used in sight reading. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30, Miss Fraser, Madison Hall. Methods and Rote Songsâ1C.âThis course is devoted to the discussion and presentation of correct teaching principles of music for the first four years in public schools. The methods employed are those used in the school room. Students are required to formulate detailed outlines embodying the preparation and presentation of lessons for the classroom. Rote singing is the foundation upon which there must be laid the whole structure of school music. In this course, emphasis is placed on the importance of selecting material specially adapted for rote singing, upon the method of presentation, and upon the artistic interpretation of the thought and spirit of the song. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Miss Fraser, Madison Hall. Rudiments of Music and Melody Writingâ1D.âThe work in Rudiments of Music includes the study of the constructive elements of music with individual oral and written tests on the same.
