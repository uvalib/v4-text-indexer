Assistant Professor of Physical Education HISTORY The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. It is the main purpose of the Department of Education to provide opportunity for such professional training. Since education is of great importance as an agency of Democracy and as an aspect of civilization, the Department also aims to provide courses of cultural value for citizens generally. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training, the Department, as a part of the State University, offers its services to school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical educational problems and in the furtherance of public education. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by the leading authorities on school architecture in this country who were consulted before its erection. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift by Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2,000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A recent gift of $2,000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City will enable the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of several thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING Laboratory facilities are made available through the coÃ¶peration of the school systems of the City of Charlottesville, the County of Albemarle, and the City of Winchester, the local school boards in each case having approved such coÃ¶peration. Arrangements have been made whereby students in the Department of Education will do observation work and directed teaching in the city schools under the supervision of the Supervisor of Instruction in the City High School, who is Assistant Professor of Education in the University of Virginia. This arrangement gives the Department adequate facilities for effective practical work in secondary education by every candidate for a degree in Education. Besides work in observation and directed teaching, the city schools are also available for studies in school administration, secondary education, and educational psychology. Certain well-qualified students will be assigned special problems to study under the direction of the Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. The school system of Albemarle County is now organized on the county unit basis. It consists of the following schools for white pupils: seven accredited four-year high schools, four junior high schools, five four-room schools, four three-room schools, fourteen two-room schools and twenty-one one-room schools. A number of the small schools are recognized by the State Department of Education as standard in their respective grades. The supervision of the county schools is under the direction of the county superintendent and three full-time supervisors. The school system of the city of Winchester is open for observation, research and experiment by students of the Department of Education. This school system is divided into four departments: Primary, consisting of kindergarten and Grades 1, 2 and 3; Elementary, consisting of Grades 4, 5 and 6; Junior High School, consisting of Grades 7, 8 and 9; and Senior High School, consisting of Grades 10, 11 and 12. Each department is in charge of a supervisor who gives all of his or her time to supervision. The new plant, opened in 1923, provides many features in addition to the regular classrooms. For the elementary school division there will be a covered play court with fresh air ventilation for year-round use; a nature study court; outdoor classrooms for convalescent and anemic children; and facilities for hot lunch provided in the high school cafeteria. In the junior and senior high school division, besides the regular classrooms equipped with movable desks, there will be a business department with special equipment; science laboratories and science lecture rooms; sewing and cooking laboratories with special equipment; art studios; music studios; industrial shops for woodworking, metal working, electrical working and agriculture; library study and reference room; gymnasium and swimming pool; teachers' work room and library. For recreation and community service there will be provided an art gallery exhibit and history museum, auditorium seating twelve hundred, an athletic stadium, tennis courts, golf course, arboretum, and public park. These arrangements give to students in the Department of Education an excellent opportunity to study the problems of both city and country school organization and administration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Requirements for the Admission of Men.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, men must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering college should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register in the Department of Education. Requirements for the Admission of Women.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of College work aggregating thirty session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the summer quarter. Special Students.â(a) Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education, and upon completion of the required courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Board of Education. (b) Men may be admitted as special students without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if they are Virginians, they are more than twenty years old or, if they are not Virginians, they are more than twenty-three years old on the day of registration, and give adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which they are registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. (c) Women, twenty-five years of age, giving satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to pursue courses in Education successfully, may be admitted as special students, even though they fail to show credit for the 30 session-hours of academic work required of women for admission to regular standing. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. This examination will be held on Monday of the first week of the session. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathmetics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. This examination will be held on the Tuesday of the week during which entrance examinations are held. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Department a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this university; and the courses offered as major electives must all have been completed in residence in this university. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 117. A student who, while able to offer fifteen units, cannot offer fifteen units as defined in this list, may be conditioned on any two units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. GRADUATE WORK IN EDUCATION Graduate work in Education leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy may be pursued in the Department of Graduate Studies.

This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must make at least the grade required by the School of College Certification, and must have the recom mendation of the principal of the certifying school. The university accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS June, 1926 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P. M.

C and D Sat. 12 Latin A Latin C Latin D Sat. 18 Latin B German C English D REGULATIONS (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach college student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided he is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College of Arts and Sciences may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating eighteen session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take three additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: A student who, after due admonition, is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon the recommendation of the instructor concerned. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without the permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be automatically excluded from the course. Any student receiving a grade of less than 65 per cent. in English A1, A2, or A3 in the first or second term, must drop the course and take up English A4 at the beginning of the ensuing term. (II) Probation: (1) A student placed on 15-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 60 per cent. on all his courses or else be suspended from the Department of Education. A student placed on 15-hour probation who attains an average grade of at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, is absolved from probation. (2) A first-year student on 12-hour probation must make an average of at least 65 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the Department. Any other student on 12-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 65 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the Department. A student on 12-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (3) A first-year student on 9-hour probation must make an average of at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the Department. Any other student on 9-hour probation must pass on 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the Department. A student on 9-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be placed on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing. A student on 9-hour probation who passes on all his courses may take up 6 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (III) Suspension: Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the Department. If imposed during the session, it applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. In no case does it apply to the Summer Quarter. See also (6) below. No student suspended for a second time may re-enter the College. (IV) Probation and Suspension are administered as follows: (1) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 12 session-hours, is put on 12-hour probation* * Or 15-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. for the term next ensuing, unless his average grade on the remaining 12 session-hours is at least 75 per cent. In this case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and escape probation. A first-year student excluded from a course under (I) during the first term, however, is not to be put on probation during the rest of the first term. At the end of the first term such a student is to be on the same footing as regards probation as is a student who made less than 50 per cent, on one of his courses at the end of the first term. (2) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 9 session-hours, (a) will be put on 9-hour probation,â  â  Or 12-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. unless his average grade on his remaining 9 session-hours is at least 75 per cent., in which case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 12-hour probation, or, (b) if he be other than a first-year student he will be suspended unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. (3) Any student not in his first year, who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at any time during the session with only 6 session-hours, will be suspended at the end of the term. Any first-year student left with only 6 session-hours will be suspended at the end of the term unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. In this case he will be required to take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 9-hour probation for the ensuing term. (4) Any student not on probation who fails to attain a third-term grade or a session grade of at least 75 per cent. on at least 9 session-hours of his work, will be put on 15-hour probation for the first term of the subsequent session. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be readmitted on 15-hour probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was (a) on probation, or (b) passing on less than 9 session-hours of his work. A student previously suspended will, if readmitted to the Department, be placed on 15-hour probation. (5) No student may remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire college course. If his record is such as to call for the imposition of probation for a fourth time, he will be suspended instead of being placed on probation. (6) Probation or suspension imposed at the end of the regular session may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. (7) No student on probation may receive a leave of absence, except for imperative cause, nor may such a student be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as the athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc., until he has passed his examinations. No student may remain in the Department if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent., but not below sixty-five per cent., may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and it should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) The candidate for the academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special reexamination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted, in connection with both (I) and (II) above, that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the Department is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The president will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons; and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) (a) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absence from lectures renders the student liable to discipline by the Faculty. It should be carefully noted that no student is "entitled" to be absent at all. His presence is required at each class or laboratory exercise at which he is due, unless his absence is excused for reasons outlined above or in the next paragraph below. Even if the student is absent with excuse, he must make up the work lost by such absence. No student who was, for any reason, absent for more than fifty per cent. of the lectures of any one term can receive a grade on the work of that term. (b) Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean, and should in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs, on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page . . . . . The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. No student on Probation may receive a leave of absence except for imperative cause. It should also be carefully noted that no leave of absence can be granted just before or just after a vacation, or just after term examinations, except for very grave reasons, or unless the applicant is passing in all his courses The Dean's List.âA student who passes on not less than fifteen session-hours during a session with an average of at least eighty-five per cent., and with no session grade less than seventy-five per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List, and will remain on the List as long as he receives an average of at least eighty-five per cent., on at least fifteen session-hours per term and receives no term grade less than seventy-five per cent. in any course. Any student on the Dean's List failing to maintain this standard of excellence will be automatically dropped from the List. A student once dropped from the List can again make the Dean's List by meeting the above standard for entire session. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone..

COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form certificate for high-school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four three-session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. SPECIAL CERTIFICATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS Students who find it necessary to leave college to teach before completing their full course may be issued special certificates by the State Board of Education to teach any high-school subjects in which they have completed six session-hours of study of college grade. These students should plan to take two courses in Education during their second year in order to become familiar with school problems. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.âWhite male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION TEACHING COURSES Extension teaching courses are courses of instruction corresponding closely with those regularly given in the University by regular members of the faculty, and are under the administration, supervision and control of the University, for the benefit of persons unable to attend the regular courses of instruction and to take work in residence. Each course represents a definite amount of study corresponding to an equivalent amount of work done in residence at the University, and when completed satisfactorily by persons meeting the entrance requirements of the University, receives the same credit as if taken in residence. Extension teaching classes in Education, conducted by members of the faculty of the Department of Education or instructors approved by the faculty of the Department, were organized in the session of 1925 under the Division of Extension of the University, in Alexandria, Orange, Lexington, Lynchburg, and Roanoke. Additional Extension Teaching classes were conducted by members of the regular faculty of the University and instructors in the Extension Division of the University in Staunton, Culpeper, Lynchburg, Farmville, and Richmond. Extension Teaching Courses will be organized upon application for them in as many centers as possible, if a sufficient number (a minimum of fifteen) apply for them. Application for such courses should be made to the Director of University Extension, Box 149, University, Virginia. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. On account of the increasing demand for graduate work in the Summer Quarter, the number of graduate courses will be enlarged in 1926. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 21st and ends July 31st; Second Term begins August 2nd and ends September 4th. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, September 3rd, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors J. L. Manahan, W. R. Smithey, J. C. Metcalf and I. F. Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments (J. L. Manahan, Director), University, Virginia. PHI DELTA KAPPA FRATERNITY A chapter of the national honorary educational fraternity of Phi Delta Kappa has been organized in connection with the Department of Education. Under the constitution of the fraternity, only those students are eligible to membership who expect to make teaching or administration of schools a permanent vocation, and who give evidence of superior qualities of character, scholarship and initiative. The standards of scholarship governing election to membership in the fraternity are similar to those prescribed for election to Phi Beta Kappa. The purpose of the fraternity as stated in its constitution is "to develop among the students of Education at the University of Virginia the spirit of `Research, Service and Leadership,' " and to endeavor by every worthy means at its command to create and foster fellowship and true fraternalism among the members of the society. EDUCATION CLUB An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts towards placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. SCHOLARSHIPS The Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships in the Department of Education and the College: fifty scholarships annually, each with a value of $100. Founded in 1918 by action of the General Assembly of Virginia. The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirious by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia, EXPENSES The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $360 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States, $530 upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found on page 127 of the General Catalogue.
