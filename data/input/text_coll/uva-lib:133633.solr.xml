Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign, Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been an integral part of the University from its foundation. The aim of the Department of Law has been, from earliest days, to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as have satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of study according to traditionally rigid standards. This policy has been uniformly enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to economic conditions and to meet the increasing demands of the profession. The Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools; is registered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York as meeting the requirements for admission to the bar in that State; and is on the approved list of the American Bar Association. Standards of the American Bar Association.âAs an approved law school on the list of the American Bar Association, this law school complies with the official request of that Association that approved law schools include in their Annual Bulletins a copy of the following standards: "Standards of the American Bar Association." (1) "The American Bar Association is of the opinion that every candidate for admission to the Bar should give evidence of graduation from a school complying with the following standards: (a) "It shall require as a condition of admission at least two years of study in a college. (b) "It shall require its students to pursue a course of three years duration if they devote substantially all of their working time to their studies, and a longer time, equivalent in the number of working hours, if they devote only part of their working time to their studies. (c) "It shall provide an adequate library available for the use of the students. (d) "It shall have among its teachers a sufficient number giving their entire time to the school to ensure actual personal acquaintance and influence with the whole student body. (e) "It shall not be operated as a commercial enterprise and the compensation of any officer or member of its teaching staff shall not depend on the number of students or on the fees received. (2) "The American Bar Association is of the opinion that graduation from a law school should not confer the right of admission to the Bar, and that every candidate should be subjected to an examination by public authority to determine his fitness. (3) "The Council on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar is directed to publish from time to time the names of those law schools which comply with the above standards and of those which do not and to make such publications available so far as possible to intending law students. "In compliance with the policy announced by the American Bar Association in 1921, we recommend the establishment in each state, where none now exist, of opportunities for a collegiate training, free or at moderate cost, so that all deserving young men and young women seeking admission to the Bar may obtain an adequate preliminary education; and, that the several states be urged, through the Council on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, to provide, at stated times and places, for pre-legal examinations to be held by the university of the state or by the board of law examiners thereof, for those applicants for admission to the Bar obliged to make up their preliminary qualifications outside of accredited institutions of learning." For further information, address Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, American Bar Association, 1140 North Dearborn St., Chicago, Ill. A pamphlet is available upon request, containing the various Rulings of the Council upon the foregoing Resolutions of the Association, and a revised list of Approved Law Schools. Law School Building.âThe Law School occupied from 1911 to 1932 its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. But due to increased numbers, both in the teaching force and in student enrollment, the Law School in recent years found these quarters too limited for its purposes. This situation was relieved at the opening of the session of 1932-33, when the Law School occupied its new and commodious quarters, Clark Memorial Hall, which was formally presented and dedicated on October 5, 1932. It occupies the elevated site in rear of the dormitories known as D and E on Dawson's Row, now demolished. The Law School was indebted for the new building to the generosity of the late William Andrews Clark, Jr., of Los Angeles, California, a graduate of the Law School of 1899. The gift is a memorial to his late wife, Mabel Foster Clark, for whom the building is named. It is a modern fireproof structure, with liberal and handsome provision for all the needs and conveniences of a modern law school. Law Library.âThe Library contains about twenty-nine thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the Canadian and Australian Reports; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States in official or unofficial form; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern searchbooks in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, and bound volumes of law journals. Practically all the current American legal periodicals are received, and bound volumes of these are on the shelves. Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of the Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from November to June, inclusive. The Review is now in its twenty-second volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Adequate quarters are provided for the accommodation of the editorial board and the business staff. GENERAL INFORMATION The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 19; the second, March 20; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No student may register, as a candidate for the degree, for the work of the first term after October 15, nor for that of the second term after January 10ânor is registration in absentia permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those of the first year, should enter upon the study of law at the beginning of the session. Where this was impossible, it was formerly the practice of the Law School to permit students to register at the beginning of the second term, in January, but not later, save in exceptional cases. This practice was then feasible, since new courses were begun at that time. With the session of 1931-1932, however, a number of indivisible courses, some in each year, were extended over two or more terms. It is, therefore no longer possible for candidates for the degree to enter at the beginning of the later term. In exceptional cases, qualified students who seek special courses, and who are not candidates for the degree, may be permitted to enter after the end of the first term. Fees and Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Law School may be estimated at $700 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all University and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $900 to $1,000 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The University fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee for residents of Virginia is $175, for non-residents, $195; an athletic fee of $15 applies to all students. The total fees, therefore, for Virginia students are $250, and for non-Virginians $270, plus a fee of $1.50 for the student newspaper. Payments of Fees.âFees are payable one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term; and the remainder at the opening of the third term. Failure to make satisfactory arrangements therefor with the Bursar will lead to suspension of all University privileges. (See Regulation 2, post page 15.) Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in the State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âEach professor has full liberty to adopt his own method of teaching. In a great majority of the courses instruction is by the case method, oral discussion in the class-room of cases contained in standard case-books. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by lectures and demonstrations during the first term of the first year, accompanied by the assignment of practical work in the library, on which numerous oral and written tests are held; and in the third year briefs on assigned topics and according to rigorous standards are required. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases on scientific principles. The Law Clubs.âThere are usually six or more Law Clubs functioning actively in the life of the Law School. Membership in the Law Clubs is optional but students are strongly advised to participate in this work as it affords training in the use of the library, in the preparation of briefs, and in the presentation of oral argument. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work, and have maintained a satisfactory record for ethical conceptions and honorable conduct such as should characterize a prospective member of the legal profession. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, infra), and elective courses, aggregating at least 21 term-hours. A term-hour represents one lecture period per week throughout one of the three terms into which the session is divided. Degree with Final Honors.âA student who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may, when registering for his third year, seek to qualify for the award of the degree with Final Honors upon the conditions set forth on page 18 infra. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âProspective law students, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of all law teachers is that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Moreover, sound academic training tends to develop and to refine the ethical sense so necessary to an honorable career at the bar. It is this consideration that has been, in large measure, the motive of the Association of American Law Schools, and of the national and State bar associations of America, to stress, as these have been doing for some years, the need of a higher educational standard for students proposing to enter upon the study of the law. Students are therefore urged not to begin their legal studies before completion of an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not as yet exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: Entrance Credits.âIn addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for two years at least he has pursued, as a resident, in a standard college, courses acceptable toward a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least 30 session-hours, or 60 semester-hours. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Applications for Admission.âApplications for admission must be submitted upon forms which will be supplied by the Dean of the Law School. Such applications, with satisfactory evidence of the required entrance credits, should be filed in the Dean's office not later than September 1. An applicant for admission from outside Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with representatives of the University. Any applicant whose pre-law college record is not considered satisfactory by the Committee on Admissions, from the standpoint of scholarship, may be denied admission, or admitted only on Probation, even though such applicant has completed the entrance credits required. Courses Not Acceptable for Admission.âA candidate shall present at least 30 session-hours (or 60 semester-hours, or their equivalent) of college work, taken in a school approved by standard regional accrediting agencies, and exclusive of credit earned in non-theory courses in Military Science, Hygiene, Domestic Arts, Physical Education, Vocal or Instrumental Music, or other courses without intellectual content of substantial value. This requirement conforms to the rules of the Association of American Law Schools. Recommended Pre-Law Courses.âThe following subjects are recommended as desirable pre-law courses: English, Latin, a Modern Foreign Language, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Accounting, Economics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Public Speaking. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work.âEvidence of the required entrance credits must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the college work was done. Such certificate must indicate, in addition to the high school units offered for admission, the college courses completed, the grades received, the time devoted to each course, and the credit, in session- or semester-hours, at which each such course is valued toward a baccalaureate degree. No Conditioned Students.âCandidates for admission who have not completed the required 30 session-hours will not be admitted with the privilege of making up the deficiency. Advanced Standing.âFrom 1904 to 1934 no advanced standing or other credit was given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. During that time the practical results were so satisfactory that the rule must still be regarded as the prevailing policy of the law school, as a general rule.* * After considerable experimentation with the prevailing custom of giving credit for work done in other law schools, this rule was adopted in 1904. From the beginning the practical results were so satisfactory that it has become a firmly established policy of the Law School. The rule does not rest on an assumed superiority of curriculum or methods, but on the practical impossibility of dovetailing the parts of two differently arranged curricula. It also avoids certain evils usually accompanying the advanced standing privilege. For an account of the origin of the privilege of advanced standing, and the undesirable results, reference is made to Bulletin Number Fifteen (1921, p. 168) of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. During recent years, however, it has become apparent that iron-clad adherence to this rule occasionally prevented the Law School from receiving an applicant of the highest calibre. To make the admission of such an applicant possible, in exceptional cases, the Law Faculty adopted a resolution, effective with the session of 1934-35, providing as follows: "Credit toward the degree of Bachelor of Laws in this Law School, in no event to exceed the work of one full session, may, in the discretion of the Dean or Assistant Dean of this Law School, or upon vote of the Law Faculty, be given for courses satisfactorily passed in a law school in the United States that is either approved by the American Bar Association or is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. Similar credit may in like manner be given for work done in law schools outside the United States. No credit shall be given to a student who is ineligible for re-admission to the law school in which the work, for which credit is sought, was done; and no credit shall be given for work in any single session during which the student failed in two or more courses. Credit once given may be withdrawn for unsatisfactory work in this Law School. The Dean and the Assistant Dean of this Law School are given power to make such rulings and adjustments as shall be necessary for the fair and equitable administration of this general provision." Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session of 1920-1921, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admissions are the same as in the case of male applicants. 2. Special Students.âA limited number of applicants who are at least 23 years old and who present proper evidence of good character and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfil the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, and only in exceptional cases, be admitted as special students, and not as candidates for the degree.â  â  The limitation of the number of special students admitted conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association. The applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law, with a statement of reasons why he was unable to qualify as a regular student. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government.

Under the terms of the donation the award is made at the close of each session to the law student who is a candidate for graduation the following year, and whose scholarship, character, personality, activities in the affairs of the Law School, and promise of efficiency, have, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, entitled him to special recognition above his fellows. The William Samuel Goodwyn Fellowship, with an income of $280: Founded in 1935 upon the bequest of Mrs. Dora H. Goodwyn, of Emporia, Va. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE LECTURE FOUNDATION This Foundation was established in 1922 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons of the late William H. White, a distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, especially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; and that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. OUTLINE OF COURSES The table of courses and lecture schedule, as outlined on the following pages, contemplate an average of about fifteen lecture periods (of one hour each) per week. In view of possible changes, no attempt is here made to outline the courses for 1936-1937. The courses and schedules are those offered in 1935-1936. Written examinations are held at the close of each term.

Registration Generally.âStudents are required to register in advance at the office of (1) The Dean of the Law School; (2) The Bursar; and (3) The University Registrar, for every course taken. Registration is not complete until fees have been paid or proper arrangement for payment made with the Bursar. 2. Suspension for Non-payment of Fees.âA student who is in default in the payment of fees and has so remained for fifteen days will be suspended, and deprived of all privileges of the Law School, until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails without good cause, to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine A. M. and one-thirty P. M. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Minimum for Which Students May Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than a full year's work as scheduled. 5. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 6. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after 50 per cent. of the lectures thereon in any term have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 8. 7. Courses Extending Through More Than One Term of the Session.â a. Real Property I and Real Property II are so far regarded as separate courses that one may be passed, and credited, and the other failed. They are so far regarded as a single course that both may be absolved by attaining, in the same session, grades which average the passing grade. b. All other courses extending through more than one term will be credited only in their entirety, each as a single course. Regular examinations will be held, however, at the end of each term during which such a course is given, and will be reported to the Dean's Office, for disciplinary purposes, but the final grade for the entire course will be based upon the several term examinations, with the usual adjustments for attendance, written exercises and recitations. The last examination in such a course may cover the entire subject. 8. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average examination grade of 80 per cent. will place such student on probation (see Regulation 11) for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless marked improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation may be required. 9. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work from the First Year.âSubject to regulations below, students who have been found deficient in two or more courses prescribed for the first year may be re-admitted on probation (see Regulation 11). Where the Law Faculty deems the deficiency serious enough the student must repeat the lectures in the courses in which he is deficient. No optional attendance is permissible in the latter case, and only such a limited amount of new work may be taken as will not conflict with the previously incomplete work. 10. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work from the Second Year.âA candidate for the degree who has proved deficient in one or more subjects required in the second year may be required to repeat such courses without privileges in optional attendance, or otherwise, and may be on probation in any term during which he is repeating a second-year course. 11. Probation.âStudents on probation are not entitled to leaves of absence except for imperative cause, nor are they permitted to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University. Any student on probation may be required to resign unless his work indicates a marked improvement. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âA student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 325 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session, but may be permitted to return, on conditions, the next session thereafter. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 9 foregoing. 13. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 14. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject, required in the first year, but has failed on the examinations, may, with the approval of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subject the following session, to the extent necessitated by actual conflict in schedule with the regular courses of the second year, but subject to Regulation 9. 15. Advanced Work.âStudents are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 16. General Requirements.âStudents of the Law School are required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which they are members, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 17. Absence from Lectures.âA careful record is kept of the absence from lectures and omission of prescribed work. Such absences, unexcused, render the student liable to be disciplined and detract from his class or examination grade. A student who has been absent for any cause from more than one-third of the scheduled number of lectures in any course shall, prima facie, automatically be denied the privilege of standing the examination in such course. Under special circumstances, and upon special petition, the Law Faculty may permit such a student to stand the examination in such course. 18. "Dean's List."âAn average examination grade of 90 per cent. for the first two years will entitle the student to a place on the "Dean's List," which carries with it special privileges with respect to absences from lectures. The privilege will not exempt students from required practical work, nor from review quizzes. The Dean may revoke the privilege if abused. 19. Extra-Curricular ActivitiesâReports to the Dean.âStudents of the Law School who propose to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University, or who propose to devote a material portion of their time to work outside the Law School, are required to report their names and proposed activities at the Dean's office for official approval. In no case will such approval be given to a student on probation. 20. Law Students Taking College Courses.âA Law Student, under special circumstances, with the permission of the Dean, may register in the College of Arts and Sciences for a course not exceeding three hours a week. 21. Special Examinations. (Subject to Regulation 24 below.)âNo special examinations are granted, save in case of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 22. Re-Examinations.âNo re-examinations are granted, except under conditions stated in Regulations 14 and 23. 23. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âA candidate for the degree who at the end of his third year is found deficient in one or more subjects, may return the following session and, without further attendance upon lectures, stand the regular examinations on such of his uncompleted subjects as the Dean and the professor or professors in charge may approve. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. In exceptional cases and for good cause this privilege may be extended to the student of any year. See Regulation 14. 24. The Same.âStudents in the category mentioned in the foregoing regulation who return for a regular examination as mentioned, and who reside 250 miles from the University, may be granted the privilege of standing one or more special examinations in incompleted courses scheduled for a later term. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the expense of several return trips. 25. Examinations in absentia.âStudents entitled to one or more examinations under Regulation 23, and who reside more than 300 miles from the University, may, in the discretion of the Dean and of the professor or prefessors in charge, be allowed the privilege of standing such examination or examinations in absentia under approved supervision. 26. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the last three preceding regulations is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, are required to pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause, under Regulation 21. 27. Elective Courses Required for Degree.âIn addition to the satisfactory completion of all required work a candidate for the degree must offer credits of not less than 21 term-hours to be chosen by the student from the elective courses offered in the third year. Choice of Elective Courses.âEach applicant for a degree must upon his matriculation sheet specifically designate those elective courses which the candidate proposes to take in order to absolve the requirements under Regulation 27 (twenty-one term hours of elective courses) and under Regulation 29, if applicable (thirty-one term hours). Such designation when definitely made shall be final, and the candidate must pass the courses so elected in order to obtain the degree. Grades in elective courses, as in obligatory courses in the third year, will not be announced until after the publication of the degree list in June. No addition nor substitution of elective courses after choice is definitely made will be permitted except upon the approval of the Dean's Office, for good cause shown. 28. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 29. Graduation with Final Honors.âA candidate who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may apply (See Regulation 28) for the award of the degree with Final Honors, by offering credits for elective courses totaling at least 10 term-hours, in addition to the 21 term-hours of elective courses mentioned in Regulation 27. The degree of Bachelor of Laws with Final Honors may be conferred upon any applicant who has completed all the prerequisite work, with an average grade of at least 90 per cent. on the courses offered in his third year, but subject to such special oral or written examinations as the Law Faculty may prescribe in respect to each such application. Caveat.âAt the date of the preparation of this catalogue the whole question of whether the Law School shall continue the degree of Bachelor of Laws with Final Honors, and, if so, under what conditions, is being studied by a committee of the Law Faculty. For this reason the catalogue announcement is being left as it has appeared heretofore, but should be regarded as subject to change for the session of 1936-1937. 30. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 31. Honor System.âAll written tests and examinations are conducted under the Honor System.
