A candidate may be admitted in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his academic work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. The maximum allowable number of conditions is four. No student will be conditioned in Mathematics A, B, or C; or in English A or B. SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for registration who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered by the Dean of the University as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students must in all cases meet the specific entrance requirements as prescribed for the courses elected by them. Special Students and Conditioned Students are advised and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by work in the Summer School. They will then be registered as Regular Students. But it is expressly ordered that no such student shall be recognized as a candidate for any degree from the University of Virginia, unless he shall have completed all the Entrance Requirements at least one academic year before the date of his graduation. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ADMISSION WITH ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other universities and from colleges affiliated with the University of Virginia will be admitted to advanced standing as candidates for degrees from this University upon presentation of proper certificates, covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. They must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the Professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should in no case fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. Students from training schools, in which the work of the upper classes is approximately of collegiate grade, will be granted advanced standing in English, Mathematics and the Languages, provided they are recommended officially and in writing for such advanced standing by the principal of the school. Such students must, however, in every case, attend the lectures and pass the examinations here in the last year of the undergraduate work of every course elected. High School courses in Science are in no case accepted as grounds for advanced standing. Any student admitted with advanced standing to the B Course in English, or Mathematics, or Latin, or Greek, or French, or German, or Spanish, who passes on the Fall Term in such course, may be allowed credit for an additional unit in his Entrance Electives. The College.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least one full session to the studies of the College and at least three of his electives must be taken here. Department of Engineering.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for a degree in Engineering must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least two full sessions to engineering studies in this University. Department of Graduate Studies.âApplicants for admission to this department as candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy must present the baccalaureate degree of an affiliated institution of collegiate rank, or in cases of incorporated institutions of learning which confer no such degree, the certificate of graduation on a course fully equivalent to the ordinary collegiate course. No diploma or certificate can be accepted except UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA RECORD by vote of the Faculty, based on the recommendation of the Committee on Academic Degrees. Department of Law.âNo admission with advanced standing is permitted by the Faculty of this Department. Department of Medicine.âThe special prescription for admission with advanced standing in Medicine will be found set forth in the section of the catalogue devoted to that Department on page 195. CONDITIONS FOR THE ACCREDITING OF SCHOOLS. A school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the University should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the University will be sent to inspect the school. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of affiliated schools and published in the catalogue of the University. No school will be placed upon the list in which the course of study covers less than four years of high school work based upon at least seven years of competent elementary instruction. Each school must offer at least sixteen units of high school instruction as defined in the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia in the current number of the catalogue, and in this Bulletin. A unit consists of thirty six weeks of instruction in one subject, in which there are five recitations of forty minutes each per week. These sixteen units must include the first three units of English, the first three in Mathematics, and one unit of history as outlined. Students wishing to pursue the study of Latin at the University must offer four units of Latin for entrance. The University will not consider any high school in which the teaching force consists of less than two teachers devoting their entire time to high school instruction. It is strongly in favor of requiring the entire time of not less than three teachers. All high school teachers should possess college training and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. The number of daily recitation periods given by one teacher should not exceed eight. The University advises six. The number of daily recitation periods of one student should not exceed five. The quality of the instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, the efficiency of the equipment and the character of the text-books used are paramount factors and a representative of the University must report satisfactorily upon those points before a school shall be accredited. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS The laboratory and library facilities should be adequate to the needs of the instruction in the subjects for which credit is asked. Each accredited school is required to report to the Committee on Accredited Schools when requested to do so. Any failure so to report will be considered cause for removal from the list. The principal is required to forward to the Dean of the University, upon a blank to be supplied upon request, a list of subjects in which each student entering the University from said school is properly prepared. The University reserves the right to cease to accredit at any time any school that employs inefficient teachers or fails to maintain the standard mentioned herein. High schools which do not fulfill all the requirements for a fully accredited school, but which offer at least twelve units may be partially accredited, upon those subjects which have been approved by the Committee. Graduates of such schools will be credited with the twelve approved units and will be required to stand entrance examinations upon the other units. LIST OF ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. The following is a list of the schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University. This list is revised annually by the Faculty Committee on Accredited Schools. Schools already on the list will be retained and new schools added provided they give evidence upon examination of meeting the entrance requirements stated above. Certificates from schools outside the State of Virginia which are accredited by their own State Universities, or other institutions of similar rank, may be accepted by the Dean, provided the courses of instruction in such schools meet the requirements indicated in the foregoing pages.
