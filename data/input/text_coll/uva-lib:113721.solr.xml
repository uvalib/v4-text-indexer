      <field name="fulltext">History and Introduction The Virginia High School Literary League was organized by the Washington and Jefferson Literary Societies of the University of Virginia, in 1913. A bulletin was published which contained a question of current importance for debate and sufficient material so arranged as to enable a high school pupil to write an intelligent argument on both sides of the question. Each year a similar bulletin is published with the same purpose in view. The interest taken in the League has been remarkable. At the end of the first year forty schools were enrolled. This number jumped to eighty in 1914, to two hundred and fifty in 1915, and there is great promise of doubling the last number before 1916 has passed. During the first two years of its existence the League conducted contests in reading and debating only. In 1915 the scope of work was broadened and the spring of 1916 saw State contests in reading and debating, basketball and track, and a district baseball contest. For the coming year a local prize contest, in general literary and athletic work, will be added and the prizes will be given by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. All athletic contests will be under the supervision of the General Athletic Association of the University. All literary contests will be under the supervision of the Virginia Union of the University. In the debating and reading contests the teams in each locality are pitted against each other in preliminary debate. When all but about forty teams have been eliminated by this process the victorious survivors come to the University of Virginia for the final debates. By a continuous process of pairing off by lot and surviving by merit the winners are finally determined. The last three debates of the past May were decided only after a secondary debate by the judges in conference, and then by a two-to-one vote. In those close contests, John Marshall High School won over the Pulaski High; Houston High won over Roanoke High, and then in the final trial was barely defeated by John Marshall. The readings were equally interesting. The winners were Miss Esidora Henry and Mr. J. C. McManaway, both of the Charlottesville High School. Just previous to the debates, the Jefferson School of Charlottesville and the Salem High School fought their way through a long line of victories to the final game in the basketball contest. This was played in the Fayerweather Gymnasium at the University, and Salem emerged the winner. Last year Woodberry Forest School won the track meet held on Lambeth Field at the University. The faculty and students of the University of Virginia put forth every effort to entertain the visitors while here. The visiting teachers were the guests of the Colonnade Club and Gleason Hotel, while the visiting teams were entertained by the girls and boys of Charlottesville and the students of the University of Virginia. Meals were served both at the Commons and at the Tea Room to visitors without cost. Free tickets were given the visitors to the moving picture theatres and there was no charge for street car service. The Chamber of Commerce arranged an excursion to Monticello, but, to the regret of all, it had to be abandoned on account of rain. After the final contest in the debates a reception was given to the visitors in the Tea Room, which was beautifully decorated for the occasion. During the course of the banquet members of the University faculty, representatives of the Washington and Jefferson Literary Societies, and visitors from the various schools were called upon to speak. And thus the evening passed away most pleasantly. "By their fruits ye shall know them" bears quite a significant interpretation to The Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League. The League's progress has been unrivalled. The membership has increased phenomenonally, which bears witness to the direct accomplishments. There has been a salutary spirit of encouragement of society work. And in the rounding out of the League to include athletic endeavors a great step has been made in the encouragement of training in athletics and the standardization of athletic requirements in all the secondary schools of Virginia. The good work has only started. It is earnestly hoped that every secondary school in the State, whether public or private, will affiliate with the League and extend hearty support to its already successful endeavors. We require no dues. We simply ask your undivided coÃ¶peration. If you wish material on the debate we will furnish it to you in pamphlet form. If you desire to go further, the University library has kindly provided package libraries on the question, which will be sent to any principal of a high school for two weeks without cost, save postage, upon application to Mr. John S. Patton, Librarian, at the University of Virginia. Address all inquiries to A. R. Boyd, Secretary of the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League. The Virginia Union** The Virginia Union is an organization controlling all forensic and other related student public activities at the University. The Washington and Jefferson Literary Societies are under the auspices of this union. and The General Athletic Association.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Athletic Courtesy. Our athletics should foster clean sport between gentlemen. It is the privilege and duty of every committee and person connected with the League to embody these principles in his own actions and to earnestly advocate them before others: (1) The rules of games are to be regarded as mutual agreements, the spirit or letter of which no gentleman would break. The stealing of advantage in sport is theft. (2) Visiting teams are to be honored guests of the home team, and should be treated as such. (3) No action is to be taken nor course of conduct pursued which would seem ungentlemanly or dishonorable if known to one's opponent or the public. (4) No advantages are to be sought over others except those in which the game is understood to show superiority. (5) Officers and opponents are to be regarded and treated as honest in intention. When opponents are evidently not gentlemen, and officers manifestly dishonest or incompetent, future relationships with them may be avoided. (6) Decisions of officials are to be abided by, even when they seem unfair. (7) Ungentlemanly or unfair means are not to be used even when they are used by opponents. (8) Good points in others should be appreciated and suitable recognition given.</field>

Basketball Throw.âThe girls must stand back of the throwing line and throw with one hand. She must not run before the throw. She must not step over the line in throwing; to do so is a trial without result. Three trials are allowed. Potato Race.âAt one end of a line, 20 yards long, place a basket containing three potatoes. Draw three 2-foot circles at intervals of 5 yards along this line, the nearest one being 5 yards from the basket. At the opposite end of the line from the basket is the starting line. The circle nearest to starting line is No. 1, the next No. 2, and the next No. 3. A girl starts at the starting line, runs to the basket, gets one potato and places it in circle No. 1. She then gets another and places it in circle No. 2, and then places the third potato in circle No. 3, passing between basket and starting line each time. She then runs to the starting line, and returns and replaces potato No. 1 in the basket, then No. 2, and No. 3, passing around the basket each time. She then finishes in a dash across the starting line. Only one trial is allowed. All-up Indian Club Race.âTwo tangent circles each 3 feet in diameter are 30 feet in front of starting line. In one circle are three 1-lb. model BS Indian clubs, upright. A girl runs from starting line, and transfers clubs to the other circle, using only one hand. She returns to the starting line, then makes two more trips, transferring clubs each time. The clubs must be left upright each time. She then finishes in a dash across the starting line. One trial is allowed. Bean Bag Target Toss.âDraw on the ground three concentric circles with diameters of 2 feet, 4 feet, and 6 feet, respectively. A girl stands back of a line 10 feet from outer circle, and tosses a bean bag 6 inches square and containing one-half pound of beans. If the bag falls within the inner circles, it counts 15 points; if between the inner and middle circle, it counts 10 points, and if between middle and outer circle it counts 5 points. Only one and three-quarters minutes are allowed each contestant in group contests and two minutes in pin contests. After each throw a girl must run and pick up her bag and return to throwing line. Two trials are allowed. Balancing with Bean Bag on Head.âA beam or piece of timber 2 feet wide and 12 feet long is used. The girl must with bean bag on her head start at the center, walk to the end, then without turning she must walk to the center, then walk forward to the end, and then turn and walk back to the center. Two trials are allowed. The bag must not be touched with the hands. The other requirements relating to the boys' contests will also apply to the girls' contest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hints on Training. 1. Always warm up slowly and cool off gradually when finished. 2. Stop practice before you are exhausted. 3. Dress lightly for practice or competition, but put on warm clothing at once when you have finished. 4. Practice regularly; a little each day, if possible. 5. Have regular hours for eating and sleeping. 6. Don't Smoke. TRAINING SCHEDULE. For Runners. (a) Warm up; never fail to do this. (b) Practice five or six starts. Before taking the line trot a dozen steps up the track and back. On the start run at full speed about twenty yards; slow up gradually and walk back to the line. (c) Wait a minute; take a few deep breaths; trot a few steps and repeat the start, running a few yards further than before. After two or three trials put as much speed as possible into the start, run moderately for a few yards and finish at top speed. (d) Once a week run your full distance at top speed. This may be done oftener for distances under 100 yards. (e) Always end practice by walking about until breathing becomes nearly normal; then take a rub-down and dress. For Jumpers. (a) Warm up. (b) Devote a large part of the practice to getting the "take off" properly. (c) Decide which foot you will jump from, then starting on this foot from the "take off" run back six, eight or some even number of strides and mark off the spot where you strike your last stride. Let your jumping foot strike this mark in the run to the "take off." Run with the natural stride until the last two paces, which may be lengthened a few inches. If you do not hit the "take off" right, move your starting mark backward or forward by just the distance that you go over or fall short. Some jumpers have two marks. This is often helpful; the first mark serving as a guide to bring the jumper to the second mark on the proper stride. (d) At first try easy jumps, raising the knees quickly and as high as possible when the jump is being made. Practice this until you learn how to land and to control your body while in the air. (e) Do not try for height or distance in the high and broad jump more than once or twice a week, and take a good rub down and dress quickly when you have finished practicing. For Shot Putters. (a) Warm up by swinging the arms, bending the body and springing forward, at the same time giving the body a sharp turn forward and to the right. (b) Practice should be done from a stand so as to get the spring with the legs, the turn and lunge of the body and the heave with the shoulders. (c) Before making a put always limber the muscles of the arm and shoulder by stretching the arm up to its full length. (d)Use a light shot until the fundamental motions are mastered. For Hurdlers. (a) Warm up and practice starts the same as for running. (b) Practice with one hurdle at first to get the stride and to overcome any hesitancy in taking the hurdle. (c) Go no higher than is necessary in clearing the hurdle. Both time and strength may be saved in this way. (d) Later practice with two or three hurdles, aiming to get a uniform stride between the hurdles and to maintain a good balance. A good preliminary exercise is to raise the legs alternately, bringing the knees to the level of the armpit. (e) Once or twice a week take the full number of hurdles for time. Warming Up Program. (a) Take a dozen steps rising slightly on the toes at each step. (b) Trot a dozen steps. Repeat, swinging the arms at the sides. (c) Trot thirty steps, lifting the knees well at each step. Repeat, lifting the heels high. (d) Take several deep breaths. Now trot fifty steps at a good swinging pace, then walk fifty. (e) Breathe deeply. Always do this, no matter what your event may be.</field>

The Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League does not form local organizations, but will join with the CoÃ¶perative Education Association in the formation of a High School CoÃ¶perative League in each school. This High School CoÃ¶perative League should have general charge of all of the activities of the school, athletic, literary, civic, industrial, moral, etc. The Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League will undertake to render assistance in athletic and literary contests, the CoÃ¶perative Education Association will render special assistance in the civic and social improvement work, the State Y. M. C. A. will have special direction of the devotional and moral features, and other organizations will coÃ¶perate in rendering aid in their special fields. In order to provide a definite plan of organization of High (and Elementary) School CoÃ¶perative Leagues (these Leagues take the place of the Junior Leagues), the CoÃ¶perative Education Association has issued a Bulletin giving the constitution and by-laws and directions for each committee. This Bulletin also contains a suggestive plan for the county organization of the Leagues. Write to the CoÃ¶perative Education Association for this Bulletin and an application blank. This application blank must be used in sending the names of the officers and chairman of the committees and it should be filled out and returned to the Association at once. A card index record will be kept by the Association which will indicate the condition and progress of each League. The State Executive Committee of the Virginia Young Men's Christian Association, at the urgent request and with the generous coÃ¶peration of representative ministers, leaders in educational work, and Sunday School leaders of both sexes, has sought to bring before the collective young life of the secondary public schools a program of moral and religious study and activities that would help solve the vexatious problems incident to the bringing together of large numbers of immature youths, the purpose being to inspire the young folk to create, maintain and extend throughout the schools an atmosphere conducive to normal growth morally and religiously. The plan is to organize the boys into a club which is divided into natural groups to each of which a leader, chosen by the young people with the approval of adult advisors, is related, and each group meeting at a stated time for the study of carefully selected material conducive to growth morally and religiously. Each club elects officers from among the student body, the senior students assuming the greater responsibility, and the younger students moving up each year from less responsible to the more responsible places. The materials used are prepared by men and women intimately acquainted with the problems confronting secondary students, and intended to give a clear presentation of moral and religious value at the most susceptible time in life. The CoÃ¶perative Education Association, through its Executive Secretary, Mr. J. H. Montgomery, Richmond, Virginia, will furnish a Bulletin of High School CoÃ¶perative Leagues, making suggestions for the work of the several committees. The Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League, through Professor Chas. G. Maphis, Professor of Secondary Education in the University, or Mr. A. R. Boyd, Secretary, will send all the necessary Bulletins in regard to athletic and literary contests, and the State Y. M. C. A. Department, Richmond, Va., through its Secretary, will send special information in regard to its work.
