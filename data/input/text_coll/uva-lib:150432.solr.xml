      <field name="fulltext">THE RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY OF LONDON VOLUME III DOCUMENTS, I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Note In 1906 the Library of Congress published, in two quarto volumes entitled "The Records of the Virginia Company of London," the text, from the manuscript in the Library, of the Court Book containing the minutes of that company's meetings, and of the meetings of its council, from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624, together with an elaborate and learned introduction by Miss Susan Myra Kingsbury, now professor of social economy in Bryn Mawr College, and a list prepared by her of additional documents illustrative of the company's history from the date of its chartering until after its dissolution by the Crown and the consequent conclusion of its business. These documents, 764 in number, are listed, with bibliographical references as to their sources, in the section of Miss Kingsbury's first volume (pp. 119–205) entitled "List of Records." The project of publication formed at the time when those volumes were issued contemplated the printing, in additional volumes, of the documents thus listed, or of all those among them that had any historical significance. Their texts are now to be presented, in two volumes num- bered III, IV, of The Records of the Virginia Company of London. The texts have been prepared by Miss Kingsbury with great care and accuracy. The first 273 of the documents arranged for publication are presented in the present volume. A nearly equal number, completing the series, will be presented in Volume IV, now in the printer's hands. The two volumes will constitute an addition of great magni- tude, and of the highest interest, to the materials for the early history of Virginia, and their preparation, distinctly a labor of love on the part of Miss Kingsbury, places all future students of that history under a heavy debt of gratitude to their accomplished editor. He?bert Putnam, Librarian of Congress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preface The documents contained in Volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia Company of London are original papers, official and other, of the company or relating to it. While the Court Book of the Virginia Company, published as Volumes I and II of this series, presents minutes of the meetings of the corporation, the succeeding volumes contain materials that vivify its decisions and decrees, explain the difficulties met and overcome by that redoubtable group of adventurers, reveal the petty jeal- ousies of the administrators, and especially record the controversy between the company and the Crown that resulted in the dissolution of the corporation and the creation of the first crown colony of Great Britain. Four official sets of records are herein printed or cited. Two are published in full. One set is the original papers contained in the volume, now preserved in the Library of Congress, which has long been referred to as "Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III." One set embodies records of action in law courts by the company or against the company. They are taken from the records of the various British courts and were found in the Public Record Office. Two sets are not here included as originally planned. They have been published in full since this series was begun. One is the "Courte Booke" of the colony, February 4, 1622/23, through February 9, 1632/33. It is now printed under the title "Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia," edited by Dr. H. L. McIlwaine (Richmond, Va., 1924). The other set of documents has been published in the "Acts of the Privy Council, Colonial", volume I (London, 1908). Some actions of the council that concerned the Virginia Company of London are not to be found in that publication. They are therefore here printed. The collection called the Sackville Papers, dis- cussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I, page 114, was, by the courtesy of the third Lord Sackville, examined by Prof. A. Percival Newton, of the University of London, and the documents relating to Virginia were printed in 1922 in the American Historical Review, Volume XXVII, pages 493 to 538 and 738 to 765. Those bearing dates earlier than 1623 are not here reprinted. Included in this volume are manuscripts from two collections that are unique. The "Smyth of Nibley" papers give the history of a single settlement, called Smyth's (or Smith's) Hundred, that is typical of the various hundreds of the colony. They extend from February 3, 1618/19, to August 1, 1622, inclusive. These papers are all in the New York Public Library. The "Ferrar Papers," on the other hand, now belong- ing to Magdalene College, Cambridge University, are a veritable gold mine; their unique value is discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I. They supply a vast amount of information through the correspondence between the colony and individual planters of the colony and Sir Edwin Sandys, Nicholas Ferrar, and John Ferrar, and also between Sir Edwin Sandys and the other officials of the company. Only a few documents are official, including two reports from the council in Virginia, a record of a Somers Islands court, and some less impor- tant items of this type. The first paper bears the date June 8, 1617, and the last November 1, 1624. But only a few go beyond midsummer of 1622. On the other hand, the "Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III," do not begin until August 12, 1621, but continue throughout the life of the com- pany. They differ in character from the Smyth of Nibley Papers and the Ferrar Papers. As stated above, they record official acts of the council in Virginia and include commissions, proclamations, orders, laws, letters to and from the council in London, and petitions to the Governor and council in Virginia. Communications between the company and the King or the privy council, and some letters to and from the governor and council of the colony, were spread on the minutes of the company, and therefore appear in Volumes I and II, of this series. They are not reproduced in Volumes III and IV, even though the original documents are found in the other collections. All documents here published are discussed at length in the Introduction to Vol- umes I and II of this series. Practically every paper indicated as to be included in the series by the star affixed in the "List of Records" that appears in the Introduction to Volume I is here printed. Two documents (List of Records No. 70 and No. 153) could not be found, and it has proved impossible to secure a copy of No. 12. Fifty-seven documents dating earlier than April 28, 1619, when the records in Volume I begin, are printed in this volume. They include all records that had not heretofore been known or published by Alexander Brown, the Virginia Magazine of History, or other reliable works on the early history of Virginia. Perhaps the most important documents found by the editor that are here included are the "Instruc?ons Orders and Constitu?ons to Sr Thomas Gates knight Governor of Virginia" of May, 1609, and the "Instructions orders and constitu?ons ... to ... Sr Thomas West knight Lo: La Warr," 1609/10, by the Virginia Council. These are the first instructions given by the competent authority to a British colony. Source material for the history of the company through the year 1622 is presented in this volume. March 22, 1622, saw the frightful massacre of colonists by the Indians. The story of that tragedy, the efforts for recovery, and the beginning of the reestablished colony conclude this volume. The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, chief of the division of manuscripts in the Library of Congress, for his painstaking care in reading the proof to the original documents of the "Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III," and to some of the photostats of material in England, and also for his constant watchfulness in seeing the documents through the press. To Marian Carter Anderson the editor is indebted for her valuable and expert assistance in preparing much of the manuscript, and especially in the difficult reading of practically all of the proof. Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index of Volume III, and to her the editor wishes to express gratitude for the complete and accurate contribution she has made to the usefulness of the documents in historical research. A part of the expense for reading the proof and the cost of preparing the index were met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council. Susan M. Kingsbury. June 30, 1932.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Records of the Virginia Company of London I. A Justification for Planting Virginia Before 1609 Tanner manuscripts, XCIII, folio 200 (old folio 352) Document in the Bodleian Library, Oxford University List of Records No. 1 A Iustification for planting in Virginia It was proposed;1 1 Blank space in the manuscript. that some forme of writinge in way of Iusti- fication of our plantation might be conceiued, and pass, (though not by publique authorytye) into many handes. The motion seemed to have these inducements. 1.First, yt it mought give adventurers, a clearnes and satisfaction, for ye Iustice of ye action, and so encourage them, and draw on others. 2.That ye Spaniard might out of this intimation reasonably collect, yt wee vnderstood our owne case to be such, yt the state would neyther feare, nor be ashamed to proceed in yt persecution ther of, if any Course should bee held agaynst yt: and yt this Iustification of our owne title, would deterr, or at least retard ye Spaniard from suddayne attempting vs. And though it were sayd then; That this was a lowe and impotent way to convey it by such a close scedvle; yet [xx] seemt, not to want example of other things carried in yt manner: and yet to haue wrought ye same effect, as a more publique declaration of ye state could doe. They wch differed from him had these motiues; 1.That it conduc'd not to his first hope of encouraging, or inciting adventurers: for, they in this poynt needed it not, nor require yt. That ther is much of a Confession, in euery unnessary Apology: yt to moue scruple, especially of Conscience, wher ther is afore quiettnes and no doubting rather shakes and deterrs, then settles, or confirmes. And yt already some of best Iudgement, startle vpon ye first noyse of yt. That 2.That ye Spaniard hath already seene more publique, and authentique testemonyes, of ye States good affection to ye Iourny, by establishing it vnder ye great seale: and by ye seconding, and Iterating supplyes, then this way can giue him: Besides it is more then probable yt his Ambassador will forthwith expos- tulate wth his Matie about this writing, and then it is not conceau'd how far his Matie wilbe pleasd to avow yt, wch may intimate disavowing: Besides yt it seemed not to worke these good effects wch were pretended, it hath these euident dangers in yt. 1It will rather hasten ye Spaniards rage, then retard yt; because he will see it, to grow euery day harder for him to defeat vs. 2It will rayse vndisputably, two pen-adversaries of diuers sortes: The first are perfect Spaniards, who will defend yt title vpon ye Donation, of Alexander, wch is so grounded vpon the principles of theyr religion yt some of ther best authors haue pronounced yt Heresy to doubt yt. And wee, (though wee want not inducinge and Convenient arguments from God, and Nature and Nations) yet haue no such convincinge and obliga- tory * * * * * * irs,1 1 The manuscript is so torn as to be illegible. especially towards them, and their ground. [2] The second sort wilbe neutrall writers, but of Spanish affections: who because they cannott thereby hurt ye Spaniard already established there, but may slacken vs, if they can cast scruples into our Conscience §2 2 See note at the end of the document. will wright agaynst ye lawfullnes of plantation in these, as well by ye Spaniard, as by vs, or any, wch must necessaryly grow to disputution of so much intricasy, perplexity, and replication, as shall conduce vnto theyr end of slackning ws. if no farther. For when at first discouery of these partes, ye Spaniard did subiect ye Consideration of yt to Casuists, and Confessors, it became so indeterminable, yt he was forced to resolue roundly vpon ye worst way, least he should haue none, to prosecute ye Indians as Barbar's, and therby Naturally slaues. When after 50 yeares his Fryars declyn'd him from yt seuere and vnIust course, and he labourd by men of all learninge to prouide himselfe of a more acceptable title, all ye reasons, wch were prepard to him, by men of discourse, from ye Indians transgressing ye Law of Nature; from his [ciuilians] for their denying com- merce: from his Canonists, by ye Donation: and from his Deuines, by preparation of religion, were so incohœrent and so resisted by one another, as many bookes written in his defence, were suppressed in his owne Kyngdome, and at this day, from all ye authors extant, in yt pointe, (though they admitt ye purpose of ye donation, yet departing from ye very lettre) can be gathered for him no title, of Dominion or property, but only a Magistracy, and Empire, by wch he is allowed to remoue such impediments, as they had agaynst ye knowledge of Religion. Because therfore, we shalbe putt to defend our title, not yet publiquely quarreled, not only comparatiuely to be as good as ye Spaniards (wch we doubt not is easy enough, when it shalbe impugned,) (agaynst wch not wth standinge to gouerne them, ther arises ye Donation, and yt wee seek Dominion) but absolutely to be good agaynst ye Naturall people: some thought it better to abstayne from this vnnessisary way of proui- cation, and reserue ourselues to ye defensiue part, when they shall offer any thing agaynst vs: wch will more easyly and satisfactoryly be donne, and we are like enough to bee too soone putt to yt by them, when they see ye proportion and forwardnes of this present supply. § if ye first way fayle (because I doubt not of ouerthrowing ye Dona- tion) then this will follow, wch if we could mayntayne yet wth such subtelty of distinction, as ye merchant wilbe vncapable of satisfaction therby1 1 This paragraph is written in the margin. § [Indorsed:] ?Reasons against publishing the King's title to Virginea.?</field>

A Letter to the Mayor of Salisbury1 1 This document is printed in the New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 31, page 21, 1877, in an article entitled "Notes on American History No. XIII, The Virginia Lotterie," by the Reverend Edward D. Neill, President of Macalester College, Minneapolis, Minn., who describes it as "among the records of the city of Salisbury." December 19, 1616 List of Records No. 37 Whereas the Royal, most excellent Majesty, under his great seal of Eng- land, authorizes the Virginia Company for the setting up of a lottery for the benefit of that Plantation. We by virtue of said grant do earnestly pray and desire you Mr Mayor, Mr Recorder, and the Aldermen of the City your brethren to be assistants to our deputies Gabriel Barber and Lott Peere being also members of our Company, to whom, for the approved trial we have of their care and sufficiency, we have committed the management of a running lottery to be kept in that, your City of Salisbury, requesting so much more earnestly, your furtherance therein, for that it is for so good a work as the upholding of that Plantation which we have now great hope and greater than before, shall stand and flourish to the honor and benefit of the realm. And although we are well satisfied of these men's integrity, and have already given them an oath for their just and true dealing in this employ- ment, with all men, yet to Satisfy you and the world in the most exact manner that may, we desire you to receive the key here enclosed, of the prizes and to see them mingling of them with the blanks, and appoint one or two of your City, men of care to lock up and open the same every morning and evening, and permit a child who shall be allowed for his pains, to draw out the lots for all that adventure, as shall those we employ not be suspected of popularity who shall only pay out those prizes that shall be drawn, and yourselves be encouraged if they shall so desire to give them your testimony of the said proceedings. In so doing both ourselves shall have great cause to thank you and the Plantation to acknowledge your love and kindness towards the same. And so we bid you very hearty farewell.

Whereas upon the returne of Sir Thomas Dale Knight, (Marshall of Virginia) the Treasurer, Councell and Company of the same, have been throughly informed and assured of the good estat of that Colony, and how by the blessing of God and good government, there is great plentie and increase of Corne, Cattell, Goates, Swine, and such other provisions, necessary for the life and sustenance of man; And that there wants nothing for the setling of that Christian Plantation, but more hands to gather and returne those commodities which may bring profit to the Adventurers, and encouragement to others: And whereas thereupon the Company hath given a commission to Captaine Samuel Argol to be the present Governour of that Colonie, who hath undertaken to transport and carry thither a certain number of men, upon his owne charge, and the charge of other his friends that joyne him in that Voyage; in which divers men of good qualitie have resolved to adventure, and to goe thither themselves in person, and to carry with them their wives, their children and their families, whereby in short time (by the favor and assistance of Almighty God) that goode worke may be brought to good perfection, by the division and setting out of lands to every particular person, the settling of trade, and returne of Commodities to the contentment and satisfaction of all Well affected Subjects, which eyther love the advancement of Religion, or the honour and welfare of this kingdome: Wee his Majesties Treasurer, Councell and Company for the same Plantation, have thought good to declare and make knowne to all men by these presents, that wee have resolved to give free leave and license to any who are now remaining in Virginia, at his will and pleasure to returne home into England, which liberty wee doe likewise grant and confirme unto all those which hereafter from time to time shall go thither in person, without any other restraint, there to aske leave of the Governour (for the time being) to depart. And therefore if any man be disposed to send for any of his friends from thence, he may hereby take notice, that he hath full power and meanes to doe eyther of them at his good descretion.

      <field name="fulltext">XXIV. John Rolf. A Letter to Sir Edwin Sandys June 8, 1617 Ferrar Papers Document in Magdalene College, Cambridge List of Records No. 40 Honored Sr The many courtysies and favors I haue receaued at yor hands shall (during my life) bynd me to you in my best service: and so often as occasion shall offer itself, I will not forgett to express the same. At this ?sent I haue breifly noted to you, in what estate wee found the Colony; and of or speedy passage hether. Upon the 10th of Aprill wee departed from Plymouth, and the next daie lost sight of the Lyzard, having the Treasurer in or Company, wch kept wth us about 3 weeks: at what tyme we lost her in foggy weather wch contynued after 20. daies, in wch tyme wee hadd hardly a daie to make a certeyne obseruacon. The same daie month (according to the daie of the weeke) that we lost the lands end, we fell wth the dangerous shoulder of Cape Codd, runnying in one glass from 20 to 5 and 4 fathom water, not able to see (by reason of the thyck fogg) halfe a Cables length from the shipp. Here wee ancored all night, and the next daie wth no small ?ill gott cleere of them. From heare wee shaped a Course along the Coast of Virginia, keeping our lead all the waie, wch was or best guide having so good a Pylott as or Gournr, the fogg still contynuyng, and arryved at Point Comfort ye 15th of May, all or Company being in good health, only one man dyed, who was sickly before we came from England. Thus it pleased God to bless vs wth a speedy and ?sperous passage, yea hadd wee not bene troubled, to free or selves from those showlds, and wth mysty weather, we hadd assuredly (by Gods help) arryued in Virginia in a months space. The next daie befo Two, or 3 daies after arriued Captaine Martyne wth the pynnace all his men in good health to increase or ioyes. Wee found the Colony (God be thanked) in good estate and inioyng a firmer Peace and more plenty, howeur in buildings, fortyfica?ons, and for want of boats, much ruyned and greate want. Or ?sent Gournr at James towne is repayring and making straight what he fyndeth decayed and crooked, to whose good indeavors and noble disposicon or Colony hath bene, is, and wilbe much indebted. All men cheerefully labor about their grounds, their harts and hands not ceasing from worke, though many have scarce ragges to cour their naked bodyes. English wheate, barly, Indyan Corne, Tobacco greate plenty in the ground. Hemp and flax seed distributed to most men by the Gournr and is putt into the ground: nothing neglected, wch any waies may be avayleable to advance the Colony, and to give incouragemt to yorself and the rest of the Hoble Company. The Cattle thrive and increase exceeding well, the ploughes yerely worke and oxen are plentyfull. The Indyans very loving, and willing to parte wth their childeren. My wives death is much lamented; my childe much desyred, when it is of better strength to endure so hard a passage, whose life much greately extinguisheth the sorrow of her loss, saying all must die, but tis enough that her childe liueth. I know not how I may be censured for leaving my childe behind me, nor what hazard I may incurr of yor noble loue and other of my best frends. At my departure from Gravesend (nothwthstanding I was ymportuned) I hadde no such intent. But in or short passage to Plymouth, in smothe water, I found such feare and hazard of his health (being not fully recouered of his sicknes) and lack of attendance (for they who looked to him hadd need of nurses themselues, and indeed in all or passage ?ved no better) that by the advise of Captaine Argall, and diuers who also foresaw the danger and knew the inconvenyence hereof ?swaded me to what I did. At Plymouth I found Sr Lewes Stukely so nobly mynded toward me, that he most earnestly intreated to haue the keping of him, vntill my Brother tooke further order. I thought good to rectyfie you hereof, and desyre yor self and all the Company, for those causes, to hold me excused, if in their iudgemts I may be censured to haue erred herein. A firme contynuance of yor favor and love toward me I daylie praie for. And although greate is my loss, and much my sorrow to be depriued of so greate a comfort, and hopes I hadd to effect my zealous inten?ons and desyres as well in others, as in her whose soule (I doubt not) resteth in eternall happynes: yet such temperance haue I learned in ?sperity, and patience in adversitie, that I will as ioyfully receiue euill, as good at the hand of God: and assuredly trust that Hee, who hath ?served my childe, euen as a brand snatched out of the fier, hath further blessings in store for me, and will give me strength and courrage to vndertake any religious and charitable ymploymt, yorself and the Hoble Company shall co?and me, and wch in duty I am bound to doe. Now my last request at this tyme is to yorself, whom I haue found a father to me, my wife and childe, and will eur acknowledg it wth the best gratefullnes my hart and penn can offer, that you would be pleased as you haue begun and ben the one of ye principall instrumts herein, to contynue yor noble favor and furtherance even for my childe sake, being the lyving ashes of his deceased Mother, and that you will still be the meanes, that yor owne free lib'ality and all others by yor ?curemt in obtayning so liberall a stipend, may not die wth my wife, but contynue for her childes advancemt, wch will the better inhable myself and him hereafter to undertake and execute what may be co?aunded and requyred from us, Thus refering myself to yor approued wisedom craving ?don for my boldnes, desyring no longer to liue, then when I shall cease from studying and indeavoring to bend my best strength to ?seuer in this Accon for the advancemt of the hour of or God, King and Cuntry, wth my humble remembrance to yorself and yor noble and virtuous Lady whose requests I will not forgett to satisfie wherein I may when tyme shall serve I take my leave and rest At yor command ever ready Jo: Rolf James Towne this 8 of June 1617.

(2) Randolph MSS., III, pp. 46–150 Document in (1) Library of Congress, (2) Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Va. List of Records No. 87 The Treasurer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London for the first Colony in Virginia. To Captain George Yeardly Elect Governor of Virginia and to the Council of State there being or to be Greeting. Our former cares and Endeavours have been chiefly bent to the procuring and sending people to plant in Virginia so to prepare a way and to lay a foundation whereon A flourishing State might in process of time by the blessing of Almighty God be raised. Now our trust being that under the Government of you Captain Yeardly with the advice and Assistance of the said Council of State such public provisions of Corn and Cattle will again be raised as may draw on those Multitudes who in great Abundance from diverse parts of the Realm were preparing to remove thither if by the late decay of the said public Store their hopes had not been made frustrate and their minds thereby clene discouraged We have thought good to bend our present cares and Consultations according to the Authority granted unto us from his Majesty under his great Seal to the setling there of A laudable form of Government by Majestracy and just Laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people there inhabiting like as we have already done for the well ordering of our Courts here and of our Officers and accions for the behoof of that plantation And because our intent is to Ease all the Inhabitants of Virginia forever of all taxes and public burthens as much as may be and to take away all occasion of oppression and corruption we have thought fit to begin (according to the laudable Example of the most famous Common Wealthes both past and present) to alot and lay out A Convenient portion of public lands for the maintenance and support as well of Magis- tracy and officers as of other public charges both here and there from time to time arising We therefore the said treasurer and Company upon a solemn treaty and resolution and with the advice consent and assent of his Majesties Council here of Virginia being Assembled in A great and general Court of the Council and Company of Adventurers for Virginia require you the said Governor and Council of Estate to put in Execution with all convenient Speed a former order of Our Courts (which had been commended also to Captain Argal at his making Deputy Governor) for the laying and seting out by bounds and metes of three thousand Acres of land in the best and most convenient place of the territory of James town in Virginia and next adjoining to the said town to be the seat and land of the Governor of Virginia for the time being and his Successors and to be called by the name of the Governors Land which Governors Land shall be of the freed grounds by the common labor of the people sent thither at the Companies Charges And of the Lands formerly conquer'd or purchased of the Paspeheies and of other grounds next adjoining In like sort we require you to set and lay out by bounds and Metes other three thousand Acres of good land within the territory of James town which shall be con- venient and in such place or places as in your discretions you shall find meet which latter three thousand Acres shall be and so called the Com- panies Land And we require you Captain Yeardley that immediately upon your arrival you take unto you the Guard assigned to Captain Argal at his going Deputy Governor or sithence by him assumed to be of your guard [for the better defence] of your Government and that as well the said guard as also fifty other persons now sent and transported with you you place as tennants on the said Governors land and that all other persons heretofore transported at the Common Charge of the Company since the coming away of Sr Thomas Dale Knight late Deputy Governor be placed as Tennants on the said Companies Lands And we will and ordain that all the said Tennants on the Governors and Companies Lands shall occupy the same to the half part of the profits of the said Lands so as the one half to be and belong to the said Tennants themselves and the other half respectively to the said Governor and to us the said Treasurer and Com- pany and our Successors And we further will and ordain that of the half profits arising out of the said Companies Lands and belonging to us the said Treasurer and Company the one Moiety be imploied for the Enter- tainment of the said Councel of Estate there residing and of other public officers of the general Colony and plantation (besides the Governor) accord- ing to the proportion as hereafter we shall Express and in the mean time as you in your discretions shall think meet And the other moiety be carefully gathered kept and ship'd for England for the public use of us the said Treasurer and Company and our Successors And we will and ordain that out of the half profits of the said Companies Lands to us belong- ing one fifth part be deducted and alotted for the Wages of the Bailiffs and other Officers which shall have the oversight and Government of the said Tenants and Lands and the dividing gathering keeping or shiping of the particular moiety of the profits belonging Either to the said Council and Officer there or to us the said treasurer and Company and our Succes- sors as aforesaid Provided alwaies that out of the said Companies Land A sufficient part be exempted and reserved for the securing and Wintering of all sorts of Cattle which are or shall be the public Stock and Store of the said Company And forasmuch as our intent is to Establish one Equal [blank of several lines] Plantations, whereof we shall speak afterwards, be reduced into four Cities or Burroughs Namely the cheif City called James town Charles City Henrico and the Burrough of Kiccowtan And that in all these foresaid Cities or Burroughs the ancient Adventurers and Planters which [were] transported thither with intent to inhabit at their own costs and charges before the coming away of Sr Thomas Dale Knight and have so continued during the space of three years shall have upon a first division to be afterward by us augmented one hundred Acres of land for their personal Adventure and as much for every single share of twelve pound ten Shillings paid [for such share] allotted and set out to be held by them their heirs and assigns forever And that for all such Planters as were brought thither at the Companies Charge to inhabit there before the com- ing away of the said Sr Thomas Dale after the time of their Service to the Company on the common Land agreed shall be expired there be set out One hundred Acres of Land for each of their personal Adventurers to be held by them their heirs and Assigns for ever. paying for every fifty Acres the yearly free Rent of one Shilling to the said treasurer and Company and their Successors at one Entire payment on the feast day of St Michael the archangel for ever And in regard that by the singular industry and virtue of the said Sr Thomas Dale the former difficulties and dangers were in greatest part overcome to the great ease and security of such as have been since that time transported thither We do therefore hereby ordain that all such persons as sithence the coming away of the said Sr Thomas Dale have at their own charges been transported thither to inhabit and so continued as aforesaid there be allotted and set out upon a first division fifty acres of land to them and their heirs for ever for their personal Adventure paying a free rent of one Shilling yearly in manner aforesaid And that all persons which since the going away of the said Sr Thomas Dale have been transported thither at the Companies charges or which here- after shall be so transported be placed as tenants on the Companies lands for term of seven years occupy the same to the half part of the profits as is abovesaid We therefore will and ordain that other three thousand Acres of Land be set out in the fields and territory of Charles City and other three thousand Acres of Land in the fields and territories of Henrico And other three thousand Acres of land in the fields and territory of Kiccowtan all which to be and be called the Companies lands and to be occupied by the Companies Tenants for half profits as afore said And that the profits belonging to the Company be disposed by their several moieties in the same manner as before set down touching the Companies lands in the territory of James town with like allowance to the Bailies and reservation of ground for the common Store of Cattle in those several places as is there set down And our will is that such of the Companies tenants as already inhabite in those several Cities or Burroughs be not removed to any other City or Burrough but placed on the Companies Lands belonging to those Cities or Burroughs where they now inhabite Provided alwaies that if any private person without fraud or injurious intent to the public at his own charges have freed any of the said Lands formerly appointed to the Governor he may continue and inhabite there till a valuable recompence be made him for his said Charges And we do hereby ordain that the Governors house in James town first built by Sr Thomas Gates Knight at the charges and by the Servants of the Company and since enlarged by others by the very same means be and continue for ever the Governors house any pretended undue Grant made by misinformation and not in a general and quarter Court to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding And to the intent that godly learned and painful Ministers may be placed there for the service of Almighty God &amp; for the spiritual benefit and comfort of the people We further will and ordain that in every of those Cities or Burroughs the several quantity of one hundred Acres of Land be set out in quality of Glebe land toward the maintenance of the several Ministers of the parishes to be there limited and for a further supply of their maintenance there be raised a yearly standing and certain contribution out of the profits growing or renuing within the several farmes of the said parish and so as to make the living of every Minister two hundred pounds Sterling ? annum or more as hereafter there shall be cause And for a further Ease to the Inhabitants of all taxes and Contributions for the Support and Entertainment of the particular magistrates and Officers and of other charges to the said Citys and Burroughs respectively belonging We likewise will and ordain that within the precincts or territories of the said Cities and Burroughs shall be set out and alotted the several Quantities of fifteen hundred Acres of Land to be the common Land of the said Citie Or Burrough for the uses aforesaid and to be known and called by the name of the Cities Or Bur- roughs Land And Whereas by a special Grant and licence from his Majesty a general Contribution over this Realm hath been made for the building and planting of a college for the training up of the Children of those Infidels in true Religion moral virtue and Civility and for other godly uses We do therefore according to a former Grant and order hereby ratifie confirm and ordain that a convenient place be chosen and set out for the planting of a University at the said Henrico in time to come and that in the mean time preparation be there made for the building of the said College for the Children of the Infidels according to such Instructions as we shall deliver And we will and ordain that ten thousand acres partly of the Lands they impaled and partly of other Land within the territory of the said Henrico be alotted and set out for the endowing of the said University and College with convenient possessions Whereas also we have heretofore by order of Court in Consideration of the long good and faithful Service done by you Captain George Yeardley in our said Colony and plantation of Vir- ginia and in reward thereof as also in regard of two single shares in money paid into our treasury granted unto you the said Captain Yeardley all that parcel of Marsh ground called Weynock and also one other peice and parcel of Land adjoining to the same Marsh called by the Natives Konwan one parcel whereof abutteth upon a Creek there called Mapscock towards the East and the other parcel thereof towards a creek there called Queens Creek on the West and extendeth in breadth to landward from the head of the said Creek called Mapscock up to the head of the said Creek called Queens Creek (which creek called Queens Creek is opposite to that point there which is now called the Tobacco point and abutteth south upon the River and North to the Landward) all which several Lands are or shall be henceforward accounted to be lying within the territory of the said Charles City and exceed not the quantity of two thousand and two hundred acres We therefore the said Treasurer and Company do hereby again grant ratifie and Confirm unto you the said Captain George Yeardley the said several Grounds and Lands to have and to hold the said Grounds and Lands to you the said Captain George Yeardley your heirs and Assigns for Ever And for the better Encouragement of all sorts of necessary and laudable trades to be set up and exercised within the said four Cities or Burroughs We do hereby ordain that if any artizans or tradesmen shall be desirous rather to follow his particular Art or trade then to be imploied in husbandry or other rural business It shall be lawful for you the said Governor and Councel to alot and set out within any of the precincts aforesaid One dwell- ing house with four Acres of Land adjoining and held in fee simple to every said tradsman his heirs and Assigns for ever upon condition that the said tradesman his heirs and Assigns do continue and exercise his trade in the said house paying only a free rent of four pence by the year to us the said Treasurer and Company and our Successors at the feast of St Michael the Archangel for ever And touching all other particular Plantations set out or like to be set out in convenient Multitudes either by divers of the ancient Adventurers Associating themselves together (as the Society of Smiths hundred and Martins hundred) or by some ancient Adventurer or Planter associating others unto him (as the plantation of Captain Samuel Argall and Captain John Martin and that by the late Lord La warre advanced) or by some new Adventurers joining themselves under one head (as the plantation of Christopher Lawne Gentleman and others now in providing) Our Intent being according to the Rules of Justice and good government to alot unto every one his due yet so as neither to breed Dis- turbance to the Right of others nor to interrupt the good form of Govern- ment intended for the benefit of the people and strength of the Colony We do therefore will and ordain that of the said particular plantations none be placed within five Miles of the said former Cities and Boroughs And that if any man out of his own presumption or pleasure without special direction from us hath heretofore done otherwise a convenient time be Assigned him and then by your Discretions to remove to Some farther place by themselves to be chosen with the Allowance and Assent of the Governor for the time being and the Council of Estate And that the Inhabitants of the said City or Burrough too near unto which he or they were placed make him and them a valuable recompense for their Charges and expence of time in freeing of Grounds and building within those pre- cincts In like sort we ordain that no latter particular plantation shall at any time hereafter be seated within ten Miles of a former We also will and ordain that no particular plantation be or shall be placed straglingly in divers places to the weakening of them but be united together in one seat and territory that so also they may be incorporated by us into one body corporate and live under Equal and like Law and orders with the rest of the Colony We will and ordain also for the preventing of all fraud in abusing of our grants contrary to the intent and just meaning of them That all such person or persons as have procured or hereafter shall procure grants from us in general Words unto themselves and their Associates or to like Effect shall within one year after the date hereof deliver up to us in writing under their hands and seals as also unto you the said Governor and Councel what be or were the names of those their first Associates And if they be of the Adventurers of us the Company which have paid into our treasury money for their shares that then they express in that their writing for how many shares they join in the said particular Plantation to the End a Due proportion of Land may be set out unto them and we the said Treasurer and Company be not defrauded of Our due And if they be not of the Adventurers of the Company which have paid into our treasury money for their shares yet are gone to inhabit there and so continue for three years there be allotted and set out fifty Acres of Land for every such person paying a free rent of twelve pence the year in manner aforesaid and All such persons having been planted there since the coming away of Sr Thomas Dale And forasmuch as we understand that certain persons having procured such Grants in general Words to them- selves and their Associates or to like Effect have corruptly of late endeav- oured for gain and Worse respects to draw many of the ancient Planters of the said four Cities or Burroughs to take grants also of them and thereby to become associated unto them with intent also by Such means to over- strengthen their party And thereupon have adventured on divers Enor- mous Courses tending to the great hurt and hindrance of the Colony Yea and have also made Grants of like Association to Masters of Ships and Mariners never intending there to inhabit, thereby to defraud his Majesty of the Customs due unto him We to remedy and prevent such unlawful and greedy Courses tending also directly to faction and sedition Do hereby ordain that it shall not be lawful for the Grantees of such Grants to asso- ciate to any other unto them then such as were their Associates from the first time of the said grants without express licence of us the sd Treasurer and Company in a great General and Quarter Court under our seal ob- tained And that all such after or under Grants of Association made or to be made by the said Grantees shall be to all intents and purposes utterly void And for as much as we understand that divers particular persons (not members of our Company) with their Companies have provided or are in providing to remove into Virginia with intent (as appeareth) by way of Association to shroud themselves under the General Grants last aforesaid which may tend to the Great disorder of our Colony and hinder- ance of the good Government which we desire to Establish We do there- fore hereby ordain that all such persons as of their own Voluntary Will and authority shall remove into Virginia without any Grant from us in a great general and Quarter Court in writing under our seal shall be deemed (as they are) to be occupiers of our Land that is to say of the Common Lands of us the said Treasurer and Company And shall yearly pay unto us for the said occupying of our Land one full fourth part of the profits thereof till such time as the same shall be granted unto them by us in manner aforesaid And touching all such as being Members of our Com- pany and Adventurers by their monies paid into our Treasury shall either in their own person or by their agents Tennants or Servants set up in Virginia any such particular Plantation tho with the privity of us the said Treasurer and Company yet without any grant in Writing made in our said General Quarter Courts as is requisite We will and ordain that the said Adventurers or Planters shall within two year after the arrival of them or their Company in Virginia procure our grant in writing to be made, in Our General Quarter Court and under our seal, of the Lands by them possessed or occupied or from thenceforth shall be deemed only Occupiers of the Common Land As is aforesaid till such times as our said grant shall be obtained We also not more intending the reformation of the Errors of the said1 2 This memorandum was added by John Ferrar. than for advancing of them into good Courses and therein to assist them by all good means We further hereby ordain that to all such of the said particular1 as shall truly fully observe the orders Afore and hereafter specified there be alotted and set out over and above Our former Grants One hundred Acres of glebe land for the Minister of every1 and fifteen hundred Acres of Burough Land for the public use of the said Plantation Not intending yet hereby either to abridge or enlarge such grant of glebe or common Land as shall be made in any of our grants in writing to any of the said particular planta- tions We also will and ordain that the like proportion of maintenance out of the1 and profits of the Earth be made for the several Ministers of the said particular Plantations as have been before set down for the Ministers of the said former Cities and burroughs We will and ordain that the Governor for the time being and the said Council of Estate do justly perform or cause to be performed all such grants Covenants and Articles as have or shall be in writing in Our great and general Quarter Courts to any of the said particular Plantations Declaring all other grants of Lands in Virginia not made in one of our great and general Quarter Courts by force of his Majesties Letters patents to be void And to the End aforesaid we will and ordain that all our grants in writing under our seal made in our great and general Quarter Courts be Entered into your records to be kept there in Virginia Yet directly forbiding that a Charter of Land granted to Captain Samuel Argal and his Associates bearing date the twentieth of March 1616 be entered in your Records or otherwise at all respected forasmuch as the same was obtained by slight and cunning And afterwards upon suffering him to go Governor of Virginia was by his own voluntary act left in our Custody to be cancelled upon Grant of a new Charter which1 1 Blank

But being I have now well weyghed and considered that I may be able to doe the Country as good servise, yea and being best acquainted with my owne disposition, better service then yf I did continew Governour, and that in many respects wch your selfe Sowthampton Hundreth and allso the whole Company shall fynd god willing, yett wherein for the ?ticulars I will not boast, till I shall have ?formed th?, in execution whereof I shall not stick to spend my Lyfe for the effecting of such matters for the Publike good, I doe now therefor beseech you Sir since my servise to the Country shall be no less but more, that you would be pleased my tyme of 3 years being expired to give your ffurtherance for this gent Capt Thorpe to be Chossen and established Governour of Virginia in my stead, wherein I know and am well assurd you shall doe a most worthy worke.

I would not have douted to haue bought too better vessels with halfe the prys of that tobako, though perhaps he myght find but a bad markett for want of a good Chapman [2a] yett the gent shall fynd me ready to doe him any pleasure I may to give him helpe in his transportation att any tyme whilse I shall vse hir, though I know he cannott Chuse but make more mony of the tobako then they both cost him, and had they come home his they would have bin as dead a comodity as the Pinas was being myne, but he is a man as I conceave that wicheth well to the plantation and doth entend himselfe to come over, wherefor for his encoragment I doubt not s but in his voyage to pleasure him and thus much yf you please you may certify him, This bearer Capt Rostingam my wyfes Nephew, though yong yett of good worth and discretion as by experience had of him here in Virginia I may speake, him I most humbly recomend vnto your Noble ffavor beseeching you to afford vnto him your wonted courtesy, and your best assistance in all Lawfull causes wherein he shall have ocassion to entreat your helpe, herein as in all other your great ffavors shewed me I shall §be§ most thankfull vnto you for any ffavor shewed him as yf the same were Imediatly to my selfe, and doe not doubt but yf you shall please to give him admitans into your ffavor but that in some measur he will deserve it, and Manger all Malitious false forestalled reportes acquitt himselfe and win your aprobation, but of such reports I hope you have had of late good expe- rience, therefor I will not troble you with any more thereof, As for Mr Pory I have formerly written some thing to you concerning him, and doe not doubt but you have well considered it, wherein I Justified him I had my reasons for it and I know you will aprove them, and I beleeve you doe not conceave me so weake as not to see having lyght given me by so good a watchman as your selfe, the tyme I hope will not be long but you shall see how far I have beleeved and how I trust him, your words you spake to me a littell before my de?ture have never since de?ted frõ me and by experience I have found your Judgment not deceaved, neither have I bin slak in making vse of it, but nessitty hath no law and better a bad foole then none or worse.

List of Records No. 116 Proceedings of the Virginia Assembly, 1619 A Reporte of the manner of proceeding in the General assembly convented at James citty in Virginia, July 30, 1619, consisting of the Governor, the Counsell of Estate and two Burgesses elected out of eache Incorporation and Plantation, and being dissolved the 4th of August next ensuing. First. Sir George Yeardley, Knight, Governor and Captaine general of Virginia, having sent his sumons all over the Country, as well to invite those of the Counsell of Estate that were absent as also for the election of Burgesses, there were chosen and appeared. For James citty Captaine William Powell, Ensigne William Spense. For Charles citty Samuel Sharpe, Samuel Jordan. For the citty of Henricus Thomas Dowse, John Polentine. For Kiccowtan Captaine William Tucker, William Capp. For Martin Brandon-Capt. John Martin's Plantation Mr. Thomas Davis, Mr. Robert Stacy. For Smythe's hundred Captain Thomas Graves, Mr. Walter Shelley. For Martin's hundred Mr. John Boys, John Jackson. For Argall's guiffe Mr. Pawlett, Mr. Gourgaing. For Flowerdieu hundred Ensigne Roffingham, Mr. Jefferson. For Captain Lawne's plantation Captain Christopher Lawne, Ensigne Washer. For Captaine Warde's plantation Captaine Warde, Lieutenant Gibbes. The most convenient place we could finde to sitt in was the Quire of the Churche Where Sir George Yeardley, the Governor, being sett downe in his accustomed place, those of the Counsel of Estate sate nexte him on both hands excepte onely the Secretary then appointed Speaker, who sate right before him, John Twine, clerke of the General assembly, being placed nexte the Speaker, and Thomas Pierse, the Sergeant, standing at the barre, to be ready for any service the Assembly shoulde comaund him. But forasmuche as men's affaires doe little prosper where God's service is neglected, all the Burgesses tooke their places in the Quire till a prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the Minister, that it would please God to guide and sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and the good of this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the intente that as we had begun at God Almighty, so we might proceed with awful and due respecte towards the Lieutenant, our most gratious and dread Soveraigne, all the Burgesses were intreatted to retyre themselves into the body of the Churche, which being done, before they were fully admitted, they were called in order and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it) tooke the oathe of Supremacy, and entred the Assembly. At Captaine Warde the Speaker tooke exception, as at one that without any Comis- sion or authority had seatted himselfe either upon the Companies, and then his Plantation would not be lawfull, or on Captain Martin's lande, and so he was but a limbe or member of him, and there could be but two Burgesses for all. So Captaine Warde was comanded to absent himselfe till such time as the Assembly had agreed what was fitt for him to doe. After muche debate, they resolved on this order following: An order concluded by the General assembly concerning Captaine Warde, July 30th, 1619, at the opening of the said Assembly. At the reading of the names of the Burgesses, Exception was taken against Captaine Warde as having planted here in Virginia without any authority or comission from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in Englande. But considering he had bene at so great chardge and paines to augmente this Colony, and adventured his owne person in the action, and since that time had brought home a good quantity of fishe, to relieve the Colony by waye of trade, and above all, because the Comission for authorising the General Assembly admitteth of two Burgesses out of every plantation without restrainte or exception, Upon all these considerations, the As- sembly was contented to admitt of him and his Lieutenant (as members of their body and Burgesses) into their society. Provided, that the said Captaine Warde with all expedition, that is to saye between this and the nexte general assembly (all lawful impediments excepted), should procure from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in England a comission lawfully to establish and plant himselfe and his Company as the Chieffs of other Plantations have done. And in case he doe neglect this he is to stande to the censure of the nexte general assembly. To this Captaine Warde, in the presence of us all, having given his consente and undertaken to per- forme the same was, together with his Lieutenant, by voices of the whole Assembly first admitted to take the oath of Supremacy, and then to make up their number and to sitt amongst them. This being done, the Governor himselfe alledged that before we proceeded any further it behooved us to examine whither it were fitt, that Captaine Martin's Burgesses shoulde have any place in the Assembly, forasmuche as he hath a clause in his Patente which doth not onely exempte him from that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders which the great charter saith are to extende over the whole Colony, but also from diverse such lawes as we must be enforced to make in the General Assembly. That clause is as followeth: Item. That it shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Captain John Martin, his heyers, executours and assignes to governe and comaunde all suche person or persons as at this time he shall carry over with him, or that shalbe sente him hereafter, free from any comaunde of the Colony, excepte it be in ayding and assisting the same against any forren or domestical enemy. Upon the motion of the Governor, discussed the same time in the assembly, ensued this order following: An order of the General Assembly touching a clause in Captain Martin's Patent at James Citty, July 30, 1619. After all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted into the house and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain Martin's Patent was produced by the Governor out of a Clause whereof it appeared that when the general assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for the whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole company and chuse whether they would obay the same or no. It was therefore ordered in Courte that the foresaid two Burgesses should withdraw themselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had made his personall appearance before them. At what time, if upon their motion, if he would be contente to quitte and give over that parte of his Patente, and contrary thereunto woulde submitte himselfe to the general forme of governement as all others did, that then his Burgesses should be readmitted, otherwise they were to be utterly excluded as being spies rather than loyal Burgesses, because they had offered themselves to be assistant at the mak- ing of lawes which both themselves and those whom they represented might chuse whether they would obaye or not. Then came there in a complainte against Captain Martin, that having sente his Shallop to trade for corne into the baye, under the commaunde of one Ensigne Harrison, the saide Ensigne should affirme to one Thomas Davis, of Paspaheighe, Gent. (as the said Thomas Davis deposed upon oathe,) that they had made a harde voiage, had they not mett with a Canoa coming out of a creeke where their shallop could not goe. For the Indians refusing to sell their Corne, those of the shallop entered the Canoa with their armes and tooke it by force, measuring out the corne with a baskett they had into the Shallop and (as the said Ensigne Harrison saith) giving them satisfaction in copper beades and other trucking stuffe. Hitherto Mr. Davys upon his oath. Furthermore it was signified from Opochancano to the Governour that those people had complained to him to procure them justice. For which considerations and because suche outrages as this might breede danger and loss of life to others of the Colony which should have leave to trade in the baye hereafter, and for prevention of the like violences against the In- dians in time to come, this order following was agreed on by the general assembly: A second order against Captain Martin, at James citty, July 30, 1619. It was also ordered by the Assembly the same day in case Captaine Martin and the ging of his shallop would not thoroughly answere an accusation of an outrage committed gainst a certaine Conoa of Indians in the baye, that then it was thought reason (his Patent notwithstanding, the authority whereof he had in that case abused) he should from henceforth take leave of the Governour as other men, and should putt in security, that his people shall comitte no such outrage any more. Upon this a letter or warrant was drawen in the name of the whole as- sembly to sumon Captaine Martin to appeare before them in the forme following: By the Governour and general assembly of Virginia. Captaine Martine, we are to request you upon sight hereof, with all con- venient speed to repair hither to James citty to treatt and conferre with us about some matters of especial importance which concerns both us and the whole Colony [and] yourself. And of this we praye you not to faile. James citty, July 30, 1619. To our very loving friend, Captain John Martin, Esquire, Master of the ordinance. These obstacles removed, the Speaker, who for a long time has bene ex- treame sickly, and therefore not able to passe through long harangues, delivered in briefe to the whole assembly the occasions of their meeting. Which done he read unto them the commission for establishing the Counsell of Estate and the general Assembly, wherein their duties were described to the life. Having thus prepared them he read over unto them the greate Charter, or commission of privileges, orders and laws, sent by Sir George Yeardley out of Englande. Which for the more ease of the Committies, having divided into fower books, he read the former two the same forenoon for expeditions sake, a second time over, and so they were referred to the perusall of twoe Committies, which did reciprocally consider of either, and accordingly brought in their opinions. But some may here objecte to what ende we should presume to referre that to the examination of Committies which the Counsell and Company in England had already resolved to be perfect, and did expect nothing but our assente thereunto. To this we answere, that we did it not to the ende to correcte or controll anything therein contained, but onely in case we should finde ought not perfectly squaring with the state of this Colony or any lawe which did presse or binde too harde, that we might by waye of humble petition, seeke to have it redressed, especially because this great Charter is to bind us and our heyers for ever. The names of the Committies for perusing the first booke of the fower:1 1. Captain William Powell, 2. Ensigne Rosingham, 3. Captaine Warde, 4. Captaine Tucker, 5. Mr. Shelley, 6. Thomas Douse, 7. Samuel Jordan, 8. Mr. Boys. The names of the Committies for perusing the second booke: 1. Captaine Lawne, 2. Captaine Graves, 3. Ensigne Spense, 4. Samuel Sharpe, 5. William Cap, 6. Mr. Pawlett, 7. Mr. Jefferson, 8. Mr. Jackson, These Committies thus appointed, we brake up the first forenoon's assembly. After dinner the Governour and those that were not of the Committies sate a second time, while the said Committies were employed in the perusall of those twoe bookes. And whereas the Speaker had propounded fower severall objects for the Assembly to consider on: namely, first the great charter of orders, lawes and privileges; Secondly, which of the instructions given by the Counsel in England to my Lo: La: warre, Captain Argall or Sir George Yeardley, might conveniently putt on the habite of lawes; Thirdly, what lawes might issue out of the private conceipte of any of the Burgesses, or any other of the Colony; and lastly, what petitions were fitt to be sente home for England. It pleased the Governour for expedition sake to have the second objecte of the fower to be examined and prepared by himselfe and the Non-Committies. Wherein after having spente some three howers conference, the twoe Committies brought in their opinions concerning the twoe former bookes, (the second of which beginneth at these wordes of the charter: And forasmuche as our intente is to establish one equall and uniforme kinde of government over all Virginia &amp;c.,) which the whole Assembly, because it was late, deferred to treatt of till the next morning. Satturday, July 31. The nexte daye, therefore, out of the opinions of the said Committies, it was agreed, these Petitions ensuing should be framed, to be presented to the Treasurer, Counsel and Company in England. Upon the Committies perusall of the first book, the Generall Assembly doe become most humble suitors to their lops and to the rest of that honble Counsell and renowned Company, that albeit they have bene pleased to allotte unto the Governor to themselves, together with the Counsell of Estate here, and to the officers of Incorporations, certain lande portions of lande to be layde out within the limites of the same, yet that they woulde vouchsafe also, that groundes as heretofore had bene granted by patent to the antient Planters by former Governours that had from the Company received comission so to doe, might not nowe after so muche labour and coste, and so many yeares habitation be taken from them. And to the ende that no man might doe or suffer any wrong in this kinde, that they woulde favour us so muche (if they meane to graunte this our petition) as to sende us notice, what comission or authority for graunting of landes they have given to eache particular Governour in times paste. The second petition of the General assembly framed by the Committies out of the second book is. That the Treasurer and Company in England would be pleased with as muche convenient speed as may be to sende men hither to occupie their landes belonging to the fower Incorporations, as well for their owne behoofe and proffitt as for the maintenance of the Counsel of Estate, who are nowe to their extream hindrance often drawen far from their private busines and likewise that they will have a care to sende tenants to the ministers of the fower Incorporations to manure their gleab, to the intente that all allowance they have allotted them of 200 G. a yeare may be more easily raised. The thirde Petition humbly presented by this General Assembly to the Treasurer, Counsell and Company is, that it may plainly be expressed in the great Comission (as indeed it is not) that the antient Planters of both sortes, viz., suche as before Sir Thomas Dales' depart were come hither upon their owne chardges, and suche also as were brought hither upon the Companie's coste, maye have their second, third and more divisions suc- cessively in as lardge and free manner as any other Planters. Also that they wilbe pleased to allowe to the male children, of them and of all others begotten in Virginia, being the onely hope of a posterity, a single share a piece, and shares for their issues or for themselves, because that in a newe plantation it is not knowen whether man or woman be more necessary. Their fourth Petition is to beseech the Treasurer, Counsell and Company that they would be pleased to appoint a Sub-Treasurer here to collecte their rents, to the ende that the Inhabitants of this Colony be not tyed to an impossibility of paying the same yearly to the Treasurer in England, and that they would enjoine the said Sub-Treasurer not precisely according to the letter of the Charter to exacte mony of us (whereof we have none at all, as we have no minte), but the true value of the rente in comodity. The fifte Petition is to beseeche the Treasurer, Counsell and Company that, towards the erecting of the University and Colledge, they will sende, when they shall thinke it most convenient, workmen of all sortes, fitt for that purpose. The sixte and laste is, they wilbe pleased to change the savage name of Kiccowtan, and to give that Incorporation a new name. These are the general Petitions drawen by the Comitties out of the two former bookes which the whole general assembly in maner and forme above sett downe doe most humbly offer up and present to the honourable con- struction of the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England. These petitions thus concluded on, those twoe Comitties broughte me a reporte what they had observed in the two latter bookes, which was nothing else but that the perfection of them was suche as that they could finde nothing therein subject to exception, only the Governors particular opinion to my selfe in private hathe bene as touching a clause in the thirde booke, that in these doubtfull times between us and the Indians, it would behoove us not to make as lardge distances between Plantation as ten miles, but for our more strength ande security to drawe nearer together. At the same time, there remaining no farther scruple in the mindes of the Assembly touching the said great Charter of lawes, orders and priviledges, the Speaker putt the same to the question, and so it had both the general assent and the applause of the whole assembly, who, as they professed themselves in the first place most submissively thankful to almighty god, therefore so they commaunded the Speaker to returne (as nowe he doth) their due and hum- ble thankes to the Treasurer Counsell and company for so many priviledges and favours as well in their owne names as in the names of the whole Colony whom they represented. This being dispatched we fell once more debating of suche instructions given by the Counsell in England to several Governors as might be con- verted into lawes, the last whereof was the Establishment of the price of Tobacco, namely, of the best at 3d and the second at 18d the pounde. At the reading of this the Assembly thought good to send for Mr. Abraham Persey, the Cape marchant, to publishe this instruction to him, and to demaunde of him if he knewe of any impediment why it might not be admitted of? His answere was that he had not as yet received any suche order from the Adventurers of the in England. And notwithstanding he sawe the authority was good, yet was he unwilling to yield, till suche time as the Governor and Assembly had layd their commandment upon him, out of the authority of the foresaid Instructions as followeth: By the General Assembly. We will and require you, Mr. Abraham Persey, Cape Marchant, from this daye forwarde to take notice, that, according to an article in the Instruc- tions confirmed by the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in Englande at a general quarter courte, both by voices and under their hands and the Comon seall, and given to Sir George Yeardley, knight, this present governour, Decemb. 3, 1618, that you are bounde to accepte of the Tobacco of the Colony, either for commodities or upon billes, at three shillings the beste and the second sorte at 18d the punde, and this shalbe your sufficient dischardge. James citty out of the said General Assembly, July 31, 1619. At the same the Instructions convertible into lawes were referred to the consideration of the above named Committies, viz., the general Instructions to the first Committie and the particular Instructions to the second, to be returned by them into the assembly on Munday morning. Sunday, Aug. 1. Mr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased. Munday, Aug. 2. Captain John Martin (according to the sumons sent him on Fryday, July 30,) made his personall appearance at the barre, whenas the Speaker having first read unto him the orders of the Assembly that concerned him, he pleaded lardgely for himself to them both and indevoured to answere some other thinges that were objected against his Patente. In fine, being demanded out of the former order whether he would quitte that clause of his Patent which (quite otherwise then Sir William Throck- morton's, Captain Christopher Lawnes and other men's patentes) exempt- eth himselffe and his people from all services of the Colonie excepte onely in case of warre against a forren or domesticall enemie, His answere was negative, that he would not infringe any parte of his Patente. Where- upon it was resolved by the Assembly that his Burgesses should have no admittance. To the second order his answere was affirmative, namely, that (his Patent notwithstanding) whensoever he should send in to the baye to trade, he would be contente to putt in security to the Governour for the good behaviour of his people towardes the Indians. It was at the same time further ordered by the Assembly that the Speaker, in their names, should (as he nowe doth) humbly demaunde of the Treas- urer, Counsell and Company and exposition of this one clause in Captaine Martin's Patente namely, where it is saide That he is to enjoye his landes in as lardge and ample manner, to all intentes and purposes, as any lord of any manours in England dothe holde his grounde out of which some have collected that he might by the same graunte protecte men from paying their debts and from diverse other dangers of lawe. The least the Assembly can alledge against this clause is, that it is obscure, and that it is a thing impossible for us here to knowe the Prerogatives of all manours in Englande. The Assembly therefore humbly beseeches their lopps and the rest of that Honble house that in case they shall finde any thing in this or in any other parte of his graunte wherby that clause towards the conclusion of the great charter, (viz., that all grauntes aswell of the one sorte as of the other respectively, be made with equall favour, and graunts of like liberties and imunities as neer as may be, to the ende that all com- plainte of partiality and indifferency may be avoided,) might in any sorte be contradicted or the uniformity and equality of lawes and orders extend- ing over the whole Colony might be impeached, That they would be pleased to remove any such hindrance as may diverte out of the true course the free and publique current of Justice. Upon the same ground and reason their lops, together with the rest of the Counsell and Company, are humbly besought by this general assembly that if in that other clause which exempteth the Captaine Martin and his people from all services of the Colony etc., they shall finde any resistance [to] that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders intended nowe by them to be established over the whole Colony, that they would be pleased to reforme it. In fine, wheras Captaine Martin, for those ten shares allowed him for his personal adventure and for his adventure of $70 besides, doth claim 500 acres a share, that the Treasurer, Counsell and Company woulde vouchsafe to give notice to the Governour here, what kinde of shares they meante he should have when they gave him his Patent. The premisses about Captaine Martin thus resolved, the Committies appointed to consider what instructions are fitt to be converted into lawes, brought in their opinions, and first of some of the general instructions. Here begin the lawes drawen out of the Instructions given by his Maties Counsell of Virginia in England to my lo: la warre, Captain Argall and Sir George Yeardley, knight. By this present General Assembly be it enacted that no injury or oppres- sion be wrought by the English against the Indians whereby the present peace might be disturbed and antient quarrells might be revived. And farther be it ordained that the Chicohomini are not to be excepted out of this lawe; untill either that suche order come out of Englande or that they doe provoke us by some newe injury. Against Idlenes, Gaming, drunkenes and excesse in apparell the Assembly hath enacted as followeth: First, in detestation of Idlenes be it enacted, that if any man be founde to live as an Idler or renagate, though a freedman, it shalbe lawful for that Incorporation or Plantation to which he belongeth to appoint him a Mr to serve for wages, till he shewe apparant signes of amendment. Against gaming at dice and Cardes be it ordained by this present assembly that the winner or winners shall lose all his or their winninges and both winners and loosers shall forfaite ten shillings a man, one ten shillings whereof to go to the discoverer, and the rest to charitable and pious uses in the Incorporation where the faulte is comitted. Against drunkenness be it also decreed that if any private person be found culpable thereof, for the first time he is to be reprooved privately by the Minister, the second time publiquely, the thirde time to lye in boltes 12 howers in the house of the Provost Marshall and to paye his fee, and if he still continue in that vice, to undergo suche severe punishment as the Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to be inflicted on him. But if any officer offende in this crime, the first time he shall receive reprooff from the Governour, the second time he shall openly be reprooved in the churche by the minister, and the third time he shall first be comitted and then degraded. Provided it be understood that the Governor hath alwayes power to restore him when he shall in his discretion thinke fitte. Against excesse in apparell that every man be cessed in the churche for all publique contributions, if he be unmarried according to his owne apparell, if he be married, according to his owne and his wives, or either of their apparell. As touching the instruction of drawing some of the better disposed of the Indians to converse with our people and to live and labour amongst them, the Assembly who knowe well their dispositions thinke it fitte to enjoin, least to counsell those of the Colony, neither utterly to reject them nor yet to drawe them to come in. But in case they will of themselves come voluntarily to places well peopled, there to doe service in killing of Deere, fishing, beatting of Corne and other workes, that then five or six may be admitted into every such place, and no more, and that with the consente of the Governour. Provided that good guarde in the night be kept upon them for generally (though some amongst many may proove good) they are a most trecherous people and quickly gone when they have done a villany. And it were fitt a house were builte for them to lodge in aparte by themselves, and lone inhabitants by no meanes to entertain them. Be it enacted by this present assembly that for laying a surer foundation of the conversion of the Indians of Christian Religion, eache towne, citty, Borrough, and particular plantation do obtaine unto themselves by just means a certine number of the natives' children to be educated by them in true religion and civile course of life---of which children the most towardly boyes in witt and graces of nature to be brought up by them in the first elements of litterature, so to be fitted for the Colledge intended for them that from thence they may be sente to that worke of conversion. As touching the busines of planting corne this present Assembly doth ordain that yeare by yeare all and every householder and householders have in store for every servant he or they shall keep, and also for his or their owne persons, whether they have any Servants or no, one spare barrell of corne, to be delivered out yearly, either upon sale or exchange as need shall require. For the neglecte of which duty he shalbe subjecte to the censure of the Governor and Counsell of Estate. Provided always that the first yeare of every newe man this lawe shall not be of force. About the plantation of Mulbery trees, be it enacted that every man as he is seatted upon his division, doe for seven yeares together, every yeare plante and maintaine in growte six Mulberry trees at the least, and as many more as he shall think conveniente and as his vurtue and Industry shall move him to plante, and that all suche persons as shall neglecte the yearly planting and maintaining of that small proportion shalbe subjecte to the censure of the Governour and the Counsell of Estate. Be it farther enacted as concerning Silke-flaxe, that those men that are upon their division or setled habitation doe this next yeare plante and dresse 100 plantes, which being founde a comodity, may farther be in- creased. And whosoever do faill in the performance of this shalbe subject to the punishment of the Governour and Counsell of Estate. For hempe also both English and Indian and for English flax and Anniseeds, we do require and enjoine all householders of this Colony that have any of those seeds to make tryal thereof the nexte season. Moreover be it enacted by this present Assembly, that every householder doe yearly plante and maintaine ten vines untill they have attained to the art and experience of dressing a Vineyard either by their owne industry or by the Instruction of some Vigneron. And that upon what penalty soever the Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to impose upon the neglecters of this acte. Be it also enacted that all necessary tradesmen, or so many as need shall require, suche as are come over since the departure of Sir Thomas Dale, or that shall hereafter come, shall worke at their trades for any other man, each one being payde according to the quality of his trade and worke, to be estimated, if he shall not be contented, by the Governor and officers of the place where he worketh. Be it further ordained by this General Assembly, and we doe by these presents enacte, that all contractes made in England between the owners of the lande and their Tenants and Servantes which they shall sende hither, may be caused to be duely performed, and that the offenders be punished as the Governour and Counsell of Estate shall thinke just and convenient. Be it established also by this present Assembly that no crafty or advanta- gious means be suffered to be put in practise for the inticing awaye the Tenants or Servants of any particular plantation from the place where they are seatted. And that it shalbe the duty of the Governor and Coun- sell of Estate most severely to punish both the seducers and the seduced, and to returne these latter into their former places. Be it further enacted that the orders for the Magazin lately made be exactly kepte, and that the Magazin be preserved from wrong and sinister practises, and that according to the orders of courte in Englande all To- bacco and sasafras be brought by the Planters to the Cape marchant till suche time as all the goods nowe or heretofore sent for the Magazin be taken off their hands at the prices agreed on. That by this meanes the same going for Englande with one hande the price thereof may be uphelde the better. And to that ende that all the whole Colony may take notice of the last order of Courte made in Englande and all those whom it con- cerneth may knowe howe to observe it, we holde it fitt to publishe it here for a lawe among the rest of our lawes. The which order is as followeth: Upon the 26 of October, 1618, it was ordered that the Magazin should continue during the terme formerly prefixed and that certaine abuses now complained of should be reformed and that for preventing of all Imposi- tions save the allowance of 25 in the hundred proffitt, the Governor shall have an invoice as well as the Cape Marchant, that if any abuse in the sale of the goods be offered, wee upon Intelligence and due examination thereof, shall see it correctede. And for incouragement of particular hundreds, as Smythe's hundred, Martin's hundred, Lawnes' hundred, and the like, it is agreed that what comodoties are reaped upon anie of these General Colonies, it shalbe lawefull for them to returne the same to their owne adventurers. Provided that the same comodity be of their owne growing, without trading with any other, in one entyre lumpe, and not dispersed and that at the determination of the jointe stocke, the goods then remaining in the Magazin shalbe bought by the said particular Colonies before any other goods which shall be sente by private men. And it was moreover ordered that if the lady la warre, the Lady Dale, Captain Bar- grave and the rest, would unite themselves into a settled Colony they might be capable of the same priviledges that are graunted to any of the foresaid hundreds. Hitherto the order. All the general Assembly by voices concluded not only the acceptance and observation of this order, but of the Instruction also to Sir George Yeardley next preceding the same. Provided first, that the Cape Mar- chant do accepte of the Tobacco of all and everie the Planters here in Virginia, either for Goods or upon billes of Exchange at three shillings the pounde the beste, and 18d the second sorte. Provided also that the billes be only payde in Englande. Provided, in the third place, that if any other besides the Magazin have at any time any necessary comodity which the Magazine dothe wante, it shall and may be lawfull for any of the Colony to buye the said necessary comodity of the said party, but upon the termes of the Magazin viz: allowing no more gaine then 25 in the hundred, and that with the leave of the Governour. Provided lastly, that it may be lawfull for the Governor to give leave to any Mariner, or any other person that shall have any suche necessary comodity wanting to the Magazin to carrie home for Englande so muche Tobacco or other naturall comodities of the Country as his Customers shall pay him for the said necessary comodity or comodities. And to the ende we may not only persuade and incite men, but inforce them also thoroughly and loyally to aire their Tobacco before they bring it to the Magazine, be it enacted, and by these presents we doe enacte, that if upon the Judgement of fower sufficient men of any incorporation where the Magazine shall reside, (having first taken their oaths to give true sentence, twoe whereof to be chosen by the Cape Marchant and twoe by the Incorporation), any Tobacco whatsoever shall not proove vendible at the second price, that it shall there imediately be burnt before the owner's face. Hitherto suche lawes as were drawen out of the Instructions. Tuesday, Aug. 3, 1619. This morning a thirde sorte of lawes (suche as might proceed out of every man's private conceipt) were read and referred by halves to the same comitties which were from the beginning. This done, Captaine William Powell presented to the Assembly a petition to have justice against a lewde and trecherous servante of his who by false accusation given up in writing to the Governor sought not only to gett him deposed from his government of James citty and utterly (according to the Proclamation) to be degraded from the place and title of a Captaine, but to take his life from him also. And so out of the said Petition sprang this order following: Captaine William Powell presented a pettition to the generall Assem- bly against one Thomas Garnett, a servant of his, not onely for extreame neglect of his business to the great loss and prejudice of the said Captaine, and for openly and impudently abusing his house, in sight both of Master and Mistress, through wantonnes with a woman servant of theirs, a wid- dowe, but also for falsely accusing him to the Governor both of Drunken- nes and Thefte, and besides for bringing all his fellow servants to testifie on his side, wherein they justly failed him. It was thought fitt by the general assembly (the Governour himself giving sentence), that he should stand fower dayes with his eares nayled to the Pillory, viz: Wednesday, Aug. 4th, and so likewise Thursday, fryday, and Satturday next following, and every of those dayes should be publiquely whipped. Now, as touch- ing the neglecte of his worke, what satisfaction ought to be made to his Mr for that is referred to the Governour and Counsell of Estate. The same morning the lawes abovewritten, drawen out of the instruc- tions, were read, and one by one thoroughly examined, and then passed once again the general consente of the whole Assembly. This afternoon the comitties brought in a reporte, what they had done as concerning the thirde sorte of lawes, the discussing whereof spente the residue of that daye. Excepte onely the consideration of a pettiton of Mr. John Rolfes againste Captaine John Martine for writing a letter to him wherein (as Mr. Rolfe alledgeth) he taxeth him both unseemly and amisse of certaine thinges wherein he was never faulty, and besides, casteth some aspersion upon the present government, which is the most temperate and juste that ever was in this country, too milde indeed, for many of this Colony, whom unwoonted liberty hath made insolente and not to know themselves. This Petition of Mr. Rolfes' was thought fitt to be referred to the Counsell of State. Wednesday, Aug. 4th. This daye (by reason of extream heat, both paste and likely to ensue and by that meanes of the alteration of the healthes of diverse of the general Assembly) the Governour, who himself also was not well, resolved should be the last of this first session; so in the morning the Speaker (as he was required by the Assembly) redd over all the lawes and orders that had formerly passed the house, to give the same yett one reviewe more, and to see whether there were any thing to be amended or that might be excepted againste. This being done, the third sorte of lawes which I am nowe coming to sett downe, were read over [and] thoroughly discussed, which, together with the former, did now passe the laste and finall consente of the General Assembly. A thirde sorte of lawes, suche as may issue out of every man's private conceipte. It shalbe free for every man to trade with the Indians, servants onely excepted, upon paine of whipping, unless the Mr. will redeeme it off with the payment of an Angell, one-fourth parte whereof to go to the Provost Marshall one fourth parte to the discoverer, and the other moyty to the publique uses of the Incorporation. That no man doe sell or give any of the greatter howes to the Indians, or any English dog of quality, as a mastive, greyhound, bloodhounde, lande or water spaniel, or any other dog or bitche whatsoever, of the Englishe race, upon paine of forfaiting 5s sterling to the publique uses of the Incor- poration where he dwelleth. That no man do sell or give any Indians any piece shott or poulder, or any other armes, offensive or defensive upon paine of being held a Traytour to the Colony, and of being hanged as soon as the facte is proved, without all redemption. That no man may go above twenty miles from his dwelling-place, nor upon any voiage whatsoever shalbe absent from thence for the space of seven dayes together without first having made the Governor or comaunder of the same place acquainted therwith, upon paine of paying twenty shillings to the publique uses of the same Incorporation where the party delinquent dwelleth. That no man shall purposely goe to any Indian townes, habitations or places or resortes without leave from the Governor or comaunder of that place wher he liveth, upon paine of paying 40s to publique uses as aforesaid. That no man living in this Colony, but shall between this and the first of January nexte ensueing come or sende to the Secretary of Estate to enter his own and all his servants' names, and for what terme or upon what conditions they are to serve, upon penalty of paying 40s to the said Secre- tary of Estate. Also, whatsoever Mrs or people doe come over to this plantation that within one month of their arrivall (notice being first given them of this very lawe) they shall likewise resorte to the Secretary of Estate and shall certifie him upon what termes or conditions they be come hither, to the ende that he may recorde their grauntes and comissions, and for how long time and upon what conditions their servants (in case they have any) are to serve them, and that upon paine of the penalty nexte above mentioned. All Ministers in the Colony shall once a year, namely, in the moneth of Marche, bring to the Secretary of Estate a true account of all Christenings, burials and marriages, upon paine, if they faill, to be censured for their negligence by the Governor and Counsell of Estate; likewise, where there be no ministers, that the comanders of the place doe supply the same duty. No man, without leave of the Governor, shall kill any Neatt cattle whatsoever, young or olde, especially kine, Heyfurs or cow-calves, and shalbe careful to perserve their steers and oxen, and to bring them to the plough and such profitable uses, and without having obtained leave as aforesaid, shall not kill them, upon penalty of forfaiting the value of the beast so killed. Whosoever shall take any of his neighbors' boates, oares, or canoas without leave from the owner shalbe helde and esteemed as a felon and so proceeded againste; tho hee that shall take away by violence or stelth any canoas or other thinges from the Indians shall make valuable restitution to the said Indians, and shall forfaict, if he be a freeholder, five pound; if a servant, 40s, or endure a whipping; and anything under the value of 13d shall be accounted Petty larcency. All ministers shall duely read divine service, and exercise their min- isterial function according to the Ecclesiastical lawes and orders of the churche of Englande, and every Sunday in the afternoon shall Catechize suche as are not yet ripe to come to the Com. And whosoever of them shalbe found negligent or faulty in this kinde shalbe subject to the censure of the Governor and Counsell of Estate. The Ministers and Churchwardens shall seeke to presente all ungodly disorders, the comitters wherofe if, upon goode admonitions and milde reprooff, they will not forbeare the said skandalous offenses, as suspicions of whordomes, dishonest company keeping with weomen and suche like, they are to be presented and punished accordingly. If any person after two warnings, doe not amende his or her life in point of evident suspicion of Incontincy or of the comission of any other enormous sinnes, that then he or shee be presented by the Churchwardens and suspended for a time from the churche by the minister. In which Interim if the same person do not amende and humbly submit him or her- self to the churche, he is then fully to be excomunicate and soon after a writt or warrant to be sent from the Governor for the apprehending of his person ande seizing on all his goods. Provided alwayes, that all the ministers doe meet once a quarter, namely, at the feast of St. Michael the Arkangell, of the nativity of our saviour, of the Annuntiation of the blessed Virgine, and about midsomer, at James citty or any other place where the Governor shall reside, to determine whom it is fitt to excomunicate, and that they first presente their opinion to the Governor ere they proceed to the acte of excomunication. For the reformation of swearing, every freeman and Mr. of a family after thrise admontion shall give 5s or the value upon present demaunde, to the use of the church where he dwelleth; and every servant after the like admontion, excepte his Mr. discharge the fine, shalbe subject to whipping. Provided, that the payment of the fine notwithstanding, the said servant shall acknowledge his faulte publiquely in the Churche. No man whatsoever, coming by water from above, as from Henrico, Charles citty, or any place from the westwarde of James citty, and being bound for Kiccowtan, or any other parte on this side, the same shall pre- sume to pass by, either by day or by night, without touching firste here at James citty to knowe whether the Governor will comande him any service. And the like shall they performe that come from Kicawtan ward, or from any place between this and that, to go upwarde, upon paine of forfaiting ten pound sterling a time to the Governor. Provided, that if a servant having had instructions from his Master to observe this lawe, doe not- withstanding, transgresse the same, that then the said servant shalbe pun- ished at the Governor's discretion; otherwise, that the master himselfe shall undergo the foresaid penalty. No man shall trade into the baye, either in shallop, pinnace, or ship, with- out the Governor's license, and without putting in security that neither himself nor his Company shall force or wrong the Indians, upon paine that, doing otherwise, they shalbe censured at their returne by the Governor and Counsell of Estate. All persons whatsoever upon the Sabaoth daye shall frequente divine service and sermons both forenoon and afternoon, and all suche as beare armes shall bring their pieces swordes, poulder and shotte. And every one that shall transgresse this lawe shall forfaicte three shillinges a time to the use of the churche, all lawful and necessary impediments excepted. But if a servant in this case shall wilfully neglecte his Mr's comande he shall suffer bodily punishmente. No maide or woman servant, either now resident in the Colonie or hereafter to come, shall contract herselfe in marriage without either the consent of her parents, or of her Mr or Mris, or of the magistrate and minister of the place both together. And whatsoever minister shall marry or contracte any suche persons without some of the foresaid consentes shalbe subjecte to the severe censure of the Governor and Counsell of Estate. Be it enacted by this present assembly that whatsoever servant hath heretofore or shall hereafter contracte himselfe in England, either by way of Indenture or otherwise, to serve any Master here in Virginia and shall afterward, against his said former contracte depart from his Mr without leave, or, being once imbarked shall abandon the ship he is appointed to come in, and so, being lefte behinde, shall putt himselfe into the service of any other man that will bring him hither, that then at the same servant's arrival here, he shall first serve out his time with that Mr that brought him hither and afterward also shall serve out his time with his former Mr according to his covenant. Here ende the lawes. All these lawes being thus concluded and consented to as aforesaid Captaine Henry Spellman was called to the barre to answere to certaine misdemeanors layde to his chardge by Robert Poole, interpretour, upon his oath (whose examination the Governor sente into England in the Prosperus), of which accusations of Poole some he acknowledged for true, but the greattest part he denyed. Whereupon the General Assembly having throughly heard and considered his speaches, did constitute this order following against him: Aug. 4th, 1619. This day Captaine Henry Spelman was convented before the General Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole, Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman and Opochancano at Poole's meeting with him in Opochancano's courte. Poole chardgeth him he spake very unreverently and maliciously against this present Governor, whereby the honour and dignity of his place and person, and so of the whole Colonie, might be brought into contempte, by which meanes what mischiefs might ensue from the Indians by disturbance of the peace or otherwise, may easily be conjectured. Some thinges of this relation Spelman confessed, but the most parte he denyed, excepte onely one matter of importance, and that was that he hade informed Opochancano that within a yeare there would come a Governor greatter then this that nowe is in place. By which and by other reportes it seemeth he hath alienated the minde of Opochancano from this present Governour, and brought him in much disesteem, both with Opochancano and the Indians, and the whole Colony in danger of their slippery designes. The general assembly upon Poole's testimony onely not willing to putt Spelman to the rigour and extremity of the lawe which might, perhaps both speedily and deservedly, have taken his life from him (upon the witness of one whom he muche excepted against) were pleased, for the present, to censure him rather out of that his confession above written then out of any other prooffe. Several and sharpe punishments were pronounced against him by diverse of the Assembly, But in fine the whole courte by voices united did encline to the most favorable, which was that for this misdemeanour he should first be degraded of his title of Captaine, at the head of the troupe, and should be condemned to performe seven years service to the Colony in the nature of Interpreter to the Governour. This sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more of the Savage then of the Christian, muttered certaine wordes to himselfe neither shewing any remorse for his offenses, nor yet any thankfulness to the Assembly for theire sofavourable censure, which he at one time or another (God's grace not wholly abandoning him) might with some one service have been able to have redeemed. This day also did the Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Argall's towne, present a petition to the general assembly to give them an absolute dis- charge from certain bondes wherein they stand bound to Captain Samuell Argall for the payment of 600lb and to Captain William Powell, at Captaine Argall's appointment, for the payment of 50lb more. To Captaine Argall for 15 skore acres of wooddy ground, called by the name of Argal's towne or Paspaheigh; to Captaine Powell in respect of his paines in clearing the grounde and building the houses, for which Captaine Argal ought to have given him satisfaction. Nowe, the general assembly being doubtful whether they have any power and authority to discharge the said bondes, doe by these presents (at the Instance of the said Inhabitants of Pas- paheigh, alias Martin's hundred people) become most humble sutours to the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England that they wilbe pleased to gett the said bondes for 600lb to be cancelled; forasmuche as in their great comission they have expressly and by name appointed that place of Paspaheigh for parte of the Governour's lande. And whereas Captain William Powell is payde his 50 which Captain Argall enjoined the saide Inhabitantes to presente him with, as parte of the bargaine, the general assembly, at their intreaty, do become sutours on their behalfe, that Captaine Argall, by the Counsell and Company in England, may be com- pelled either to restore the said 50lb from thence, or else that restitution thereof be made here out of the goods of the said Captaine Argall. The last acte of the Generall Assembly was a contribution to gratifie their officers, as followeth: Aug. 4th, 1619. It is fully agreed at this general Assembly that in regard of the great paines and labour of the Speaker of this Assembly (who not onely first formed the same Assembly and to their great ease and expedition reduced all matters to be treatted of into a ready method, but also his indisposition notwithstanding wrote or dictated all orders and other expedients and is yet to write severall bookes for all the Generall Incorporations and planta- tions both of the great charter, and of all the lawes) and likewise in respecte of the diligence of the Clerke and sergeant, officers thereto belonging, That every man and manservant of above 16 yeares of age shall pay into the handes and Custody of the Burgesses of every Incorporation and plantation one pound of the best Tobacco, to be distributed to the Speaker and likewise to the Clerke and sergeant of the Assembly, according to their degrees and rankes, the whole bulke whereof to be delivered into the Speaker's handes, to be divided accordingly. And in regarde the Provost Marshall of James citty hath also given some attendance upon the said General Assembly, he is also to have a share out of the same. And this is to begin to be gathered the 24th of February nexte. In conclusion, the whole Assembly comaunded the Speaker (as nowe he doth) to present their humble excuse to the Treasurer Counsell and Company in England for being constrained by the intemperature of the weather and the falling sick of diverse of the Burgesses to breake up so abruptly—before they had so much as putt their lawes to the ingrossing. This they wholly comited to the fidelity of their speaker, who therin (his conscience telles him) hath done the parte of an honest man, otherwise he would be easily founde out by the Burgesses themselves, who with all expedition are to have so many bookes of the same lawes as there be both Incorporations and Plantations in the Colony. In the seconde place, the Assembly doth most humbly crave pardon that in so shorte a space they could bring their matter to no more perfec- tion, being for the present enforced to sende home titles rather then lawes, Propositions rather then resolutions, Attemptes then Acchievements, hoping their courtesy will accepte our poor endevour, and their wisedome wilbe ready to supporte the weakness of this little flocke. Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech the said Treas- urer, Counsell and Company, that albeit it belongeth to them onely to allowe or to abrogate any lawes which we shall here make, and that it is their right so to doe, yet that it would please them not to take it in ill parte if these lawes which we have now brought to light, do passe currant and be of force till suche time as we may knowe their farther pleasure out of Englande: for otherwise this people (who nowe at length have gotten the raines of former servitude into their owne swindge) would in shorte time growe so insolent, as they would shake off all government, and there would be no living among them. Their last humble suite is, that the said Counsell and Company would be pleased, so soon as they shall finde it convenient, to make good their promise sett downe at the conclusion of their commission for establishing the Counsel of Estate and the General Assembly, namely, that they will give us power to allowe or disallowe of their orders of Courte, as his Majesty hath given them power to allowe or to reject our lawes. In sume Sir George Yeardley, the Governour prorogued the said General Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to fall out this present yeare of 1619, and in the mean season dissolved the same.</field>

Autograph Letter, Signed List of Records No. 120 Good Mr fferrar: I came by Sr Nicolas Tufton: &amp; brought along wth me seven good men, wch Sr Nicolas had very carefully provided for us. But at my coming to Northborn on Wendsday the 11th of this present, I found the Ship gone the day before. I found also som letters to me out of the Ship: wch gave me no great content, conceiving they wanted som of or number appointed, &amp; yet were unwilling to take anie more in. And as for Nicolas Tufton, they sent not to him at all. But perceiving by my men, that after the writing of those letters, that had taken in those five wch we sent to them in the Sandwich bote; &amp; other two wch my folk had here provided; &amp; hearing also that they had got a good pilote out of the Kings Ships, (for at Sandwich they could get none); &amp; that at their setting of Saile, wch was on Tuesday at noone, they wanted but one of their complete number of six score: I must confesse I was then not a little comforted: but much more, &amp; more again everie day since, the wynd having continued here so constantly prosperous. I hope verily by this they are on a quarter of their way. What had they been, if they had not lost those two days at the custome House? I trust the blessing of God is wth us in this Action: &amp; then will we not feare what the Devill can woork against it. I disbursed Ten shillings amongst those seven: wch wth their enterteinment at my house gave them reasonable content, &amp; they have promised to be readie against another voiage. I merveil we heare not yet of the Diana from the Ile of Wight, unles this north-east wynd have stopt hir there. I have taken good order for yor supplie wth monie. Before the end of this moneth I dowt not yu shall have plentie. Meane tyme I pray yu cause Mr Carter to procure a warrent to me from the Committies for or Smiths Hundred, for paying for the transportation of or 42. persons in this Ship: (ffor so manie set to Sea, though five dyed in the way:) wch cometh to 2521 at 61 the person. The payment for those in the Magazin Ship, yu knowe is respited by their consent, till other reckonings be cleared: wch will not be now till or meeting the next term. I have spent this after- noon wholy in writing of letters: &amp; reserved Yors to the last; so that now I growe wearie, &amp; the night is far spent. I shall long to heare from yu &amp; what nues by the Diana. Yu made me half a promise to visit us at Northborn: I pray yu perfit it in yor next letter; &amp; set me down the tyme when my gelding wth a footman shall at Gravesend attend yu. But yu must have first rid yor hands of the Diana, especially of the mar- iners, who may not be delayed.

A Rough Draft in Sandys' Autograph List of Records No. 132 [1b] Right Honorable Beeing advertized of yor Lps return to London, it trowbled me much that I could not sodainly wayt upon yor Lp: beeing detained here by a coorse of physick, imposed upon he §me§ for som tyme, yet, in way of prevention. I am also put in som hope &amp; expectance, that my L. of Doncaster wilbe pleased to take my house in his way: at wch tyme I should be exceeding §very§ loth to be absent, beeing so much beholden to his Lp as I am. Mean tyme I am, &amp; have §&amp; wilbe§ been carefull, that there should be no §defect§ neglect found in or Virginia busines. The chief whereof is now, the paying of mariners wages, &amp; fraight of Ships returned: wch is all well performed by my §honest§ faithfull &amp; carefull Deputie; whom I have furnished for that purpose wth §above§ One Thousand pounds &amp; upward; so that all men have been satisfyed iustly at their days. Only one thing dooth much perplex me, wherein I shalbe bold to crave som Direction from yor Lp. The Governor Sr George Yeardley, having taken exceeding pains for the setling of all things §matters§ in order in Virginia, &amp; for laying the foundation of a regular State, according to his Instructions &amp; other Directions; hath sodainly fallen into a violent resolution of quitting his Place, (grounding himself upon an errorr,) &amp; ceaseth not by all his letters publick &amp; private to impor- tune it. The error is, that he conceiveth Sr Thomas Smyth still to be Treasuror, wth his Alderman Deputie: &amp; supposeth that he shalbe there the Subiect of their malignancie, &amp; so as to be wronged &amp; disgraced by them in his place &amp; actions §be his Industrie &amp; Integritie never so great§ Sr Th Smyth was highly offended wth his §Sr George Yeardleys being§ knighted: aleging that §it§ beeing doon contrarie to his pleasure, yet both his name, &amp; the whole companies name, were used in it §either§ whereof [in truth] was so. Before Sr Georges Departure, I both labored &amp; effected a Reconciliation, (thinking it very unfitt that the Treasuror of the Com- panie, &amp; the Governor of the Colonie, should be at Variance: &amp; mutuall offices of love §&amp; frendship§ &amp; kyndnes did passt on bothe sides. After Sr Georges §was gone§ departure, I §perceived§ saw my woork to be unsound. ffor upon occasion of a motion made openly against Sr G. Yeardley by a noble person in favor as §contemplation as seemed§ was con- ceived of Captain Argall, Sr Thomas taking the advantage renued his former [2a] displeasure; not long after upbraiding again in open coort his unduely procured Knighthood: Mr Canning also muttering our matter of disgrace by §to§ his wife: &amp; this against a man, to whom they §had§ professed frendship, §who was§ chosen by themselves, &amp; sent §by them (in great part at his own private charges)§ to so difficult a service. The report hereof coming (as dooth now appeare) to Sr G Yeardley, (for his owne brother was present), hath bred in him this discontent, &amp; hastie resolution, not to serve under his controll, whose hatred §though causeles§ was so strong, as to break thorough the §nue§ bounds of a publick recon- ciliation. Yet he offereth, that beeing dismissed of the place of Governor, he will continue in that Contrie, &amp; prosecute wth all care or Smiths Hundred busines. wch in particular for or Societie were a matter of much benefit: but the well carrying of the publick is of more importance. To the setting up whereof, we have this yeare already sent three Fifties of persons: One in Januarie wth Sr G. Yeardley, for the Governors land: &amp; the other two now lately, for the College &amp; Companies lands. There were also in March last 20. sent for the Companies land in Captain Lawns Ship: &amp; 4. in the Triall: &amp; about 10. more for the publick wilbe recovered in the Contrie. My Desire is to make those Fifties up so manie Hundreds, to be sent away in the end of Januarie next. To wch purpose I cast about for supplie of monie: &amp; am in good hope to bring it to effect. I suppose there is no man that knoweth the Contrie, but will easily acknowledge, that the profit of the labors of these three hundred men §once setled§, redounding equally to the Governour, College, &amp; Companie, can be esteemed at no lesse then a Thousand pounds a yeare to each; &amp; I hope §in som short tyme§ double that sum. wch wilbe a fair ground §whereon§ to reedifie that state: &amp; wch, if §former§ my persuasions had taken anie place, had not been now to doo for the Governor &amp; Companie. But this my good L. cannot be doon wth out great charge. wch causeth the wthdrawing of publick monie out of private mens hands: whence riseth this name of Accounts, so mortally hated. I had thought that no man, carrying the face of an honest man, could have been displeased wth beeing called to an Account: being the onlie iustification &amp; discharge of a true man. But it §hath§ fallen out other- wise. In steed of thanks for my labor, I have reaped a masse of malignitie: under wch (had it not been by the help of yor Lps §noble§ Justice) I might have quailed. But in affiance of §the blessing of God first &amp; next of§ the continuance of yor Lps §Constancie§ good favor, I will not faint in §persisting to goo on to§ dooing that, wthout wch this woork can not be doon. But touching Sr George Yeardley, the assurance wch I gave of his faithfulnes, §experience§ honest care sufficiencie &amp; industrie, dooth cause me §much§ to desire it exceedingly that the woork wch in my yeare dooth moove from hence, may passe on §unto§ under to his hands to be the establing of §there§ established of it there. Men of greater place or higher thoughts may perhaps [2b] folde their §owne§ particular mynds: wch heretofore I doubt hath doon little good to the Colonie. Besides I hold fit that no mutation be made, till Sr Thomas Dales return: that we may first knowe what coorse he §then entends to§ will take. Sr George Yeardley hath written of late twice to the Counseil, once by the Diana, &amp; as wch came to my hands; &amp; since by the Prosperous, wch are delivered to Sr Thomas Smith. The former packett I opened, having present oportunitie to write back unto him: &amp; now have sent it to or Deputie Mr Ferrar, to be presented to yor Lp wth the rest of the Counseil, when yor Lp shall be pleased that they be assembled. My humble suit to yor Lp is, only for the §if it shall seem§ good of Virginia §for§ the service §of Virginia§ no advantage be taken of Sr Georges has rash offer over (nothing dowting but §conceiving that§ by this tyme §seeing his error§ he would recall it,) if he could: but that it either §it§ may be passed §past§ clene over in silence, or reserved held in suspence till som farther oportunitie may §better§ discover what is fittest to be doon. About Alholantyde, not to faile if God permit, I purpose to present my personall service to yor Lp.

      <field name="fulltext">LXXXII. John Pory. A Letter to "the Right honble and my singular good lorde" September 30, 1619 Barlow Collection, 2270 Document in the New York Public Library. Autograph Letter, Signed List of Records No. 133 Right honble and my singular good lorde, Hauing mett wth so fitt a mes- senger as this man of warre of Flushing, I could not but imparte wth yor lop (to whom I am so euerlastingly bounde) these poore fruites of our labours here; wherein though your lop will espie many errours &amp; imper- fections, and matters of lowe esteeme; yet wthall you wilbe contente to obserue the very principle and rudiments of our Infant-Co?onwealth; wch though nowe contemptible, your lop may liue to see a flourishing Estate; maugre both Spaniards &amp; Indians. The occasion of this ships coming hither was an accidental consortship in the West Indies wth the Tresurer an English man of warre also, licensed by a Co?ission from the Duke of Sauoye to take Spaniards as lawfull prize. This ship the Treas- urer wente out of England in Aprill was tweluemoneth, about a moneth, I thinke, before any peace was concluded between the king of Spaine &amp; that prince. Hither shee came to Captaine Argall then governr of this Colony, being parte-owner of her. Hee more for loue of gaine the root of all euill, [* * * *] then for any true love he bore to this Plantation, victualled &amp; manned her anewe, and sente her wth the same Co?ission to raunge the Indies. The euente whereof (we may misdoubte) will proove some attempte of the Spaniard upon us, either by waye of revenge, or by way of prevention; least we might in time make this place sedem belli against the West Indies. But our Governr being a soldier truly bred in that vniversity of warre the lowe Countries, purposeth at a place or two upon the riuer fortifiable to prouide for them, animating in the meane while this warlike people (then whom for their small number, no prince can be serued wth better) by his example to prepare their courages. Both those of our nation and the Indians also haue this Torride so?er bene visited wth great sicknes &amp; mortality; wch our good God (his name be blessed for it) hath recompensed wth a maruelous plenty, suche as hath not bene seen since our first coming into the lande. For my selfe I was partly at land &amp; partly at sea vexed wth a Calenture of some 4. or 5. moneths. But (praised be god) I am nowe as healthfull as euer I was in my life. Here (as yor lop cannot be ignorant) I am, for faulte of a better, Secretary of Estate, the first that euer was chosen and appointed by Co?ission from the Counsell and Company in England, vnder their handes &amp; co?on seale. By my fees I must maintaine my selfe; wch the Gouernr telles me, may this yeare amounte to a matter of 300? sterling; wherof fifty I doe owe to himselfe, and I pray God the remainder may amounte to a hundred more. As yet I haue gotten nothing, saue onely (if I may speak it wthout boasting, a general reputation of integrity, for hauing spoken freely to all matters, according to my conscience; and as neare as I could discerne, done euery man right. As touching the quality of this country, three thinges there bee, wch in fewe yeares may bring this Colony to perfection; the English plough, Vineyards, &amp; Cattle. For the first, there be many grounds here cleared by the Indians to our handes, wch being muche worne out, will beare no more of their corne, wch requireth an extrordinary deale of sappe &amp; sub- stance to nourish it: but of our graine of all sortes it will beare great abundance. We have had this yeare a plentifull cropp of English wheat, tho the last haruest 1618. was onely shed upon the stubble, and so selfe- sowne, wthout any other manurance. In Iuly last so soon as we had reaped this selfe-sowen wheate, we sett Indian corne upon the same grounde, wch is come up in great abundance; and so by this meanes we are to enjoye two crops in one yeare from off one &amp; the same fielde. The greattest labour we haue yet bestowed upon English wheate, hath bene, upon newe broken up groundes, one ploughing onely &amp; one harrowing, far shorte of the Tilthe used in Christendome, wch when we shall haue ability enough to performe we shall produce miracles out of this earthe. Vines here are in suche abundance, as wheresoeuer a man treads, they are ready to embrace his foote. I haue tasted here of a great black grape as big as a Damascin, that hath a true Muscatell-taste; the vine wherof now spending itselfe euen to the topps of high trees, if it were reduced into a vineyard, and there domesticated, would yeild incomparable fruite. The like or a better taste haue I founde in a lesser sorte of black grapes. White grapes also of great excellency I haue hearde to be in the country; but they are very rare, nor did I euer see or taste of them. For cattle, they do mightily increase here, both kine, hogges, &amp; goates, and are much greater in stature, then the race of them first brought out of Eng- land. No lesse are our horses and mares likely to multiply, wch proove of a delicate shape, &amp; of as good spirite &amp; metall. All our riches for the present doe consiste in Tobacco, wherein one man by his owne labour hath in one yeare, raised to himselfe to the value of 200?i sterling; and another by the meanes of sixe seruants hath cleared at one crop a thou- sand pound english. These be true, yet indeed rare examples, yet possi- ble to be done by others. Our principall wealth (I should haue said) consisteth in seruants: but they are chardgeable to be furnished wth armes, apparell, &amp; bedding, and for their transportation, and casuall both at sea, &amp; for their first yeare co?only at lande also: but if they escape, they prooue very hardy, and sound able men. Nowe that yor lop may knowe, we are not the veriest beggers in the worlde, our Cowe-keeper here of Iames citty on Sundayes goes acowterd all in freshe flaming silkes and a wife of one that in England had professed the black arte not of a scholler but of a collier of Croydon, weares her rough beuer hatt wth a faire perle hattband, and a silken suite therto correspo- §e§ndent. But to leaue the Populace, and to come higher, the Gouernor here, who at his first coming, besides a great deale of worth in his person, brought onely his sworde wth him, was at his late being in London, together wth his lady, out of his meer gettings here, able to disburse very near three thousand pound? to furnishe himselfe for his voiage. And once wthin seuen yeares, I am persuaded (absit invidia verbo) that the Gouernors place here may be as proffitable as the lord Depuities of Irland. All this not wthstanding, I may say of my selfe, that when I was the last yeare wth yor lop at Middleborough, si mens non laeua fuisset, I might haue gone to the Hagh wth you, and founde my selfe there nowe in far better company, wch indeed is the soule of this life, and might haue bene deeply ingrafted into yor lops seruice, wch since I haue a thousand times affected in vaine. And therfore seing I haue missed that singular happines, I must for what remaines, depende upon Gods prouidence, who, my hope is, wilbe so merciful towards me, as once more before I dye, to vouchsafe me the sight of your countenance, wherein, I speak vnfainedly, I shall enioye as muche happines as in any other thing I can imagine in this worlde. At my first coming hither the solitary vncouthnes of this place, compared wth those partes of Christendome or Turky where I had bene; and likewise my being sequestred from all occurrents and passages wch are so rife there, did not a little vexe me. And yet in these fiue moneths of my continuance here, there haue come at one time or another eleuen saile of ships into this riuer, but fraighted more wth igno- rance, then wth any other marchandize. At length being hardned to this custome of abstinence from curiosity, I am resolued wholly to minde my busines here, and nexte after my penne, to haue some good book alwayes in store, being in solitude the best and choicest company. Besides among these Christall riuers, &amp; odoriferous woods I doe escape muche expense, envye, contempte, vanity, and vexation of minde. Yet Good my lorde, haue a little compassion upon me, and be pleased to sende me, what pampletts and relations of the Interim since I was wth you, as yor lop shall thinke good, directing the same (if you please) in a boxe to Mr Ralfe Yeardley Apothecary (brother to Sir George Yeardley our gouer- nour) dwelling at the signe of the Hartychoke in great Woodstreet, to be sente to me by the first, together wth his brothers thinges. This pacquett I deliuered to one Marmaduke Rayner, an Englishman, who goes inter- tained as Pilott in this Flemishe man of warre. If he come to yor lop, as he hathe promised, he wilbe the fittest messenger. All possible happines I wishe to yor lop, and to my most honoured lady; and though remote in place, yet neare in affection, doe reste Yor lops euer most humbly at yor co?aunde Io: Pory Iames citty in Virginia Sept. 30. 1619.</field>

Yor courteous acceptance of so ordinarie entertein- ment, (for yu were my frend &amp; familiar) dooth double yor deserts. And yu have trebled them by the iournie yu have made for me to Sion. For all wch I return yu threefold thankes &amp; affection: wch shalbe redie to expresse it self really on yor service, upon all fit occasions. I pray yu not to faile to keep yor Coort on wendsday. Yu may please (if yu see the Companie fit &amp; in tune) to acquaint them that I am not idle in their busines, wch at the Coort my self will make knowne unto them. If yu fynd anie crosse pro- ceedings, make a motion to have them referred to the quarter Coort ap- proaching. Let them knowe there are no generall letters to the Company come to my hands. Those to the Counseil I have a good while since caused to be presented to them: but they contein no matters of speedie consultation. That wch dooth concern the Companie, shalbe brought to them in fit tyme. If wrong be offered, yu may moove those of the Counceil wch are not factious, to goe from the Coort, &amp; yor self goe wth them, rather then the publick good or Justice should be oppressed by faction. But I hope there wilbe no such proceeding. I send yu here two letters from mr Barbor for yor comfort. But keep the contents very secret to yor self. There yu fynd my care in 1001 to be paid to yu.

      <field name="fulltext">XCIV. John Rolfe. A Letter to Sir Edwin Sandys January 1619/20 Ferrar Papers. Document in Magdalene College, Cambridge. Autograph Letter, Signed, with Seals List of Records No. 154 Honored Sr Studieng wth my self what service I might doe yow, as a token of my gratefull rememberance for yor many favors and constant love shewed me, aswell in my absence as when I was ?sent wth yow I could not at this tyme devise a better, then to giue yow notice of some ?ticulers both of or ?sent estate, and what happened since the departure of the Diana. And though I am well assured, yow wilbe satisfied herein more fully by or Governor, yet I desire yor kind acceptance of this my poore indeavor. Presently after the Diana hadd her dispatch Sr George Yeardley (according to a Co?yssion directed vnto him and to the Councell of State,) caused Burgesses to be chosen in all plac? who mett at James City, where all matters therein conteyned were debated by severall Co?yttees and approved: and lykewise such other lawes enacted, as were held expedient &amp; requisite for the wellfare and peaceable govermt of this Co?on-weale. Captaine Martines Burgesses for his Planta?on were not admytted to this Assembly, the reasons I am assured yow shall receive from or Governor, who sendeth home a report of all those ?ceeding?. These principall men being at James Citie, Capten William Epps (who commandeth Smythes Hundred Company) was arraigned (as neere as might be) according to the lawdable Lawes of England, for killing one Captaine Edward Roecroft a?s Stallenge. He came hether from the North Colony in a shipp of Sr fferdinando Gorges (as he sayd) for some necessaries wch he wanted; and to coast along the shoare to fynd and discover what Harbors and riu9s he could: but through neglect of the Mr of the shipp and others she was forced a ground in a storme neere Newports Newes, and there sprang so greate a leake, that he could not carry her back againe. This myschance happened through vncivill and vnmanly word? vrged by Stallenge (there being no ?cedent malice) wth wch Captaine Epps being much moved did strike him on the heade wth a sword §in the§ skabberd a such an vnfortunate blowe, that wthin 2. daies he died. The Jury (whereof Capt Lawne was foreman a discreete and vnderstanding man) hearing the Evidence, found him guilty of Manslaughter by Chaunce meddley. The Governor fynding him (though young) yet a ?per civill gent, and of good hopes, not long after restored him to his Command. Captaine Henry Spelman being accused by Ro?te Poole (one of the inter- pretors of the Indian language) of many crimes wch might be ?iudiciall to the State in generall, and to every mans safety in ?ticular, receiued Censure at this generall Assembly. But the Governor hoping he might redeeme his fault? being §?ceeding§ much of Childishe ignorance, ?doned the p?nishmt [1b] vpon hope of amendmt. In triall whereof he was ym- ploied as interpretor to Patawamack to trade for Corne. Captaine Ward in his shipp went to Monahigon in the No: Colony in May, and returned the latter end of July, wth fishe wch he caught there. He [He] brought but a smale quantitie, by reason he hadd but little salte. There were some Plymouth shipps where he harbored, who made greate store of fishe, wch is farr larger then New-land-fishe. The George was sent by the Cape Marchant (wth the Governors consent) to New-found-land to trade and buy fishe for the better releif of the Colony and to make triall of that passage. One other reason (as I take it) was, for that the Magazin was well stoored wth good?, it was some what doubtfull, wheth9 a shipp would be sent to carry home the cropp so sone as the George might vpon her returne back. She departed hence about the 9th of July, and arriued here againe about the 10: of Septembr. She made her passage to Newfound-land in less then 3. weekes, and was at the banck amongst the french fishermen in 14. daies. She came back hether againe in 3. week?, wth bare wynd?, and brought so much fishe as will make a saving voyadge, wch, besid? the greate releif, giveth much content to the wholl Colony. ? the Sturgeon shipp and the Triall departed hence togeth9 about the fiue of July. Mr Pountys hath taken greate paines in fishing, and toward Michellmas (the weather being somewhat temperate) made some good sturgeon. He hopeth by the spring to be better fitted, wth Cellars and houses, and to do some good therein. The Cattle in the Triall came exceeding well, and gaue the Colony much ioy and greate incouragemt. Both they horses and Mares wilbe very vendible here a long tyme, the Colony increasing wth people as of late. About the latter end of August, a Dutch man of Warr of the burden of a 160 tu?es arriued at Point-Comfort, the Comandors name Capt Jope, his Pilott for the West Indies one Mr Marmaduke an Englishman. They mett wth the Tr?r in the West Indyes, and determyned to hold consort shipp hetherward, but in their passage lost one the other. He brought not any thing but 20. and odd Negroes, wch the Governor and Cape Marchant bought for victuall? (whereof he was in greate need as he ?tended) at the best and easyest rat? they could. He hadd a lardge and ample Co?yssion from his Excellency to range and to take purchase in the West Indyes. Three or 4. daies after the Tr?r arriued. At his arriuall he sent word prsently to the Gou9nor to know his pleasure, who wrote to him, and did request myself Leiftenante Peace and Mr Ewens to goe downe to him, to desyre [2a] him to come vp to James Cytie. But before we gott downe he hadd sett saile and was gone out of the Bay. The occasion hereof hap- pened by the vnfrendly dealing of the In?itant? of Keqnoughton, for he was in greate want of victuall?, wherewth they would not releive him nor his Company vpon any termes. he reported (whilst he staied at Keq- noughton) that if wee gott not some Ord'nance planted at Point Comfort, the Colony would be quyte vndone and that ere long: for that vndoubtedly the Spanyard would be here the next §spring§ wch he gathered (as was sayd) from some Spanyard? in ye West Indyes. This being spread abroade doth much disharten the people ingenerall. ffor wee haue no place of strength to retreate vnto, no shipping of c9teynty (wch would be to vs as the wodden walles of England) no sound and experienced souldyers to vndertake, no Engineers and arthmen to erect work?, few Ordenance, not a serviceable carriadge to mount them on; not A?uny?on of powlder, shott and leade, to fight and 2. wholl dayes, no not one gunner belonging to the Planta?on, so yor Honors or soveraignes dignity, yor honors or poore reputa?ons §lives§ and labors thus long spent lieth too open to a suddayne, and to an inevitable hazard, if a forroigne enemy oppose against §vs§. Of this I cannot better doe, to giue yow full satisfac?on, then to referr yow to the iudgemt and opynion of Capt Argall who hath often spoken and herof during his govermt, and knoweth (none better) these defect?. That the Spaun- iard would be there next Spring1 1 This leaflet is bound into a very thick and wide folio volume of pamphlets. It is a small quarto of 3 pages. About the begynnyng of Septembr J-apazous (the King of Patawamack? brother) cames to James Cyty to the Governor. Amongst other frivoulous messag? he requested, that 2. shipps might be speedyly to Patawamack where they should trade for greate stoore of corne. Herevpon (according to his desyre) the Governor sent an Englishman wth him by land, and in the begynning of October, Capt Ward? shipp and So?er-Iseland? frigate departed James Cyty hether-ward. Ro?te Poole being wholly ymployed by the Governor of messag? to the greate King, ?swaded Sr George, that if he would send Pledg? he would, he would come to visite him. Or Corne and Tobacco being in greate aboun- dance in or ground? (for a more plentyfull yere then this, it hath not pleased God to send vs since the beginning of this Planta?on, yet very contagious for sycknes, whereof many [2b] both old and new men died) the Governor sent two men vnto him, who were returned wth frivoulous aunsweres, sayng he never hadd any intent to come vnto him. The Gou9nor being iealous of them (the rath9 because wee hadd many straggling Planta?ons, much weakened by the greate mortality, Poole lykewise proving very dishonest) requested Captaine William Powell and myself (for Opachan- kano ?fesseth much love to me, and giueth much credite to my word?) to goe in a shallopp unto Pomonkey ryver: wch wee did. Going vp that ryver wthin 5. myles of his house wee sent Capt Spelman and Tho: Hobson vnto him wth the Governors message. The shipp and frigate (being not farr out of their way to Patawamack) went in the night about 12. myles into the riu9, and wee hasting vpp wth or shallopp, the messengers were wth Opaihankano, before or asone as any newes came to him eyther of the shipps or or arriuall, wch much daunted them and putt them in greate feare. Their intertaymt at the first was harshe, (Poole being even turned heathen) but after their message was delyuered, it was kindly taken, they sent away lovingly, and Poole accused and Condemned by them, as an instrumt that sought all the meanes he could to breake or league. They seemed also to be very weary of him. Sh Opachankano much wondered I would not goe to him, but (as I wished the messengers) they said I was syck of an ague, wherewth they was were satisfied. Wee hadd no order to bring Poole away, nor to make any shew of discontent to him, for feare he should ?swade them to some myscheif in or corne feild?, hoping to gett him away by fayre meanes. So wee returned in greate love and amyty to the greate content of the Colony, wch before liued in dayly hazard, all messag? being vntruly delyu9ed by Poole on both sid?. A Plentifull yeare but Contagious. ? ? ? The Chikahomynies come not at vs, but wee receyue no domage by them. The Governor hath bounded the lymytt? of the 4. Cerpora?ons the Com- panies, the Governors, the Vniversity and Glebe land? according to the Co?yssion. [3a] All the Ancient Planters being sett free haue chosen plac? for their dividend? according to the Co?yssion. Wch giueth all greate content, for now knowing their owne land?, they strive and are prpared to build houses §&amp;§ to cleere their ground? ready to plant, wch giveth the * * * greate incouragemt, and the greatest hope to make the Colony florrish that ever yet happened to them. More hope then ever of the Col- lonys florisheng. Vpon the 4. of November the Bona Noua arriued at James Cyty. All the passengers came lusty and in good health. They came by the west Indyes, wch passage at that season doth much refreshe the people. The proporcon9 of Victuall? brought for those 100. men fell so short, that Captaine Welden and Mr Whitaker? were forced (notwthstanding or plenty) to putt out 50. or thereabout? for a yere, by the Governors and Councell? advise. ffor whom they are to receyue the next yere, 3. barrell? of corne and 55? of tobacco for a man; wch their sicknes considered (for seldom any escapeth little or much) is more then they of themselues could eu9 gett. By this meanes the next yere, they wilbe instructed to ?ceed in their owne busynes and be well instructed to teache new-co?ers. Wth the remaynder (being about 25. a peece, the one is seated wth one Capt Mathewes 3. myles beyond Henrico for his owne securytie, and to his greate content. And Mr Whithakers wthin 4. myles of James Cyty on the Companies land. ? Vpon Saterday the 20th of November at night Mr Ormerod died at James Cytie, after a long and tedious sicknes, the cheif occasion the flux, wch of late hath much raigned amongst vs. His death is generally much lamented, the Colony receyving hereby a greate loss, being a man of so good life, learnyng &amp; carriadge as his fellow here he left not behing him. ? ? One Mr Darmer a gent sent out by the Plymouth Company arriued here about the end of September in a smale bottome of 7. or 8. tu?es, he hadd coasted from Monah[ucon] to or Planta?on, and found an Inland sea to the No: of vs, the depth whereof he could not search for want of meanes, and wynter co?yng on. He is fitting his smale vessell, and purposeth this spring to make a new tryall. ? Note this well This Mr Darmer vpon his returne a gaine out of Virginia went fur- ther to Discover this Inland sea as he Called it but he and all his were Cutt of by the Indians It was one the South of Cape Cod toward? Vir- ginia this Sea. ? Capt Lawne at his arriuall seated himself in Wareskoyack Bay wth his Company, but by his owne sycknes and his peoples (wherein there was improvidency) he quytted his Planta?on, went vpp to Charles Cyty, and about Novembr died. So his ?iect is lykely (vnles better followed and well seconded) to come to nothing. Smythes Hundred people are seated [are seated] at Dauncing Point, the most convenyent place wthin their lymitt?. There hath bene much sycknes amongst them: so yt this yere no matter of gaine or of greate industry can be expected from them. Martynes Hundred men seated at Argall Towne wth good &amp; convenyent houses haue done best of all New-Co?ers. Many who were industrious having reaped good cropps, but most not of equall spiritt and industrious haue less, yet exceeded other New-Co?ers. Many of these haue also died by sycknes, but not comparab comparable to other plac?. ? ? About the latter e begynning of Decembr Capt Ward wth his shipp and the frigate came from Patawamack. Japasons hadd dealt falsely wth them, for they could gett little trade, so that they brought not aboue 800 bushell?, the most ?te whereof they tooke by force from Jupasons Country who deceyued them, and a smale quantyty they traded for. But in conclusion being very peaceable wth all the oth9 Indyans, at their departure they also made a firme peace againe wth Japazons. ? ? At this tyme also came Captaine Woodiff in a smale shipp of Bristow, who brought his people very well, and made his passage in tenn week?. Thus ffarr farr as ?te of my duty (ever ready at yor service) haue I breifly made knowen vnto yow, some ?tyculers of or estate: and wthall in con- clusion cannot chose but reveale vnto yow the sorrow I conceyve, to heare of the many accusa?ons heaped vpon Captaine Argall, wth whom my reputa?on hath bene vniustly joynted [4a] but I am ?swaded he will aunswere well for himself. Here haue also bene divers deposy?ons taken and sent home by the Diana, I will tax no man therein: but when it shall come to farther triall, I assure yow that yow shall fynd many dishonest and faithles men to Captaine Argall, who haue receyued much kindnes at his hand? &amp; to his face will contradict, and be ashamed of much, wch in his absence they haue intymated against him. Lastly, I speake on my owne experience for these 11. yeres, I neuer amongst so few, haue seene so many falseharted, envious and malicious people (yea amongst some who march in the better ranck) nor shall yow ever §heare§ of any the iustest Governor here, who shall liue free, from their scandall? and shameles exclama?ons, if way be given to their report?. And so desyring yor kind acceptance hereof, being vnwilling to conceale any thing from yorself (who now, to myne and many others comfort?, standeth at the helme to guide vs and bring vs to or the Port of or best happynes, wch of late wee say principally by yor goodnes wee now inioy) eyther wch yow may be desyrous to vnderstand or wch may further yow for the advauncemt of this Christian Planta?on I take my leave, and will ever rest At yor service and commaund in all faithfull dutyes Jo: Rolf.

The defect is (wch makes me sigh) that my sufficiencies from hence (heu quantum est in rebus inane!) cannot in the thousand parte answere yours euery way so complete, out of England. And though I had it in my person, yet the place so newly inhabited wantes many helpes, wherwth those ciuiler partes doe abounde. Howbeit this yeare to come (for the last was full of infirmities in all kindes) so it please God to con- tinue my health as it is, being neuer more perfect in any place wheresoeuer I haue remained, I will rouze up my spirits to doe all that may be possible. Neither shall the vncertainty of my being continued, or by some newe gouernour thrust out of my place, any whitt dismay me from performance of my duty for the Interim; for that is a stroke, though many times vnjust and cruell, for wch there is no sense. In this dispatche I haue sente you enclosed in a letter of mine to the Counsell and company, a copie of a warrant from the Gouernr: and Counsell here, for establishing my fees, according as it was there ordered in courte, before my coming awaye. Herein (as all of them can be my witnesses) I was not mine owne caruer at all; but they in [1b] mine absence, and wthout my suggestion, did order mine allowance, as appeareth in the same copie. For the first whole yeare from the time my co?ission was deliuered me, I receiued not a farthing, and since that, very little, being faine to trust the most of those I doe seruice for. If the Company shalbe pleased to confirme vnto me that, wch all men of reason here do thinke to be but reasonable, I shall esteem both my hazard and my paines well bestowed, although, do what I can, I feare me, that at my three yeares ende I shall skarce make a sauing voiage. In su?a su?ar?, whatsoeuer they in their wisdom and bounty shall thinke fitte to allotte me I will rest contented. ? ? Now in answere to your letter by the same ship. Your loue I do most thankfully acknowledge; and I thinke Sir George Yeardley will not deny, but he hath still cause to affect me euery day more and more. To that noble Earle I am deeply bound, who cannot but testifie on my behalfe, that when he employed me in his owne particular seruice I performed it fully to his minde, and aboue his expectation, and will hope to do the like, if euer I shall haue the honour to serue him againe. As it hath bene your indeuour to maintaine his lops good fauour toward? Sir George Yeardley, so (as you will perceiue by somewhat that comes in this dispatche) it hath bene my care to nourish Sir George his due respect and worthy seruice towards his lop, and this also out of regard to the good of [2a] Virginia. It would grieue me, that any error or disaster should haue any power to worke any contrary effecte. But you knowe that human? est errare, and disasters what wisedome can preuent? If his lop be offended in ought, it wilbe in respect of his more then ordinary affection towards Captain Argall, whose faultes Sir George was bounde by co?ission, and for the saluing of his owne reputation also, to discouer. Sir George Yeardley, I thinke, would not robb Captaine Argall of my lordes loue, for he hath in him to deserue muche; nor would he haue his lop to haue spent so muche loue upon any man in vaine; but onely doth wishe that Captain Argall being riche, a Bachelour, and deuoid of chardge, would not so excessiuely intende his owne thrifte. As touching Sir George his intercepting of my letters, his lop I knowe (so noble is he) will not be implacable. And on the other side, I knowe not howe he will interpret that wch hath bene written concerning the Treasurer (wch Argall called his ship, while she was here) or concerning Spelmans vnaduised using of his lops name to Opo- chancano. Meane while in the dangers wherein the Colony stood, Sir George thought himselfe vnworthy of a remedy, vnlesse he had sett downe the truth of the case. What tempestes that answere of his by the Diana, and those other letters then and since haue raised in your court, I doe almost fear to think of. Without his co?andement I did nothing [2b] and that wch I did, he viewed and reuiewed still to a syllable. All wch upon the sending away of this dispatch we throughly perused, and he constantly auowes and Justifies euery iota and title. Jacta est alea, and some body must run the hazard of it. But if we be blamed for doing part of our duty, then what should we haue bene, if we had done all? All that I can say is, that whatsoeuer errours of mine be represented back hither (for in the distemper I was in, I could not chuse, but co?itte some) I shall be more willing to amende, then euer I was to co?itte, and shall honour them most, that read me my lesson most roundly. And whosoeuer do so, shall in my conceipte do far better, then those others (who they were, I knowe not) that by the Marigolde putt this gouernour for the time (whenas I serued him wth the greatest fidelity and zeale that was possible) into so many violent needles Jelousies against me, which notwthstanding had not the force to batter downe my patience of prooff. That lawe of iustice and friendship so to doe right to one friend, as to beware of offring wrong to another, I haue as duely obserued, as I could any way deuise. And you shall well perceiue, howe I haue concurred with you to close up the breache, wch was in danger to haue growen wyder. So haue I euer since my coming hither performed the parte of a true friend, and that for the publique good, wherin I pray god, we may all haue Joye. For per- forming my requestes, wthowt answering my letters, I most humbly [3a] thanke you. This far in answere of your kinde letter. I haue sente you in Sir George his boxe of letters directed both to your selfe, and to his brother, the copies of our two dispatches both by the Prosperous and the Flemish man of warre, to the ende, that if you haue occasion, you may make use of them. I haue sent you also inclosed wth this, the copie of my letter to you by the Fleming; and a copie also of my letter I write nowe to my lord of Warwick, to the end you should from my part, be ignorant of nothing wherby you may doe any good office between that most noble lord and Sir George Yeardley, and for none other purpose. This secret I would not putt into §any§ hand but yours, nor into yours, but onely for that intent. I am to confident of your true worth, as I dare putt my life into your handes, and therfore this, wch I hold not much inferiour. By the Bona noua I purpose to sende you copies of suche graunts of lande, as we shall haue passed to the ende, that if you like not the forme, you may be pleased to reforme it. If you receiued Sir George his dispatche by the Prosperous I would beseech you to viewe the general petition §against Captaine Argall§ of those nine of James citty, §contained in one sheet§ and to compare the original wth the copie sent you nowe in Sir George his boxe, and if you finde neuer so little difference between them §though but a worde§ that you would vouchsafe to giue me notice by the first, for it may concerne me. You may best doe it by correcting the said copie by the original, and sending it back againe. More time I will not presume to rob you of, that haue so many better wayes to employe it. [3b] Mine humble duty and seruice I beseech you to present to your noble and vertuous lady. And so wishing her Idp, your selfe, and your generous ofspring all happines, I reste ? ? ? ? ? Yours euer most humbly bounden to loue and serue you. Jo: Pory. James Citty Jan. 13th 1619. Postscript Wheras in my letter by the Fleming I wrote concerning Poole the Inter- preter, that Sir George would make him sure for telling any more false tales to Opochancano, if once he gott him into his power; at Pooles coming lately home we were quite of another opinion. For bringing the Kinges picture as a messenger from Opochancanough, we counted him a pub- lique, and as it were a neutral person, and so for not discontenting Opoe- chancanough, wth whom nowe we stand in termes of reconciliation, we thought it no wayes convenient to call Poole to accounte. One fauour yet I must humbly beseech of you, and that is, after this dis- patche hath bene perused in the courte, you would be pleased to sende it my lo: Carewe to read it ouer, and likewise if there be any thing wch his lop hath not seen in the last dispatche by the fleming. At the sealing up of this I cannot finde the copie of my letter to you by the Fleming, wch, it may be, you shall finde in one of the other pacquett?.

Nor doth it appear whether the passages of all the rest that in the same note go vnder the name of Passengers be payd for, or freely given by the Company. Captain Welden saith, the Com- pany gave him passage for twoe, Thomas Smyth and Edward Kerby gen- tlemen, wch the Gouernr will not accept of as a warrant sufficient to saue him harmeles, wthout certificat from the Company. Wch two, together wth Adames that goes vnder the name of Mr Whitakers man, the Gouernr will not lett passe for England; nor yet Mr Hansbies man in pledge of George Eden that by your order is to go for Smyths hundred, till such time as he receive other order from the Company, or vntill there come three others in their roome Of Vignerons, of those that haue skill in breeding silkewormes, and such* as know how to handle and dresse flaxe for the managing of our silke grasse, If the company will not have most of their ships continually to returne home empty, there would be good numbers sought out and sent.

Letter, Signed List of Records No. 158 Honoble Knight Once more give me leave to interrupt yow § in § answeringe an obiection wch some may make against Sr George Yeardley for ?feringe to serve ye Cõpany in his place of his governemt, for his three yeares in Case he be continued gratis. Against this some man may alleadge that he hath broke his proffer in takinge this yeare a rente of Corne and tobacco, though not much, from Martins hundred people, whom Capt Argall had placed on the G[overno]rs lande. To this he answeres, first that what he received from them did not arise out of ye labours of those fifty of his guarde, wch ye Company allowed him, by whose labor he hath not yet reaped a penny benefit, save onely and meerely in Corne, wch he Cannot Converte into mony, because he muste reserve yt for his next yeares provision. Secondly he is at least 80011 sterlinge out of purse by reason of this Chardgeable employmt and that yf he should heale vp his estate againe out of ye Governors lande, onely to that su?e, and no farther, yet might he be sayd to serve them, gratis, havinge made but owne of owne. But still he ?fesseth as in his former that he Consecrateth that expence wholly to ye service of ye Colony, that he will not from henceforth rayse a penny proffit out of those mens labors that remaine of his guarde. or that shalbe sent over for a farther addition, but apply it wholly to ye buildinge and mayntaininge a fort at Point Comforte: and lastly that he tooke that petty rente of Martins Hundred people, to make them acknowledge by ye same act of theirs that Paspaheigho by expresse wordes in ye greate Co?ission did belonge to ye Governor and that they had bene wrongfully seated by Capt Argall vpon that lande, wch both he had instructions, and Sr George Yeardley Co?ission to lay out for ye Governors vse. ? ? Sr George adviseth not onely ye Adventurers for Smythes hundred, but ye generall Company also, to send hither husbandmen truely bred (whereof here is a greate scarcity, or none at all) both to manage ye Plough. and breake or oxen and horses to that busines. Besides he wisheth ye generall Company would send greate store of Vignerons, and Vine plants of a good race though growinge in England, albeit they woulde doe better to be had of ffrance and Spaine. Mr Nicholas Leate ye Marchant hath vpon my knowledge or (I am sure) had a lardge vine of Corynth grapes at ye house he formerly dwelt in ye garden whereof Containinge ye same vine is parted but by a wall from ye §garden of the§ house where he nowe dwelleth. It grewe when I sawe yt against ye North wall of ye same garden wch supported it toward? ye South sune. If yow Could ?cure any slips of that howe [1b] gainefull might they prove wth in seven or Eight yeares, heere beinge h[eat] enough both to ripen and to dry them? There belonge so many severall skills to ye plantinge and dressinge of a vineyard and to ye makinge and preservinge of wines, whereof or nation is ignorant, as needes must wee have Vignerons from from forraine partes: And vineyards beinge once planted where such infinite store of caske may be provided, wee might §for want of other co?odities§ lade all ye ships that come, wth as rich wines as ffrance or Spaine doth yeild. Sr George brought hither some plant? wch doe prosper passinge well, but his Vigneron being a fretfull olde man is dead. And because Canary wine is ye most durable in all voyages and Climates of anie, and so Consequently ye most salable and proffitable: yt would doe passinge well, yf wee could get store of plant? from thence, * * * yt would one day acquite ye Cost to ?cure plant? of those wines * * * ly and Greece, wch doe emulate ye Nectar. Then this, no Country is more apt for that purpose; for in time of yeare yow Can scarce walke three steps in any place vnmanured, where some vine or other will not be ready to entangle yor foote. But of this subiect enough, whereof I have so lardgely dilated, not because I thirst after yt; for I thanke god, I drinke water here wth as much (yf not more) pleasure §and§ contente, as I dranke wine in those part?. ? ? ?

Tobacco not a needfull Com- modity ffor ye dressinge hatchellinge, and makinge marchantable silke grasse, flaxe and hempe, hither would be sent men of professed and practised skill---it may be some might be founde in England. Tobacco onely takes vp as much labor and care, as all these (yea yf yow should adde some one Co?odity more) Can employ or exercise. ffor in sowing plantinge, weedinge, worminge, gatheringe, Curinge, and making vp, it Consumes ten monethes at least, yf not eleven.

The extreame Care, diligence, and labor spent about yt, doth prepare or people for some more excellente subiect. All those other Comodities can prosper in a wet yeare, when tobacco proves starke naught. Besides they are not in danger of frost, wch sometimes overthrowes ye greatest parte of ye tobacco in ye lande. And though this yeare (wch was a most extraordinary good yeare both for Corne and To- bacco) I thinke there will goe home ten thowsand waighte at least as good as ever Came out of ye Indies; yet are wee not to set or rest vpon a Co?- odity as much importuned as little necessary.

One thinge more I am willed to adde for a Postscript; and that is a reason yet vnalleadged why ye greater parte of the Companies and Colledge men sent hither in ye Bona Nova are put out to olde planters. It is because those that ye Company hath appointed to governe them are men quite vnexpercienced in this Country, and therefore not fit to take so greate a chardg vpon them at ye first, as ye Comaundinge and ye directing and orderinge of fifty men a piece. The greater parte of wch by that time their yeares service to those old men is expired, wilbe men well seasoned and skillfull to labor themselves and those two gentlemen their Governors by that tyme also wilbe more apt to take chardge over them all.

Copy of Opinion of Counsel upon the Patents of the Virginia Company May, 1620 Manchester Papers, No. 271 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 170 Vpon Considera?on of the patent? &amp; of the questions move therevpon, I am of oppinion as followeth. 1 That Sr Thomas Smithe is not so absolutely made T?er by the 2 patent as that he is not removable by the lawes &amp; orders of the company; either vpon his owne Desire to surrender the place; or vpon other cause wch they shall conceyve to be reasonable; ffor although yt may seeme a hard expo- si?on of the wordes (or other seu9all occasions) that there wills shalbe taken as an occasion to remove him; wthout expressing any iust cause in certeyne yett when they haue removed him by a gen9all consent; it is not now to be questioned (as I Conceyve) whether they had lawfull cause or no; but there doing? are to be holden lawfull &amp; iust: &amp; §that by§ the inten?on of the 2 patent wthout any helpe of the third; But when a Lawe (by authority of the 3 patent is made) at a gen9all court by Consent of the wholl Company that all officers shall cease at such a tyme &amp; newe to be chosen; that is byndinge, &amp; makes this point wthout question as I take yt 2 That by the clause of the 3 patent where the wordes are (we do give &amp; graunt to the sayd t?er &amp; Company &amp; there successors foreu9 by theis ?nt?, that the sayd t?er &amp; Company or the greater nomber of them so assembled (viz at the gen9all quarter Court?) shall &amp; may haue full powe &amp; authority to choose Councillors &amp; officers &amp; to make lawes &amp;c That in this case the greater nomber of the Company wthout the t?er may make Lawes &amp;c: &amp; that as well when there is no t?er at all, as when he is absent; ffor as I do conceyve this great &amp; gen9all Quarter Court wch is appointed by the 3 patent onely may be held wthout any t?er at all; and all thing? are to be dispatched there by the greater nomber of the company then assembled, &amp; that by the expresse wortes of the patent; ffor although the graunt be to the sayd t?er &amp; Company for the doinge of theis thinges at this Court, yett that is but for forme onely, because all graunt? must be made to them by there name of Corpora?on &amp; yt is not requisite that the t?er should be ?n?e or haue any voice in the makinge of theis Lawes; But for the holdinge of the petty Court? apointed by the patent, (&amp; to be su?oned by the t?er) the t?er must be one by expresse wordes, but so it is not here; Neither hath the t?er any negatiue voice in the makinge of theis Lawes, nor can hinder the doinge of any thinge wch the greater nomber of the Company at this gen9all Court will do; and therefore in reason his ?nce, is not needfull, the rather seinge he is not appointed by the patent to be ?nte, as he is at the other Court?. 3 I am of oppinion that the Company (wthout the t?er) having power to make Lawes at the gen9all Court, haue also power to repeall &amp; abrogate all or any former Lawes as yt seemes they haue done, for the Lawe of repeall is a Lawe as well as the former &amp; eodem modo quo Constituitur Dissoluitur; And so the Lawes that were made for the degrees of estab- lishing Lawes, &amp; for elec?on of officers by the balladinge boxe, though they were excellent &amp; Comendable; yett being repealed by the same authority they were made, they are gone &amp; determined 4 Sr Edwin Sandes cannott be Continued t?er by the act of the company vpon his former elec?on, for that is against the Lawe of the company that all officers shall cease at the quarter courte Day in Easter terme yearely; but the Company may then choose him anewe, as yt is likely they did 5 I thinke that the Company here hath no power by the wordes of the 2 patent either to punishe or ?don offences co?itted in Virginia especially in Capitall or criminall causes; 1 because they haue no power to ?ceed here against any such offence, as the gou9nor there may do; &amp; yf not to ?ceed against it then not to ?don yt; 2 although that graunt of the patent, be aswell to the t?er &amp; Company &amp; there successors, as to the gou9nor; yett the power is given to them accordinge to the natures &amp; Limitt? of there offices &amp; places, respectiuely, that they shall &amp; may wth in the ?cinct? of Virginia or in the way by the seas thither &amp;c: haue full power to Correct punishe ?don gou9ne &amp; Rule &amp;c: Nowe when a gou9nor is chosen &amp; sent thither he hath a kinde of Regall power to execute Lawes &amp; to punishe offenders there and also to ?don them yf he see cause &amp; that by the wordes of the patent; wch is more then the Company can do here; for any offence Co?itted here, where the offence requires the punishmt of life or member; muche lesse for any offence done there (as I Conceyve) because they are not to execute any Lawes there but by ther gou9nor; And besides so muche may be gathered vpon the wordes of the 3 patent where the Company are authorised to remaund &amp; send backe offenders to virginia there to be punished and ?ceeded against accordinge to the Lawes there established for offences there co?itted, and the reason is apparant because that by those lawes nor by any other they Cannott be ?ceeded against here for offences done there, nor ?doned here when they are ?ceeded against there; And so I thinke that for all matters wherein the gou9nor may ?ceed there by lawes there established, &amp; for matters ?? to his Gou9nemt, the Company here haue no power to Controll his act?: And the clause of the 3 patent whereby the Company are authorised either to punishe misbehauiors or Contempt? or to send the offendors to virginia to be punished is to taken seu9ally &amp; distributiue reddendo singula singulis; that is for offences that are co?itted against the company here (&amp; against wch they may ?ceed) they may punishe the offenders here; But for offences done in Virginia against the peculiar Lawes there established for that gou9nemt, they must send the offendors thither to be punished or not at all; and being ?ceeded against there by those Lawes, they are not to be ?doned here; And this I take to be the playne meaninge of both the patent? touching this point.

But I heard (wch contented me) first by Mr Bluet &amp; My Cosen David Sandys, who have been here these 3 dayes, &amp; since by Captain Wilkins, who came this morning, that yu were very well. We expected this morning, that the Bonaventure would have been come about: now they expect hir this evening. And till then I am told that I may not stirr from hence, by reason of som writings wch must have my hand unto them. ffor as for my owne letters, they are readie to an haire: having spent in a manner all my tyme here, in writing letters &amp; Directions, to &amp; for Virginia. ffor I have left neither person, nor thing unanswered: nor omitted anie thing to the best of my understanding, wch might serve for advancement of the busines. So carefull have I been to be no example of negligence: wch I knowe or people there would be too prone to imitate. This I knowe yu will hold for a iust cause, &amp; no excuse, of my abode here longer then I before had purposed. But would to God there were no other cause then that. Then should I be free from as much sorroe, care, &amp; feare, as I ever endured for anie one thing in my life. ffor my wife by reason of a fever, wch seazed on hir last thursday, hath had such an inflammation on the one side of hir neck, that it §hath§ excoriated hir throte on the inside, wch is most dangerous for hir life. And although I humbly thank God, we hope it beginneth §now§ to hele: yet dooth it deprive hir (beeing wth chyld) of all strengthning nourish- ment, &amp; thereby is as dangerous to hir &amp; hirs another way. Twice she hath been let blood, &amp; one tyme purged: wch §also§ encreaseth hir weaknes. All wch notwithstanding, such &amp; so strong is hir affection, that she will by no meanes §be§ persuaded to stay behynd me: so that on Thursday God permitting we set out, entending to take leysure, &amp; make it three days woork. I have enlarged to yu these particulars, that yu may thoroughly free me from blame. Besides in verification of the Italian Proverb, Il mal non viene mai scompagnato; my Coachman going one eevening to Sandwich, &amp; falling into the hands of thiefs, was so grievously beaten &amp; wounded that hetherto we have very small hope of his life: though he be dayly looked to by a good physitian &amp; surgeon: wch enforceth me to be bold wth som of my neighbors to borroe one. Howsoever, if I be alive, looke for me on Saturday. Mean tyme, I pray yu keep Wendsday Coort: though for no other busines, yet to revive the three Committees set on foot before Easter. The first, for examination of the Acts of the Generall Assembly in Virginia. The second, for the prizes unpaid, &amp; monie unbrought in of the Great Standing Lottarie. The third, for all the Debts yet due by the Companie. On the same day I pray yu also not to faile, to begin yor Accounts of this yeare wth the Auditors: (for so is the order:) ffor when yors are finished, myne will hold them but one hower. I trust yu have taken order wth Mr Barbor, to be here by this Day fort- night at farthest: that so all or Accounts may be made clere &amp; perfect.

Printed Document in New York Public Library List of Records No. 174 By the Treasuror, Councell and Company for Virginia. THE Treasuror, Councell and Company for Virginia, to the Gouernour of Virginia, and the Councell of Estate there residing, Greeting. We haue to our great griefe receiued aduertisement of the mortality, which this last yeere hath there wrought vpon the People, to the consumption of diuers hundreds, and almost the vtter destruction of some particular Plantations. And although we cannot herein but with much humility acknowledge the iust finger of Almighty God, by this seuerity of chastisement, to recall vs and you from those grieuous transgressions, which draw downe, euen from clemency itselfe, such necessary punishments; and accordingly aduise you, together with our selues, to humble vs in due contrition, before his mercifull hand; and by future amendment, in better attending the Diuine worship, and more carefully obseruing his holy and iust Lawes, to worke a recon- ciliation, and to entreate the renewing of his most gracious fauour towards vs. Yet obseruing on the other side, that this mortality hath proceeded from a disease in it selfe not mortall, and accordingly hath most wrought vpon the new Plantations, who (contrary to our hopes and intended pro- uisions) were destitute of those meanes, which should haue relieued and cherished them in their weakenesse and sicknesse, of which the ancienter Inhabitants being prouided, did recover: We therfore, according vnto our place and Christian duty, taking into our carefull considerations the redresse and preuention of these defects in all future times: That both the Colony may better attend the seruice of God, and that the people now sent, and which hereafter shall come, may be the better prouided against that, and the like sicknesses, (seing in the health of the People, consisteth the very life, strength, encrease, and prosperity of the whole generall Colony) doe with mature deliberation and vnanime consent, ordaine and establish as hereafter followeth. First, we ordaine and require, that in conuenient time, after the sight and publication hereof, the foure ancient generall Burroughs, called Iames City, Henrico, Charles City, and Kicowtan, (which hereafter shall be called Elizabeth City, by the name of his Maiesties most vertuous and renowned Daughter,) as also the other seuerall particular Plantations, shall each of them, at their common charge, labour, and industry, frame, build, and perfect, with all things thereto belonging, a common house, to bee called a Guest house, for the lodging and entertaining of fifty persons in each, vpon their first arriuall. Of which houses, to be raised in due and whole- some places, each shall be sixteene foot broad within, and nine score foot long, (vnlesse it seeme good to diuide that length into two houses:) And in each of them shall be set vp all along on the one side, fiue and twenty Bedsteads of foure foot broad, sixe foot long, and two foot height from the ground in equall distance, and with partitions of Boords betweene them: And there shall be raised in each of th? in conuenient places, fiue Chimnies. These houses we also require to be strongly built for continu- ance, with windowes well placed for wholesomnes of aire. And although it were reason that each Burrough should beare the charge of such an house entirely, being for the health and safety of their people: Yet for their better encouragement, we haue, and by these presents doe grant and giue to each Burrough, in consideration and aide of that worke, two Kine or Heifers, to be deliuered at our charges, for the beginning of a stocke of cattell, for their common or Burrough Land, by vs formerly granted. And to the end that the People, both present and to come, may be faithfully brought vp in the true knowledge and seruice of Almighty God, and so learne to frame their liues and conuersations, as not onely, not to prouoke the Diuine indignation, which pursueth the faithlesse and diso- bedient soules by sundry kinds of punishment to euerlasting destruction: but also by their good example, to allure the Heathen people to submit themselues to the Scepter of Gods most righteous and blessed Kingdome, and so finally to ioyne with them in the true Christian profession: We doe hereby ordaine and require, that in euery Burrough there be prouided and placed at the least one godly and learned Minister, to be chosen in each particular Plantation by the seuerall Aduenturers and Planters; And for the foure ancient Burroughs, to be prouided and nominated by vs, and our Successors; As also for the Tenants and Inhabitants of the Companies Land wheresoeuer: Leauing alwaies to the Gouernour to prouide a Minister for his Tenants, and to the Colledge for theirs. All which Ministers and their Successors, we earnestly pray and require to apply themselues with all diligence, to the training vp of their charge in the way of righteousnesse, as the same is now professed, and by Law established in this Church of England, and other his Maiesties Dominions, auoiding all factions, and needlesse Nouelties, tending onely to the disturbance of peace and vnity. And wheras we haue ordained heretofore, that one hundred acres of Glebe land be set out and allotted for euery Minister, besides other profits out of the Inhabitants encrease: We doe hereby also ordaine, that the said Ministers be furnished, each with sixe Tenants, towards the occupying of his Glebe land: which sixe, for the Ministers belonging to the publike lands; that is to say, the Gouernours, Colledges, and Companies Land, shall bee sent and furnished wholly at the common charges of the Company. And for the Burroughs, as well the ancient, as those of particular Planta- tions, the Company is content to furnish out at their charges, three Tenants for each, vpon condition that the seuerall Burroughs furnish out three more: which sixe, for each Minister being once so furnished, the Ministers themselues shall be afterwards charged each to maintaine that number at the least, and so to leaue them to his Successor. And for as much as it is apparant to all vnderstanding minds, that the wealth, happinesse and stability of each particular Estate, is founded vpon the strength and prosperity of the publike, (the publike hauing been of late yeeres wholly decayed and ruined, to the inestimable losse and detriment of the whole Plantation, we haue carefully endeuoured to restore and set vp in greater height than euer, as by the supplies of sixe hundred persons for publike vse, now, and lately sent, will manifestly appeare:) We therfore vpon assured trust and confidence, that not onely your selues, the Gouernour and Councell, but the whole body of the Colonie, and euery member therof, taking into due consideration, how much the life and health of the publike Tenants may import them all, as well for their ease of publike burthens, as for support of publike Iustice, good order &amp; gouern- ment, will by all meanes apply themselues to the entertaining and prouiding for them so vpon their first arriuall, as that not onely their liues and healths bee not indangered as heretofore; but that also they may cheerfully set in hand, with the workes and labours directed and prepared for them; doe earnestly pray and require both you, and them all, that all other businesse of lesse importance laid aside, they immediatly affoord all possible assist- ance, for the raising of houses and conuenient lodgings for them, with other necessary reliefe and succour: Wherein whatsoeuer they shall doe louingly and freely of their owne voluntary accord, we shall with due thankes accept it at their hands, (desiring that particular notice be giuen to vs thereof) and for that which is to be done by them, aboue that pro- portion, there shall be recompence made of as many dayes workes by those publike Tenants, at the next possible opportunity; thinking it equall neither to refuse any helpe for the publike, nor yet to charge the priuate aboue their contents and abilities. And although we haue absolute power deriued from his Maiesty, to establish and enioyne by order the performance hereof: yet seeing this aide is to bee yeelded but this once, (the publike Tenants being henceforward to prepare for all new supplies) we haue thought better by request, to try the loue of the Colony, than their obedience by command. Lastly, for as much as it is become very apparant (which we haue often heretofore foreseene and forewarned) that the applying so altogether the planting of Tobacco, and the neglect of other more solid commodities, haue not only redounded to the great disgrace of the Countrey, and detri- ment of the Colony; but doth also in point of profit, greatly deceiue them which haue trusted to it: We therefore endeuouring to reforme this errour, and to restore due reputation to that Land and people, haue with great care and charge (assisted also with some particular Plantations) endeuoured to set vp sundry reall Commodities, and other some we haue thought fit to recommend to your care to prosecute. First, Iron, being of most necessary vse for the Colony. For the making whereof, we now furnish out 150. persons, to set vp three Iron-workes, with all Materials and other prouisions therunto belonging. Secondly, for Cordage; we much com- mend the order taken by your selues, for the planting of Silk-grasse there naturally growing, which we desire may be in the greatest abundance possible, as conceiuing it to be of chiefe importance both for vse and profit. Thirdly, for Pitch and Tarre, we aduise and require, that the Polackers be returned in part to these their works, with such other assistance as shall be necessary. The like we shall desire for Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, when there shall be fit store of hands to assist them: Requiring in the meane time, that care be generally taken, that Seruants and Apprentices be so trained vp in these works, as that the skill doe not perish together with the Masters. The Fourth commodity recommended, is Timber of all sorts, with Masts, Plancks, and Boords, for prouisions of shipping, and sundry other Materials of much vse and benefit. And to the ease and encrease of diuers of those works, prouision is now sent, for the erecting of Sawing- Milles, which may fill the whole Colony also with Plancks and Boords, to their great ease and helpe in setting vp their Buildings. The fifth, is Silke, for which that Countrey is exceeding proper, hauing innumerable store of Mulbery trees of the best. For the setting vp of which commodity, his Maiesty hath been graciously pleased, now the second time (the former hauing miscarried) to bestow vpon the Company plenty of Silk-worme-feed of his owne store, being the best to be had; which together with such other, as from other places we could procure, we haue sent to you by the DVTY, at a seasonable time of the yere; requiring the same to be dispersed amongst the Colony, with order for the vsing therof, and especially to keep the Wormes from the aire of Tobacco, which is mortall to them. The sixth is Vines, whereof the Countrey yeeldeth naturally great store, and of diuers sorts, which by culture will bee brought to excellent perfection. For the effecting whereof, diuers skilfull Vignerons heretofore, and some now are sent, with store also from hence of Vine-plants of the best sort. And here by the way we aduise and desire, that Men of those Sciences, which are not naturall to vs, be extraordinarily cherished and encouraged in their workes: seeing if they should faile, it would be difficult to supply them. The last commodity, but not of least importance for health, is Salt: the workes whereof hauing been lately suffered to decay; we now intending to restore in so great plenty, as not onely to serue the Colony for the present, but as is hoped, in short time, the great fishings on those Coasts (a matter of inestimable aduancement to the Colony) doe vpon mature deliberation ordaine as followeth: First, that you the Gouernour and Councell, doe chuse out of the Tenants for the Company, 20. fit persons to be imployed in Salt workes, which are to be renewed in Smiths Iland, where they were before; as also in taking of Fish there, for vse of the Colony, as in former time was also done. These 20. shall be furnished out at the first, at the charges of the Company, with all implements and instruments necessary for those workes. They shall haue also assigned to each of them, for their occupation or vse, 50. acres of Land, within the same Iland, to be the Land of the Company. The one moyty of Salt, Fish, and profits of the Land, shall be for the Tenants, and the other for vs the Company, to be deliuered into our Store: and this contract shall be to continue for fiue yeeres. Wee doe also hereby grant and ordaine, that if any of the old Burroughs, or other particular Plantations, shall be pleased to concurre in the same workes of making Salt, and taking Fish, they shall be admitted thereunto to the number of twenty persons or vnder, for euery Burrough or Plantation, with the like Grants as before, &amp; with the same Diuisions of profit, betweene them and their Landlords, as is before set downe betweene the Company and their Tenants. These being the commodities (for Corne and Cattell we passe ouer, being onely for sustenance of the people) which we desire to haue set vp with all care and diligence, as well for necessary vse and profit, as for the honour and reputation of the Countrey and Colony; and for the aduancing of which, we haue spared neither care nor cost, which on our parts was requisite to our best vnderstandings: It remaineth, that we earnestly pray and desire you, that you also on your parts correspond with vs in the like. And if any thing (as in so manifold businesse) shall happen on our behalfe, to haue been omitted or vnprouided, that you endeuour to supply it with all such helpe as may there be had: For vnworthy he were to be a member of that body, that would not lend his hand to the setting vp of workes so necessary and profitable, and whereof himselfe may in short time be a partaker. And whatsoeuer in that kind shall bee done through our desire, we assure you, shall be acknowledged and recompenced by vs to their iust content. Giuen in a great and generall Court held for Virginia, the 17. day of May, 1620. and in the yeere of the Raigne of our Soueraigne Lord Iames, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. viz. of England, Scotland, France and Ireland the eighteenth, and of Scotland the three and fiftieth.

Autograph Letter, Signed. Part of the Seal remains List of Records No. 178 Most Noble Lord Having not had the good fortune to attain to yor Lps presence after som-tyme attendance, &amp; beeing now forced to retire for a few days into the Contrie; I have presumed once again in these few rude lines to prezent my most humble suit &amp; service to yor Lp. I understand, by the late boastings of Sr Thomas Smith &amp; his partizans; of their sedulous endevors, by a cloud of untrueths to make a fresh inter- position between the most ioyfull light of his Maties favor, &amp; the darknes wherewith my self &amp; my service rest yet obscured. An attempt of strange malignitie: wch if I have deserved by anie offer of the least wrong to him or his, I will beare it wth patience; as the effect of iust Revenge, though not mesured by Justice. But if (beeing resolved by Gods Grace to wrong no man) I have not so much as offended Sr Thomas Smith or his upholders, save only in one kynd, in that I have not yielded to the abetting or cloking of those coorses in menaging the affairs of Virginia, wch wth derogation of his Maties authoritie, &amp; contrary to his Royall Instructions (unworthily smothered), have been held from tyme to tyme, to the dishartning of all Adventurors, &amp; perpetuall keeping down of the Plantation that it might not prosper; &amp; on the other side to the enriching of themselfs or som of them, by meanes so unlawfull as the enhazerding of the destruction &amp; utter extirpation of the Colonie: And in that it hath pleased God also so to blesse my late labors, that more hath been doon in my one yeare, wth lesse then Eight Thousand pounds, for the advancement of that Colonie in People &amp; store of Commodities, then was doon in Sr Thomas Smiths Twelve yeares, wth expence of neer Eightie Thousand pounds; as by vieu of bothe or Accounts (if yet his be an Account,) dooth manifestly appeare: Then my good Lord, I humbly tender to his Maties Princelie Justice, &amp; to yor Lps favorable mediation this equitable suit, that his Matie upon this complaint against me may be graciously pleased, to call me to my answer, before anie indifferent Judges to be deputed by his Matie. And if Sr Thomas Smith or his abettors be able to make good anie one of their materiall accusations against me; or if his Matie should please also so to appoint, (though it be farr from my dispo- sition to be an Accuser of anie man,) that I be required to make good what I have here enformed to yor Lp, &amp; I faile in anie one materiall clause thereof: I shall willingly submit my self to condign censures for bothe, &amp; from thencefoorth make utter forfeit of all hope of his Maties favor, beeing that wch of all worldlie things I most earnestly desire. It was the saying of a wise man, that One good man dooth never hate another. Seeing therfore this extreme hatred of me by Sr Thomas Smith, dooth argue a great defect of Goodnes in the one: let tryall I beseech discover the partie that is in falt. The procuring of wch iust tryall, I shall ever acknowelege as a singular &amp; eminent favor from yor noble Lp: beeing the onlie meanes remaining of dooing me right wth his Matie. Touching the former busines about the Place wch I held this last yeare for Virginia; as I wrate to yor Lp before, so now also I repeate again: If by yor Lps mediation, on wch I wholy relie, my self &amp; my service may be so accepted by his Matie, as that wth comfort &amp; courage I may proceed in this busines, I shall willingly, though to my great charge, &amp; neglect of my owne estate, (for this Busines is too great to admit anie concurrent wth it,) bestowe one yeare more in foloing this service, if wth his Maties approbation I be called unto it: And will also presume to offer a Proiect to his Matie, (wch though in som points it may seem difficult, yet is unassured in none) of raising to his Matie there a great &amp; speedie revenue, wthout charge to his Maties cofers, save som small matter to grace the Action. But if his Maties pleasure shalbe otherwise, &amp; so as to suspend me from this service: upon the least inti- mation thereof from yor Lp, I shall of my owne accord so withdraw my self from the Action, as no way to be occasion of hindering the choise of anie other, whom his Matie shalbe pleased to appoint or commend: beeing wholy resolved for no worldlie respect whatsoever, either actively or passively, so much as lyeth in my power, to be anie matter henceforward of the least offence to his Matie, trusting also that by this my willing obedience &amp; duetie, his Maties gracious hart may be one day moved, to restore unto me the light &amp; comfort of his Princelie favor, wch wth all loyal humilitie I shall evermore seek &amp; sue for. Amongst the manie great grace wherewith God hath furnished yor Lp, this vertue of protecting the throwne down from farther iniurie, &amp; of expatriating the long exiled in his Maties favor, I hope shall not proove least in way of his Maties service, nor the meanest in meriting honor to yor noble Lp: upon whose Happines the faithful service shall ever zealously attend, of Yor Lps most humbly in all duetie at command, Edwin Sandys.

Letter, Signed List of Records No. 180 Honble Sr The Swan of Barnestaple arryved here at James Citty ye 15th of May and departed hence ye first of June. The London Marchant, and ye Jonathan came to an Anchor in this porte ye seven and twentyeth of May, and set sayle from hence, ye London Marchant ye 7th of June, and ye Jonathan ye 9th The Duty arryved here ye 25th of May, and departed yesterday beinge ye Eleventh of June. By ye three former ships, and in answer to ye ?res of ye Counsell and of Smyths hundred socyety both ye Governor and Counsell ioyntly, and ye Governor also aparte have wrytten. This in their absence I thought expedyent to adde by ye Duty nowe bound to trade and fish in Canada, where wee hope they will finde some men of Plymouth, to ye ende that as yow had wrytten by every one, so wee might ymitate yor example. The thing? wch I will nowe propound to yor Considera?on are first. The season of ye yeare wch for mens health may be fyttest to arryve in this Country. Wee here are in or opinions absolutely for ye leafefall and ye winter havinge found ye springe and so?er both fatall and vnproffitable to newe Co?ers, and those other two seasons quyte Contrary, ffor instance, in these three last men?oned ships ye people this springe Came in sickly, and too [too] late eyther by plantinge, settinge, howinge, clearinge ground, or buyldinge, to doe any worke of ymportance. The second thinge con- siderable is ye elec?on of yor people; that as near as may be none but sound persons be sent hither, and those yf it be possible tradesmen, husbandmen, and true labourers. The inconvenyence of vnsound bodyes amonge sound and healthfull, and of arryvinge in ye springe, wee found in or voyadge by ye Dyana both at sea, and after wee come on shore. And of this ye Jonathan may be a sad president, who lost twenty five of yor land people at sea, besides Mr Rand ye Mr, and three marriners, and some more of ye passengrs nowe dead on shore. A third matter of ymportance is ye passage from England hither, vpon ye speedynes whereof ye health of or people, and many other Comodityes doe mainely depende. Such a passage wee hope Mr Elford Pylot of ye Swan hath found by ye Course of ye So?er Ilands, those other passages by ye West Indyes, and by ye North beinge ye two extreames of that golden Medyum wch I hope will by proffitable vse verify ye sayinge Medio tutissimus ibis. ? The best time to arrive in Virginia is a boute Sep- tember October What sorte of People best. ? The Best Pas- sadge to Virginia. John Damyron notwthstandinge he made a kinde of a vowe vpon or vn- toward northerly passage in ye Dyana that he would never stand ye like Course for Virginia againe preferred nowe obedyence before sacrafice, and followed ye companyes direc?ons by ye way of ye north, and by longe Contynuance at sea (besides other inconvenyence) lost to ye Colony ye benefytt of those silkewormes wch his Maty had so gratiously bestowed vpon vs. And I pray god ye Bonaventure, ye Tryall and ye ffalcon (of whom wee can yet heare no newes) be not fallen into ye same incon- venyence out of ye same direc?ons. And yf wee may wthout offence (as I humbly beseech wee may) vtter or mindes, wee wonder why any should so much doute vpon a northerne passage, wch is never Comodious but in ye springe and toward? so?er, both wch seasons in respect of ye health of newe co?ers, of ye plenty of ye Country, and of proffitt to be raysed are ye most ymproper. Mr Elford by being blest of god wth a short passage brought all his people in health, who having bene here nowe allmost a moneth, doe all god be praysed as yet hold vp their heades, doe worke stoutly, and take very good lykinge to ye Country. But they were a party of sound, honest, and Country labouringe men. Yeat Since the New England Planters doe goe this Northerly Course to New England and soe Carnt be so ill for Virginia Longe Experience is the maine in these things and triall not one but many yeares. Arriving in Maye it faires well. Nowe as Conc9ninge ye buyldinge of guest-houses, this tyme of ye year is most vnfittinge, in respect of ye tymbr to be felled, wch would nowe be full of sap in respect of ye heate, and lastly in respect of ye peoples attend- inge their corne, where on depende ye lives of vs all. In winter some good wilbe done in that kinde. To drawe ye old planters also to assist in ye Iron workes wilbe very harsh and difficult, And I doe verily knowe, and wthout flattery may [1b] confidently affirme, that ye Governor yf he wer able would defray all these publique affaires out of his owne purse, and would not put ye people to so much as an howers worke. He hath allready by ye George, and ye Bona Nova (ye wch I was much against) proffered his salary towards ye buyldinge of a forte at Poynt Comforte. If ye Company please they may apply that to ye buylding of guest-houses, and other publique vses, and to keepe ye old planters from losse and murmuringe. It is not longe agone, since ye Governor made those that watched here at James Citty to contribute some labor to a bridge, and to c9taine plat- formes to mounte greate ordinance vpon, beinge both for ye vse and defense of ye same Citty, and so of themselves; yet they repyned as much as yf all their goods had bene taken from them. Of these Iron workes so much affected by ye Company, neyther ye Gov- ernor, nor wee of ye Counsell have any skill at all and must therefor be slowe in delyvering or opinions. Onely wee thinke, that so heavy and so ymportant a worke, beinge fytt to exercyse ye most perfect Comon weale, should have taken moe tyme of delibration there in England. But espe- cially some skillfull man should have ?vsed ye country for a whole yeare before, and should have bene sure of some abundant Iron mine and fyt places to worke yt in, Notwthstandinge that heretofore there hath in many partes of this Country bene gathered some quantety of that mine from ye su?ficyes of ye earth. ffor Pytch and tarre, true yt is, that as some quantety hath heretofore bene made, so may there be some made hereafter, but some here that have lyved longe in Poland doe say, that ye worth will no way contrvaile ye chardge, and one reason is, that whereas in Poland a principall country for that comodity, there be whole forrests of pytch trees and none else, and that for fower, and five hundred myles together in this parte of Virginia ye same kinde of trees growe but * * * skatteringe here one and there one, and may indeed be employed to that vse but wth greate labor, and as greate losse. ffor tymber, and bourdes well may they serve for ye vse of ye Colony, but in sendinge for ye same expressly out of England, ye fraight would cost double ye pryce of ye comodity. Silke is a marvellous hopefull comodity in this Country, here beinge as many mulbery trees as in Persia, or in any other parte of ye world besides. Vynes Cannot but prosper admirably well in this Country, where in many places yow can hardly walke ye woods for their intanglemts. And in most parte of ye Country yow shall see vines wth a body as big as a mans leg, as tall, and vpright as ye mast of a ship, not touchinge ye espoused tree any where but at ye top. Besides though ye ordinary grape be but a Crab, very small, wth a thick skin, greate stones, and iuice harsh, and lytle, yet many sortes whereof I my selfe have tasted are to be found of ye quite contrary qualityes, and that in much excellency. Here be also singular white grapes though rare to be founde, yet shall yt goe hard but I will bringe Mr Chanterton to ye findinge of them. Sure I am I haue tasted some grapes here as good as in Greece or Italy: But Sr I must tell yow by ye way, that Mr Chanterton smells too much of Roome (in ye terri- tory whereof he served ye Colonnessi) as he attempts to worke myracles wth his Crucyfixe, and to shewe as much Zeale in mayntaining his sensles religion as he doth professe yt wth blindnes. Whereof ye Governor, vnles he perceive some danger, will take no notyce, till ye man have discovered his skill to ye Country, and then yf he prove turbulent, he will do wth him as he shall see cause, or as he shalbe Comaunded out of England. Meane while he may be come hither as a spy, wch pointe [2] wee doe beseech yow throughly to consider of He told me he was at Roome in Octobr last, and is nowe got hither by May, and ther fore yf he be come vpon such an errand, he hath made greate speed. Out of ye Country by mine advise he shall not goe in hast to tell tales. Silke. Vines abound- ance and won- derful vignes and talenes. A Spye. The last Co?odity spoken of in yor Chartr is salt; ye workes whereof wee doe much marvell, yow would have restored to their former vse; whereas I will vndertake in one day to make as much salt by ye heate of ye sunne, after ye manner vsed in ffrance, Spaine, and Italy, as can be made in a yeare by that toylesome and erroneous way of boyling sea water into salt in kettles as or people at Smyths Iland have hitherto accustomed. And therefore when yow entr into this worke, yow must send men skillfull in salt pondes, such as yow may easily procure from Rochell, and yf yow can have none there, yet will some be found at Lymington, and in many other places in England. And this indeed in a short tyme might prove a reall worke of greate sustenance to ye Colony at home, as of gaine abroad, here beinge such stulls of excellent good fish, as ought rather to be admyred of such as have not seene ye same, then Credited. Whereas ye company doe give their tennants fifty acres vpon Smyths Iland some there are that smyle at yt here, sayinge there is no ground in all ye whole Iland worth ye manuringe.

Whereas yow have sent two Germans skillfull in mynes, here is a freind of mine as skillfull as themselves, and my selfe, though vnskillfull, who doe purpose wthin fewe dayes to make tryall of their skill, in c9taine places where wee hope to finde better Comodity, and of lesse labor then Iron mine, and yet will not goe about to preiudice ye Iron mine neither. And yf wee Chance to send yow over any tryall, yt shalbe both in that quantety, and in that truth and c9tainty as there shalbe no doubt to be made of yt. Where I speake above in this ?re in ye person of more then my selfe, I beseech yow pardon me, because there I speake not mine owne but ye co?on opinion. Mines better than Irone. The cominge hither of that vertuous gentleman Capt Thorpe, was to vs in many respects as of an Angell from heaven, neyther did I ever see any mans face out of my natyve countrey, that did more ioy me. He will helpe to beare or burthen, and wilbe able in many matters soundly to resolve yow at home. I pray god send more like vnto him. Two things might have much discouraged me from doinge my duty. One is yor not vouchsafinge to answer, had yt bene but in three lines, my so many, and so confident ?res, so that I knowe not whither I wryte nowe to a freind or to an enemy. The other was ye imbecillity of some of Sr George his freinds, who not havinge courage enough to defende his ?re by ye fflemish man of warr, layd all ye whole envy vpon me, as yf Sr George had bene so weake, as to have signed to any thinge ignorantly, or against his will or as yf I had counterfaycted his hand and seale. My comfort is that this wronge hath advanced me to so high a dignity as yt is nowe in my power to pardon my betters. Nowe that I suppose I have wearyed yow, I growe weary my selfe, though I shall never be weary to pray from ye Almighty all happines vpon yow and yors, nor to contynue High Commenda- tion of Mr Thorpe a man Truly of much worth and afterward I may say a [Mouther] in Virginia Yors most cordyally devoted to yor srvice Jo: Pory.

By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia. 22. Iunij 1620. London: Printed by Thomas Suodham 1620. By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia After the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Almighty God to suffer the great Enemy of all good Actions and his Instruments, to encounter and interrupt, to oppresse and keepe weake, this noble Action for the planting of Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It hauing pleased him now contrarily of his especiall great grace, so to blesse and prosper our late carefull endeuours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for supplying of the present defects, wherewith the Colony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a sodaine growne to double that height, strength, plenty, and prosperity, which it had in former times attained: We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our place, accordingly as it hath beene also ordered by a generall Court, to Summon as it were by a kinde of louing inuitement, the whole Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great expences and trauailes. And first to remoue that vnworthy aspersion, where[2]with ill disposed mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from thence, and by rumours here at home, sought vniustly to staine and blem- ish that Countrey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it necessary for the full satisfaction of all, to make it publikely known, that by diligent examination we haue assuredly found, those Letters and Rumours to haue been false and malicious; procured by practise, and suborned to euill purposes: and contrarily disaduowed by the testimony vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Colony; by whom we are ascertained, that the Countrey is rich, spacious and well watered; tem- perate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accustomed to it; abounding with all Gods naturall blessings: The Land replenished with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Deere, and other Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Riuers (whereof many are exceeding faire and nauigable,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts desireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great store and variety: In Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reserued by the prouidence of God, for such as shall apply themselues faithfully to his seruice, and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation. But touching those Commodities for which that Countrey is proper, and which haue beene lately set vp for the Aduenturors benefit: we referre you to a true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and generall Court, and here- unto annexed for your better information. By which and other approued informations brought vnto vs, We rest in great assurance, that this Countrey, as it is seated neere the midst of the world, betweene the extreamities of heate and cold; So it also par[3]ticipateth of the benefits of bothe, and is capable (being assisted with skill and industry) of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and Cordage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with ease and plenty. The Masts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, (being the materials of Linnen,) which now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iron, which hath so wasted our English Woods, that it selfe in short time must decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia, (where wasting of Woods is a benefit) for all good conditions answerable to the best in the world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of France and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will be found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferiour. We omit here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dispersed vp and downe the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent Dyes: of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall seruice: of sweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: of Cotten-wooll, and Suger Canes: all which may there also be had in abundance, with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle and Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Graine of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength, and fertility. The Cattle which we haue transported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred) become much bigger of Body, then the [4] breed from which they came: The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde two Fawnes at a birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd, being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of New-found-Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpose can defame. Now touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country, We haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue bin sent thither this last yeere, and are now presently in going, twelue hundred persons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue specified: and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those that were gone before. The men lately sent, haue bin most of them choise men, borne and bred vp to labour and industry. Out of Deuonshire, about an hundred men, brought vp to Husbandry. Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, about one hundred and ten; and out of Sussex, about forty; all framed to Iron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme. There haue beene also sundry persons of good quality, much commended for sufficiency, industry and honesty, prouided and sent to take charge and gouernment of those people. The care likewise that hath beene taken by directions, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce the people and affaires in Virginia into a regular course, hath bin such and so great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and fashion of an orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The people are all diuided [5] into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land due to him set out, to hold and enjoy to him and his Heires. The publike Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernour there, for the College, and for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and for diuers other necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are setled in their Seates, being allotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance. The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is reduced within the limits prescribed by his Maiestie: and the laudable forme of Iustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue speedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly hath, partly is bound to haue in short time a sufficient Minister: for whom maintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value. Which orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused the Colony now at length to settle themselues in a firme resolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest-houses, for entertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp their Ploughes; to the planting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple Commodities furnished and commended from hence. In summe, they are now so full of alacritie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall Assembly, they haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the set[6]ling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires of the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice. Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authoritie and pleasure, there hath beene a collection made of all the branches of the same, dispersed in his Letters Patents, now three times renewed: as also out of other Instructions proceeding from his Maiestie. Out of both which, together with such other Orders as (authorized by his Maiestie) the Company themselues haue thought necessary to make, hath beene com- piled a booke of standing Orders and Constitutions, approued by the generall consent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, haue their businesse carried regularly, industriously, and iustly, euery man knowing both his right and duty, to their generall great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas the Colony likewise haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of England proper for the vse of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important circumstances should necessarily require: a course is likewise taken for the effecting of this worke; yet so as to submit it first to his Maiesties view and approbation; it being not fit that his Maiesties Subiects should be gouerned by any other Lawes, then such as receiue the influence of their life from him. And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular, by whose charges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maiesties especiall grace) this famous Plan[7]tation hath not onely beene vndertaken, but through so many difficulties vpheld and continued: we should be very greatly iniurious to them, if we should not acquaint them with this season- able time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto them. We therefore let them know, that in this last yeare now ended, there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen seuerall Patents for particular Plantations; and more are in hand to be passed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vnprobable that vpon each of these Patents, diuers hundreds of persons will soone Plant in Virginia: there haue beene already transported vpon the first, aboue three hundred men. These and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion of Land to them and their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery share of twelue pounds &amp; ten shillings, vpon a first diuision; &amp; as much more vpon a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery person, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their own charges they shall transport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of Iune 1625. if he continue there three yeeres, either at one or seuerall times, or die after he is shipped for that voyage: It standeth them vpon, who are not willing to be the least in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the last in setting foorth to the choise and peopling of their Land. Wherein what fauour or assistance may by vs be giuen them, they shall be well assured of it, in equall proportion with our selues, as their charges and long expectance haue well deserued. And to the end that not onely the Aduenturors now liuing, but the Heires also of the de[8]ceased, may take certaine notice of the seuerall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Aduentures in mony are due and belonging to them: And likewise that posteritie may truely know, by whose charges this Plantation (next vnder his Maiestie) hath beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: We haue here, ac- cording to an Order of Court, set downe in an Alphabeticall Table the names of all the Aduenturors, with all their seuerall summes aduentured. Wherein if by errour, or other mis-accident, there haue wrong be done to any man; if within one twelue moneth after the date hereof, he giue notice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors, he shall be set right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere vnto vs, then to doe right vnto them, with all Iustifiable curtesie, who haue beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending so much to the propagating of the true seruice of Almighty God, to the adding of greatnesse and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nation in disburdening their multitude. 22.

By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia. 18. Iulij 1620. Whereas the Right Honourable, Henry Earle of Southampton, with the aduise and consent of the Counseil and Company for Virginia, hath re- solued and concluded to imploy all good meanes in this present yeare, 1620. not onely for the aduancing of the Plantation in strength and multi- tude of good people, but also for the enriching thereof with store of cattell of diuers sorts, and by setting vp or encreasing such Staple Commodities, as being proper for that Countrey, may be also of most necessary vse for this Realme, and redound in fine to the greatest benefit of both Aduen- turors and Planters, and lastly [16] for the establishing there of such good Gouernment (originally deriued from the Kings most excellent Maiestie, the first and chiefe Founder of this glorious worke) as whereby the people there, diuided in soyle onely, but still participating in the religious and happy gouernment of this their natiue Countrey, may continue alwayes as one and the same people with vs, according to the most Princely direc- tion of his Maiestie: We haue thought it very necessarie for the seconding and forwarding of those so noble Designes, not onely to publish them to the Aduenturors in generall, thereby to inuite them to concurre with vs in the same, but also to set downe such particularities requisite, as whereby the preparations of all sorts needfull, may vpon this timely warning, both better and more seasonably be made and compassed. First therefore we haue thought fit, to make it publikely knowne, that besides the great store of particular Plantations now in prouiding, and like very shortly in large proportion to augment, the Company haue resolued in a late generall Court, by the blessing of God, to set out this yeere at the publike charge, and to send to Virginia, eight hundred choise persons, of the qualities ensuing: First, foure hundred, to be Tenants of the general land of the Company, to make vp the number of those Tenants ful 500. wherof 200. to be placed at Elizabeth Citie, with the Companies Deputie: 100. at Henrico, 100. at Charles Citie: And at Iames Citie there are a hundred and more already. Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to such Officers, &amp;c. as the Court already hath, or shall shortly appoint: viz. 10. for the Deputy of the College, [17] 40. for the Companies Deputy: 20. for the Secretary: 10 more (befides 50. already fent) for the Ministers: and 20. for the Phisitian: their care for the ease and prosperity of the Colonie, being such and so great, as to cause them to endowe those Offices and places, (as they haue formerly done others,) with faire possessions, furnished with Tenants and other fit prouisions: that the people may haue the benefit by them, and yet be freed from the burden. Thirdly one hundred yong Maides to make wiues for these Tenants as the former 90. which haue been lately sent. Fourthly, one hundred Boyes, to be apprentizes likewise to the publike Tenants. Fiftly, one hundred seruants to be disposed amongst the old Planters, which they greatly desire, and haue offered to defray their charges with very great thankes. And although by reason of the preparations already made, the difficulty may be well conceiued to be in great part ouercome, and the profit much more neere, and more easie to come by, yet the Companie wholly affecting the peoples prosperity, haue determined to deale both as fauourably in the Contracts, and as bountifully in all sorts of furniture and prouisions with the Tenants which shal now goe, as they haue done with those, which haue beene formerly sent. Which conditions it hath beene thought fit here to reinsert and publish. Every man transported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants to the Common land of the Company, or to the publike land, shall be freely landed there at the charge of the Company: And shal be furnished with pro- uisions of victuall for one whole [18] yeare next after his arriuall, as also of Cattle: And with apparell, weapons, tooles and implements, both of house and labour, for his necessary vse. He shall enjoy the ratable moytie of all the profits that shall be raised of the land on which he shall be Planted, as well Corne and Cattle, as other commodities whatsoeuer: the other halfe being due to the Owners of the Land. He shall be tyed by Couenant, to continue upon that Land for the Terme of seauen yeares: which being expired, it shal be in his choyse, whither to continue there or to remoue to any other place, at his owne will and pleasure. Of these persons, one hundred and twenty (such as are to be Tenants) are to be slipped here for Virginia, by the midst of August now at hand: and the rest in Ianuary and February ensuing. The next preparations are of Cattle of diuers sorts: whereof there are intended in the next Spring to be sent these ensuing. One hundred Kine, for this addition of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to remaine in a perpetuall stock vpon the Companies Land, to be lent to new Planters, as hath bin formerly ordered. Foure hundred Goats, twenty Mares, fourescore Asses to be procured from France: The care of prouiding which, is commended to diuers select persons by parts, and the whole to the ouersight of the generall Comitties. The last prouisions appointed to be made, are for the setting vp, or increasing of diuers principall Commodities. For Silke, there is prouision to be made, of great store of Silke-worme-seede about Michaelmas [19] next: as also of men skilfull in the ordering as well of the Wormes, as of their Silke, which are to be sent away in a Pinnace, in October betimes. For Hempe and Flaxe, Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, Pitch and Tarre, there is a Treaty already on foote, for procuring of men skilfull in those Trades from the Easterne parts: besides the Polakers yet remaining in Virginia. For Wines, it is also ordered, that men skilfull be procured in the planting and dressing of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence also and other parts to procure Plants of the best kindes. For Oyle, besides great quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia in great abundance, Oliue-Plants are to be prouided from Marseilles and Ligorno. For Fish, which on those Coasts are taken in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a course taken, to preserue the Companies Liberties, and to set vp the Fishings in better sort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it in abundance, and after the manner of those hotter Climates, which may prooue a great helpe to increase the Plantation. For Iron, there is sufficient done alreadie. And for Sawing-Milles, besides those already gone this Spring, there are lately come from Hamborough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be sent in the next ship. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates shall be prouided, to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to traffique and trade for the Company and their Tenants vnder his charge. [20] These large supplies of men, Cattle, and Commodities, as they tend to the accomplishing of this great worke of the Plantation: so can they not be themselues effected, without large prouision of money, being the sinewes and mouing Instruments in these great Actions. To which end wee desire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be assisting to vs, by such meanes as they shall please: especially that the remaine of all promised Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in without faile, which we trust will now be done cheerefully on all parts, the inuitements of this yeere being well considered: that as the presenting of their first payments, hath been the beginning, so the performance of the later, may be the perfecting and finishing of this worke, so glorious before God and man. And here by the way, for the clearing of some scruples and errors through mistaking of our writings lately published, we are to aduertise, that the Alphabet of Aduenturers and summes aduentured, neither then conueniently could, nor was intended to extend any further, then to such summes as haue been paid in to the Treasurors of the Company, and to Sir Baptist Hicks, by speciall order of Court. And whereas diuers other bils of Aduen- ture, haue bin heretofore deliuered, partly vpon personall aduenture, and no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deserts, partly for summes paid to other men, whose Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treasurors) and partly for goods which neuer came [21] within the Treasurors Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whose hands they were deliuered, for which notwithstanding bils of Aduenture haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treasuror: If the Aduenturors shall be pleased within the time prefixed, to put in their iust claimes, by these or any other wayes whatsoeuer, there shall be right done to them, and a new Alphabeticall booke shall be published, embracing exactly all kinde of Aduenturors, with their seueral summes either really aduentured, or otherwise accepted, allowed or bestowed, be it vpon what cause, or in what kinde soeuer. Now if the Aduenturors be thus requested, with much greater reason are all Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and make perfect their seuerall Accounts, and to pay in those monyes, which shall remaine due to the Company: that so all parts concurring with their duties and endeuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy. Lastly, as heretofore, so we now also declare, that the persons to be admitted to goe, as the Companies-Tenants, and with the foresaid conditions, shall be no other then good men, that is to say, of good Trades, of skill in husbandry, or industrious labourers; and such of those as shall be commended for their honest conuersation: which persons repairing to the Citie of London, to Mr. Ferrar, Deputy to the Company, his house in St. Sithes lane, in the beginning of August, and in the middle of Ianuary, next, according to the seuerall numbers at those times to be sent, shall from thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies char- [22] ges, til such time as they be shipped for Virginia: there being especiall care likewise taken, for the prouiding of good Commanders and Directors of their workes.

And it is not to be counted a perfect Court, vnlesse there be fiue of the Counseil there (the Treasuror or Deputy being one) and fifteene of the Generality. IV. It shall be in the power of the Treasuror, or the Deputie in his absence, vpon extraordinary cause to call an extraordinary Court. V. It shall not be in the power of any other then a Quarter-Court, to make any contract whereby to binde the Company for any continuance of yeares. In which case it shall be proposed also in the Preparatiue Court next preceding. VI. [57] Pvblique businesse shall haue the precedence in the Courts before priuate, vnlesse there be extraordinary important cause to the contrary. VII. If any thing ordered in an ordinary or lesser Court, be afterward reuersed in one of the great and generall Courts: It shall be from thence-forward as though it had neuer beene so ordered. VIII. All Courts shall begin at two of the clocke in the afternoone, and dissolue at the rising of the Treasuror, or of the Deputie in his absence. IX. Nothing shall be put to the question after sixe of the Clocke in the after- noone. X. In regard of the great businesse for Virginia yearely encreasing, It shall be in the power of the Treasuror, (if hee see it so necessary) to assemble the Quarter-Courts both in the fore-noones and after-noones of the dayes appointed for them. XI. The Companie shall be summoned to the Quarter-Courts, and Courts extraordinary, by the Offi[58]cer: But of the ordinary Courts themselues shall take notice. And the Secretary shall keepe a booke of the proceedings of the Courts: who with the Booke-keeper, Husband, and Bedle, shall at all Courts giue diligent attendance. XII. It shall be lawfull at a general Court, and with consent thereof, to dispence with all meetings in long Vacations, or in such part of them as may be spared; vnlesse some extraordinary matter befall, in which case may be called extraordinary Courts. XIII. The Treasuror and Companie, being a Body and Commonaltie perpetuall, shall haue one faire and common Seale, to be kept by the Treasuror; and not to be affixed to any Grants or Instruments whatsoeuer, otherwhere then in publike Courts, or by warrant from thence. XIV. The Treasuror and the Counseil, or the Court, haue power to admit any into this Society. Elections. XV. At the great and generall Court, commonly called the Quarter-Court, in Easter Terme, all Offices [59] of this Companie (excepting the Counseil) shall be voyde: And the Court shall proceede to an election of new Officers, in manner following. XVI. The Treasuror in the beginning of the Court, at the giuing vp of his Office, shall declare by word or writing the present estate of the Colony and Planters in Virginia.

And generally no man shall be present in the Court, whilest himselfe or his matter passeth the iudgement of the Court. XIX. In regard of the weighty and manifold businesse of this Companie, which is also like daily to encrease: [60] No man shall be chosen Treasuror of the Companie of Virginia, who at the time of his election is Gouernour of any other Company; but vpon condition that before the next Quarter Court hee effectually resigne that other Gouernement: except it seeme good for the behalfe of both Companies, that the same man be also Gouernour of the Somer Ilands Company. XX. It is for weighty reasons thought very expedient, that no man continue in the place of Treasuror or Deputie, aboue three yeeres at once. XXI. For the auoiding of diuers inconueniences, It is thought fit, that all elections of principall Officers in or for Virginia, as also of the Treasuror and Deputie here, be performed by a Ballating box, as in some other Companies. XXII. Every Officer as he is chosen, shall openly in Court take his oath: or if he be absent, at the next Court he commeth to. XXIII. The Treasuror, Deputie, Auditors, and Comitties, hauing no certaine allow- ance for their cares and labours: the reward of these former Officers accord- ing to their deserts, is referred to the pleasure of the Court wherein new Officers are chosen.

CXIX. For the preuenting of fraud, and dammage to the Companie in their Rents; by drawing new Aduenturors or Planters, vpon purchase of a few old Aduentures, into th'immunitie of the old Aduenturors of not paying any Rent for the shares of fiftie acres the person transported by them before the foresaid day: it is ordered, that in all Indentures of Grant of Lands to old Aduenturors, being for fewer then fiftie shares of the old aduenture, the immunitie of not paying Rent for the shares obtained by transporting of persons as aforesaid, shall not be generall; but restrained to the propor- tion of foure persons to euery share of the old aduenture, transported before Midsomer day, 1625. CXX. All Grants of Land shall be made with equall fauours, and Grants of like Liberties and Immunities as neere as may be, (except the differences of Rent aboue set downe:) to the end that all complaint of partialitie or vnindifferency may be preuented.

The Quarter-Court in euery Trinitie Term, shall appoint a choise Comittie of fiue or seuen, to continue for that yeare, to take into their care and charge the matter of the College to be erected in Virginia for the con- uersion of Infidels: which Comittie shall take a course for the recouering of the mony that hath beene collected for that worke. And shall like- wise consult how the same may be best imployed, for the beginning, pursuing, and perfecting of the same worke. And shall from time to time acquaint the generall Courts with their doings, from thence to receiue approbation and direction. CXXVI. The Treasuror shall keepe a seuerall Cash and account of this money, to be presented to the Auditors, and from them to the Court. And he shall not issue any money out of this Cash, otherwise then by warrant vnder the great part of these Comitties hands. CXXVII.

Accounts. CXXVIII. No Auditors extraordinary shall presume to intermedle with the auditing of any Account, wherein the body of the Companie is interressed, but being appointed in the face, and with the approbation of the Court. CXXIX. All Accountants whatsoeuer, and Auditors extraordinary, if the Court so require, shall haue an Oath ministred vnto them in the face of the Court; the one for true accounting, the other for true auditing. CXXX. No Account shall be held cleered, nor Accountants discharged; till the Account, being approued vnder the Auditors hands, be presented to the Court: And there lye openly in Court, two Court dayes, to be viewed by any that are so disposed. CXXXI. If exception be taken to any Account whatsoeuer, the Court shall proceede to a review, as in like case of the Treasuror. If no exception be taken in the two Court dayes; or vpon the reuiew returned, and the Account approued: the Treasuror then, or Deputie in his absence shall signe the Ac- count in open Court: wherby the Accountants shall be clearely discharged. [92] CXXXII. If any Officer, or other Accountants, be slowe in bringing in their Accounts to the Auditors, ordinary, or extraordinary; Or within one moneth after their Account is perfected, doe not pay to the Cash the due summe remain- ing, vnlesse the Court see cause to giue longer time: the Auditors or Treasuror shall impart the same to the Court, that order be thence giuen for redresse thereof. These Orders hauing beene first framed and digested by a select Comittie; and then presented to the Counseil, and by them approued; were after- wards publiquely read in the Preparatory Court, held on Munday the 7. of Iune, 1619. And lastly, were againe read distinctly and deliberately in a great and generall Quarter-Court held on Wednesday, the 9. of Iune, 1619. where with a full &amp; general consent, by erection of hands, they were ratified and ordained to be the perpetuall standing Orders of the Companie of Virginia. Some few additions, and small alterations, haue since been made, in the Quarter-Courts in Easter Term and Trinitie Terme, 1620. FINIS.</field>

Autograph Signed List of Records No. 186 ?July .1620.? There is in Virginia and is like to be shortly .3000. people, And the greatest want they complayne of is good drinke, wine beinge too deere, and barly chargeable, wch though it should there be sowen, it were hard in that Country beinge soe hote, to make malt of it, or if they had malt to make good beere. Theis .3000. people I accompt beinge lab most labouringe men, and the country very hote, will drink one wth an other a wine pottle a day, wch for .3000. people is .23. tunne and .28. od gallons accomptinge .4. hoggesheads to the Tunne and each hoggeshead to contayne .64. gallons wyne measure. There shalbe shewen a way to make an artificiall wyne of a vegetable wch there growes plentifully wthout any manner of charge or labour in plantinge wch artificial drink shall not cost accomptinge all charges of gettinge the said comodity and makinge it into drink above vjs a Tunne, wch is .xijd a barrell accomptinge .6. of our beere barrells to a Tunne. Each houshold if they please may brewe it themselves, wherin they cannot miscary as vsually they doe in makinge of beere or ale. This artifitiall wyne beinge as cleere as any well-fyned wyne wthout any hipostesis, grounds or lees, shall be as harty, holsome pleasinge and com- fortable for the body as any beere or wyne whatsoever. This kind of drink shall not growe flat decay or sower, though it be kept a wholl yeare, wch all sorts of beere and wyne are subiect to, especially in such hot countries. Though there be never soe much drunk of it at a tyme, it will make noe man drunk. It is an excellent ?servative against the scurvy scurvy and other diseases, and infections wch are incident to people at the sea in longe voyages, there being many in a shipp, As also very medicinable for all such as live in lowe marshe grounds subiect to many vnholsome fogs and damps. It may be caryed to sea in longe voyages insteed of water beere or wyne, for neyther heat nor cold nor any altera?on of the ayre or contry will cause it to putrify decay or growe sower. This artificiall drink is as good the first day it is made as ever after, wheras beere or ale newe brued, or wine in the must, requyre tyme, as well before their grounds or lees be se?ated, as also before they come to ?fection. And then being come to ?fection they keep not longe, but growe hard, eager, sower and lastly turne to vineger. It maketh noe body heart burnt at sea, as sharp, eager and sower wyne or beere doth. If there were in the collony ten tymes as many people, they may have sufficient of this drinke at the foresaid rate. The makinge of this artificiall wyne may here be showne either in a Tonne or .10. tonne, or what one pleaseth: we have likewise of that comodytie in England. The propounder desireth vpon demonstra?on of it here to the company that he may have but .1000li besides the benefit in Virginia of serving the collony, wth the said artifitiall drinke at the said rate of vjs the Tunne.

We send you a copy of our agreemt wth Richard Smyth and six others, who are our first tenants or vndertakers to the halfes in that kynd: If they fynd respect and ?formance from you of what we have ?mised (wch is most iust they should) vpon their ?res (wch covertly or openly they will send over to their frends and neighbors) dyu9s others (by their private agreemts) will be like affected and sutors to vs: And therfore howe you like of those Condi?ons or wherin you wish any varia?n or addi?on, we desire (for our better instruc?on in the future) to have your advice by this ship. ffive of our servant? have written to their frends, and some of them to ourselves, by ?res dated in ffebruary and March last to have two servants the peece sent over for their owne pryvate benefit and imploymt? by this Ship ?misinge apparell and dyet out of their meanes in your family and that country, Wherin as none of their [131] request? are by vs or their frends yet satisfyed (because the desire seemeth somewhat strange) yet we would not have you to leave them without assurance of our favor and satisfac?on of their reasonable request? in our future returnes and supplyes, if you and mr Tracy shall signify the same to be convenient, But to have satis- fyed one and not all would have begot murmur or discontent in the neg- lected ?sons: herein we pray you carry a tender hand, because they are all of the better sort: ?haps also your vnexpected (yet welcome) cominge amongst them, may have buryed in them that humor or desire. We must pray you to bend your vtmost care and diligence to subsist, as much and assoone as is possible of yourselves: for theis great supplyes are insupportable in longer contynuance, as more ?ticularly by this or the next Ship that cometh from England, you will both in our generall and in your ?ticular accompt vnderstand from me John Smyth. Markhams and Goovges book? of all kynd of English husbandry and huswifry, and .2. others for the orderinge of silk and silkwormes are nowe sent, wch take into your owne hands from Thomas Lemis, otherwise you will bee defrauded of them. We have sent you also a great quantity of the best seeds for a kitchen garden, and of the most vsefull kynds, wee need not comend to you the effectuall care of them, because a great ?te of the food of your family must aryse from them: With them cometh also a reasonable quantity of the seeds of cotton wooll, wch Thomas Combes your ?tener hath ?cured in London. Mr Smyth hath this day drawne out of his nurseryes a great number of yonge stock? and of apple trees grafted with pippens, pearmaynes and other the best apples, wch he hopeth for his owne humor and affec?on sake therin you will have somwhat the more care of, as also of the bagg of abricote damosell &amp; other plumstones he nowe sendeth. We hoped of your ?res from the way of newfoundland from whence dyu9s ships are arryved at Barstable &amp; Bristoll .6.3 and two dayes nowe past, as by ?te of the newe fish we nowe furnish appeareth, but till the date hereof cannot heare from you or of your arrivall.

On Thursday, the 7th of this instant, the Bona Nova wth hir Pinnace set saile from the Downs, wth a prosperous wynd: &amp; was met that evening beyond the Nesse. That day we spent here amongest or frends in great ioy.1 1 A note at the end in the handwriting of John Smyth, as are all marginal notes and all insertions. * * * * * * * [1b] Yor nues from Virginia would have brought me great ioy, if my heavie mynd were at this tyme capable of anie. But God be praised, who so prospereth or weake endevors. Yet can I not forget Virginia, when my endevors may doo hir good. To wch end I have set in hand, by my self &amp; other my frends, the bringing in of nue Adventurors to honor this yeare under so noble a Lord. Somewhat I have allready doon: &amp; more I hope to doo. I have written also to Mr Barbor to that effect: &amp; have written x x x prayd him now the third tyme not to faile us at or day (wch is this Michelmas,) or wthin a week after at farthest. I have also som other proiects in my head for advancing the Plantation; whereof at or meeting, wch I trust will be ere the end of the next moneth. I knowe yu wilbe carefull of my Lords request, to call on the Committies to perform the parts allotted them. Aboue all have in remembrance the matter of Silk woorm seed, that it may be sent by D. Bohun, who they say goeth in October. I pray yu also let the Secretarie &amp; Mr Carter be directed, for the making of the three Catalougs of the severall Adventurors indebted: that in the beginning of the term they may be delivered as is appointed to their severall solicitors. Mr Carter may not alege that he knoweth they have paid all, ffor the demands must be made according to the Companies books: otherwise there wilbe manie a 12l 10s buried in other mens purses. These demands also wilbe a great meanes of dooing that right wch we so much desire, &amp; of bringing to conclusion those untoward Accounts.

St Paules affection against Alexander the Smithe, doth sufficientlie argue the lawfulnes of a complainte, wherein deliberate discretion inquireth after the matter not the man, for we must not haue the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the god of glorie, with respect of persons, least we co?itt sinne, and be convinced of the law as transgres- sours. there is a woe pronounced against the world because of offences, but that woe pertaines vnto that man by whome the offence commeth, in the determininge whereof qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera æqua licet statuerit haud æquus fuit, for that is to be partial in our selues, and to become iudges of euil thought?: but the rule of amitye commend? vnto vs a good opinion of those we effect, so doth the lawe of charitie co?aunde vs to be well minded toward? all men, especialie strangers causes of necessitie and cases of incertaintie: Yett both of them are limited with this prove as vs? ad aras amicus.

Concerning ye ould men I wrote nothing to you becaus I had not then receaved them home which were putt out, the names of names of thos yt are both living and dead are herein inclosed: Afer I had gathered in ye Cropp I enquired of Sr George what his pleasure was I should doe with it, and he answered yt he thought you did expect nothing from them §tenants§ this yeare, becaus some of them offered to take there oaths that you made them that promise, therefore that I should pay into ye stoare so much as was there owing and divide the rest amongst them. There was owing into the stoare for fiveteen hundred of fish, at three pound fifteen shillings ye hundred, for woodden platters, spikes, iron pots §and§ kans foure hundred and fourescore waight of tobacco, ye tobacco which was due unto them that died for ye time they lived, he gave unto me, for which I thanke you and him unto whom I have many waies been behoulding, whos life, goverment, and proceedings I Can not but admire, the fish he sent to me with ye newe men becaus there provisions of meale and oyle were short: I receaved one ye I have for this yeare caused as many to worke upon other trades beside ye ground as I Could, both for ye hansomer building in my plantation, and benefit of ye Colonie, and myne owne eas ease: I have appointed foure Carpenters, three sawyers two Smiths three tailors [1a] Ye rest plant Corne and Tobacco, for vines we can not goe about it with courage untill such time as we h may have such plants as we knowe are good and will be worth our labour, which we expect out of Ingland, it is with out question, that they will prosper exceeding well, by ye next yeare I thinke Sr George will be able to furnish some of us out of his owne vineyard as also with silke-worme- seede. I have both ye last yeare and this yeare planted some young nurceries of vines which live and growe, but I can have no confidence in them, that they should ever make good wines thes and other co?odities of ye like kind are to be ripened by time, and multitudes of people. thus with my hartie thankes to you for your love and kindnes to me I humbly take my leave.

And howe &amp; upon what termes those that remaine aliue are disposed of, appeareth by the note inclosed, wch though it be very rude and muche blurred, yet because it is the handwriting of Mr John Boys himselfe, I thought good to inclose it. Their wages sett downe in the same note I holde to be reasonable, and doe think, that being but newe men, they might perhaps (ouer &amp; beside a greater hazard of their liues) not attaine so muche, if they were at their owne disposing. Against another year they may haue full experience in the country; and then if it shall please their Mrs to adde more company vnto them, I shalbe ready to giue them the best assistance I can to settle them upon their owne lande; about the laying out whereof I will take order wth Mr Boys who hath not yet assigned any land at all for any particular aduenturer remaining in England, and shall appoint those twoe gentlemen their diuidends wth the first. The reason why I haue bene so slowe in doing it is because we haue neuer a surueyour in the lande and by that meanes cannot performe suche a seruice to any purpose, but might therein muche wronge either the owners, or suche as should be their next neighbours. And besides the vndertakers at Martins hundred would thinke themselues muche wronged, if any other should be sett on worke to diuide their groundes. Besides, if that company intende (as I doe heare) to buy out the Indians of Chi- schiack, those twoe worthy gentlemen might perhaps speed a great deale better by chusing them a seate in those partes.

And therfore, though in my gen9all ?res I haue playnely accordinge to my nature delyverd such thing? as I thought fitt for them to take notice of: yet I shall be bold to goe a lyttle further with you, in boltinge forth my pryvate Conceipt of the Country §of thing? not vnnecessarie for you to knowe§ since it must be §a§ true informa?on from hence that must confyrme or rectyfie yor iudgment?. You will Consider I haue not had tyme to see much, and therefore I will not passe the bound? of myne owne observa?on. The Country, if wee Consyder the ayre, I Conceaue to be of an indifferent tem?ature, and such as younge and stronge bodies may well away with all. But men stricken in years, or Corrupted in their blood? by Nature or disorder will finde a feirce encounter. If wee Consider the earth, I iudge it also very fruytfull and apt to ?duce any thinge wch England affords: and yet haue wee yet very little of yor Corne or other graine: and I gesse the reason to be, for that seldome any of our seed? Come kyndly or seasonablie hether. ffor I my self this springe puttinge sondry * * * sort? of gardaine seed? into the ground, finde not one of them to come vp. But aboue all it would be wisht that our Corne might here be found to ?sper: and that wee had here more Cattle both for the plough and payle: for I assure yow the people here lyve very barely for the most part: havinge no other foode but bread &amp; water and such mann9 of meate as they make of the Mayze: wch I would to God I Could say they had in any reasonable plenty. I assure yow the world goes hard with many even at this tyme. The labor is infynite that they are here putto for Corne yeerly. In so much that it takes vp att ye least three part? of our hand?. wch if you Consider, yow will not wonder that so great work? as yow expect to be done haue so slowe ?gresse. The Gou9nor hath stayed the Dutch[1b]men yet awhile to see if any fitt water may be found for their tourne (for yet they meete with none) ffor to send them home without doeinge that they were sent for would tourne to yor dishonours and the Countries discreditt. In the mean tyme they are so disheartned with the entertaynment they finde here, that they are growne very ympatient of stay. And these men when they fall to worke, must haue all their help from the Companies people: and it may ffall out to be in such a place that all yow haue yet will not satisfie. And §how§ shall they doe that and look after their own lyvelihood? The Collony will afford no help toward? it, since (as they say) the benefitt thereof goes to ye Company. I am in a straite. How so many people sent hither of late yeers haue bene lost, I cannot Conceaue vnles it be through water and want, partly of good foode, but cheifly of good Lodginge: wch haue bene the onely Causes of the death of so many as came with me, if the Conceipt of their 7. years servitude did not help them on: wch Course, I am of opinion, yow should doe well to alter. The half yeere, for wch onely wee were victualled, since our landinge, is now allmost expyred; sure I am, our ?visions are expended, and yet wee here of no supplie. In so much that yf the Edwin had not stood vs in some stead by fetchinge vs corne forth of the Bay (wher now we haue good and free trade) wee had bene distrest. ffor yor ?visions fall exceedinge short, wch is not my Complaint alone. ffor myne owne part I will be bold to say that none could ever be more honestly or thriftily issued, yet if many men had not died wee had bene longe since in want. I ymmagine I should haue wronged my self and abused the Company, if I had not said somethinge in my ?res concerninge Huddlestone, in whom you haue bene deceaued, for he ys a dissemblinge Companion. I haue giuen yow but a touch of his behavyor out of my respect to Mr Deputy: with whom I haue dealt freelie. Though he deserue not the best from me, yet I could eazely disgest that, had he discharged his dutie otherwise. Thincke not therfore I beseech you that I mallice his person. I haue more to saie then I haue tyme to vtter. Now therefore hopeinge that you and my good Ladie haue had no worse health then then I and my wife (I prayse God for it) haue hitherto enioyed, with the remembraunce of both of our due respect? to yow both, gyvinge yow many thank? for yor great favours, I humbly betake you to the dyvine ?tec?on, and remayne Yor faithful and humble servaunt to Commaund Tho: Nuce Eliza: in Virginia 19o Maii 1621 [2a] Sr, I had allmost forgotten to tell yow houe farre wee thinke those Co?odities men?oned in yor booke, vndervallued. Especially Silke Codd?: wherin to deale, the people are now very much discouraged. Howbeit I would to God the seed had come safe that I might haue made tryall though to my losse, so §I§ might haue gyuen the Companie satisfac?on. Out of all question no Countrie vnder heauen is more ?? for them. But I would be glad to vnderstand by those m9chaunt? who vallue the Codds at x  x  xd ijs vjd a pound, when this will prooue a Co?odity for men to lyue by in this Country, wher wee pay iijs a day for the labor of a man who hath no other waie but to digg and dealue. Sure they thought themselues in Italie, Spayne, or ffraunce: Countries plentifull and populous: wher are thousands of women and children and such ydle people to be hyred for jd or ijd a day. I am enformed that 20. ounc? of seed, wh[en] it is in woormes will busie forty people daylie duringe the season. will those m9chaunt? be contented to take the silke from vs then, as wee may afford it, payinge for the hire of men as abouesaid? Nay, men here in that season are not to be gotten at any rate: for the tyme of their attendaunce falls out to be iust at such a season as wee are busiest about our Corne: so as no man but he that means to starue will once looke after them. somethinge I might saie against other things to: but not wth like reasons. Sr, I am bolde to speake my minde to yow presuminge yow will not publish my follies: but rather endeavor pryvatelie to amend. Yor humble servaunt Tho: Nuce. Eliza: in Virginia 27 Maii 1621. Since I cannot write pleaseinge thinges, I haue forborne to direct my ?res to ye Companie, wherin if yow finde I haue erred, I beseech yow to ioyne wth my L. of Southton in my excuse, whose favor therin I haue humbly besought. I haue bene earnestlie entreated by one that otherwise may §doth§ com- maund me to take of my complaint against Huddlestone in my ?res to ye Councell. I praie Sr, do you therfore take onely a pryvate Notice of his miscarriage. My wife would declared hir owne thankefullnes to my Noble Ladie in wrytinge.

List of Records No. 262 Copy of a ?re to the Governor and Counsell of State residinge in Virginia. July 25th 1621 After or harty Comenda?ons, we received yor letters by the Bona Noua so lately, as we haue not had leasure to peruse them, beinge opress[ed] wth a multitude of bussines, that night and day employes vs. Wee shall therefore by this letter only touch some principall point? reservinge or selu[es] to a time of more leasure fully to deliberate and giue youe answere referringe youe for a supply of matters therein omitted, to or generall instruc?ons, wch we desire youe diligently to peruse and punctually to obserue. Wee haue sent youe (Sr Francis Wyatt) to be the future Gov- ernor, to whom we require all respect and obedience be given. mr Sandys we haue ellected or Treasuror, and Stated his place, and given him authority to see and cause all or orders concerninge staple comodities to be putt in execu?on. mr Davison is chosen by the Quarter Court for Secretary. Theire dispatches haue wholy possest vs for a night; and we hope that by the addition of such able ministers, youe wilbe enabled to performe what we ?ticulerly enioyne: the want of able officers hau[e] beene here- tofore pleaded for the cause or direc?ons haue beene no bette[r] obserued. Wee desire that these gentlemen may be well accomodated att theire landinge, and theire people well lodged. Wee haue likewise sent youe two sufficient preachers: mr Haut Wyatt; who is to be Preacher to the Gov- ernors Tenñts: and mr Bolton, whom wee haue consigned to Elizabeth Citty, to inhabitt wth Capt Tho: Nuce to whom we recomende him, vndr- standinge that mr Stockton is otherwise seated. And for supply of the Phisitions place we haue sent youe Doctor Pott, wth two Chirurgeio[ns] and a Chest of Phisicke and Chirurgery; not doubtinge but youe will enterteine and supplie him well att his landinge, wth all necessaries and accordinge vnto the Companies promise, giue him helpe for the speedy buildinge of a house imediatly vppon his arivall: the Twenty Tenant? form- erly sent must be deliuered him, and the Land belonginge to his place sett out, and what are wantinge of the number of Twenty, are to be supplied out of the Companyes Tenant? wch wee doubt not but may be done wth theire very good sattisfatio[n] Itt is or expresse will that the Tenant? belonginge to every office be fixed to his certaine place vppon the Land sett out for itt, for wch mr Cleyburne is Chosen to be or Surveyor, who att the Companies very great charge is sett out as by his condition of agreement youe may perceiue. Great hath beene the care of the Company to sattisfie yor desires that they haue spared for no paines nor charge: The Publique land? sett out, and that wch belong? to publique ?sons; his next employment must bee to sett out land? belonging vnto ?ticuler Plantations, and then that of private per- sons: for the publique, he is to do by vertue of his place wthout other then the former Salarie; neither may he exeed when he is employed by any private ?sons the rate of vjs the day, wch some must be duly paid him in good and valuable Comodities. And for that we find by experience that notwthstandinge or stric[t] comand? to the contrary, diurs Shipp? sett out for monthly wadges, mos[t] long and vnnecessary staies, to or excessiue charge; and that for want of due care shipp? come so vnsufficiently provided, as we haue reason to feare that some of them haue foundred in the Sea, and also to prevent the frau[ds] and abuses of mrs: of Shipp?, and Mariners in detention of good? sent to the Planters, and in sellinge theire good? att excessiue rates. Therefore Wee haue ellected mr John Pountis or Vice-Admirall, provisionally for one yea[re] till by a Quarter Court his place may be confirmed vnto him, and seated wth Tenant?, beinge assured that by his sufficiencie, integrity, &amp; indust[ry] these and many such growinge mischeifes wilbe prevented. [15a] With great difficulty wee haue erected a private Magazine, men beinge most vnwillinge to be drawne to subscription to be paid in smoke. yf therefore youe expect for the future any such place, it must be yor principall care the Cape-Marchannt be not constreined to vent his Comodi- ties att any sett price, and in ?ticuler not to be enforced to take Tobacco att any certaine rate; and that youe be aidinge aswell to this as to the former Magazine for the returne of Debt?. Wee require that the Markett be opne for all men, that the charitable intention of the Adventurers be not abused, and turned into privat gaine: therefore we desire youe to haue principally in yor care, that a strict Proclamation be sett out, to prohibitt such engrosseing of Comodities, and forestalling the Markett, thereby to vent it to the poore people at exessiue rates: such oppression and grindinge of the poore wee in or heart? abhorr, and require youe severely to punishe; assuringe youe nothing can be more pleasing vnto vs, then the exemplarie punishment of such Monsters as devor theire brethren by this wiked and barbarous course, especially if such wickednesse should be exercised by men in place of authority. The advancement of the Iron Workes wee esteeme to be most neces- sarie, by ?servinge whereof we esteeme the Plantation is gained: Wee therefore require all possible assistance be given to mr Berkley, now sent, and all furtherance to his Ging, es?ially good enterteinment at theire Landinge, that they may be well lodged and cherished wth such comfort- able helpe as yor place will afford, wch we will thankfully requite to any that shall advance this or so much desired Worke. And here againe wee renue againe or former Comenda?ons of mr Lapworth and that in very effectual manner. In the next place we Comend vnto yor care or Saw-Mill?, a worke of such importance as it deserues yor speciall furtherance, and therefore we desire the Dutchmen sent for the fabricke of them may be extraordinarily well vsed, &amp; carefully provided of apparell out of the new Magazine, wch we would haue paid for by the Companies Tobacco: as for such other neces- saries as they want especially beere wch cannot now be shipped for want of time and Tunnage; wee haue desired Sr Francis Wyatt to supply them wth, wch he shalbe repaid: and thus supplied wee hope they wilbe encoraged to bringe that so much desired worke to its ?fec?on Wee exeedingly approue yor course in takinge in of Indian families as beinge a great meanes to reduce that Nation to Civility and to the imbrace- ing of our Christian religeon; the blessed end wee haue proposed to or selues in this Plantation and wee doubt not of yor vigilancie that youe be not hereby entrapp'd, nor that the Savadge haue by this accesse meanes to surprize you. And to youe mr Thorpe wee will freely confesse, that both yor letters and endevors are most acceptable to vs: the enteringe vppon those Staple Comodities of wyne, and silke, wee highly co?end: and assure youe it is the Companies care to reward yor Merritt?; wch debt they will discharge, if either the Clergie heare supply or Stocke, or a returne from the Colledge Tenant? shall enable vs. In the meane while they desire youe to ?roceed in these noble courses, assuring youe of all loue and respect. The vesselle of earth youe sent wee haue not as yett received; when tryall is made youe shall heare from vs: And we pray youe all in generall that such extraordinary Oare, or Earth, as yee find youe send vs over in plentie; for that wch was sent by youe, Capt Nuce, was in so smale propor?on, as we hardly could make any triall thereof; we conceived it to be terra Lemnia, and it is exceedinge good for the flix, youe shall therefore do well to bringe it in vse in the Colony: wee desire youe Captain Newc therefore to send vs over three or foure Tunn of the said white earth; And we desire youe the Governor and Counsell to haue an especiall care that no greater proportion thereof then we from time to time direct youe be brought over: for if it be brought over in greater quantity it will not pay the fraight. This Comodity is intended to be apropriated to the generall Company, and if any benefite shalbe raised thereby it shalbe employed in fortifica?ons, and other publique, and pious uses work?, for the advancement of the Colony. And for that the Compa: conceives of youe Capt Newc as great hopes as of any theire publique instrument?, and haue by yor letters received great sattisfac?on, therfore [16] They haue in bountie added to yor former proportion of Land 300 acres wch is to be appropriated to yor place for ever: for manuringe wch they by Quarter Court haue ordered, that youe shall haue ten men sent over the next yeare, only they desire that youe wilbe so provided of Corn and other necessaries, as they may be only at the charge of transport, armes, apparrell and work- inge tooles; and not for victuall?, because their stocke is exhausted. We haue sent by a Shipp of Cattell from Irland, whereof we desire that Capt Newc be first served wth his ?mised number The hopes youe haue putt the Company in of a trade of ffurrs to be had in Hudsdons and De La Ware River, haue made many private Adventurers of great worth and well affected to the Plantation, to sett out a Shipp to that ?ticuler end, to wch we desire youe to give all possible furtherance The vioadges and discoveries already made wthin the Land, as also vppon the Sea Coast, we highly Comend; and desire a constant course be held therein, for in that consist? the very life of the Plantation. we comend to yor care especially the buildinge of Guest-houses, wch we stricktly charge youe to be brought to ?fec?on: we conceive that bussines would haue beene effected, if half so much care and time had been taken to do it, as hath beene spent in givinge reasons to the contrary. The plea of impossibility we admitt not; the Discontent we assure or selues is rather a bug-beare, then an essentiall cause of forbearance; the spoile of or good? by often remoues is a weake allegation: but that it should be a more regulated kind of killinge of men (as some haue beene pleased to writte) wee deeme strange error of iudgment. Wee cannot conceale from youe, that it is heare reported, that contrary to the publique faith given, not the sicke, but the ablest men are lett out to hire and theire provisions converted to private vses; And where it is pretended this placinge them wth old planters is for theire health, they are so vnmercifully vsed that it is the greatest cause of or Tennt? discontent, and dislike of theire Tenancy by halues: and though we hope this is not in all parts true: yett can we not conceive such vnwillingnes to proceed in this worke, should they not haue some other ground? then is alledged: lett it therefore be yor worke at yor first generall Sessions of the Counsell, to effect this bussines, and it shalbe or care to provide for the well orderinge and furnishinge of them. We comend vnto youe Capt Wm. Norton, who is now sett out by the generall Company, and many private Adventurers for the erectinge of a Glasse house Glasse worke: we desire he may be placed wth his Ginge, in the Guest house that Liuetennt Whittakers hath erected; there to reside till he hath found a convenient place to erect his furnace, In the choise whereof we desire youe to giue him yor best assistance, and especially haue a care to seat him neare some well inhabited place, that neither his Ginge be subiect to surprize, nor the Comoditie of glass and bead? be vilified by to Comon a sale to the Indians And wee canot forbeare to deliur vnto you the good opinion the Company has received of Liuetennt Whittakers for the good accompt given by him of his charge, but especially of his obedience to theire direc?ons, in erectinge a guest house; for reward whereof they haue confirmed vnto him that wch Sr George Yeardley last yeare gaue him, and promised two servant? to be transported next yeare: thereby to encorage him and others to proceed in vertue and continue in their obedience, whereof the Company and orselues much like their argument? and discourses. Wee are in hope to send to the Colledge Tennt? a very sufficient Minister we desire youe mr Thorpe that a house may be ready for him, and good provision to enterteine him: and the like course may be held in all the Planta?ons. Wee desire youe mr Thorpe, and mr Newce, to be carefull of the present      and that the Moyity be equally devided and returned vnto the Company: for the stock of the Company is utterly exhausted. wee haue sent youe a Comission for the Counsell wherein are inserted the names of all such as or intent is shalbe of the Counsell. Againe we Comend vnto youe that the people be not oppressed especially that youe limitt the fees of officers; and amongst them those of the Prov[ost] [16a] Marshall?, and Jaylors, whereof we haue dayly great Com- plaint?. wee require that shuch matters as shalbe laid vppon Delinquent? be hereafter registered, and an accompt yearely given of those that be levied, and in what publique worke, (to wch we only restreine them) they are employed. In generall, wee Comend to yor care all such bussines as by ?ticuler letters concerninge private men, and theire occacons, we haue formerly, and now againe, recomended vnto youe: And in ?ticuler from youe the Governor wee expect a good accompt of the great trust we haue reposed in youe; hopinge youe will not faile in the close, but deliur vpp to yor successor Sr Francis Wyatt, or in case he dy, to such a one as by the Counsell in Virginia shalbe chosen att the expiration of yor Comission, the Comand of the Colony in good and flourishinge estate, and much better in condi?on then when you found itt. wherein youe shall do an acceptable thinge to vs and glorious to yor selfe: In the meane while we expect the ?formance of some remarkeable service, whereof youe haue meditated long, and haue put vs in hope youe will effect before the period of yor Government. And even so we comend youe and all the rest to the proteccon of the Almightie. London this 25 of July 1621. Yor very Lovinge frend?

List of Records No. 265 Copy of a letter To the Governor and Counsell of State in Virginia by the Marmaduke. August 12th 1621 After or harty Comenda?ons &amp;c In or last letters sent youe by the George we promised a full and sattisfactary answer to all yor propositions, but by reason of the absence of the most part of the Counsell, as also that bussines dayly beyond or expectacon infinitly increaseth, we are con- streined only to touch vppon some few ?ticulars reservinge or selues for more oportune tyme, when wth a clearer iudgment we may fully deliur our mind? to you. You shall receiue by the hand? of mr Leech now bound for Virginia in the Marmaduke a Copy of or last letters, together wth a Duplicat of the Instruc?ons and Comissions, sent by the new Gov- ernor Sr Francis Wyatt, by whose happy arivall we hope you are informed what care we haue taken to giue you full sattisfac?on in most or all of yor demand?: and therefore we will hope for of the like respectiue ?for- mance of or desires from you. There are gon and in goinge from hence many Shipp? for Virginia and we canot but apprehend wth great griefe the sufferings of these multitudes at theire first landinge for want of Guest houses wherein they might haue a while sheltred themselves from the iniuries of the air in the cold season; wch omission and defect we hope and very earnestly desire you will supply by a curteous and Christian entertainment of them in yor owne howses, till they may conveniently provide themselves; and that against the next yeare you will haue erected in the foure severall Boroughs as many Guest houses capable to receiue those great numbers. Wee send youe in this Shipp on Widdow and eleven Maid? for Wiues for the people in Virginia: there hath beene especiall care had in the choise of them; for there hath not any on of them beene received but vppon good Comendacons, as by a noat herewth sent youe may perceiue: Wee pray youe all therefore in generall to take them into yor care; and more espe- cially we recomend them to youe mr Pountis, that at theire first landinge they may be housed, lodged and provided for of diet till they be marryed: for such was the hast of sendinge them away, as that straightned wth time we had no meanes to putt provisions aboard: wch defect shalbe supplied by the Magazine Shipp: and in case they cannot be presently Marryed we desire they may be putt to severall housholders that haue wiues till they can be provided of husband?: There are neare fiftie more wch are shortly to come, are sent by or most honoble Lord and Treasuror the Earle of Southampton and certaine worthy gentlemen, who takinge into theire consideration, that the Planta?on can never flourish till families be planted, and the respect of wiues and Children fix the people on the Soyle; therefore haue given this faire begininge; for the reimbursinge of whose charges, itt is ordered that who every man that Marries them giue 120li waight of the best leafe Tobbacco for each of them, and in case any of them dye that proportion must be advanced to make it vpp vppon those that surviue; and this certainty is sett downe for that the price sett vppon the boyes sent last yeare being 10li wch was so much mony out of purse here there was returned 66?i of Tobacco only and that of the worst and basest, so that fraight and shrinkage reconed together wth the basenes of the Com- oditie, there was not on half returned: wch iniury the Company is so sencible of, as they demand restitution, wch accordingly must be had of them that tooke vppon them the dispose of them, the rather that no man may mistake himselfe in accomptinge Tobacco to be currant 3s sterling the pound contrary to or expresse orders: And though we are desireous that mariadge be free according to the law of nature, yett would we not haue these maid? deceived and married to servant?, but only to such [17a] freemen or tennt? as haue meanes to manteine them: wee pray you therefore to be fathers to them in this bussines, not enforecing them to Marrie against theire will? neither send we them to be servant?, saue in case of necessitie extremitie, for we would haue theire condi?on so much bettered as multitudes may be allured thereby to come vnto you: and you may assure such men as marry those weomen that the first servant? sent over by the Company, shalbe consigned to them; it being or intent to preserue families, and to preferr married men before single ?sons: The tobacco that shalbe due vppon the mariadge of these maides we desire mr Pountis to receiue and to return by the first; as also the little quantitie of Richard Pace the Copie of whose bill is here returned. To conclude the Company for some weighty reasons too long to relate, haue ordered that no man marryinge these weomen expect the proportion of Land vseually alotted for eury head: wch to avoid clamor or troble hereafter you shall do well to giue them notice of. In the next place, Wee comend vnto yor care Capt Wm Norton and his Italians together wth the rest of his Company, to whom we pray you to be helpfull at his landing, to convey his people and good? vp to the guest- house of Liuetennt Whittakers; It is the only body in this Shipp the general Company hath interest in, and therefore we will expect yor best helpes and advice, especially in making choise of a healthfull place to plant himself in neare to the best inhabited towne, either in Charles Citty or Henerico, but by no meanes lower then James Cittie, nor remote from people: and in case Capt Norton shall dy we pray you mr George Sandys to vndertake the oversight of the worke; and if he should faile by any misaccident (wch God forbidd) then we intreat you mr George Thorp and mr Jo: Pountis to take it into yor care and in yor absence to appoint some trustie person to oursee that bussines, for wch curtesie the generall Company, and private Adventurers wilbe very thankfull to you. The makinge of bead? is one of Capt Nortons cheife employment? wch beinge the mony you trade wth the natiues we would by no meanes haue through to much abundance vilified or the Virginian? at all ?mitted to see or vndrstand the manufacture of them: wee therefore pray you seriously to consider what proportion of bead? can be vented and their worth not abated, and intimate the proportion to Capt Norton and his Italians, and certifie the same to us in yor next letters, that accordingly we may limitt the quantitie that shall from time to time be made: Vppon sight of Capt Nortons Invoice you shall ?ceive, what large provisions he is sett out wth, wch in case of his failing we desire may be carefully preserved for his people. And here we cannot hide from youe an information that is lately given vs that such provisions as we send wth new men are taken from them &amp; Indian corne given them instead thereof, the extreame labor of beatinge thereof, being no smale disharteninge to the new comers; and this sud- daine change of diett is affirmed confidently to be the cause of the flix in or men to or irreparable losse; we desire youe the whole body of the Coun- sell, to take care that these abusses be reformed for the future. The Adventurers of Martins hundred intend to proceed in theire Planta- tion they haue sent twelve lustie youths in this Shipp wch supplie they will second wth a greater of fourty more in the Magazine Shipp very soddainly to followe: theire governor mr Harwood is enioyned to accquaint youe wth his Instruc?ons, to whom wee pray youe accordingly giue yor best assistance. Wee cannot but condempne the vse that is made of or boat? that are only employed in trading in the bay for Corne almost every letter tell? of that trade wch wee only approue in case of necessitie; for we conceiue it would be much better for the Plantation and more honor for you and or nation, that the naturall? should come for theire provision to you; then you to begg yor bread of them, we shall wth a great deale more content heare of Store-houses full of corne of yor owne growth, then of a Shallopp laden wth Corn from the Bay: wee pray you therefore that a larger proportion of ground be assigned to every man to plant then formerly hath beene, and that severest punishment? be inflicted vppon such as dare to breake yor constitutions herein; and that officers be not spared, nor theire tennt? nor servant? dispenced wth.

(wch here, all charges deducted was should for lesse then then 20d ? pound) yett will not the Adventurers be so in this wrested; for they are determined to accept of tobacco at no certaine price, nor will sell theire Comodities vppon trust, till that wicked phras[e] and conceipt be rooted out of the mouths and hart? of the Planters that any thing is good enough for the Marchant. how vnworthy we and the Com- pany are of this contempt we appeale to yor selves, yet hath it not been resented by you, nor the insolencie punished, but seeing or care and charg is repaid by such monstrous ingratitude we desire you to giue notice to the Collony that after this yeare they expect no further supply of any necessaries to be exchanged wth them for theire darling tobbacco: wee haue given them a yeares notice before hand, that they may fall vppon some other course. And beinge sensible of the great losse the Adventurers still sustenith by yor roule Tobacco made vp wth fillers (as the terme is) itt is by vs and the Adventurers ordered that the Cape marchant accept of none but leaf Tobacco: wee pray youe to publish this or order throughout the Collony, that they may be provided to exchang wth or Cape Marchant non but leaf: and such as wilfully transgresse this havinge notice, if they suffer for it, it shalbe no part of or care: There is an intention to send on an exellent Shipwright wth a ginge of thirty or fortie Carpenters and boatwright?; The Company is in treatie wth him, and the rowle of Adven- turers is almost full; so that youe may certeinly expect him the next Spring: in the interim we pray youe that great number of trees of the white and black oake, growinge in wett ground? be felled and many more barked to season by standinge. The time most fitting to fell and barke yor trees is in November and December, and the begininge of Januarie. In the choise of the place we pray youe to haue respect vnto the nearenes of the Iron work?, and of the Saw Mill?; most especially we pray your best asistance in the ?fectinge of those two work?, the profitt will redound to the whole Collony, and therefore it is necessarie that you extend yor authoritie to the vtmost lymitt?, to enforce such as shall refuse theire help to a bussines, so much tendinge to the generall good: yf those work? be not ?fected the body of the Shipwright? wilbe of no vse, and if this oppor- tunity be lost, mens heart? wilbe discoraged from further adventuring: wee haue to sattisfie yor desires and to supplie yor necessities entred vppon this proiect, wee therefore expect yor best help to perfect yor owne worke whereby youe shall do a thing, glorious in it selfe, benefitt for yor selues, and the whole Collony; acceptabl to vs and the whole Company; and being ?fected it wilbe the securitie, reputation, and defence of yor litle Co?on Wealth, wch now in his infancie must be supported by fame and hope of such Comodities: And so desiringe god to blesse youe and all yor good endevors tendinge to the advancement and establishing of yor Collony, Wee bidd you farewell. Yor very Lo: frend?. London this 12th of August 1621. Wee send you againe Copies of the letters and agreement? wth mr Gookin and recomend his good enterteinment to you, and in ?ticuler we seriously advise that you do yor best endevor to pay him in tobacco though at one C waight the Cow, and to take as few Cowes as possible may be vppon mony heare to be paid by the Company; because or stocke is vtterly wasted: lett him hau[e] very good tobacco for his Cowes now at his first vioadge, for if he mak[e] a good returne, it may be the occa?on of a trade wth you fro those par      [18a] whereby you may be abundantly supplied, not only wth Cattle, but wth most of those Comodities wch you want, att better and easier rate then we from hence shalbe able. Directed: To or very Lovinge frend? the Governor and Councell of State residinge in Virginia. Since the Conclusion of or Letters, we haue received from his Matie a Petition exhibited vnto him by certain Frenchmen and Walloones desirous to inhabit in Virginia: wee haue considered of theire propositions, &amp; haue returned them so faire an answer, as wee conceiue they will resolue to go, they wilbe 60 families consisting of about 300 ?sons, youe may expect theire cominge about the next Spring. we hope they wilbe a great strength to the Collony.

List of Records No. 269 A Copie of the Counsell? letter. To the Gournor and Counsell of Virginia Sent by the Warwicke September 11th 1621 After or very hartie Comenda?ons: you shall now by this Shipp the Warwicke and the Pinace that cometh along wth her receiue those supplies that we formerly in or letters by the George and Marmaduke promised; the setting forth of wch hath beene of so exceedinge troble and labor vnto vs, being but a very few on whom so great a burthen hath lien, as we haue not been able to intend any thinge else: wherefore in that regard, as also that the noble Earle of Southampton, is not yet returned to London nor those eminent ?sons, wthout whose Councell, and authoritie we thinke it not fitt to proceed to resolu?on in so waightie bussinesses: or letters and dispatches by the Bona Nova, and the Margrett &amp; John must yett remaine vnanswered; but by the Dutie wch about the Midle of the next month is to depart, wee hope you shall receiue full sattisfac?on; wch Shipp shall bring wth her store of Silke worme seed and abundance of vine plant?, for both wch we desire not only that generall ?pera?ons be made, but that timely notice, and order be given throughout the whole Colony that every ?ticuler man may make provision for the arrivinge of some quantitie of them both; and that a straight charge be given for the preseruing of vines and Mulbery Trees, wch we vndrstand are wth others promiscuously de- frayed: and because the skill of handling them, is only derived from the ffrench men, we canot but here recomend them to yor fauor and regard, that they may be kindly vsed and cherished: we haue as by the Invoice youe shall perceiue sent them and the Duch-men (the delay of whose most necessarie workes is wth much indigna- tion here resented) dius provisions of victuall?, as also a Cloth to make them apparrell; for hose and shooes and other such matters we desire they may be supplied by the Companies stock there, out of the Magazine wch comes now along in the Warwicke large and abundante in all vsefull and necessarie Comodities: for as for vanities and su?fluities, although we find they yeeld most profitt in Virginia; yet we haue thought it most vnfitt to norish by such supplies that evill humor of prid[e] and ryott wch we wish were vtterly extirpated: and this or care therein hath had an eie rather to the benefitt of the plantation then the profitt of the Adventurors; wch shall not we hope proue preiudiciall, but rather breed a willingnes and desire in the whole Collony to make vs a speedy and profitable returne of the stock now sent (&amp; not as hitherto evill and disgracefull word? for or zeale of theire welfare, and nothing att all or at least lesse then the principall laide out) for theire relief and comfort: for youe shall vndrstand, that (not only of the ould Magazine wch was about 7000 pound, we cannot hope to see much aboue half and hitherto to haue not received any one peny) but even the new Magazine sent last yeare by mr Blany is returned backe wth losse of the principall it self, after almost two years time and so many hassard? born and yett to beare; a thinge so vnkindly and distastfully taken here, as if the accompt? had been sooner knowne we much fear thet supplies now sent had beene farr short of what they now are: But that we may not now againe incurr the like vnworthie damages; we desire you by whose wisdome and integ- ritie, wee expect a generall redresse, to be by all lawfull and iust fauors aidinge and asistinge to the bussines it selfe; and to or factor mr Blany, that both his ?son and the good? may be safely &amp; conveniently provided for and accomodated; and that the sellinge and bartering of them be left free to his discretion, and accordinge to the prices and instruc?ons he hath here given vnto him by the Adventurers, whose vnanimious resotu?on and charg is not to accept of tobacco at 3s ? pound; findinge besides all former losses that neare 40 thousand waight sent home last yeare for the generall Company and Magazine, the better half hath not yeelded xviijd ? pound, and the rest not aboue ijs to wch prices there is no possibilitie that they should ariue this next yeare: so that there must be an abatement of the price of tobacco there; neither can we yield (wch is by some planters propounded) but by the whole Company, not only the Adventurers of the Magazine denied to continue the ould rate of 3s per pound, and to ad vallew as much in the good? sent hence, as the tobacco is esteemed lesse worth then that rate for although for matters of profitt, it might go currant much alike; yet thereby we should manteine [19a] the Collony in theire overweening esteeme of theire darlinge Tobacco, to the ourthrow of all other Staple Comodities, and likewise continue the evill will they haue conceived there, and the scandalous report? here spread of oppression, and exac?ons from the Company, selling all theire Comodities for three tymes the vallew of what they cost, vppon wch fond and vniust surmises they thinke itt lawfull to vse all maner of deceipt and falshood in theire tobacco, that they put of the Magazin wch is the next thing wherein we desire yor care and favor, being assured from or factor in Holland yt exept the tobacco that shall next come thence, proue to be of more ?fec?on and good- nesse then that was come home last, there is no hope that it will vent att all, for albeit itt passed once yett the wary buyer will not be againe taken, so that we heartily wish that youe would make some provision for the burninge of all base and rotten stuff, and not to suffer any, but very good, to be cured, at least sent home whereby certainly there would be more advanced in the price then losse in the quantity: howsoever we hope that no bad nor ill condi?oned Tobacco shalbe by compelling author- itie (abusing it power given for publique good to private benefitt) putt vppon or factor: and very earnestly desire that he may haue the helpe of iustice to constreine men to pay theire debt? vnto him, both remaining of the last yeares accompt, and what shall this yeare grow dew, and that in Comodities of the same vallew and goodnes as shalbe by him contracted for. The ingrossinge of some of the principall Comodities in the last Magazine is here much distasted, as a wrong to the stocke, to be deprived of theire best Comodities at a low rate: but principally to the whole Collony who were thereby made to pay dearer, and forced to take other Comodities that they needed not: These disorders we point at and are so long and earnest in this bussines of the Magazine, not out of the private interest wch some of vs haue therein, but out of a true and sincere care and zeale of the generall good of yt Planta?on, wch we are asured will receiue notable advancement by a good and speedy returne for that will much help, if it come to the fitt Markett of this stock now adventured, the good ?ceed whereof will encourage and confirme the good mind? of the ould Adventurers, by many losses almost beaten out, and draw in many men into the Company, and wch most of all ?happ? concerneth the Collony, establish a constant and larg trade wth them, whereby not only all theire want?, but even theire desires, wilbe at all times plentifully furnished: but on the contrary if this succeed like the former, it is in vaine eur to hope for like suplies from hence: for want whereof if the Collony fall vppon any calamitie or miserie, theires be the shame and guilt whose fault it is; as for vs, it wilbe our comfort? neither to haue failed in abundance of charitie hitherto, nor in timely advise and warning? now given. By this Shipp and Pinace called the Tyger, we also send as many maid? &amp; yong weomen as will make vpp the number of fiftie, wth those twelue formerly sent in the Marmaduk; wch we hope shalbe received wth the same Christian pietie and charitie as they are sent from hence; the providinge for them at theire first landing, and disposinge of them in Mariage (wch is or cheife intent) we leaue to yor care &amp; wisdome to take that order as may most conduce to theire good, and sattisfac?on of the Adventurors for the charges disbursed in settinge them forth, wch coming to twelue pounds &amp; vpwards they require one hundreth and fiftie of the best leafe tobacco for each of them; and if any of them dye there must be a proportionable addition vppon the rest; this increase of thirty pound? weight, since those sent in the Marmaduke, they haue resolued to make finding the great shrinkage and other losses vppon the tobacco from Virginia will not beare lesse; wch tobacco as it shalbe received, we desire may be deliuered to mr Ed: Blany who is to keepe thereof a ?ticuler accompt. We haue vsed extraordinary dilligence and care in the choise of them and haue received none of whom we haue not had good testimony of theire honest life and cariadge, wch together wth theire names we send here inclosed for the sattisfac?on of such as shall Marry them; for whose further encoradgement we desire youe to giue publique notice that the next spring we purpose to send over as many youths for apprentices to those that shall now Marry any of them and make vs due sattisfac?on: this and theire owne good desert? together wth yor favors and cares will we hope marry them all vnto honest and sufficient men, whose names will reach to ?sent repayment: but if any of them shall vnwarily or fondly bestow her self (for the libertie of Mariadge we dare not infrindg) vppon such as shall not be able to giue ?sent sattisfac?on; we desire that at least as soone as abillity shalbe they be compelled to pay the true quantitie of tobacco proporconed, and that this debt may haue ?cedence of all others to be recovered: for the rest wch we hope will not be many, we desire yor best furtherance for providing them fitting services, till they may hapne vppon good matches; and are here perswaded by many old Planters that there wilbe maisters enow found there who will readily lay down what charge shalbe required, vppon assurance of repayment at theire mariadges wch as iust and [20] reasonable we desire may be given them. But this and many other thing? in this bussines we must referr to yor good considerations and faithfull endevors, hopeinge a worke begun here out of pittie and tending so much to the benefitt of the Plantation shall not miscarry for any want of good will or care on yor part?. The Society of Martins hundred whose designes by many misfortunes as well here as in Virginia haue beene hitherto checked, do now againe go forward cherefully; sendinge a supplie of people largly furnished with all necessarie provisions; the succouringe, and cherishinge of them and theire proceeding?, we in effectuall manr recomend vnto you, desiringe youe to be by all possible favors aidinge and asistinge vnto them: and in ?ticuler if the Inhabitant? of Wolster-Holmes Towne, theire old tenant? shall vn- kindly refuse to enterteine for a while these new Comers in theire howses, we desire that by yor Comand they may be billited amongst them, and they compelled to so charitable and bounden a dutie; as likewise if they shall vse any aversnes or remissnes in the deliury of such cattle as by the Adventurers is here ordered, we desire you by your authoritie to make the devision, and not to ?mitt the people now sent to suffer any preiudice at all for the want of them: The Comand and oursight of these people they haue comitted to mr Richard Keane now resident in Virginia. The Company is by diurs waies informed that there is great want of worthie Ministers in Virginia wherefore they haue enterteined, and now send along, mr Thomas White a man of good sufficiencie for learning, and recomended for integritie &amp; vprightnes of life and of so good zeale to the Planta?on, that he is content to go wth that smale allowance the Com- panies stock is able now to aford him, and to put himself vppon such pre- ferrment there, as he shall deserue, and you shall be able to accomodat him wth, wch if it be of the places belonging to the Company, we haue promised him here an addic?on to the smale allowance he hath now re- ceived: and likewise that yor godly care and wisdomes will provide for him in some competent maner, till he may be furnished wth the full number of tenant? belonging to the Ministrie; wch for him and all others shall we hope in the begininge of the Spring be accomplished: If he find enter- teinment from any private hundred; then we shall expect from them the restitution of or charges, that is six pound? for his passage and eight pound? deliured him toward? the making of some provisions. as for bookes we doubt not but you wilbe able to supplie him out of the lybraries of so many that haue died. There are two ffrench youths now sent to Capt Tho: Nuce part of those Ten promised him the next Springe; this anticipation although in a very difficult time for want of mony, we haue yeelded vnto, vppon Sr John Davers his motion, that Capt Nuce might be so much pleasured. Wee send likewise one Miles Prickett to be employed in the Companies service and especially in making of Salt wch we are informed he heretofore prack- tised in Virginia, he is to serue till Allhollantide in the yeare 1622 wthout any reward at all, wch is here before hand paid him by his passage and apparrell given him. The releases of diurs ?sons here graunted we pray you to make good the Condi?ons seurally specified, as also to giue yor best furtherance for the accomplishment of all such bussines as by ?ticuler letters or petti?ons vndrwritten are recomended vnto youe, from the Counsell and Company, whose last and ioynt request is in the behalf of Capt Guy and the Maister of the Warwick, that vppon the good ?formance of theire vioadg as well kindly vsinge and cherishinge the Passengers, as safely deliuringe all theire good?, they may be dispatched from Virginia; and what theire necessities shall require may speedily and curteously be supplied; and if you send any good? home in this Shipp or any other we pray youe to take bond for the deliury of the same; and giue them order to stay at the Ile of Wight or the Downes wthout breakinge bulke, till they receiue direc?on from hence at what Port they shall vnlade at.

Neverthelesse for that the Factors of the Merchants now abroad cannot soe suddainely haue notice hereof, and that they may haue time to vent those co?odities wch att this present they may haue in forraine parts, Their Lo?ps were pleased to respite the execution of this present order for foure Moneths, wch time being expired their Lo?ps pleasure is the same should be duely kept and observed</field>

By this means all the rights prviledges and lib9tyes togeather wth the gou9ment of the law is layd asside &amp; had noe power to worke all free trade is barred to any but the Magazine, The Planters goods after 9 or ten yeares seruice in this former slauery being taken from them, are sould and bought before their faces, and the prices contracted for wth Sr Tho Dale are sunck and raised at the will of this Conclaue, And whereas heretofore there was eight or ten staple comodityes brought from Virginia nothing comes home now but tobacco &amp; sassafrass to fill Alderman Johnsons shopp, and there goeing .8. or .10. shipps to Virginia in one yeare, all of them comes home emptye except the Magazine shipp, by wch meanes the very name of the planta?on [2] in Virginia was brought into detesta?on here And the Planters here groaning vnder the oppression of their gou9nors here, write ouer lres to nue Patrons complayning of their wronges, and yor Peticonrs free trade being bard And afterward by deteyning of his goods &amp; the passengers that came home in his shipps as well at the first coming as afterwards when yor peti?onr had two shipps &amp; 100 men in pay vpon a second voyage which shipps they desyring to stay that the Magazine might take away their Trade before yor Orators shipp came to Virginia, the deteyning his goods being the means to doe it, Yor Peti?oner findeing him- self so besett by them that he had noe way to escape them but by putting himself to the Company thinking that fiue Counsellors &amp; 15 Co?onrs could hardly be founde that would doe him so much wrong To his ou9throw he felt that this conclaue consisting of two buyers and three sellers Alderman Johnson being the buyer and seller of a great part of yor Peti?onrs goods to himselfe was the Companye they intended whereby they deceiued yor Peticonr to the vallue of 3000?, stayed his shipps putting them into a winters voyage were the death of the most of his men The Mariners sould his shipps in Virginia to pay themselues wages, and this yor Orator and another gen- tleman his ?tner had the voyage ouerthrowne wch cost as it appears by their Acco neer vpon 3600? and this was donn in the name of the Company, This there vniust dealings much greiuing some of the noblest of thadventurs who seeking aswell to redress these wrongs as to call Sr Thomas Smyth and §or§ his Casheires to acco for the moneys he [he] hath re?d vppon adven- tures, lotteryes and other means graunted by the King for the good of the said Planta?on, But by the sequence it appeares, they traduced him to his Maty, and ioyning wth certaine sole importers of tobacco, vnder a Couller of their being the onely husbands to the King they sought to make them- selues or some of their frinds Gou9nors thereby to keep the said Planta?on in slauery, and to smother there iniurious dealings which Gou9norship although they failed in it the Company not induring them yet the sole importa?on of tobacco being gained by the Projectors they haue banished the bringing home of Virginia tobacco, whereby the Planta?on is vndonne by them, that setting a price onely of tobacco and sassefrass made it alone to be planted there: All wch wrongs &amp; iniuryes afforesaid yor Peti?oner hath thought fitt to make knowne to this honorable assemblye humbly desyring that the said Sr Thomas Smyth may declare wherefore he hath not ruled the Compã &amp; Colony in Virg. according to his Maties Lres Pattents &amp; instruc?ons, but by the lawes directly contrary to the same, And fur- ther that he and his Cash Ke?s may be forthwith Compelled to pay into the now Tr?r so much money as they haue any way re?d for the said Com- pany, &amp; can shew noe true or iustifiable acco or discharge for the same, And likewise to consider how much the Planta?on hath been dishonored thereby, And lastly that he and his associates may make satisfac?on to yor Peti?oner of all such hindrances as he hath by their vniust practizes susteyned And yor peti?onr will euer pray for yor honors as the Preseruers of his estate John Bargraue Ordered to be mooued in the house Send for to Answear, Sr Tho.

Gates &amp; Captaine Argall successiuely, now liueing, and readye to witnes did see such a necessitye that the said lawes should be made and published in some cases, ad terrorem, and in some to be truely executed, as wthout wch the Colony consisting then of such debayst &amp; irregular ?sons could not possibly continue: And it is a bould slaunder that Sr Thomas Smyth and others practizeing wth him did print the said book and practize those things for their owne ends, first nothing being donne by him in the practize &amp; execu?on thereof and secondly the printer yet liueing can witnes that he was directed to print it not by Sr Thomas Smyth alone but by sundry of his Maties Counsell for Virg: whereof many are very honb?e LL &amp; kntts, now liueing &amp; of this honorb?e house And the said Sr Thomas Smyth and Alderman Johnson doe joynctly say that to their knowledge the said Bargraue had noe nomina?on in any Pattent to make a priuate Planta?on nor neuer made any, much les the first as he vntruelye alleageth but they beleiue that wthout Comission from the Companye he sent thither his Deputies, a very disordered Crew, that intruded there vppon the Lands of other Planters &amp; Comitted outrage and rapine vppon the pore Indyans, as Captaine Martine, then in Virginia now in London vnder the testimony of his hand complayneth &amp; is ready being called to iustifye. Neither doe the said Sr Thomas Smyth nor Alderman Johnson beleiue, nor know, nor is it by their meanes that he hath suffred those supposed da?ages, of one thousand pounds in one voyage to Virginia, by reason of the 15th and other Articles executed there, but they say confidentlye, that if by Captaine Argall then Go?nor in Virginia the said Bargraue was hindred in his designes, it was to eisye a punishment for such to be onely Curbed &amp; restrained of their euill courses whereof Captaine Argall now resident in London complayneth &amp; is ready to iustifie against Bargraues Deputyes &amp; others that vnder Couller of goeing to trade wth the Indyans did for their priuate lucre vnfurnish the Colonye of necessary prouisions and furnish the Indyans wth Armes, or rob them of their [2] corne, and also to approue that the afforesaid article, restrayning all men on paine of death without leaue to take &amp; Carry shipps and vessells out of the Riuer vnder pretence of Tradeing, whereby many played the Pyratts and took their courses to rob and spoyle, was very iust and necessarye. And they vtterly denye, as falcely suggested by the said Bargraue and most im?tinent that euer they ioyned with the sole importees of tobacco or that they sought to deteyne the go?ment, wch by Sr Thomas Smyth was absolutely refused, and in open Court denyed to be putt in elec?on, neither did they bannish the bringing home of Virginia tobacco, that being donne by those that succeded after he had left the Go?ment, wch if it be a iust ymputa?on, it resteth vppon them. And they doe further say and thereof doe humbly desyre this honorable Comittee to be informed that this Bargraue being at ?nte 500li in indebted by his bond long forfeited to the Virginia Aduenturers for tobacco bought of them; This bond was put in sute by Sr Thomas Smyth Sr John Wol- stenholm and Alderman Johnson to whome it was made by order from the said Aduentrs Bargraue remooued the Cause into Chancerye wth a rayling bill against those three and others.

List of Records No. 283 After or very hartie Comendacons, Wee writt vnto you very lately by the Discouerie, whereof Capt Thomas Jones went Maister: we haue since received certaine advice, that there are newly gon from Amsterdam for the same trade of ffurrs and the self same places, two smale Pinaces, the one of 40 Tunn wth foure, and the other of 80 Tunn wth six peeces of cast Ordinance double manned, and exeedingly well provided wth Comodities: wherefore it will very much import that the Discouerie be instantly expe- dited from Virginia, wth those necessarie supplies of men and provisions, that we haue intreated you to furnish her wth, that she may not com either to weak or to late, or any way vnfitt for the ?formance of her bussines; for the ?ticularities whereof we referr you to or former letters, the topics whereof we here inclosed send you. Now we only in the most effectuall and earnest maner that we may againe recomend it to yor most serious cares and zealous furtherance. ffor the supplies of the Magazine and Maid? formerly sent in the Marmaduke, Warwick, and Tyger; we assure or selues thing? are in that forwardnes of a good return (through yor prudent cares and favors) as we haue more cause to giue you hartie thank?, then need to intreat yor asistance therein: yett because no diligence in so waightie matters, can be thought su?flu- ous; we haue at the intreatie of the Adventurers, here inclosed sent you the Copie of that dispatche, to reviue thing? in yor memorie, and thereto do now againe adioyne or most earnest intreatie for the continuance of yor care, and iust fauor, till the full accomplishinge of all those businesses in such maner as is desired, and indeed deserved, by such free and worthie mind?, as those Adventurers moue from. Wee will not recapitulate, what wee haue amply in or formr letters expressed, how iust and necessarie it is (the Companies stock beinge vtterly exhausted and no meanes of supplie but from private purses) that a good and profit- able accompt should be returned of these many Adventures; we will only add (wch to generous mind? is of no smale force) that by yor wise cares and iust favors it is expected; and in that confidence, but principally out of a singuler zeale to advance the Plantacon and accomodate the Planters, although the Adventures alreadie sent, haue been so many and so large, as orselues cannot but wonder, yet haue the self same ?sons newly vndrwritt nere a thousand pound? for the sending of Shippwright? and house-Carpenters; and so farr is the busines alreadie proceeded in, as we may asure you, and you the Collony, that by God? blessing, they shall by the end of Aprill at the furthest haue this necessarie supplie amongst them: In the meane space we desire that fitt preparations may be made for the enterteining of them, that shall after make preparations for others; In wch regard we giue you this timely notice: and also that you might be ?takers wth us of the comfort and encoragment, wch we dayly receiue by the continuance and increase of those free and worthie Adventurers, wherein we wth all thankfull humilitie do acknowledg the gratious provi- dence of God, in so much enlargeinge (vppon the failinge of the publique revenues) the heart? of private men, in a verie difficult time, and after so many vnfortunate Adventures made in the like kinde, to ?forme these great work?, so advanteageable and necessarie vnto the Plantation. There is one thinge likewise that hath lately hapned vnto us, not great in itself but of great good hope; the gentlemen and Mariners of the Royall James belongeing to the East India Company, being mett at Cap Bona Speranza by some English Shipps outward bound, and certified of the prosperitie of Virginia, did there (vppon the exhortation of Mr Copland theire Minister) bestow the su?e of 70li toward? the buildinge of a free schoole in Virginia; wch pious guift hath lately received an addiccon of 30li by an vnknowne ?son. The maner of employeinge the mony wch the Company hath resolued vppon, we send you here inclosed, desiringe that you would likewise take it into yor considerations: We likewise send you the Copies of some Court?, whereby you shall vndrstand, what hath lately passed concrning the bringeing in of all or Tobbacco; wch we doubt not but you haue and shall heare of by many waies; otherwise we should haue been loth to mingle any thing vnpleasant amongst so much ioyfull and comfort- able as we haue before related; but such is the composition of all worldly affaires: for orselues we are not, and desire you likewise not to be dis- coraged, att any difficulties that do or may arise: wch we interprett onely as the tryall of or patience and vertue, whether we be worthie to be the Instru- ment? of so glorious a worke as this Plantation is, so we wish and desire you to conceiue, and to go on cheerefully in yor waighty charg?, according to the instruccons we haue given you, and in especiall that you vse all possible dilligence and industrious care, to further and accomplish those great and many designes of Salte, Sawinge Mills, and Iron, not letting slipp those occacons, wch ?happs will hardly be ever recovered; nor neglecting the ?fectinge of those thing? wch you haue, and ever shall haue, a certaine necessitie of, and but an vncertaine asurance of from vs: wee desire you therefore very earnestly to endevor the setting vp of those and other staple Comodities, and by example and by ?swations to make the whole Collony capable, [21a] what necessitie lieth vppon them, to make a good store wthin themselues, of all vsefull Comodities, rather then a smale advantage of prsent profitt. Wee haue by this Shipp and the Discouerie sent you diurs sort? of seed?, and fruit trees, as also Pidgeons, Connies, Peacock? Maistiues, and Beehiues, as you shall by the Invoice ?ceiue; the preservation &amp; encrease whereof we recomend vnto you. We haue sent vnto you likewise some Vine cutting? and a very smale quantitie of Silkworm seed, of both wch we had hoped to haue sent you abundance, and in that regard deteined the Discoverie so long; but of thing? so farr remote we are not absolute maisters, we are put in howerly expectation thereof, In the mean while, we pray you that these now sent, and those you formerly had, may be improued to the most; and the skill of the Frenchmen diffused amongst many, though they haue not much matter to exercise it in. There haue been nyne several Pattent? granted at or last Quarter Court, and aboue 1,000 people vndertaken to be transported by them this next Spring, we desire you therefore that those due provisions of Guesthouses (so often sollicited by vs) may be made, and abundance of Corn planted to supplie them at fittinge prices, in regard that through the great rayse of grayn here, they are like to come slenderly furnished hence. And further we commend vnto yor care and charitie the enterteimt of those prsent Planters, that at their first landing, they may haue yor best further- ance for the lodgeing them in howses; and also in setting out of theire land in convenient places, together wth yor best assistance and direccon in their courses, at their first arivall, that they may by yor curteous vsage be encoradged to stay wth you, and others invited to come vnto you: and amongst these in ?ticuler wee cannot but co?end mr Copeland? three Tennt?, he having merited that favor of the Company. Wee haue dilli- gently laboured but not yett able to effect any thinge toward? yor helpe in the matter of Fortification: yet are we not out of hope to do something shortly In the meane while, we desire you not to be any thing remisse, in whatsoever may tend to yor saftie, to wch no gaine can be comparable, but to be alwaies so prepared as in imminent danger, and especially to supplie wth abundance of care and vigilancie, what you want in strength. The coniectures of the Southwest passage and the peece of Copper wch you sent us, wee gladly saw and heard; for since you now begin to discover the Cuntrie, and enquire after Comodities we doubt not, but you shall find what you seeke, or better; wherefore we earnestly desire you, to continue and proceed herein, according to yor best meanes; and to send us from time to time the Card? of such places as you shall discour; and larg quantities of the Comodities that you find, for the Sayes of thing? are not easily nor certainly made in smale quantities: The place of Copper hold? nothing else, but is so ?fect good, that if it might be gotten wth so easie labor as the Indian? relate, there were no mine could equall the riches thereof: what further you haue vndrstood thereof, we desire by the next to heare, that we may both sattisfie orselues and others, and either begin or leaue so rich a hope. The last thing we haue at prsent to writte, is that these Shipp? the Bona Nova &amp; Hopewell both in or owne, and the Companyes name, may be seriously recomended vnto you, that they may be speedily dispatched from Virginia, and neither by you deteined, nor suffered themselues to trifle out the time. In wch we especially require the care of mr Pountis, whom in or last Quarter Court, we haue chosen Vice Admirall, and purpose, God willng, with the first opportunitie to estate the place wth twelve Tennt?. Thisor whatsoeur favor or curtesie you can aford vnto these Shipp?, in furtherance of theire intended fishinge vyoadges, wee pray you effectually to ?forme, for so both the vndrtakers and setters out of them do deserue at yors and or hand? and the good or ill successe of this bussines doth very highly importe the Collony wch we doubt not but you fully undrstand: And so we comitt you to the guidance and protection of the Allmightie and rest Yor very Loving frend?

And the said Court, for the better maintenance of the said Schoole, Schoolemaster, and Vsher intended there to be placed, granted 1000. acres of land to the said free Schoole, to bee at Charles Cittie, as the most commodious place for health, security, profit, and conueniency: And appointed that with the said 100. pound 8. shillings 6. pence, there should be sent ouer presently an Vsher, for the instructing of the children there, in the principles of Religion, ciuility of life, and humane learning: as also that fiue persons (besides an ouerseer of them) should be foorthwith sent in the condition of Apprentices, to manure and cultiuate some part of the said land, for the vse and benefit of the said Vsher, till God stirred vp the hearts of others to be further helpefull to the said Schoole. Likewise the said honourable Virginia Court, thought fit in honour of the said East-India Benefactors, the said free Schoole should bee built, and the said 1000 acres set out in Charles Citie, to be called The East- India Schoole: And that the East-India Companies seruants, should haue precedence before any other, to preferre their children thither, to be brought vp in the rudiments of learning. They thought fit also, that this (as a Collegiat or free Schoole) should haue dependance on Henrico Colledge in Virginia, which should be made capable to receiue Schollers from the Schoole, into such Schollerships and Fellowships as the said Colledge shall be endowed withall, for the aduance- ment of Schollers, as they shall rise by degrees and desert in learning. There was since by a person refusing to be named, sent in to the great and generall Quarter Court held for Virginia, the 30. of Ianuary 1621. 25 pound toward the furtherance of this godly worke: So that now there is in all 125. pound 8 shillings 6. pence.

For publike actions of vertue, besides that they are presently comfortable to the doers, are also exemplary to others; and as they are more beneficiall to others, so are they crowned in vs: our principall care should bee, that while our soules liue in glory in heauen, our good actions may liue vpon earth, and that they may be put into the banke and multiply, while our bodies lie in the graue and putrifie.

TO THE HONRABLE COMPANIE OF VIRGINIA. Right Honorable and Worthy: The fame of our late vnhappy accident in Virginia, hath spread it selfe, I doubt not, into all parts abroad, and as it is talked of of all men, so no question of many, and of most, it cannot but be misreported, some carryed away with ouer-weak lightnesse to beleeue all they heare, how vntrue soeuer; others out of their disaffection possibly to the Plantation, are desirous to make that, which is ill, worse; and so the truth of the Action, which is only one, is varied and misreported. I haue thought it therefore a part of some acceptable seruice in me towards you, whose fauors haue preferred me to be a member of your Company, to present you with these my poore labours, the Collection of the truth hereof, drawne from the relation of some of those that were beholders of that Tragedie, and who hardly escaped from tasting of the same cup, as also from the Letters sent you by the Gouernour and other Gentlemen of quality, and of the Councell in that Colonie, read openly here in your Courts: That so the world may see that it was not the strength of a professed enemy that brought this slaughter on them, but contriued by the perfidious treachery of a false- hearted people, that know not God nor faith. No generous Spirit will forbeare to goe on for this accident that hath hapned to the Plantation, but proceed rather chearfully in this honorable Enterprize, since the discouery of their bruitish falshood will proue (as shall appeare by this Treatise following) many waies aduantageable to vs, and make this forewarning a forearming for euer to preuent a greater mischiefe. Accept it from me, I most humbly beseech you, as the first fruits of my poore seruice. Time may happily make me able to yeeld you some other worke whose subiect may bee Ioy, as this is a Theame of Sadnesse: Meane- time, I commit You and the Noble Colony to Gods good blessing, as he that shall alwaies be A true Votarie for your happinesse, and seruant to your commands, Edward Waterhovse.

With a Relation of the barbarous Massacre in the time of peace and League, treacherously executed vpon the English by the natiue Infidels, 22 March last. Although there haue been many and sundry Treatises writ of Virginia, and the Commodities thereof; whereat malitious men may take occasion to cauill, but godly men will finde good cause to praise the Almighty, whose wonders are seene in the deepe, through the which we haue sailed to the discouery of this good Land: Yet I haue not thought it amisse (since I am to expresse some late Accidents) before-hand to summe vp the benefits of that Countrey; partly because they daily encrease by new Dis- coueries made, to the glory of our most gratious King, and euer renowned to all posteritie, for the founding and supporting of this most Royall and blessed work of Plantation, to the great honor, wealth [2] and happinesse of his most famous Kingdomes; and partly, because such is the customary daintinesse of Readers, that they seldome take the paines to gather together all that hath beene written of any subiect, that so they might take the whole businesse into their consideration, (which is the onely way to make a true iudgement,) but vsually content themselues with one or two Bookes set out occasionally, and with reference to some former Treatises, whereby they gaine but a lame and parcell-knowledge, and so oftentimes both preiudice themselues and the truth. The Countrey called Virginia (so named by the late Virgin-Queene Eliza- beth of blessed memory) being the rightfull inheritance of his Maiesty, as being first discouered at the costs and charges of that most prudent Prince of famous memory, King Henry the Seauenth, his Maiesties great Grand- father; The Patent whereof still extant to be seene, was granted to Iohn Cabot and diuers other of his subiects, who went thither with sixe Saile of Ships, and discouered as farre as from Cape Florida to New-found-land, all along the Coast, and tooke possession thereof to the Kings vse, about that time when Ferdinando and Isabella discouered the Westerne Indies: (by which title of first discouery the King of Portugal and Spaine hold and enioy their ample and rich Kingdomes in their Indies East &amp; West:) A coast where King Edward the Sixt after planted his fishing to the New- found-land by publike Act in Parliament, and of which Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlow tooke againe possession to the vse of the late Queene Elizabeth: and after them, [3] Sir Richard Greenfield, Sir Ralph Lane, and Sir Walter Rawleigh; at what time seuerall Colonies were there placed. And since his Maiesties most happy comming to the Crowne, being an absolute King of three of the most populous Kingdomes (which Charles the Fift was wont to tearme Officina gentium, the shop or forge of men,) finding his Subiects to multiply by the blessed peace they enioy vnder his happy gouernment, did out of his high wisedome and Princely care of the good of his Subiects, grant a most gratious Patent to diuers Honour- able persons, and others of his louing Subiects, authorizing them thereby to goe on in the Plantation of this his lawfull and rightfull Kingdome of Virginia, which by the blessing of Almighty God is growne to good perfection. This spatious and fruitful Country of Virginia, is (as is generally knowne to all) naturally rich, and exceedingly well watered, very temperate, and healthfull to the Inhabitants, abounding with as many naturall blessings, and replenished with as goodly Woods, and those full of Deere and sundry other beasts for mans sustenance; and the Seas and Riuers thereof (many therein being exceeding fayre and nauigable) as full of excellent fish of diuers sorts, and both water &amp; land yeelding as great variety of fowle, as any Country in the world is knowne to afford. The situation whereof being neere the middest of the world, betweene the extremities of heate and colde, seemes to partake of the benefits of both, and therby becometh capable of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. From whence ariseth an assurance [4] that (by the assistance and skill of industry) those rich Furres, Cordage, and other Commodities, which with difficulty and danger are now drawn from Russia, will be had in Virginia and the parts adioyning, with ease and safety. And the Masts, Plancks, and Boards, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, which now are fetched from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, will there be had in abundance. The Iron, which hath so wasted our English Woods, (that it selfe in short time must decay together with them) is to be had in Virginia (where wasting of Woods is an ease and benefit to the Planter) for all good conditions answerable to the best Iron of the world, whereof proofe hath beene made. The Wines, Fruits, and Salt of France and Spaine: the Silkes of Persia and Italy, will be had also in Virginia, in no kinde of worth inferiour, where are whole Woods of many miles together of Mulberry trees of the best kindes, the proper food of the Silke-worme, and a multitude of other naturall commodities. Of Woods, Roots and Berries, for excellent Dyes; of Plants and other Drugs for Physicall seruice; of sweet Woods, Oyles and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse; of Cotton-wooll, Silke-grasse and Sugar-Canes, will there be had in abundance, with many other kindes. And for Corne, Cattell, and Fish, (which are the substance of the food of man) in no place better: the Graine also of our owne Country prospering there very well; but their Maize (being the naturall Graine of Virginia) doth farre exceed in pleasant- nesse, strength, fertilitie, and generalitie of vse, the Wheat of England. [5] The Cattell which were transported thither (being now growne neere to fifteene hundred) doe become much bigger of body then the breed from whence they came. The Horses also (through the benefit of the Climate, and nature of their feeding) more beautifull and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertilitie of that soyle, that the Does of their Deere (a kinde differing from ours in England, yet no way inferiour) yeeld two Fawnes at a fall or birth, and sometimes three. And the Fishings along our Coasts are in plenty of Fish equall to those of New-found-land, and in greatnesse and goodnesse much superiour, and twice in the yeare to be taken, in their going and returne, which is not else-where found in such plenty and varietie; So as there went this yeare from diuers parts of this Kingdome, neere thirty Saile thither, who are well returned and richly fished. To conclude (but out of certaine aduertisements so often reiterated from thence, as well as by the constant relations of many hundreds now yearely comming &amp; going) they auow, that it is a Country which nothing but igno- rance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde &amp; ill purpose can defame, which as it paralelleth the most opulent and rich Kingdomes of the world, by lying in the same Latitude with them, so doth it promise richer Mynes of the best and most desired mettals with them, when the Colonie shall be of sufficient strength to open and defend them. And for the Passage thither, and Trade there, it is free from all restraint by forren Princes, whereunto most of our other accustomed trades are subiect: there is neyther danger in the way, through [6] the encountring of the Enemy or Pyrate, nor meeting with Rockes or Sholes (by reason of the fayre and safe passage thorow the maine Ocean) nor tediousnes of iourney, which by reason of better knowledge then in former yeares (the fruit of time and obseruation) is oftner made and in fewer weekes, then formerly it was wont to be in moneths; which (with the blessing of God) produced in the last Summer this effect, that in the Fleet of nine Saile of ships, transporting aboue seauen hundred Passengers out of England and Ireland, for the Plantation, but one person (in whose roome another at Sea was borne) miscarryed by the way. And for them after ariuall, there are conuenient lodgings now in building, and carefull attendance in Guests-houses prouiding, till those that ariue can prouide for themselues. In the three last yeares of 1619. 1620. and 1621. there hath beene prouided and sent for VIRGINIA forty two Saile of ships, three thousand fiue hundred and seauenty men and women for Plantation, with requisite prouisions, besides store of Cattell, and in those ships haue beene aboue twelue hundred Mariners imployed: There hath also beene sent in those yeares nine ships to the Sommer Ilands with about nine hundred people to inhabite there, in which ships two hundred and forty Mariners were imployed. In which space haue beene granted fifty Patents to particular persons, for Plantation in VIRGINIA, who with their Associates haue vndertaken therein to trans- port great multitudes of people and cattell thither, which for the most part is since performed, and the residue now in preparing, as by the seuerall Declarations of [7] each yeare in their particulars, (manifested and approued in our generall and publike Quarter-Courts) and for the fuller satisfaction of all desirous to vnderstand the particularities of such proceedings, hath beene by printing commended to the vnderstanding of all. 3570 People sent to Virginia in the three last yeares. 42 Saile of ships, 1200 Mariners im- ployed. 500 1 2 No copy seems to contain this "Note." Apparently the broadside "The Inconveniencies." etc., was a substitute for it. To the Sommer Ilands. 9 ships, and 240 Mariners im- ployed. The Letters written from the Gouernor and Treasurer in VIRGINIA in the beginning of March last, (which came hither in April,) gaue assurance of ouercomming and bringing to perfection in this yeare, the Iron-works, Glasse-works, Salt-works, the plentifull sowing of all sorts of English graine with the Plough, hauing now cleared good quantitie of ground; setting of store of Indian Corne or Maize, sufficient for our selues, and for trucke with the Natiues; restraint of the quantity of Tobacco, and amendment of it in the quality, learned by time and experience; The planting of Vines and Mulberry-trees neere to their houses, Figg-trees, Pomgranats, Potatoes, and Cotton-wooll seedes, Pocoon, Indico, Sugar-Canes, Madder, Woade, Hempe, Flaxe, and Silke-grasse; and for the erecting of a fayre Inne in Iames-Citie for the better entertainment of new commers, whereto and to other publike workes, euery old planter there offered freely and liberally to contribute. I write the words of their Letters. And how in a late Discouery made, a few moneths before by some of them to the South- ward, they had past thorow great Forrests of Pines, fifteene or sixteene miles broad, and aboue threescore miles long, very fit for Mastes for ship- ping, and for Pitch and Tarre, and of other sorts of woods fit for Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, and came vnto a most fruitfull Country, blessed with abun- dance of Corne, [8] reaped twice ayere (within the limits of VIRGINIA) where also they vnderstand of a Copper-myne, an essay whereof was sent, and vpon tryall here found to be very rich; and met with a great deale of Silk-grasse there growing, which monethly may be cut, of which kindes, and Cotton-wooll, all the Cambaya and Bengala stuffes are made in the East- Indies: and of which kindes of Silke-grasse was heretofore made a peece of Grogeram giuen to Queene Elizabeth. And how that in December last they had planted and cultiuated in VIRGINIA Vines of all sorts, (as well those naturally growing, as those other Plants sent them from these parts of Europe) Orenge and Lemon-trees, Figge-trees, Sugar-Canes, Cotton- wooll, Cassaui Rootes, (that make very good bread) Plantanes, Potatoes, and sundry other Indian fruits and plants not formerly seene in VIRGINIA, which at the time of their said Letters beganne to prosper very well: as also their Indico-seedes, for the true cure whereof there is lately caused a Treatise to be written. Mr. Hariot in his book of Virginia 1585. Furthermore, they write that in a Voyage made by Lieutenant Marmaduke Parkinson, and other English Gentlemen, vp the Riuer of Patomack they saw a China Boxe at one of the Kings houses where they were: Being demanded where he had it, made answer, That it was sent him from a King that dwelt in the West, ouer the great Hils, some tenne dayes iourney, whose Countrey is neare a great Sea, hee hauing that Boxe, from a people as he said, that came thither in ships, that weare cloaths, crooked swords, &amp; somwhat like our men, dwelt in houses, and were called Acanack-China: and he offered our people, that he would send [9] his Brother along with them to that King, which offer the Gouernor purposed not to refuse; and the rather, by reason of the continual constant relations of all those Sauages in VIRGINIA, of a Sea, and the way to it West, they affirming that the heads of all those seauen goodly Riuers, (the least wherof is greater then the Riuer of Thames, and nauigable aboue an hundred and fifty miles, and not aboue sixe or eight miles one from another) which fall all into one great Bay, haue their rising out of a ridge of hils, that runnes all along South and North: whereby they doubt not but to finde a safe, easie, and good passage to the South Sea, part by water, and part by land, esteem- ing it not aboue an hundred and fifty miles from the head of the Falls, where wee are now planted; the Discouery whereof will bring forth a most rich trade to Cathay, China, Iapan, and those other of the East Indies, to the inestimable benefit of this Kingdome. But for the further proofe hereof, and of the North-west passage thither by Sea, I referre the Reader to the Treatie annexed at the end of this Booke, written by that learned and famous Mathematician, Mr Henry Briggs, which I hauing happily attained vnto, haue published for the common good. Moreouer, the Letters of Mr. Iohn Berkley, sometimes of Beuerstone Castle in the County of Glocester, (a Gentleman of an honorable Familie) likewise certifie, that a more fit place for Iron-workes (whereof he was made Master &amp; ouer-seer) then in VIRGINIA, both for wood, water, mynes, and stone, was not to be found: And that by Whitsontide then next (now past) the Company might relye vpon good quantities [10] of Iron made by him: which also by Letters from Mr. George Sandis the third of March last, was confirmed, with this farther description of the place (called The falling Creeke) to be so fitting for that purpose, as if Nature had applyed her selfe to the wish and direction of the Workeman; where also were great stones hardly seene else where in VIRGINIA, lying on the place, as though they had beene brought thither to aduance the erection of those Workes. The Letters of the French Vignerous or Vine-men, procured out of France &amp; sent ouer into VIRGINIA, did likewise assertaine, that no Countrey in the world was more proper for Vines, Silke, Rice, Oliues, and other Fruits, then VIRGINIA is: and that it farre excelled their owne Countrey of Languedocke; the Vines of diuers sorts being in abundance naturally ouer all the Countrey: and they hauing planted some cuttings of Vines at Michaelmas last, in their Letters affirme that these bare Grapes already this Spring, to their great wonder, as being a thing they suppose not heard of in any other Countrey. A taste of Wine made of the wilde grape, they last year sent, with hope to send a good quantitie this next Vintage; and that the Mulberry-trees where they abode were in wonderfull abundance, and much excelling both in goodnesse and greatnesse those of their owne Country of Languedocke: and that those Silke-wormes they haue, prosper exceeding well, and some Silke they hope to send this yeare, there wanting nothing to set vp that rich Commodity but store of hands wherewith England doth abound. Of the fruit of which Mulberry-trees (as of a Plum there plentifully grow[11]ing) they would make wholsome drinkes for the Colony and people there. The Letters of Mr Porey (verified also from the Gouernor and Councell) aduertised of a late Discouery by him and others made into the great Bay Northward, (reseruing the sounding of the bottome thereof for a second Voyage,) where hee left setled very happily neare an hundred English, with hope of a good trade for Furres there to be had. From thence was brought by Lieutenant Perkinson, in his voyage, some of that kind of Earth which is called Terra Lemnia (there to be had in great abundance) as good as that of Turkey. By this (though it be but in part) the Reader may vnderstand the great riches and blessings of this excellent Countrey, which euen ordinary diligence and care must needes strangely improue. But that all men may see the vnpartiall ingenuity of this Discourse, we freely confesse, that the Countrey is not so good, as the Natiues are bad, whose barbarous Saua- genesse needs more cultiuation then the ground it selfe, being more ouer- spread with inciuilitie and treachery, then that with Bryers. For the land being tilled and vsed well by vs, deceiued not our expectation, but rather exceeded it farre, being so thankfull as to returne an hundred for one. But the Sauages though neuer Nation vsed so kindly vpon so small desert, haue in stead of that Haruest which our paines merited, returned nothing but Bryers and thornes, pricking euen to death many of their Benefactors: yet doubt wee not, but that as all wickednes is crafty to vndoe it self, so these also, thorow our sides, haue more wounded [12] themselues then vs, God Almighty making way for seueritie there, where a fayre gentlenesse would not take place. The occasion whereof thus I relate from thence. The last May there came Letters from Sir Francis Wiat Gouernor in VIRGINIA, which did aduertise that when in Nouember last he ariued in VIRGINIA, and entred vpon his Gouernment, he found the Country setled in a peace (as all men there thought) sure and vnuiolable, not onely because it was solemnly ratified and sworne, and at the request of the Natiue King stamped in Brasse, and fixed to one of his Oakes of note, but as being aduantagious to both parts; to the Sauages as the weaker, vnder which they were safely sheltred and defended; to vs, as being the easiest way then thought to pursue and aduance our proiects of buildings, plant- ings, and effecting their conuersion by peaceable and fayre meanes. And such was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or neuer a sword worne, and a Peece seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle. By which assurance of securitie, the Plantations of particular Aduenturers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground inuited them, and the further from neighbors held the better. The houses generally set open to the Sauages, who were alwaies friendly entertained at the tables of the English, and commonly lodged in their bed-chambers. The old planters (as they thought now come to reape the benefit of their long trauels) placed with wonderfull content vpon their priuate diuidents, and the planting [13] of particular Hundreds and Colonies pursued with an hopefull alacrity, all our proiects (saith he) in a faire way, and their familarity with the Natiues, seeming to open a faire gate for their conuersion to Christianitie. The Country being in this estate, an occasion was ministred of sending to Opachankano the King of these Sauages, about the middle of March last, what time the Messenger returned backe with these words from him, That he held the peace concluded so firme, as the Skie should sooner fall then it dissolue: yea, such was the treacherous dissimulation of that people who then had contriued our destruction, that euen two dayes before the Mas- sacre, some of our men were guided thorow the woods by them in safety: and one Browne, who then to learne the language liued among the Warra- scoyacks (a Prouince of that King) was in friendly manner sent backe by them to Captaine Hamor his Master, and many the like passages, rather increasing our former confidence, then any wise in the world ministring the least suspition of the breach of the peace, or of what instantly ensued; yea, they borrowed our owne Boates to conuey themselues crosse the Riuer (on the bankes of both sides whereof all our Plantations were) to consult of the diuellish murder that ensued, and of our vtter extirpation, which God of his mercy (by the meanes of some of themselues conuerted to Christianitie) preuented; and as well on the Friday morning (the fatal day) the 22 of March, as also in the euening, as in other dayes before, they came vnarmed into our houses, without Bowes or arrowes, or other weap- ons, with Deere, Turkies, Fish, [14] Furres, and other prouisions, to sell, and trucke with vs, for glasse, beades, and other trifles: yea in some places, sate downe at Breakfast with our people at their tables, whom immediately with their owne tooles and weapons, eyther laid downe, or standing in their houses, they basely and barbarously murthered, not sparing eyther age or sexe, man, woman or childe; so sodaine in their cruell execution, that few or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction. In which manner they also slew many of our people then at their seuerall workes and husbandries in the fields, and without their houses, some in planting Corne and Tobacco, some in gardening, some in making Bricke, building, sawing, and other kindes of husbandry, they well knowing in what places and quarters each of our men were, in regard of their daily familiarity, and resort to vs for trading and other negotiations, which the more willingly was by vs continued and cherished for the desire we had of effecting that great master-peece of workes, their conuersion. And by this meanes that fatall Friday morning, there fell vnder the bloudy and barbarous hands of that perfidious and inhumane people, contrary to all lawes of God and men, of Nature &amp; Nations, three hundred forty seuen men, women, and children, most by their owne weapons; and not being content with taking away life alone, they fell after againe vpon the dead, making as well as they could, a fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and mangling the dead carkasses into many pieces, and carrying some parts away in derision, with base and bruitish triumph. Neither yet did these beasts spare those amongst [15] the rest well knowne vntthem, from whom they had daily receiued many benefits and fauours, but spitefully also massacred them, without remorse or pitty, being in this more fell then Lyons and Dragons, which (as Histories record) haue beene so farre from hurting, as they haue both acknowledged, and gratefully requited their Benefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell beasts, as to make them put off the very nature of beasts, and to put on humanity vpon them. But these miscreants, contrariwise in this kinde, put not off onely all humanity, but put on a worse and more then vnnaturall bruitishnesse. One instance of it, amongst too many, shall serue for all. That worthy religious Gentleman, Master George Thorpe Esquire, Deputie of the Colledge lands, sometimes one of his Maiesties Pentioners, and in one of the principall places of command in VIRGINIA, did so truly and earnestly affect their conuersion, and was so tender ouer them, that whosoeuer vnder his authority had giuen them but the least displeasure or discontent, he punished them seuerely. He thought nothing too deare for them, and as being desirous to binde them vnto him by his many courtesies, hee neuer denyed them any thing that they asked him, insomuch that when these Sauages complained vnto him of the fiercenesse of our Mastiues, most implacable and terrible vnto them, (knowing them by instinct it seemes, to be but treacherous and false-hearted friends to vs, better then our selues) he to gratifie them in all things, for the winning of them by degrees, caused some of them to be killed in their presence, to the great dis[16]pleasure of the owners, and would haue had all the rest guelt (had he not beene hindered) to make them the gentler and the milder to them. Hee was not onely too kinde and beneficiall to the common sort, but also to their King, to whom hee oft resorted, and gaue many presents which hee knew to be highly pleasing to him. And whereas this king before dwelt onely in a cottage, or rather a denne or hog-stye, made with a few poles and stickes, and couered with mats after their wyld manner, to ciuilize him, he first, built him a fayre house according to the English fashion, in which hee tooke such ioy, especially in his locke and key, which hee so admired, as locking and vnlocking his doore an hundred times aday, hee thought no deuice in all the world was comparable to it. Thus insinuating himselfe to this King for his religious purposes, he con- ferred after with him oft, and intimated to him matters of our Religion; and thus far the Pagan confessed, moued by naturall Principles, that our God was a good God, and better much then theirs, in that he had with so many good things aboue them endowed vs. Hee told him, if hee would serue our God, hee should bee partaker of all those good things wee had, and of farre greater then sense or reason euer could imagine. Hee wonne vpon him, as hee thought in many things, so as hee gaue him fayre hearing and good answer, and seemed to be much pleased with his discourse and in his company. And both hee and his people for the daily courtesies this good Gentleman did to one or other of them, did professe such outward loue and respect vnto him, as nothing could seeme more: but all was little regarded after by [17] this Viperous brood, as the sequell shewed: for they not only wilfully murdered him, but cruelly and felly, out of deuillish malice, did so many barbarous despights and foule scornes after to his dead corpes, as are vnbefitting to be heard by any ciuill eare. One thing I cannot omit, that when this good Gentleman vpon his fatall hower, was warned by his man (who perceiued some treachery intended to them by these hell- hounds) to looke to himselfe, and withall ranne away for feare of the mischiefe he strongly apprehended, and so saued his owne life; yet his Master, out of the conscience of his owne good meaning, and faire deserts euer towards them, was so void of all suspition, and so full of confidence, that they had sooner killed him, then hee could or would beleeue they meant any ill against him. Thus the sinnes of these wicked Infidels, haue made them vnworthy of enioying him, and the eternall good that he most zealously alwayes intended to them. And thus these miserable wretches, not hee, hath lost by it, who to the comfort of vs all, hath gayned a Crowne of endlesse blisse, and is assuredly become a glorious Martyr, in which thrice-happy and blessed state we leaue him. But these miscreants, who haue thus despised Gods great mercies so freely offered to them, must needs in time therefore be cor- rected by his iustice: So as those who by the way of mercies would not be drawne vnto him, shall some of them at length (no doubt) be brought vnto him by his way of iudgements: to which leauing them, I will knit againe together now the thred of my Discourse, and proceed to tell you, That at the time of this Massacre [18] there were three or foure of our ships in Iames-Riuer, and one in the next Riuer, and daily more to come in, as three did within fourteene dayes after; one of which they endeuored to haue surprised, but in vaine, as had also beene their whole attempt, had any the least fore-knowledge beene in those places where the Massacre was committed: yet were the hearts of the English euer stupid, and auerted from beleeuing any thing that might weaken their hopes of speedy winning the Sauages to Ciuilitie and Religion, by kinde vsage and fayre conuersing amongst them. Hee, and the whole Councell write further, That Almighty God (they doubt not) hath his great worke to doe in this Tragedy, and will thereout draw honor and glory to his great Name; safety, and a more flourishing estate to themselues, and the whole Planta- tion there; and the more speedy conuersion of the Children of those Sauages to himselfe, since hee so miraculously preserued so many of the English (there being, God be praysed, about eleuen parts of twelue still remayning) whose desire to draw those people to Religion by the carelesse neglect of their owne safeties, seemes to haue beene the greatest cause of their own ensuing destruction. Yet it pleased God to vse some of them as instru- ments to saue many of their liues, whose soules they had formerly saued, as at Iames-Citie, and other places, and the Pinnace trading in Pamounkey Riuer, all whose liues were saued by a conuerted Indian, disclosing the plot in the instant (whereof though our sinnes (say they) made vs vnworthy to be instruments of so glorious a conuersion in generall, yet his infinite wisedome can neuerthelesse bring it to passe [19] with some more of them, and with other Prouinces there in his good time, and by such meanes as wee thinke most vnlikely. For euen in the deliuery of vs that now suruiue, no mans particular carefulnesse saued any one person, but the meere goodnesse of himselfe, freely and miraculously preserued whom it pleased him. The Letters of Mr. George Sandis a worthy Gentleman and Treasurer there, likewise haue aduertised (as many others from many particular persons of note and worth) besides the Relations of many returned in the Sea-flower (the ship that brought vs this vnwelcome newes) haue beene heard at large in the publike Courts, that whilst all their affayres were full of successe, and such intercourse of familiaritie, as if the Indians and themselues had beene of one Nation, those treacherous Natiues, after fiue yeares peace, by a generall combination in one day plotted to subuert their whole Colony, and at one instant of time, though our seuerall Plan- tations were an hundred and forty miles vp one Riuer on both sides. But before I goe any further, for the better vnderstanding of all things, you shall know that these wyld naked Natiues liue not in great numbers together, but dispersed, and in small companies; and where most together, not aboue two hundred, and that very rare, in other places fifty or forty, or thereabouts, and many miles distant from one another, in such places among the Woods where they either found, or might easiliest make some cleared plots of ground, which they imploy wholly in setting of Corne, whereby to sustaine their liues. These small and scattered Companies (as [20] I haue said) had warning giuen from one another in all their habita- tions to meete at the day and houre appointed for our destruction, at all our seuerall Townes and places seated vpon the Riuer; some were directed to goe to one place, some to another, all to be done at the same day and time, which they did accordingly: some entring their Houses vnder colour of trucking, and so taking aduantage, others drawing our men abroad vpon faire pretences, and the rest suddenly falling vpon those that were at their labours. They certifie further, that besides Master George Thorpe, before mentioned, Master Iohn Berkeley, Captaine Nathanael Powel, and his wife, (daughter of Master William Tracy, and great with childe) and Captaine Maycock, all Gentlemen of birth, vertue, and industry, and of the Councell there, suffered vnder this their cruelty and treason. That the slaughter had beene vniuersall, if God had not put it into the heart of an Indian belonging to one Perry, to disclose it, who liuing in the house of one Pace, was vrged by another Indian his Brother (who came the night before and lay with him) to kill Pace, (so commanded by their King as he declared) as hee would kill Perry: telling further that by such an houre in the morning a number would come from diuers places to finish the Execution, who failed not at the time: Perries Indian rose out of his bed and reueales it to Pace, that vsed him as a Sonne: And thus the rest of the Colony that had warning giuen them, by this meanes was saued. Such was (God bee thanked for it) the good fruit of an Infidell conuerted to Christianity; for though three hundred and more of ours [21] died by many of these Pagan Infidels, yet thousands of ours were saued by the means of one of them alone which was made a Christian; Blessed be God for euer, whose mercy endureth for euer; Blessed bee God whose mercy is aboue his iustice, and farre aboue all his workes: who wrought this deliuerance whereby their soules escaped euen as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowler. Pace vpon this discouery, securing his house, before day rowed ouer the Riuer to Iames-City (in that place neere three miles in bredth) and gaue notice thereof to the Gouernor, by which meanes they were preuented there, and at such other Plantations as was possible for a timely intelligence to be giuen; for where they saw vs standing vpon our Guard, at the sight of a Peece they all ranne away. In other places that could haue no notice, some Peeces with munition (the vse whereof they know not) were there carried away, and some few Cattell also were destroyed by them. And as Fame diuulgeth (not without probable grounds) their King hath since caused the most part of the Gunpowder by him surprized, to bee sowne, to draw therefrom the like increase, as of his Maize or Corne, in Haruest next. And that it is since discouered, that the last Summer Opachankano practised with a King of the Eastern shore (no well-willer of his) to furnish him with store of poison (naturally growing in his country) for our destruc- tion, which he absolutely refused, though he sent him great store of Beades, and other presents to winne him thereunto: which he, with fiue or sixe of his great men, offered to be ready to iustifie against him. That the true cause [22] of this surprize was most by the instigation of the Deuill, (enemy to their saluation) and the dayly feare that possest them, that in time we by our growing continually vpon them, would dispossesse them of this Country, as they had beene formerly of the West Indies by the Spaniard; produced this bloody act. That neuer griefe and shame possessed any people more then themselues, to be thus butchered by so naked and cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presentment of a staffe in manner of a Peece, nor an vncharged Peece in the hands of a woman, from which they flye as so many Hares; much faster then from their tormenting Deuill, whom they worship for feare, though they acknowledge they loue him not. Thus haue you seene the particulars of this massacre, out of Letters from thence written, wherein treachery and cruelty haue done their worst to vs, or rather to themselues; for whose vnderstanding is so shallow, as not to perceiue that this must needs bee for the good of the Plantation after, and the losse of this blood to make the body more healthfull, as by these reasons may be manifest. First, Because betraying of innocency neuer rests vnpunished: And there- fore Agesilaus, when his enemies (vpon whose oath of being faithfull hee rested) had deceiued him, he sent them thankes, for that by their periury, they had made God his friend, and their enemy. Secondly, Because our hands which before were tied with gentlenesse and faire vsage, are now set at liberty by the treacherous violence of the Sausages, [23] not vntying the Knot, but cutting it: So that we, who hitherto haue had possession of no more ground then their waste, and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their owne contentment, gained; may now by right of Warre, and law of Nations, inuade the Country, and destroy them who sought to destroy vs: whereby wee shall enioy their cultiuated places, turning the laborious Mattocke into the victorious Sword (wherein there is more both ease, benefit, and glory) and possessing the fruits of others labours. Now their cleared grounds in all their villages (which are situate in the fruitfullest places of the land) shall be inhabited by vs, whereas heretofore the grubbing of woods was the greatest labour. Thirdly, Because those commodities which the Indians enioyed as much or rather more than we, shall now also be entirely possessed by vs. The Deere and other beasts will be in safety, and infinitly increase, which heretofore not onely in the generall huntings of the King (whereat foure or fiue hundred Deere were vsually slaine) but by each particular Indian were destroied at all times of the yeare, without any difference of Male, Damme, or Young. The like may be said of our owne Swine and Goats, whereof they haue vsed to kill eight in tenne more than the English haue done. There will be also a great increase of wild Turkies, and other waighty Fowle, for the Indians neuer put difference of destroying the Hen, but kill them whether in season or not, whether in breeding time, or sitting on their egges, or hauing new hatched, it is all one to them: whereby, as also by the orderly vsing of their fishing Weares, no knowne Country in [24] the world will so plentifully abound in victuall. Fourthly, Because the way of conquering them is much more easie then of ciuilizing them by faire meanes, for they are a rude, barbarous, and naked people, scattered in small companies, which are helps to Victorie, but hinderances to Ciuilitie: Besides that, a conquest may be of many, and at once; but ciuility is in particular, and slow, the effect of long time, and great industry. Moreouer, victorie of them may bee gained many waies; by force, by surprize, by famine in burning their Corne, by destroy- ing and burning their Boats, Canoes, and Houses, by breaking their fishing Weares, by assailing them in their huntings, whereby they get the greatest part of their sustenance in Winter, by pursuing and chasing them with our horses, and blood-Hounds to draw after them, and Mastiues to teare them, which take this naked, tanned, deformed Sauages, for no other then wild beasts, and are so fierce and fell vpon them, that they feare them worse then their old Deuill which they worship, supposing them to be a new and worse kinde of Deuils then their owne. By these and sundry other wayes, as by driuing them (when they flye) vpon their enemies, who are round about them, and by animating and abetting their enemies against them, may their ruine or subiection be soone effected. So the Spaniard made great vse for his owne turne of the quarrels and enmities that were amongst the Indians, as throughly vnderstanding and following that Maxime of the Politician, Diude &amp; impera, Make diuisions and take Kingdomes: For thus he got two of the greatest Kingdomes of the West Indies, Peru and [25] Mexico, by the Princes diuisions, and the peo- ples differences. After the death of Guainacapa king of Peru, his sonnes Attabalippa and Gascar falling to war about the kingdom, &amp; each of th? striuing to make the Spaniard to his friend, Francis Pizzarro managing those their diuisions onely to his owne ends, easily stripped them both of that rich Kingdome, and became Master of Peru. And so likwise Ferdi- nando Cortez vanquished King Motezuma, and gained the Kingdome of Mexico from him, by the aid and furtherance of the neighboring people of the Prouince of Tascala, being deadly enemies to the Mexicans; for which seruice they of Tascala are freed by the Spaniards from all Tributes to this time. In VIRGINIA the many diuers Princes and people there are at this day opposite in infinite factions one vnto another, and many of them beare a mortall hatred to these our barbarous Sauages, that haue beene likely as false and perfidious heretofore to them, as vnto vs of late. So as the quarrels, and the causes of them, and the different humours of these people being well vnderstood, it will be an easie matter to ouerthrow those that now are, or may bee our enemies hereafter, by ayding and setting on their enemies against them. And by these factions and differ- ences of petty Princes, the Romans tooke their greatest aduantage to ouercome this Iland of Great Britayne, of which Tacitus sayes, Ita dum singuli pugnant vniuersi vincuntur. And Iustin hath the like saying of the cause of vanquishing the Grecian Cities. Fiftly, Because the Indians, who before were vsed as friends, may now most iustly be compelled to seruitude and drudgery, and supply the roome of men [26] that labour, whereby euen the meanest of the Plantation may imploy themselues more entirely in their Arts and Occupations, which are more generous, whilest Sauages performe their inferiour workes of digging in mynes, and the like, of whom also some may be sent for the seruice of the Sommer Ilands. Sixtly, This will for euer hereafter make vs more cautelous and circum- spect, as neuer to bee deceiued more by any other treacheries, but will serue for a great instruction to all posteritie there, to teach them that Trust is the mother of Deceipt, and to learne them that of the Italian, Chi non fida, non s'ingamuu, Hee that trusts not is not deceiued: and make them know that kindnesses are misspent vpon rude natures, so long as they continue rude; as also, that Sauages and Pagans are aboue all other for matter of Iustice euer to be suspected. Thus vpon this Anvile shall wee now beate out to our selues an armour of proofe, which shall for euer after defend vs from barbarous Incursions, and from greater dangers that otherwise might happen. And so we may truly say according to the French Prouerb, Aquelq3 chose malheur est bon, Ill lucke is good for something. Lastly, We haue this benefit more to our comfort, because all good men doe now take much more care of vs then before, since the fault is on their sides, not on ours, who haue vsed so fayre a cariage, euen to our owne destruction. Especially his Maiesties most gratious, tender and paternall care is manifest herein, who by his Royall bounty and goodnesse, hath continued his many fauors vnto vs, with a new, large, &amp; Princely supply of Munition and Armes, out of his Maiesties [27] owne store in the Tower, being gratiously bestowed for the safety and aduancement of the Planta- tion. As also his Royall fauor is amply extended in a large supply of men and other necessaries throughout the whole Kingdome, which are very shortly to bee sent to VIRGINIA. Neyther must wee omit the Honourable City of London, who to shew their zeale at this time (as they haue alwayes done vpon all Honourable occasions to their endlesse praise) are now setting forth one hundred persons, at their owne charges, for the aduancement of the Plantations. In the furtherance of which action, as the whole graue Senate of Aldermen haue shewed much piety and wisedome, so in particular, the Right Honourable Sir Edward Barkham Knight, the now Lord Mayor, hath demonstrated a most worthy mind. Besides many worthy Persons of birth and quality, and diuers others at their owne costs are now preparing for VIRGINIA. Neyther is any man to be deiected because of some such disasters as these that may seeme to thwart the businesse. What growing State was there euer in the world which had not the like? Rome grew by opposition, and rose vpon the backe of her enemies. Marke but the Spaniard who is in the same Continent with VIRGINIA, and hath now perfected his worke; Marke and tell mee, if hee hath not had more counterbuffes farre then wee, as out of their owne histories at large may be proued. Columbus vpon his returne from the West Indies into Spaine, hauing left his people with the Indian in peace, and promise of fayre vsage towards them, yet [28] at his comming backe againe, hee found no one man aliue of them, but all by the Natiues treacherously slaine. After this againe, when the Spanish Colony was increased in great numbers, the Indians (from whom the Spaniards for trucking stuffe vsed to haue all their corn) generally conspired together to plant no corne at all, intending therby to famish them, themselues liuing in the meane time vpon Cassaui (a root to make bread) onely then knowne to themselues: This plot of theirs by the Spaniards ouer-sight (that foolishly depended vpon Strangers for their bread) tooke such effect, and brought them to such misery by the rage of famine, that they spared no vncleane, no loathsome beast, no not the poysonous and hideous Serpents, but eate them vp also, deuouring one death to saue them from another: And by this meanes the whole Colony well-neare surfetted, sickned, and dyed miserably. After againe, vpon fresh and great supplyes new made, an infinite company of them by their incontinency dyed of the Indian disease, that hath now got a French name, which at first (as being a strange and vnknowne malady) was deadly vpon whomsoeuer it lighted. Besides (before they knew the cause and remedy) very many lost diuers parts of their body, feet and hands principally, by a little vermine lesse then a Flea, and skipping like it, called Nigua, which got between the skinne and the flesh before they were aware, and there bred and multiplyed, making swellings and putrefactions, to the decay and losse of their bodily members. What should I tell you that the Plantations diuers times were neare vndone, by the ambition, factions, and malice of the Commanders one vnto another. Columbus, to whom they were beholding for all, with his brothers, were sent home from the West Indies into Spaine bound with chaines: and some other great Commanders killed and murthered one another. Pizzarro was killed by Almagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded, which Vasco was taken by Blasco, and this Blasco was likewise taken by Pizzarroes brother. Thus by their owne spightfull and auaritious quarrels did they well-neare shake the mayne pillars of that Plantation. These and many other calamities and mischiefes, too long to relate now, hapned vnto them more then euer did to vs. And at one time their planta- tion was euen at the last gaspe, all their Colony being resolued desperately to leaue it, had not two ships vnexpected come in with new supplyes: yet wee see for all these miseries, that they haue attained to their ends at last, Honor, power, and wealth; In so much as that Countrey, which (when they were dishartned with disasters) they beganne to be so weary of, that they were about to forsake it all, in short time after (seeing all stormes blowne ouer, and fayre weather shining vpon them) they were so in loue with their great fortunes, that they grew so iealous of them, as made them shut them vp from the sight of any but themselues. And then they peti- tioned their King, by an inuiolable Decree to annexe and vnite the West Indies inseparably for euer to the Crowne of Spaine; which (for their better securitie and satisfaction) was accordingly performed and ratified, as it is to be seene in Hereras His[30]tory of the West Indies. And whereas before, few could be hired to go to inhabite there, now with great suite they must obtaine it. Thus haue they in time by industry, patience, and constancy effected this great worke of theirs, notwithstanding to encrease their difficulties also, they were to deale with a most populous &amp; numerous nation, which they ouercame at last: So as Ouiedo in his third Booke of the first Part of his West Indie History saith, that of a million of Indians at least, that were in Hispaniola, there were not (in little more than forty yeares space after the first beginning of the Plantation) fiue hundred of th? &amp; all their children liuing: for the Indians that liued there, after were brought out of the Continent into that Iland, or out of one Iland to be planted in another. On the other side, the Natiues in VIRGINIA are nothing populous, but thin and scattered Nations, as is knowne to all. Here by the way to make a little Digression, since I haue mentioned Ouiedo who liued aboue twenty two yeares in the West Indies, I will acquaint you with his obseruation and iudgement of the nature and disposition of the Indians there, that you may compare and see in what, and how farre, it agrees with that of the Natiues of VIRGINIA. They are (saith hee) by nature sloathfull and idle, vitious, melancholy, slouenly, of bad conditions, lyers, of small memory, of no constancy or trust. In another place he saith, The Indian is by nature of all people the most lying and most inconstant in the world, sottish and sodaine: neuer looking what dangers may happen afterwards, lesse capable then children of sixe [31] or seauen yeares old, and lesse apt and ingenious. This is the generall disposition of most of them, though there be some (sayes he) that be wise and subtill. And indeede it should seeme so, when they could ouerreach and goe beyond the Spaniard so much, to put that tricke of staruing them (as aforesaid) vpon them, to their so great and almost totall destruction. But to come againe to that which I first intended: Since the Spaniard (as we see) in his Plantations hath gone thorow farre more hazards, and greater difficulties then euer wee haue had, we therefore in looking to what is past, vpon great reason ought likewise not to be deterred, but so much the rather inuited to proceede with constancy and courage. And if besides wee looke (as most men doe) after the riches of a Countrey to inuite vs on, aske those that haue beene there, and haue trauelled farre and neare, and they will tell you, that no Countrey in the world doth naturally abound with more Commodities then VIRGINIA doth. The Clymate is knowne to be more temperate, and the soyle more rich then that of the West Indies is: neyther doth it want mynes of all sorts, no not of the richest, as is knowne to some now liuing, and shall be manifested when fit time shall serue. And yet to thinke that Gold and Siluer mynes are in a Countrey (otherwise most rich and fruitfull) the greatest wealth of a Plantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, That the Gold and Siluer is the greatest wealth of the West Indies now at this present time. True it is indeed, that in the first Conquest the Spaniards got great and mighty treasure from the Indians, which they in long space had heaped vp together, [32] and in those times the Indians shewed them entyre and plentifull rich mynes, which by length of time (as is well known and published to the world by those that haue beene there) are wasted and exhausted since, so as now the charge of getting those mettals is growne most excessiue, besides the consuming and spoyling many men of their liues, which are depriued of them by the vapors that come out of the Gold and Siluer mynes, which are most pestilent and deadly, as diuers authors auerre. Amongst others, a late Geographer speaking of the West Indies, and of those mynes there, saith, Odor ex auri &amp; argenti fodinis noxius admodum; neq3 tamen prohibuit aëris corruptissimi violentia Hispanos, ne in a?io orbe nouum moriendi locum quaeerent. So as all things considered by these mynes, what by the liues of many men lost in them, and what with the great charge otherwise in getting them, the cleare gaine to the Aduenturers from these mettals (the Kings part defrayed) is but small to them, nothing neere so much I am sure, as is imagined. And were it not for other rich Commodities there that enable and enrich the Aduenturers, those of the Contractation house were neuer able to subsist by this. For the greatest part of their gaine and profit I say consists not in these mynes, but in their other Commodities, partly natiue, and partly translated from other parts of the world, and planted in the West Indies: As in their mighty wealth of Sugars (the Sugar-Canes being transported first from the Ca- naries,) and in Ginger, and some other commodities deriued from the East Indies thither: in their Cochanile, their Indico, their Cotton, their infinite store of Hydes and Skins, [33] their Quick-siluer, and Allom, Woad, and Brasillwood, &amp;c. And their many other Dyes, Paints, Petacaraua, Tobacco, Gummes, Balmes, Oyles medecinall, and Perfumes, their Sar- saparillia, and many other physicall drugs, (for which, learned Physitians and skilfull Simplers were sent to take a suruey, and make an exquisite draught of all the Plants in colours.) These I say and other the like com- modities are the West Indies indeed vnto the Aduenturers, by which they are inabled to inrich themselues, and to sustaine the mighty charge of drawing out the Gold and Siluer, to the great and cleare reuenew of their King. I had many things of importance to say more, but I will detain the Reader no longer now. To conclude then, seeing that Virginia is most abundantly fruitfull, and that this Massacre must rather be beneficiall to the Planta- tion then impaire it, let all men take courage, and put to their helping hands, since now the time is most seasonable and aduantagious for the reaping of those benefits which the Plantation hath long promised: and for their owne good let them doe it speedily, that so by taking the prioritie of time, they may haue also the prioritie of place, in choosing the best Seats of the Country, which now by vanquishing of the Indians, is like to offer a more ample and faire choice of fruitfull habitations, then hitherto our gentlenesse and faire comportment to the Sauages could attaine vnto. Wherein no doubt but all the fauour that may be, shall be shewed to Aduenturers and Planters. And for old Aduenturers, there is due vnto them and their heyres (according to the Orders of the Company) for each twelue pounds ten shillings formerly paid [34] into the treasury, one hundred Acres of Land, vpon a first diuision, and as much vpon a second, the first being planted. And whosoeuer transports himselfe or any other, at his charge into VIRGINIA, shall for himselfe and each person so transported, before Midsummer, 1625. haue to him and his heyres foreuer, fifty Acres of land vpon a first Diuision, and as much more vpon a second: the first fifty being cultiuated or manured, if such person continue there three yeares, eyther at once or seuerall times, or dye after hee bee shipped for that Voyage. Lastly, it is to be wished, that euery good Patriot will take these things seriously into his thoughts, and consider how deeply the prosecution of this noble Enterprise concerneth the honor of his Maiestie and the whole Nation, the propagation of Christian Religion, the enlargement, strength, and safety of his Maiesties Dominions, the rich augmenting of his Reuen- nues, the imploiment of his Subiects idle at home, the increase of men, Mariners and shipping, and the raising of such necessary commoditie, for the importation of which from forren Countries so great and incredible summes are continually issued and expended. Some may helpe with their purses, some with their persons, some with their fauour, some with their counsell: especially amongst others, let Ministers in their publike and priuate prayers commend these Plantations to the blessing of Almighty God: To whom be all honor and glory, for euer and euer, A men. [35] Here following is set downe a true list of the names of all those that were massacred by the treachery of the Sauages in VIRGINIA, the 22 March last, To the end that their lawfull heyres may take speedy order for the inheriting of their lands and estates there: For which the Honourable Company of Virginia are ready to doe them all right and fauour.

A Treatise of the Northwest Passage to the South Sea, through the Continent of VIRGINIA AND BY Fretum Hudson The noble Plantation of VIRGINIA hath some very excellent Prerogatiues aboue many other famous Kingdomes, namely, the temperature of the ayre, the fruitfulnesse of the soile, and the commodiousnesse of situation. The ayre is healthfull and free both from immoderate heate, and from extreame cold; so that both the inhabitants and their cattell doe prosper exceedingly in stature and strength, and all Plants brought from any other remote climate, doe there grow and fructifie in as good or better manner, then in the soyle from whence they came. Which though it doe manifestly proue the fruitfulnesse of the soile, yeelding all kinds of graine or plants committed vnto it, with a rich and plentifull encrease, yet cannot the fatnesse of the earth alone produce such excellent effects, vnlesse the tem- perature of the Ayre bee likewise so fauourable, that [46] those tender sprouts which the earth doth abundantly bring forth, may bee cherished with moderate heate and seasonable moisture, and freed both from scorching drought, and nipping frost. These blessings are so much the more to bee esteemed, because they are bestowed vpon a place situated so conueniently, and at so good a distance both from Europe, and the West Indies, that for the mutuall commerce betwixt these great and most rich parts of the habitable world, there cannot bee deuised any place more conuenient for the succour and refresh- ing of those that trade from hence thither: whether they be of our owne nation, or of our neighbours and friends; the multitude of great and naui- gable Riuvers, and of safe and spacious harbours, as it were inuiting all Nations to entertaine mutuall friendship, and to participate of those bless- ings which God out of the abundance of his rich Treasures, hath so gratiously bestowed some vpon these parts of Europe, and others no lesse desired vpon those poore people: which might still haue remained in their old barbarous ignorance, without knowledge of their owne misery, or of Gods infinite goodnesse and mercy; if it had not pleased God thus gratiously both to draw vs thither with desire of such wealth as those fruitfull Coun- tries afford, and also to grant vs so easie, certaine, and safe a meanes to goe vnto them: which passage is in mine opinion made much more secure and easie by the commodious harbours and refreshing which VIRGINIA doth reach out vnto vs. The coasts of Florida to the West, being not so har- borous; and of New England to the East, somewhat more out of the way, amongst so many [47] Flats and small Ilands not so safe. Neither is the com- modiousnesse of VIRGINIAS situation onely in respect of this west Atlan- ticke Ocean, but also in respect of the Indian Ocean, which wee commonly call the South Sea, which lyeth on the West and North west side of VIRGINIA, on the other side of the Mountains beyond our Fals, and openeth a free and faire passage, not onely to China, Iapan, and the Moluccaes; but also to New Spaine, Peru, Chila, and those rich Countries of Terra Australis, not as yet fully discouered. For the Sea wherein Master Hudson did winter, which was first discouered by him, and is therefore now called Fretum Hudson, doth stretch so farre towards the west, that it lieth as farre westward as the Cape of Florida: So that from the Fals aboue Henrico City, if we shape our iourney towards the Northwest following the Riuers towards the head, we shall vndoubtedly come to the Mountaines, which as they send diuers great Riuers Southward into our Bay of Chesepiock, so likewise doe they send others from their further side Northwestward into that Bay where Hudson did winter. For so wee see in our owne Country, from the ridge of Mountaines continued from Derbishire into Scotland, doe issue many great Riuers on both sides into the East Germane Ocean, and into the Westerne Irish Seas: in like sort from the Alpes of Switzerland and the Grizons, do runne the Danubie Eastward into Pontus Euxinus, the Rhene into the North Germane Ocean, the Rhosne west into the Mediterrane Sea, and the Po South into the Adriatike Sea. This Bay where Hudson did winter, strecheth it selfe Southward into 49. degrees, and cannot be in probability so farre dis[48]tant from the Fals as 200. Leagues; part of the way lying by the Riuers side towards the mountaines from whence it springeth: and the other part on the other side cannot want Riuers likewise, which will conduct vs all the way, and I hope carry vs and our prouisions a good part of it. Besides that Bay, it is not vnlikely that the Westerne Sea in some other Creeke or Riuer commeth much neerer then that place: For the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter, lying more Westerly then Master Hudsons Bay by 190. Leagues in the same Sea, doth extend it selfe very neere as farre towards the west as the Cape of California, which is now found to be an Iland stretching it selfe from 22. degrees to 42. and lying almost directly North &amp; South; as may appeare in a Map of that Iland which I haue seene here in London, brought out of Holland; where the Sea vpon the Northwest part may very probably come much nearer then some do imagine: who giuing too much credit to our vsuall Globes and Maps, doe dreame of a large Continent extending it selfe farre Westward to the imagined Straight of Anian, where are seated (as they fable) the large Kingdomes of Cebola and Quiuira, hauing great and populous Cities of ciuill people; whose houses are said to bee fiue stories high, and to haue some pillars of Turguesses. Which relations are cunningly set downe by some vpon set purpose to put vs out of the right way, and to discourage such as otherwise might bee desirous to search a passage by the way afore- said into those Seas. Gerardus Mercator, a very industrious and excellent Geographer, was abused by a Map sent vnto him, of foure Euripi meeting about the North Pole; which [49] now are found to be all turned into a maine icie Sea. One demonstration of the crafty falshood of these vsuall Maps is this, that Cape Mendocino is set in them West Northwest, distant from the South Cape of California, about seuenteene hundred Leagues, whereas Francis Gaule that was imployed in those discoueries by the Viseroy of New Spaine; doth in Hugo Linscotten his booke set downe their distance to bee onely fiue hundred Leagues. Besides this, in the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter in 57. de- grees of latitude, the constant great tides euery twelue houres, and the in- crease of those tides whensoeuer any strong westerne wind did blow, doe strongly perswade vs that the maine Westerne Ocean is not farre from thence; which was much confirmed vnto them the Summer following; when sayling directly North from that place where they wintered, about the Latitude of 60. degrees, they were crossed by a strong Currant running sometimes Eastward, sometimes Westward: So that if wee finde either Hudsons Bay, or any Sea more neere vnto the West, wee may assure our selues that from thence wee may with great ease passe to any part of the East Indies: And that as the world is very much beholding to that famous Columbus for that hee first discouered vnto vs the West Indies; and to the Portingall for the finding out the ordinary and as yet the best way that is knowne to the East Indies, by Cape Bona-Speranza. So may they and all the world be in this beholding to vs in opening a new and large passage, both much nearer, safer, and farre more wholesome and temperate through the Continent of VIRGINIA, and by [50] Fretum Hudson, to all those rich Countries bordering vpon the South Sea, in the East and West Indies. And this hope that the South Sea may easily from VIRGINIA be discouered ouer Land, is much confirmed by the constant report of the Sauages, not onely of VIRGINIA, but also of Florida and Canada; which dwelling so remote one from another, and all agreeing in the report of a large Sea to the West- wards, where they describe great Ships not vnlike to ours, with other cir- cumstances, doe giue vs very great probability (if not full assurance) that our endeuours this way shall by Gods blessing haue a prosperous and happy successe, to the encrease of his Kingdome and glory amongst these poore ignorant Heathen people, the publique good of all the Christian world, the neuer-dying honour of our most gracious Soueraigne, the inestimable benefit of our Nation, and the admirable and speedy increase and aduance- ment of that most noble and hopefull Plantation of VIRGINIA; for the good successe whereof all good men with me, I doubt not, will poure out their prayers to Almighty God.

      <field name="fulltext">TO THE HONRABLE COMPANIE OF VIRGINIA. Right Honorable and Worthy: The fame of our late vnhappy accident in Virginia, hath spread it selfe, I doubt not, into all parts abroad, and as it is talked of of all men, so no question of many, and of most, it cannot but be misreported, some carryed away with ouer-weak lightnesse to beleeue all they heare, how vntrue soeuer; others out of their disaffection possibly to the Plantation, are desirous to make that, which is ill, worse; and so the truth of the Action, which is only one, is varied and misreported. I haue thought it therefore a part of some acceptable seruice in me towards you, whose fauors haue preferred me to be a member of your Company, to present you with these my poore labours, the Collection of the truth hereof, drawne from the relation of some of those that were beholders of that Tragedie, and who hardly escaped from tasting of the same cup, as also from the Letters sent you by the Gouernour and other Gentlemen of quality, and of the Councell in that Colonie, read openly here in your Courts: That so the world may see that it was not the strength of a professed enemy that brought this slaughter on them, but contriued by the perfidious treachery of a false- hearted people, that know not God nor faith. No generous Spirit will forbeare to goe on for this accident that hath hapned to the Plantation, but proceed rather chearfully in this honorable Enterprize, since the discouery of their bruitish falshood will proue (as shall appeare by this Treatise following) many waies aduantageable to vs, and make this forewarning a forearming for euer to preuent a greater mischiefe. Accept it from me, I most humbly beseech you, as the first fruits of my poore seruice. Time may happily make me able to yeeld you some other worke whose subiect may bee Ioy, as this is a Theame of Sadnesse: Meane- time, I commit You and the Noble Colony to Gods good blessing, as he that shall alwaies be A true Votarie for your happinesse, and seruant to your commands, Edward Waterhovse.</field>

And they conceaue that yor Mat? humble Subiect? all the Planters &amp; adventurers of that Colony both here and there will most readily conforme themselues to such conditions and orders as may be for yor Mat? proffitt &amp; the estab- lishment of that Plantation: And they shall ever as most bounden pray for yor Mat? long life and happy raigne over vs. Fran: West W: Claybourne John Brewer Robert Sweet Williã Cap?</field>

Reg?, The said Pynnace as is affirmed, was by ye then Gouernor of Virginia denyed, debarred, and hindered of the ffree Trade neither was shee suffered to trade in anie thinge but by the allowance and warrant of the said gouernor vpon paine of death, by means of a booke of lawes imprinted and there remayneinge, and of private ?eres wrytt by tenne of the Megazine Com- panie vnto the said gouernor, which Megazine Companie was then newlie erected by the Virginia Companie and whereof the said Sr Tho: Smith, Sr John Wolstenholme and Alderman Johnson are the principall in aduen- turing in the said Megazine or ioynt stock, wch ?eres were to this effect, that the go?nor should not suffer the Tobacco and Sassafrasse to come over in private hand? but by the Megazine for the good of the Companie; By meanes whereof the said p?. as hee affirmeth, not onely lost the benefitt of his free trade, but alsoe his said shipp was inforced to staye there about 13teene monethes to his extraordinarie greate Chardge and damadge; and in thend because the Megazine came not ouer as was expected, the p? had leaue to retorne his said shipp to carrie newse to the Companie of the estate of the Collonie and was suffered to haue some trade. In wch said Pynnace the p?. brought over a matter of 3100li waight of Tobacco for himselfe and about 5000li waight belonging to the said Companie and the passengers; And ye said Pynnace rydeing in the Riuer here, yt appear- eth that there was offered 8s the pound for the Tobaccoes therein, and soone after the said p?t? Tobacco seized in the Custome house for Custome as the p? affirmeth where non [none] was due, hee being one of the Companie; But the de?tes affirme that it was seized by the ffarmors wthout theire privytie onely to take notice of the Certaine quantytie, To thend they might haue a defaulca?on in theire ffarme from the King?

Could not haue his Tobacco againe vntill hee brought a Certifycate from the said Sr Tho: Smithe wch hee Could not ?cure vntill hee vnderwrytt to giue 100li to the vse of the said Companie, By meanes whereof the p?s said Tobacco was detained in the Custom House aboute three weekes, dureinge wch time the p? feareing that the price of Tobacco might fall, and Con- ceaueing that the best Course for the houlding vpp of the said price was to buy the said Companie and passengers Tobacco; Hee the said p?. bought 1700li waight of the said Companies Tobacco at the rate of 8s the pound, and paid about 100li in hand and vnderwrytt for the rest, and alsoe bought about 4000li waight of the said passengers, and there being alsoe then shortlie after a Megazine shipp come ouer wth 20000li waight of Tobacco or thereabout?, the said p? likewise bought a 1100li1 1 Blank space. waight thereof of the Companie at the rate of 5s 3d the pound and had 14teene daies giuen him to put in securitye for the same, wherevpon 4300li waight of Tobacco of the p?. was deposyted as securitie for the same, and some of the Companie were appointed to sell the said 1100li1 waight for the p?. But the p?. not being able to gett sale of his said Tobaccoes, and haueing then two shipps rideing in the Riuer, readie to goe over againe, and lying heare at his greate Chardge for want of monies to furnishe the same, hee the said p? wth the Consent of the said defts and some others of the Com- panie prsent retorned the said 11000li1 waight vnto ye said Company, wth this speciall agreemt that the said p?. shoulde giue 150li vnto the said Companie in Considera?on thereof, And if the said Tobacco should bee sould for more then 5s the pounde, then the said p?. was to haue the increase of benifitt, but if vnder 5s the pound, then hee the said p? was to loose his said 150li and reste satisfied; ffor wch purpose the same was to bee sould, and a noate was made and subscrybed vnder the p?. hand, and the said p?. about ye same time entered into the said bond of 800li vnto the said deft?

Smithe practizeing wth 3. 4. or 5 wch he termeth the Comp: by secrett instruc?ons giuen to ye gou9nor in Virginia to barre ye petrs trade, by the Tirranous laws there wch made it death to trade, by detaineing of ye petrs good?, by fraudilent sale of them, and by makeing stay of his shipps, haue ?iudiced the petr and his ?tner to ye valew of 6600?i That whereas ye petr hath made ?ffe of all theis abuses in ye Chancery vpon a full hereing there before ye right ho? ye Lord Keeper, whoe findeing it to bee matter of state referred the petr to this ho? board. That this fac?ous and populer gou9nmt heare by voices founded on a ioynt stock will (if it bee not ?uented) lay ye founda?on of ye planta?on in such fac?ous and disordered matter that will make it uncapeable of yt forme wch must hould it to England; This ioynct stocke therefore being all spent and Ceased, the Cause of yr gou9nmt by voices (being taken away) this ill effect in the gen9all gou9nmt should likewise Cease to be restrained, but this must be tenderly handled tell the forme of gou9nmt in Virginia bee setled. That ye planta?on now subsistinge onely of ye publique servant? planted by the lottaries and diu9s priuate Collonies some whereof are planted by manie aduenturors others by one or a feiwe, The greater Colony will by their manie voices carry ye gou9nmt from ye lesser And London together wth ye Exchange, wth theire Vicitnity of place steared by ye gou9nor to worke his owne end? out of them all, by makeing ye gou9nor in Virginia his Creature he maie dispose of ye whole planta?on or of anye private mans estate as he list; This by experience I haue found true, and although there hath beene of late good laws made to ?uent it and yt the gou9mnt bee now in good hand?, yet nothinge but ye altering of the forme Can doe it, wch alteration to bee made according to ye increase of ye planta?on, is ?mised by his Mat? instruc?ons dated 22° Nouen?r: 4° Ja? That ye body politick of ye Comp: being to Consist as aforesaid of a sett nomber of wch ye Thr?r or his deputy is to be of ye Corum, they being to make theire laws according to ye laws of England, yf ye Tr?r or his deputy shall doe any vnlawfull act or anye acte contrary to ye form9 orders made in Corte, not haueing ye full nomber, and yt any private aduenturor shall receaue priudice thereby, they stand lyable First of Censure by ye state for breach of theire Comission, secondly to ye Company, there being now a law made in print against such act? that punisheth them with dis- franchisement. Thirdly they thate are wronged are to recouer damages by law or equitie. That yor petr growneing vnder ye burthen of theis opprssions, hath since his first entering into ye planta?on endeavoured a meanes of redresse aswell for ye publique as for himselfe, and in thend draweinge it to a meathod and forme hee tendered it to Sr Tho: Smith some 4 yeres since together wth a meanes to gaine a growing and increaseing stock, by erecting a Megazin for the publique and makeing it ye Farmer to ye kinge of ye sole importa?on of Tobacco, but hee notwthstanding his Matie then offered ye sole importa?on for 5000?i ? ann?, and yt there was then to bee re- ceaued aboue 20 or 30000?i of ye publique lottarie moneys, 5000?i whereof would then haue made this stocke, hee then refuzed it, his deputy and himselfe and some others ioyneing wth him dreameing to take it them- selues, as it afterward appeared when they offered 8 or 10000?i for it. That there being now no waie left to make this publique stock but by searching into ye old debt?, and Sr Tho: Smithes grosse and vnex?inable accompt?, and the abuses of the gou9nmt I humblie intreate yor Lops ayde in ye obtaineing of a Comission from his Matie for the ex?ininge, rectifyinge and orderinge of the said gou9nmt; That thereby yor petr maie bee releeued, the publique wrongs redressed and such a forme settled, that doeinge right to all ?ties interessed in the planta?on, it may fixe the gou9nment of Virginia in a dependensey on the Crowne of England. That there is a learned treatice written by a Gen? that calls himselfe Ignotus Concerning the gou9nmt of Virginia; To which treatice the Courte hath giuen good allowance; This the petr intreatethe maie likewise bee brought in that there maie bee no helpe wanting that will giue furtherance to this noble busines or Conduce to the attaineinge of this last end of houlding the planta?on to England.

The other matter from the Spaniard? is more wicked: conteining in it matter untrue calumnious, &amp; uniust. ffor it cannot be true, that they were restrained from going immediately into Spanish §Dominions§, there beeing no other Ships there then such as were for England. Then it is palpably calumnious, that concerning their gold: wch was not aleged to the ends so ridiculous by them set downe: but only to disproove their former allegation that they were robbed &amp; stripped of all their gold. Lastly to demand anie composition of the Companie §here§ is most uniust; whom they cannot so much as charge to have anie way wronged them. There is nothing therein reasonable, but their demand of leve to be gone: wch was also needles, there beeing no hinderance given them. Yu shall doo well in my opinion to make a short answer in writing to their petition: declaring what pains yu have taken to fynd out the trueth by examinatiõ, whereby it hath appeared, that their informations were not true in manie particulars. Howbeit if it please the LL. that the matter be farther examined in the place where it was doon, &amp; whether yu are very shortly sending a nue Governor wth other Officers; yu shalbe very readie to perform their LLps Directions, &amp; to §do§ all things wch may give the Complainants iust satisfaction from the Delinquents, if anie such be found, But as for the Companie here, they have no cause to be aggreeved wth them, having no ways offended them, &amp; having sincerely endevored to try out the truth by all meanes, &amp; to doo them all good offices wch lay in their power. Mr Bargrave telleth me, (si credere dignum) that all the petitions to the King against the Companie, are set on by Sr T.

O. 1, Volume II, No. 7, I Document in Public Record Office, London. Autograph, Signed List of Records No. 326 30 May 1622 Whereas by the Right Honorable the Lord Keepers Decree it appeareth; that Sr Thomas Smythe and the other Defendants, had so sheltered them selues vnder the name of the Company, that he could not iudge whether the wrongs that were doon me, were the Companyes Acts, or the Defend- ants I complayned of: By wch meanes his Lps finding it to be matter of State, forced me to complayne against the form of Governmt, and to desire a Commission to examin and certifie the Governmt generally, thereby to distinguish the Abvsers of the same. Now, So it is: That I doe freely and voluntarily acknowledge, that my Complaint was grounded vpon the abvse of the Governmt as it §was§ ordered in the time of Sr Thomas Smythe, when taking to himself absolute power of Governing both the Plantation and the Company according to his will, when no Lawes were made to prevent faction and packing of Coorts, nor no order kept of menaging businesses in publique Coorts lawfully assembled, but they were carryed by private packings: the then Secretary framing, leaving out, adding and entring the Orders of Coort wth other Acts that concerned the Company, as he was guided by the Combiners, for wch he was since dis- placed. No assurance given to the Planter either of his Estate or libertie, Nor no Orders made to avoyd the engrossing of Trade into few hands, nor no Course taken to prevent oppression of single Planters or small Bodies of Adventurers by pluralitie of voyces of great numbers interressed in any differences. But now finding vpon due examynation these things rectified, partlie by Lawes established here for the Governmt of the Com- pany: and also by Charters and Privileges confirmed to the Colony, wth a promise of granting farther Privileges when it shall please his May to grant farther authoritie to the Company Of wch reformation (beeing now fully informed): I doe vtterly disclayme from laying any imputation vpon the Governmt for these three yeares last past. And doe farther averr, that in my opinion the Businesse of the Plantation could not have been menaged wth more industrie or integritie then during that time it hath been. In everie of wch three yeares, there hath been more doon wth Ten or Twelue Thousand pounds, whereof a true Account hath been made then was before wth fowre score Thousand pounds spent wthout account in Thirteen yeares. And whereas I have written five severall Treatises to the maintenance of vnitie and peace in Virginia, and to the vniting of the Governmt of it to the Soveraigntie of England: I would burn them all together wth the hand that writ them, rather then they should be the meanes to hinder the going forward of so Noble a Worke.

Besides, there are now prouiding seuerall Ships in diuers parts of this Kingdome to transport to the Plantations aboue 500. persons. And for the greater benefit of the Plantations, these things following haue been here done this yeere. 16 Persons Italians, and others, haue been prouided and sent for the mak- ing of Beads for trade in the Countrey with the Natiues, and for making Glasse of all sorts. 57 Young maids haue bin sent to make wiues for the Planters, diuers of which were well married before the comming away of the Ships. A Magazine hath bin sent of all necessaries for the Colony, to the value of 2000. pound, besides al priuate mens sending goods, which was very ample, Trade being set open for all his Maiesties Subiects. A Ship called the Discouery, hath bin set out for the rich trade of Furres, which both the French, and Hollanders haue yeerely within our precincts, and within 50. leagues of vs. 25. Persons for the building of Boats, Pinnaces and Ships, for the neces- sary vse of the Colony for fishing, trade, and Discouery, &amp;c. 7. Persons sent for planting the 1000. acres of land giuen to the East-India Schoole. Other occurrents of note. The Gouernors arriuall in Virginia, at the end of the last Summer, with 9. Ships, and neare seuen hundred people, all safely, and in good health. The admirable deliuerance of diuers Ships; and namely, of the Tiger, which being driuen strangely neare 200. leagues out of her course, fell into the Turkes hands, and yet came safe to Virginia. Master Berkleys letters assure vs, that there is not a more fit place for Iron-workes then in Virginia, both for wood, water, mines, and stone: and that by Whitsontide next, we may rely vpon Iron made by him. The Plants of Cotton-wooll trees that came out of the West Indies, prosper exceeding well, and the Cotton-wooll-seeds from the Mogols Countrey come vp, and grow: Samples of it they haue sent; and this commodity they hope this yeere to bring to a good perfection and quantity. The Indico seed thriues well, but they yet want knowledge how to cure it. Our Frenchmen assure vs that no Countrey in the world is more proper for Vines, Silke, Oliues, Rice, &amp;c. then Virginia, and that it excelleth their owne Countrey. The Vines being in abundance naturally ouer all the Countrey: a taste of which wine they haue already sent vs, with hope the next yere to send vs a good quantity. There be Mulbery trees in wonderfull abundance, and much excelling both in goodnesse and greatnesse those of their Countrey of Languedock. To the full perfecting of both which rich commodities of Wine and Silke, there wanteth nothing but hands. And of the Mulberies may bee made also good wholesome Wine for the people there. And of a certain Plumme in the country they haue made good drink. Salt-workes are erecting (the proper place being now found, as the Rocheller doth certifie vs) whereby many Ships will transport people at easier rates hereafter, finding Salt there to furnish them for the great and profitable fishings vpon that Coast, whither 20. saile of Ships went this last yeere out of the Westerne parts of England, besides the Ships formerly mentioned. Master Iohn Porey hath of late made a discouery into the great Bay Northward (yet at the bottome of it he was not, reseruing it to a second Voyage) where are now settled neare 100. English very happily, with hope of a good Trade of Furres there to be had. And Terra Lemnia was sent vs from thence, which is found as good as that of Turkey, and is in great abundance to be had. In February last he likewise discouered to the South Riuer, some 60. miles ouer land from vs, a very fruitfull and pleasant Countrey, full of Riuers, wherein are two haruests in one yeere (the great King giuing him friendly entertainment, and desirous to make a league with vs) hee found also there in great quantity of the same Silke-grasse, (as appeareth by the samples sent vs) wherof Master Heriott in his booke 1587. makes relation, who then brought home some of it, with which a piece of Grogeran was made, and giuen to Queene Elizabeth, and some heere who haue liued in the East Indies affirme, that they make all their Cambaya Stuffes of this, and Cotten-wooll. Also in his passage by land, Master Porey discouered a Countrey, full of Pine trees, aboue twenty miles long, whereby a great abundance of Pitch and Tarre may be made: and other sorts of woods there were, fit for Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes. The Indians haue made relation of a Copper-mine, that is not far from thence, how they gather it, and the strange making of it: a piece whereof was sent home, being found (after triall) very excellent metall. Some of the English haue made relation of a China box seene at one of the Kings houses, who declared, that it was sent him from the West, by a King that dwels ouer the great hils, whose Countrey is neare the Sea, he hauing that box from a People, as he said, that come thither in Ships, and weare clothes, and dwell in houses, and are called Acanackchina. And he offered our people that he would send his brother along with them to that King: which the Gouernour purposeth not to refuse, hoping thereby to discouer the South Sea, so long talked of. A small Ship comming in December last from the Summer-Ilands, to Virginia, brought thither from thence these Plants, viz. Vines of all sorts, Orange and Leman trees, Sugar canes, Cassado roots (that make bread) Pines, Plantans, Potatoes, and sundry other Indian fruites and plants, not formerly seene in Virginia, which begin to prosper very well. Gifts. l. s. d. The Gentlemen and Mariners that came in the Royall Iames from the East Indies (being at Cape Bona Speranza homeward bound) gaue towards the building of a Free Schoole in Virginia, to be called the East India Schoole, the summe of 70. 8. 6. Towards the furtherance of the said East India Schoole, an vnknowne person hath added the sum of 30. 00. 00. A person refusing to be made known, hath giuen the sum of 40.s. a yere for euer, for a Sermon, before the Virginia Comp. 30. 00. 00. At a Quarter Court held the 30. of Ianuary 1621. by a person not willing as yet to be knowne, was sent in gold to helpe forward the East India Schoole 25. 00. 00. At the same Quarter Court, a small Bible, with a couer richly wrought; a great Church Bible; Bookes of Common Prayer; and other Bookes were presented to be sent to Virginia, in the name of a person who had the yeere before sent, for the vse of the Colledge at Henrico, diuers Bookes, and an exact Map of America; the Giuer is not knowne, but the Bookes are valued at 10. 00. 00. Giuen also by M. Thomas Bargraue, Preacher in Virginia deceased, for the vse of the Colledge, a Library valued at 100. Marks. And there is a contribution made by the inhabitants in Virginia, for the building of an house of entertainment for new comes at Iames City, amounting to the value of 1500. li.

List of Records No. 328 June xth 1622 After or very heartie Comenda?ons: The late arivall of all the Shipp? and people sent this last yeare to Virginia, hath bredd such abundance of ioy as could not be contained amongst or selues, but hath declared it self by publique thanksgiueinge vnto God Allmightie, that of the richnes of his mercies through all waies and passages, so securely conducted you: This vnexpected blessing doth much encouradge vs, in the middest of many difficulties, wth an assured hope, that the indignation of God is now at last appeased and that his gratious favors shall henceforth lead you on successfully in all thing?: And this we hope the rather, by the good enterance wch we vndrstand you haue made in the Iron work?, and other staple Comodities; wherin we most earnestly intreat you wth all constancie and dilligence to proceed: for there is now an absolute necessitie vppon vs to make good and that speedily, by reall proofe some of those thing?, wth the exportation of wch we haue so long posessed the world. wherefore as yor owne welfare and the advancement of ye Plantation is deare and pretious vnto you, or if or loues and endevors haue deserued ought at yor hand?; we pray and intreat you not to faile in the ?formance of what we in yor behalf? haue promised; and let vs haue at least by the next returnes, some good quantitie of Iron and Wyne; that wch you sent by the George was by long carrieing spoiled but principally, by the Mustie Caske wherein it was putt, so that it hath been rather of scandall then creditt vnto vs. His Matie aboue all thing? requires from vs a proofe of Silk; sharply reprovinge the neglect thereof, wherefore we pray you lett that little stock you haue be carefully improued, the Mulberie trees preserued and encreased, and all other fitt preparations made, for, God willinge, before Christmas you shall receiue from vs, one hundreth ounces of Silkworm seed at least, wch comeinge to late from Valentia we haue been forced to hatch it here. All those supplies of Corne and seed?, wch you desire, shall, assoone as new comes in, be sent you, not doubting but there wilbe more care had to preserue them, then formerly hath been. The Silkgrasse sent home by mr Pory, whose paines and discouries we much esteeme, is avouched vnto vs, by them that haue long lived in the East Indies to be the same of wch the Cambaya stufes are made, we pray you therefore and him in ?ticular, to endevor to procure some good quantitie of it, that experience may be made thereof. The proiect of Capt Newce concerninge the altering of the Condi?ons wth or Tenant? hath been the more carefully considered of by vs, in regard it was recommended by you in generall, but as yett we are come to no deter- mination thereof, through the interup?on of many and waighty bussineses, wch haue wholie taken vpp or times, and wch we could by no meanes waue, but we shall time enough giue answer therevnto: In the meane while we desire, that no alteration be made, but that the best may be donne accord- ing to the course therein. Wee haue much and very carefully labored in the matter of Fortification, wch you so much presse, but haueinge fruitlesly attempted diurs waies. Capt Each maister of the Abigaile made offer vppon the assurance of 60000 waight of Tobacco homward? at 3d ? pound fraight to carrie twelue Carpenters wth him, by whom and his owne Mariners, together wth the asistance of the Collony, layeinge his Shipp nere Blunt point he wold erect before the end of March vppon the Oyster bank?, a Block- House, that should forbid the passage of any Shipp vpp higher in the Riuer. Wee haue many times advised wth the Planters lately come over, and by the opinions and entreatie of them all, assuring vs it wilbe a most necessarie and welcome busines, haue agreed wth Capt Each, to sett for- ward from the Ile of Wight the begining of August next; and although the Company at ?sent be much indebted, neere two thousand pound?, yet for the effectinge hereof they haue not refused to bestow neare 300?i in Instrument? and other provisions necessarie: the repayment whereof they will expect this ?sent yeare from the Collony, for whose safty and securitie they doe it: wee send you here the plott of that wch he hath proposed vnto vs, that by consideration thereof you may be the better prepared. The Companies debt? here at home, makes vs very solicitous, wch haveing grown not for or owne occa?ons here, whereas you well know all thing? are donne freelie, but for the advancmt and and good of the Plantation, and Collonie; we cannot but desire you wch haue the greatest benefite, to take likewise vppon you part of the care for the sattisfac?on thereof, that neither the Company be disinabled and dishonored, nor those private ?sons who stand engaged for them, endamaged, whose desert? toward? you; as in this so in all other thing? haue been very great: wherefore we earnestlie intreat you, to be all assistant in what possible you may: to those whose ?ticular charge it is, for the improueinge and recouringe of the Companies debt? and revenewes. The Tobacco sent home by the George for the Company, proues very meane and as yett vnsould although it hath beene offred att 3s the pound. This we thought fitt to advise you concerninge the quantitie and the maner, how it is raised in both wch being don contrarie to theire direc?ons and extreamly to theire preiudice, the Companie is verie ill sattisfied wee will by the next write more largely. [22a] Next the publique, wee must againe recomend vnto you the last years vndrtaking? of the Glassework?, the ffurrs, the Maid?, and the Magazine, that each of them respectiuelie may haue yor best fauor and assistance; so that although they haue missed of the ?sent return wch they expected, yett in the end the good proceed of theire Adventures may enable and encouradg them to go one, in these and the like necessarie kind? of sup- plies, wch haue here risen, not out of the su?fluitie of theire estates, but out of theire charitie and great zeale wch they beare vnto the Plantation, wch by the delay of one yeare is sett so much backward, whereof the damage is the Collonies, and ors the discontent and griefe, who would willingly haue continued or yearely supplies, if we might haue been answered as was fitt, wth yearely returnes, whereof we see no iust cause to the contrarie. Wee vndrstand that mr Pountis his care &amp; charitie in the providing for the Maid? hath been very abundant, for wch not onely the ?ticular Adventurers, who haue sent him a remembrance of theire loues, but the whole Company returne him verie hartie thank?: But whereas we are informed by some private letters, of his purpose to come to England this yeare, if it be not grounded one waightier reasons then are alledged we earnestly intreate him to stay considering both in regard of his skill and office, there wilbe speciall need of his assistance in the building of the forte and otherwise: In this request the Adventurers of Southampton hundred ioyne, who by the good entrance that he hath made in theire bussines haue conceived much hope of the bettering theire Planta?on; and for the ordering of the Discoverie, and the proceed? of her vioadge wch hath been a Marveilous charge vnto them, they do much relie vppon his help. The reward of the great paines and care wch we and they by the seurall employmt? haue putt vppon him, shalbe to the vttermost of theire §our§ abillities and we doubt not to his full content; for the ?formance whereof we desire creditt onely till the arivall of the Abigaile. One thinge more in ?ticuler we are to intreat him: that whereas there haue been a deliurie of certaine kine and Calues, vnto him by mr Woodall? appointmt that he do not proceed in the sale or disposinge of any more of them then are already sold, till they haue further order from the Company, who conceiue themselues much wronged in the deliury of so many, besid? that there is claime made by others vnto that debt vppon wch mr Woodall had the order for the Catle. In this Shipp cometh over Capt Tho: Barwick wth fiue and twentie other ?sons vndr his govermt, for the building of boat?, Shipp?, and Pinnaces, vppon wch they are onely to bee employed: the list of theire names, the Copies of their severall Covenant?, and the Invoyce of their provisions we send you here along, to the intent that by the knowledge of these ?ticu- lars, yor cares and favors might the better help forward this busines: there is not any thing of this nature, as hath put vs to so much troble and charge as this Proiect hath donn: wherefore as the most difficult, we most especially reco?end it vnto you, desiringe you that all the ?sons in generall may be cherished, so in ?ticular Capt Tho: Barwick may find from you that favor and respect, as may better enable him for the ?formance of his place, And as of all in generall, so in ?ticular, we verie earnestlie request mr George Sandys from whom at first this proiect in parte moved, to haue an especiall regard vnto the proceeding? thereof, and that he would be pleased to take the accompt? of Capt Tho: Barwick and to transmitt the profitt? accordingly as they shall grow due from time to time, vnto the Adventurers: Our desire is that they should be sett downe altogether in one place, where after the convenient housinge of themselues, they should all liue, and worke together in theire seurall trades: the choosinge of a place is lefte to yors and their owne iudgment?, so as there may be at the least 1200 acres of land appropriated vnto it; and for the better easing of them in drawinge of their Tymber, the Company haue graunted to lend him foure of theire Oxen, wch we pray you cause to be deliured vnto them. There comes also along one Leonard Hudson a Carpenter wth his wife and fiue of or Apprentices for the erecting of the East India Schoole, the monies would not reach vnto the sending of an Vsher as was first intended; and besides vppon a second consideration, it was thought good to giue the Collony the choise of the Schoolemr; or Vssher, if so be there be any there fitt for the place, if not, we desire to vndrstand what proportion of manteinance they will alowe and accordingly, wee will do or best, to procure from hence an honest, and sufficient man for such a charge. The building of a Schoole and setting out the land at Charles Cittie is not so absolutely required, but that if an other place shalbe iudged more convenient by the Colonie, it is lefte to yor choise; but that there be such a proportion of land some where laid out, and that those people now sent be kept together for cultivating the land and building of a howse; may not vppon any reason whatsoever be altred: wherefore wee pray you to lett the buissines proceed in that course, where in the notice of a good begininge, we are assured will stirr vpp the mind? of diurs good people to add liberaly to this foundation: There is very much in this buissines that wee must leaue to yor cares and wisdomes; and the help and assistance of good people, of wch we doubt not. [23] Wee send over mr Wi?m Leate a minister recomended vnto vs, for sufficiencie of learning &amp; integrity of life: if he be entertained by any privat societie; we shall expect the charg? of 26? wch ye Comp[any] hath laid out for him, to be returned by the first in good Tobacco 18d ?? and not aboue: and in this and the like kind?, we especially desire the care of mr George Sandys, that by the returne of the stock? we may be enabled to continue the supplies. The good endevors of mr Berkley we kindly accept, and haue sent him and his people diurs provisions wch he writt for; ffor matter of apparell he must supplie that out of the Magazines we haveing beyond or liberties strained or selues; but the Adventurers of Southampton hundred desire that he may, out of theire store, haue fine kine deliured him and his Company. There is likewise sent some provisions for the French men, and the next Shipp shall bring their apparell, there wadges haue been paid here to mr Bonall, theire kind vsage, and the instructing and training vp of many in their skill? and art?, are thing? we especially recomend vnto you. The Adventurers of the Glasse, haue sent Capt Norton a good supplie, the Copie of all wch Invoyces, together wth that of Martins hundred, we send here inclosed: that you might the better right them, if by the negligence, and default of the Mariners, the suffer any damage. Vppon the good pformance of this Vioadge by the Maister, we desire you to aford him all the favor and curtesie that you may, the owners and vndrtakers of the Shipp being ?sons likly by large Adventures much to advance the Plantation. mr Robert Paulett the Minister, was he whom the Court chose to be of the Counsell, for mr Harwood the Adventurers of Martins hundred desire that he might be spared from that office, theire bussines requiring his presence continually. The last thing that we will conclude wth is, that it hath pleased my Lord of Southampton for one yeare more to accept of the place of Treasuror, and the Lo: Cavendish of the government of the Su?er Iland?. And so reservinge all other ?ticulars, vntill better conveniencie, we comitt you and all yor affaires to the guidinge and protection of the Allmightie. London 10 Junij 1622. Yor very Lovinge ffrend?.

Whereas through the large extention of ground heretofore graunted, both to Corporation?, Hundred?, ?ticuler Plantation?, and private Dividend?, this Colony was so dispersed &amp; people so straglingly seated, that we were not only bereft of the frendly comerce and mutuall societie one of another in religeous duties, the first fruit? of Civility; but were also disabled any way to prouide for the co?on safety either against forraine or domesticke invasion, the carefullest charge of Christian charity, wittnes those vexed Soules and troubled Spirit? of ors, when in this last outrage of these Infi- dell? we were forced to stand and gaze at or distressed bretheren, fryinge in the furie of or enimies, and could not relieue them.

And therefore of Our gracious Inclination to a designe of so much honour and aduantage to the publike, Wee haue thought good, as at sundry other times, so now more particularly to recommend it to your speciall care, hereby charging and requiring you to take speedy order, that our people there, vse all possible diligence in breeding Silkewormes, and erecting Silkeworkes, and that they rather bestow their trauell in compassing this rich and solid Commodity, then in that of Tobacco; which besides much vnnecessary expence, brings with it many disorders and inconueniences.

The intimation of his Maiesties pleasure, wee conceiue to be a motiue sufficient, to induce you to imploy all your indeuours to the setting forward those two Staple Commodities of Silke, and Wine; which brought to their perfection, will infinitely redound to the honour, benefit and comfort of the Colony, and of this whole Kingdome: yet we, in discharge of our duties, doe againe renew our often and iterated Instructions, and inuite you cheer- fully, to fall vpon these two so rich, and necessary commodities. And if you shall finde any person, either through negligence or wilfulnesse, to omit the planting of Vines, and Mulbery trees, in orderly and husbandly man- ner, as by the Booke is prescribed, or the prouiding of conuenient roomes for the breeding of Wormes; we desire they may by seuere censures and pun- ishment, be compelled thereunto. And on the contrary, that all fauour and possible assistance bee giuen to such, as yeeld willing obedience to his Highnesse Commands therein. The breach or performance whereof, as we are bound to giue a strict account, so will it also be required of you the Gouernour and Councell especially. Herein there can be no Plea, either of difficulty or impossibility; but all the contrary appeares, by the naturall abundance of those two excellent Plants afore-named euery where in Virginia: neither will such excuses be admitted, nor any other pretences serue, whereby the businesse be at all delayed: and as we formerly sent at our great charge the French Vignerons to you, to teach you their Art; so for the same purpose we now commend this Booke vnto you, to serue as an Instructour to euery one, and send you store of them to bee dispersed ouer the whole Colony, to euery Master of a Family one. Silk-seed you shall receiue also by this Ship, sufficient to store euery man: so that there wants nothing, but industry in the Planter, suddenly to bring the making of Silke to its perfection: which either for their owne benefit (we hope) they will willingly indeuour, or by a wholesome and necessary seuerity they must be inforced. This particular aduice we thought necessary to giue you, lest that if it should haue come to you mingled with others, you would haue interpreted it as a common Instruction, or a businesse that was not taken so to heart, as this is by vs, and we hope will be by you in humble obedience to his Sacred Maiesties Royall Instructions. The paines and industry of the Authour, for the benefit of the Plantations (being a member of our Com- pany) are sufficient arguments of his good affection to the Action, and they both deserue your best acceptance and ours, that others may thereby be inuited to impart their knowledge in businesse of this and the like nature; whereby the Colony may not onely bee supported for the present, but brought to that perfection, that may redound to the glory of God, the honour of his Maiesty, and the inestimable benefit of his noble Kingdomes; which as they are the true aime and end the Aduenturers and Planters haue proposed vnto themselues; so ought they to bee still the honorable seeds to put others also forward in this action: we commend this businesse againe to your speciall care. And so we commit you all, and your waighty affaires, to the protection of the Almighty. Henry Southampton.</field>

List of Records No. 356 To our very loving frends Sr Francis Wyatt knight Governor &amp; Captaine generall of Virginia; and to the rest of the Counsell of state there August the first 1622 After or very hartie Comendations; Wee haue to or extreame grief vndrstood of the great Massacre executed on our people in Virginia, and that in such a maner as is more miserable then the death it self; to fall by the hand? of men so contemptible; to be surprised by treacherie in a time of known danger; to be deafe to so plaine a warning (as we now to late vndrstand) was last yeare given; to be secure in an occa?on of so great suspition and iealousie as was Nenemathanewes death; not to ?ceiue any thing in so opne and generall conspiracie; but to be made in parte instrument? of contriving it, and almost guiltie of the destruc?on by a blindfold and stupid entertaininge of it; wch the least wisdome or courage suffised to prevent even on the point of execu?on: are circumstances, that do add much to or sorrow &amp; make vs to confesse that it is the heavie hand of Allmightie God for the punishment of ors and yor transgressions: to the humble acknowledgment and ?fect amend- ment whereof together wth or selues, we seriously advise and invite you; and in ?ticular earnestly require the speedie redresse of those two enor- mous exesses of apparell and drinkeing; the crie whereof cannot but haue gon vp to heaven; since the infamie hath spredd it self to all that haue but heard the name of Virginia to the detesta?on of all good mind?, the scorne of others, and or extreame griefe and shame: In ye strength of those fault?, vndoubtedly, and the neglect of the Devine worshipp, haue the Indians prevailed, more then in yor weaknes; whence the evill there- fore sprung the remedy must first begin: and an humble reconciliation be made wth the devine Matie by future conformitie vnto his most iust and holie lawes: wch doinge we doubt not but that you shall be safe from the hand? of all yor enemies, and them that hate you: from whom if Gods protec?on be not wth you no strength of scituation can saue you: and wth it we conceiue not but where you be you may make yor selues as secure as in any other place whatsoeur: and in all other respect?, the chaung cannot be but to the worst, nay to the vtter overthrow, not only of all or labors &amp; charg? past, but to the frustrating of or intentions, and hopes, and the expectation of his Matie and the whole state: wherefore you shall do well so wholie to abandon the thought thereof, as in this point not to returne vs any answer: Spartam quam nactus es hanc exorna: there to applie all yor thought? and endevors, and in especiall to the setting vpp of Staple Comodities, according to those often instruc?ons, and reiterated advises that wee haue continually given you: the want whereof hath been the truest obiection against ye succeedinge of this Plantation, and the greatest hindrance and impediment (as we conceiue) that his Matie and the State haue not sett to a more liberall hand to the furtherance thereof but now at last it hath pleased God for the confirmation, no doubt, of or hopes, and redoubling of or and yor coradges, to encline his Maties Royall heart, to graunt the sole importation of Tobacco (a thing long and earnestly desired) to the Virginia and Su?er Ilands Companies: and that vppon such condi?ons as the private profitt of each man is likely to be much improved, and the generall state of the Plantation strongly secured, whilest his Mat?: Revenue is so closely ioyned as together wth the Col- lonie it must rise, and faile, grow and empaire, and that not a smale matter neither, but of twenty thousand pound ? ann (for the offer of so much in certainty hath his Matie been pleased to refuse in fauor of the Plantations) The good effect? likely hence to ensue are to obvious for vs to sett downe, and ?happ? greater then we can imagine; this only in generall we may assure orselues and you, that there shalbe no iust favor tending to the advancement of ye Planta?on that we may not hope from his Matie, who vppon or humble peti?on and the mediation of the Lord? of his most Honoble Privie Counsell, hath out of his Royall bountie been pleased to bestow vppon vs diurs armes (although in these part? vnserv- iceable, yett) such as against the Indians may be verie vsefull; wch we doubt not but by the Abigaile to send you; and are further put in an assured hope to obtaine the number of 400 young men, well furnished out of England and Wales at 20? a person, to repaire wth advantage the number that is lost, to sett vpp the publiq revenues of the Companie, and sattisfie the desert? of worthie persons in the Colony; this supplie we hope to procure, so as they may be wth you before the Spring. The feare of yor want of Corne doth much perplex vs, seeing so little possibility to supplie you, the publique stock being vtterly as you know exhausted, and the last yeares Adventures made by Private men not returned, as was promised, we haue no hope of raising any valuable Magazine, but rather feare to see the effect of what we forwarned by the Warwick; Other waies and meanes are so vncertaine, as wee [24] cannot wish you to rely vppon any thing, but yorselues, yet shall there not be left any mean[s] vnatempted on or part? in this kind, and for other necessaries to supplie you, hoping that the danger of this extremitie will hence forward ?swade you not to comitt the certaintie of yor liues to the vncertainty of one harvest: and that at last you will vndrstand, it is as fitt and necessarie to yeeld the return of Adventures yearely as to receiue them: but of these thing[s] the Abigaile shall not only bring you further notice, but we hope in some part the ?forman[ce] whose stay hath by these last newes been a litle prolonged but by the end of the Month wee doubt not to dispatch her; or designes in her entertainmt we advised of by the Furtherance but now send it you more fully expressed in the Order of the Quarter Court: to the accomplishing whereof we earnestly desire you to applie yor vttermost endevors: although ?happ? it may proue in the effect, of lesse consequence then we desire, and of greater difficultie in the execu?on, then is pro- pounded; yet it canot be but the bare name of a Forte will proue of more worth then the charges and paines required therevnto. The ?ticu- larities of the ?formance, we must reserue till the Shipp it self come, only now we thought necessarie to let you vndrstand that the Company, hath covenanted vppon the effecting of the bussines to make the fraight of the Shipp homeward 800? wch they haue cast to ?forme by the ladinge aboard of threescore and foure thousand waight of Tobacco at 3d ??: and at this price the generall Company, the Adventurers of the ioynt stock, of mr Blaneys Magazine, of Southampton hundred (who haue refused for theire owne and the Collonies benefitt the imployeing of the Discoverie in Virginia) and of Martins hundred haue agreed and ordered that their Tobacco shalbe brought home in the Abigaile, wch we desire you take order may be ?formed accordingly. The procuring of the rest to make vp the former quantitie is the thing we are now most seriously to recomend vnto yor cares wch vppon this timely advise (before by the coming of so many Shipp? thing? before stated) we doubt not you will verie easely effect, the price being so indifferent, the conveyance so safe, and good, and the delay of a litle time in the comeing home of the Tobacco no disadvantage at all, by reason of the contract that we haue lately concluded wth his Matie; so that we doubt not, but by the volluntarie offers of private men, you may raise the full quantitie for fraight, wch otherwise by authoritie must be provided, that neither the Company be dishonored by breach of their Covenant? wth Capt Each, nor much lesse be endamaged, in that wch for the Collonies good only, they haue vndrtaken. There come now over in this Shipp, and are imediatly to follow in some others many hundred? of people, to whom as we here think orselues bound to giue the best encouragment? for theire goinge in reguard (that you §in§ the want of a publique stock) there is no way left to encrease the Planta- tion, but by abundance of private vndrtakers; so we thinke you obliged, to giue all possible furtherance and assistance, for the good enterteining, and well settling of them, that they may both thriue &amp; prosper and others by theire welfare be drawne after them: This is the way that we conceiue most effectuall for the engageing of this State, and securing of Virginia, for, in the multitude of people is the strength of a Kingdome: The allotting out of ?ticular Divident?, and the setlinge of private ?sons, we leaue (vntill thing? may receiue a better force) vnto yor wisdomes and iudge- ment?; not doubting but you will find out some course as shall giue content to reasonable mind?; wch we very much desire may be donn, as farr as civill life and securitie will ?mitt, both wch together wth eligeon it self, by this inordinate stragglinge run hazard of perishinge; wch error by so hard a chastizment, we hope from hence forward they will be willing of themselues to amend, if not yor authoritie must restreine them, not suf- fering any to plant or sett down any where, but wth so sufficient a number of able men and well provided, as may, not in theire owne, but in yor iudgement? (who shalbe therefore accountable) defend themselues from any assault? of the Indians: in wch regard, as also for theire better Civill government (wch mutuall societie doth most conduce vnto) wee think it fitt, that the houses and building? be so contrived together, as may make if not hansome Townes, yet compact and orderly villages; that this is the most proper, and succesfull maner of proceedinge in new Planta?ons, besides those of former ages, the example of the Spaniards in the West Indies, doth fully instance, and against it we do not conceiue there will be any repugnancie, exept from shallow vndrstanding? that cast not beyond the ?sent; or from minds and affec?ons, wholely intent to the satisfieing of theire priv[ate] interests, although wth the ruine of the publique State. The relinquishing of Charles Cittie, Henerico, the Iron Works, the Colledg land? and Martins hundred, are thing?, not only of discontent, but of evill fame, although we doubt not, vndeserved; the replanting them is of absolute necessitie; lest the best fire that mantaines the ac?on here aliue be putt out. for Martins hundred we leaue it to the Adventurers, to take such expedient Course therein as themselues please, only the second- ing thereof we most earnestly recomed vnto you: but for the speedy restoringe of the rest, we pray you to employ yor vttermost endevors; and if the Colledge Ten?t? and those belonging to the Iron work? shall not be sufficient (as we much doubt) to make those places good of them- selues, we desire you to propound these two condi?ons for the inviting of private men, to a competent number to ioyne wth them. first to sett downe vppon the Companies Land, occupieing and manuringe to theire owne benefitt only, such quantitie thereof as they can manage; vntill such time as they may go vppon their owne Divident?, when there shall by the Companies Ten?t? and servant? be a full recompence and sattisfac?on made them in kind, for ye clearing of ground, building of houses, and what ever other cost or charge they haue bestowed vppon the Companies land, and must then leaue vnto them. If this prevaile not (wch we chiefly wish) then are we content to giue to every family ten acres of land, in those places, wch you setting out, we will confirme to them and theire heires for ever: and this ten acres shall not be acconnted in part of any other propor?on due vnto them; nor be any impediment to hinder them from goeing vppon theire Divident? when they please; condi?onally, that the land be not left vncultivated &amp; the houses vninhabited. The people remaining of the Iron works, we desire may be co?itted vnto the charge of mr Maurice Barkley to be imployed (since we cannot hope that the worke should go forward) in such maner as may be most bene- ficiall to themselues, and vs, vntill such time as we may againe renue that bussines, so many times vnfortunatly attempted, and yett so abso- lute necessarie as we shall haue no quiett vntill we see it ?fected: to wch purpose wee desire there may by the first oportunity be sent vs a ?ticular list of the names and professions of the men, as also a noat of the tooles and materiall? wanting for the executing of the worke: Of no lesse waight do we esteeme the Colledge affaires, wch wee pray you to take into yor considerations not only as a publique, but a sacred bussines; and in ?ticuler we very earnestly request the care, and paines of mr George Sandys for the settling and ordering of the Ten?t?; who beinge now by long experience growne skilfull in all maners of the Cuntrie, we are informed it will not be lesse advantageable vnto vs, and of farr more content to themselues, to be left to theire owne disposinge and gov- erment, and to reduce the vncertaintie of half? to the certaintie of a Rent; wch we haue therefore agreed, shalbe for eury ?son 20 bushell? of Corne; 60? waight of good leafe tobacco, and one pound of Silke, to be yearely paid, together wth six dayes labor in publique work?, and over and aboue that they be bound to buildinge of convenient howses, plantinge of orchard?, gardins &amp;, on the Colledg Land and not elswhere: they that will accept of these Condi?ons, you shall leaue to themselues, but so, as for better conveniencie of living, fowr, or at least three of them, sorte themselues to work, and liue together, and be bound each for other for the true ?formance of theire Covenant?: those other that shall not be willing or worthie of such agreement?, we leaue to you to take the best order in disposinge of them: as for those that shalbe Artificers and of Manuall trades and occupa?ons, we conceiue that they may likewise ?forme this bargaine although they follow theire trades, wch rather then that they should not do, wee leaue it to you to contract otherwise wth them, as you shall thinke best, allwaies reservinge that theire living be vppon ye Colledge Land?. As for the Brick-makers, we desire they may be held to theire Contract made wth mr Thorpe, to the intent that when opportunitie shalbe for the erecting of the fabricke of the Colledge, the materiall? be not wanting. These are part of the remedies that are to be applied for the repaireinge of this late disaster; as for the Actors thereof, wee cannot but wth much griefe proceed to the condempnation of theire bodies, the saving of whose Soules, we haue so zealously affected: but since the inocent blood of so many Christians, doth in iustice crie out for reveng, and yor future securitie in wisdome require; we must advise you to roote out from being any longer a people, so cursed a nation, vngratefull to all benefitt?, and vncapable of all goodnesse: at least to the remoueall of them so farr from you, as you may not only be out of danger, but out of feare of them, of whose faith and good meaning you can never be secure: wherefore as they haue merited let them haue a ?petuall warre wthout peace or truce; and although they haue desrved it wthout mercie too, yet remembring who we are, rather then what they haue been, we cannot but advise, not only the sparing, but the preservation, of the younger people of both Sexes, whose bodies may, by labor and service become profitable, and theire mind? not overgrowne wth evill Customes, be reduced to civilitie, and after- ward? to Christianitie: And because there is a necessitie not only in the thing it self, but in the speedines of effecting it; we thinke it fitt that besides that certaine way of famishing (wherevnto we doubt not but you haue ere this given a good begining by the burning of theire Corne, or the reaping it to yor owne benefitt) you add and putt in execution all other waies and meanes of theire destruc?on; not omitting so much as to provoke theire neighbouring enimies (by reward of bead? and Copper vppon the bringeing in of theire head?) to the fierce pursueing of them: and that at such times especially as yorselues may issue out vppon them likewise; wch we think should be often don from all part? of the Collony together: but for a full securinge of yorselues, and a certaine destroyinge of them, we conceiue no meanes so pro?, nor expedient, as to mantaine continually certaine band? of men of able bodies, and invred to the Cun- trie; of stout mind?, and actiue hand?, that may from time to time (in severed bodies) pursue and follow them, surprisinge them in their habi- tations, intercepting them in theire hunting, burninge theire Townes, demolishing theire Temples, destroyinge theire Canoes, plucking vpp theire weares, carying away theire Corne, and depriving them of whatsoeuer may yeeld them succor or relief: by wch meanes in a very short while, both yor iust revenge, and yor ?petuall security might be certainly effected. As for the mantainance of those men wth victuall? and munition, we conceiue it iust and equall, that it should be by a generall levy throughout the whole Collony; in regard whereof, the one moyitie of the prise as well of the ?sons of men for slaues, as good?, should be vnto the Collony for fortifi- ca?on and other publique vses; and the other Moytie devided amongst the Souldiars themselues; in further sattisfac?on of whose travell? and hazard?, we do purpose a liberall recompence, out of the labors of those yong people wch by his Mats gratious favor we hope to obtaine, out of the severall Counties of this Kingdom wch as it shall be bountifull to all so it shalbe redoubled to them into whose hand? the principall? either in execu- ?on or contriuement of this Treacherie shall fall: but if any can take Opachancano himself, he shall haue a great and singular reward from vs. As for those Indians whom God vsed as instrument? of revealing and pre- ventinge the totall ruine of you all we thinke a good respect and recom- pence due vnto them, wch be a good and carefull education of them may best be expressed and sattisfied; whereby they may be made capable of further benefitt? and favors. Wee send you a Copie of or Letters by the Furtherance wch wee doubt not but is safely long ere this arived wth you the suplies therein sent of Ship- wright?, and East India Schoole, wee cannot but againe most effectually and earnestly recomend vnto yor care and favors, wch ?happ? by the chaing of thing? wth you they will the more need. The improving of the Com- panies revenues, and recoverie of theire Debt? is, of those thing? wthout wch neither wee nor you can subsist. Many other matters we haue to write if time would giue leaue for want whereof, we must reserue them till the departure of the Abigaile: And now comitting you and all yor affaires, to the good guidance and protec?on of the Almightie. we bid you hartily farewell August the first 1622.

A Letter to the Governor and the Council in Virginia October 7, 1622 Manuscript Records Virginia Company, III, Part ii, Pages 25a—27 Document in Library of Congress, Washington, D. C. List of Records No. 367 October 7th 1622 After or very hartie Comenda?ons. Wee had not thought to haue written vnto you till wee had beene invited by yor letters vnto vs: but the neces- sitie of some thing? to be ?formed by you hath made vs thinke it necessarie to remember them in an extraordinarie maner, and to reinforce the Instruccons and charge of the Counsell, by the advise and desires of vs ye Company. The late calamities that haue befalne, do much grieue but no whit daunt vs, for wee see no daunger but rather advantage to be made thereby, nor any further daunger, except it be in yor feares, wch would nowe be as vicious as yor former securitie, and as much betray you to destruccon: for vs you may see the encrease of or hopes and courage in the largnes of supplies now sent by private men, since the publique is not able; vnto the con- tinuance whereof we see such a disposition in mens mind?, as we cannot but thinke, that the sheeding of this blood wilbe the Seed of the Planta- tion, for the addi?on of price, hath much endeared the purchase. And now to all the rest, we conceaue it a Sinne against the dead, to abandon the enterprize, till we haue fully settled the possession, for wch so many of or Brethren haue lost theire lives: this is the first thing due from vs and you; and the next, wch will likewise much further the other, is a sharp revenge vppon the bloody miscreant?, even to the measure that they intended against vs, the rooting them out for being longer a people vppon the face of the Earth. for the effecting whereof, as you haue already receaved advise from the Counsell (wch we desire you in all point? to follow) so you shall now receave a gratious supplie from his most exellent Matie of Armes and weapons fitt and pro? for such service: the disposing of them to ?sons and places we leaue to yor iudgment?, but only for vse; the proprietie must remaine to the generall Collony, as the begining of a Publique Armorie, and a perpetuall testimony of his Mat? royall bountie and favor: from wch wee hope very speedily to obtaine the meanes of restoring the Publique, rewarding the good desert? of all, especially whose worths shalbe shewed in these prsent difficulties, and fully to furnish the number of Tennt?, wch in yors the Governor, and other officers places, we vndrstand are wanting, not only to or griefe, but wonder. But both for the future and that wch is past, rest assured we shall provide and make sattisfac?on and had ear this donn in a very advantagable maner vnto you, insteed of Tennt? sendinge you servant?, had not yor last letters dis- claymed them, wthout such supply of Corne and victuall, as was impossible for vs to provide, through or povertie, and it? high price: wherfore the hundred youths, wch wth 500li we had procured from the Cittie, wee were constreined to giue vnto the Su?er Ileand? Company to theire benefitt and or damage, and all through want of Corne: The abundant planting and provision whereof, haueing been for these last foure yeares so continu- ally vrged from vs, and yett as constantly neglected and and contemned, giues iust cause to doubt, (and the more through the two strang propo- sisions, wch we heare of late haue beene made, of Ingrossinge all and leavinge all:) that there hath been in some (in whom it ought least to haue been) an intent to hinder the encrease of the Plantation further then it might be theire owne gaine and greatnesse: a horrible Cryme, and treason even against God himself, to whom this great work in or intent? is principally consecrated; and yett such courses force vs allmost to such suspi?on: Neither shall we belieue otherwise of you Sr Francis Wyatt and the rest, in whom we yett haue great confidence, exept the Collony and Plantation be from henceforth, by yor courage, cares, and endeavors kept and mantained, and every principall part thereof where formerly it was, and that in abundance of grayne and victuall; wch since the Savadges enmitie could not hinder in the Collonies weakest infancie, we cannot thinke it can now do, when the strength thereof is almost ten times doubled, exept we should thinke you lesse then they were: but we on the contrary haue such confidence in yor vallors and wisdome, that we hope to vndrstand as suddaine an end of this warr, as it had an vnexpected begininge, beinge ?swaded theire owne terrors will driue them away, exept yors retaine them. As for Enemies of equall condi?on in Armes and vndrstanding, and more mightier in power then yor selues, we know none, and in God feare none; yett we thinke it yor dutie to stand alwaies vppon yor guard, and prepared for defence as much as you may, the rest God will supplie if you serue him. Abundance of Munition, wch yor selues must take care that both the Publique and Private, be allwaies well stored, wch the exercising and training vpp of the people in Martiall Discipline, and carefull preservation of theire Armes, wherein there must need? haue been vnanswerable neglect: if there be that want, yor letters imply, are thing? obvious that we need not further touch: To those we desire you to take into yor con- sideration the continuall mantainance of good Shipping in the River; wch might easely be effected, if by raysinge of any Staple Comodities, they might haue some part of fraight homeward? a little would suffice, such is the danger and povertie of [26] all Marchaunt? employment?, that the certainty of verie smale gaine, would invite Shipping in abundance, of all times in the yeare to transport people for Virginia, wch would not only serue by the accomodatinge of every mans occacons to further great numbers: but also by a necessary engagement of those to whom the Shipping belong?, cause many large Addventures to be made and much people to be sent that otherwise would never go. We pray you seriously therefore to endeavor it, and to take into yor consideration what depend- ance good thing? haue one vpon another and how a right and orderly proceeding bring? all enterprises to ?feccon, seeing the following of Staple Comodities doth not only tend to the conveniences of well living there, and to the riches of them that raise them, but bringeth along wth it not only the encrease of ye Plantation but also the defence and security thereof; every Shipp being a Bullwark: and because by the same meanes, they that meane you, harme can only offend you, we thought it necessarie aboue all thing?, to secure the River from suddaine Invasion by Shipping: To wch purpose haveing fruitlesly attempted, allthough by the meanes of very noble Parsonages, who were best able to effect itt, what hath in the name of the Collony beene so often and importunatly requested, the sending of Enginers, we haue gladly embraced the offer of Capt Each, concerning the erecting of a Block house about Blunt Point, wherevnto we weare ?swaded and entreated by the advise and desires of almost all that knowe that Cuntrie, aswell Planters, as Seamen, as a thing very feazable &amp; of great benefitt. wherevppon although the alteration of mens mynd? vppon the first newes of the late Callamitie, and much more yor grievous appre- hension of itt, brought it into consultation whether it were not impossible to make those preparations and provision, that on or part? weare requisite thereto, yett we resolved to go on wth or former deliberation, and haue (though wth extreame difficultie and hazard) by Gods blessing effected whatsoever we intended. Now that you on yor part? faile not to ?forme and accomplish the thing it self, we desire, entreat and even adiure you; for yor owne sakes, for ors, for yor safty, for yor reputation, and for the sattisfa?on of all good mynd?, who are in a longing expectation thereof: If the difficulties proue greater then are here conceived, in the wrestling wth them wilbe the tryall of yor courages and in the over coming of them, the encrease of yor honors. If the worke proue not of that consequence as is prtended yet it wilbe alwaies more worth then the labor and cost, that is thereto required, and ye remonstrance of yor willingnes to ?forme what you can to yor owne safety, will effectually moue and produce (wee doubt not) the means to ?forme fully what you desire: to speake plainly we shall never belieue nor dare to attempt any thing of great engagement and hazard, till by reall example of some extraordinarie worke by you effected, we may haue proofe of the sinceritie of yor inten?ons &amp; assurance not to be deluded and frustrated, as we haue hitherto beene in so great and chargeable vndrtaking?. Performe in this, and you cannot further require, what we will not vndrtake for you in this kind; if this of it selfe proue not sufficient, wch we well hope: The Adventurers of Martins Hundred, haue very worthily made offer, and ordered their officers that the fifte parte of theire hundred be from time to time employed in this work till it may be ?fected: Southampton Hundred haue followed the example, and generally all privat Adventures of vs that haue people in Virginia, very willingly agree to the like propor?on: this tax wee haue here made, not to giue you thereby authority (wch needed not) but to giue a good example to the rest of the Collony, by taking more of the burthen then propor?onable can be due vnto vs, chearfully to sup- ply the rest of that shalbe needfull. This disposition of mynd?, we assure orselues you shall find, if not, you must make it, and compell them to theire owne good, that will not otherwyse vndrstand it, but we hope there shalbe no such occa?on given, considering the merveilous forwardnes of the Colony in this kind by many letters expressed: the remembrance whereof bring? to mynd the noble offer made by Sr George Yeardley, worthie the place he bore, to whom we must acknowledge the honor of this propo- si?ons first moveing, and accordingly doubt not but in the furtherance of ye execu?on of it, he will deserve both yor, and or thank? in an especiall maner. The Shipp and Mariners imployment as you find in the Charter- partie is to be discharged by a fraight of 800li and that to be raysed by the lading aboard of 64000 waight of Tobacco at 3d ?li att wch rate besides the generall Companyes, it is agreed and ordered by the severall societies, and the Adventures of Southampton hundred, the old Maga- zine, and last yeares Joynt stock and that now sent, both consigned to mr Ed: Blany, the Glasse, the ffurrs, the Mayd?, the Shipwrights that their Tobacco shalbe laden aboard and sent home in the Abigaile, and if it shalbe thought necessarie by the officers and factor, to send home any of it before, that then there shalbe lefte in the hand? of mr George Sandys the Treasuror, the fifteenth pound of Tobacco (and more if that will not sattisfie) toward? the makeing vpp of the 800li wch is to be paid the Shipp, and for other necessarie vses of the Colony: vnto the same condi?ons do all private Adventurers [26a] likewise agree, condi?onally you hold equall the same course vppon all the Tobacco through the Land; wch wee hold very equall and indeed necessarie to be don, if you cannot find better meanes for the discharge of such payment, as the Company hath covenñted to Capt Each, wch being plainly expressed in the Charterparty sent you, we shall not need to repeat, but only to desire yor especiall care, so to order and dispose thing?, as we be not dishonored nor endamaged any way, nor any thing lefte to vs here to pay: and likewise for sattisfac?on and payment of the materiall? now sent for the erecting of the forte, wch haue alwaies been promised by the Colony to be sattisfied and repaid, and now so much the more stricktly to be observed because they be adventuer of diurs private men, who for the furtherance of this work, seeing the Companies inabilitie haue made provision of the thing? and consigned them to mr Blany, wth order not to dispose of any of them, till the fforte be served: this theire good mynd? deserue yor especiall care, that they may be reimbursed of this charge. And now we come to the returning of yor Magazine and Adventures now and formerly sent, wch we are extreamly solicitous, not so much for or owne Interesses (although they be great) as for yors, wch be farr more: for vs wee hope God will otherwise repay, if you do not, but for you, wee cannot conceaue, but that as you iustly deserue, you wilbe cleane leafte &amp; aban- doned from any supplies hereafter; and what danger that may be, yor prsent necessities speake, wch because they were not last yeare foreseene, no regard was had of returning any thing nor be?iefe; to the protestation, wch at or request §desire§ the Counsell in theire letters by the Warwick made, wch we cannot but remember to or griefe, though to or iustification: lett the smart of sence now teach, what on the creditt of or word? you would not learne, that yor gaines to yor damage by thus gaining tyme, and that the returning of or Stock? home so much empaired, how eare it be pleasant vnto you for a while, will in the end be more bitter vnto you then vs: speedy and full returnes must be made, else it is impossible for vs to pro- ceed on, not so much for or vnwillingnes, as or inabilities, or Adventures are greater, then we can now beare, much lesse increase. This scant supplie wch is now sent had been impossible to haue been raised, if either the necessitie that required it, or the pawne that you offer had been lesse; the preservation of the whole Colony, and the Revenues of the whole; or if the securitie had been worse then the faith of you the Governor, Treasuror, and Counsell, or the dilligence and importunity of them that labored it here, lesse then indefatigable, and such as would receiue no nay, you had wanted even all, that you shall now God willing receaue. Wee send you the Rolle to Subscription to giue you evidence hereof. The multitude of Adventures, and maner of bringing in mony to all good vndrstanding demonstrat?, that thing? are at the bottome, exept the currant be againe restored from Virginia. Wee haue no more in this point to add, but that as we see it, the restles labor of those that here beare office, by procuring Adventures to supplie ye Colony so wee thinke it should be yors, to provide that by profitable returnes, they may be enabled and encouraged to continue it. The Companies great pouertie, and many debt? keep? vs infinitly perplexed, and the more because there are dayly inevitable occa?ons of expence &amp; no ground or hope of Revenues exept from Virginia: we therefore most earnestly intreat you, seriously to endeavor the improvinge of the Companies Revenues there; and in ?ticular that the debt? due vppon the 50 youths sent in the Dutie, and others, may be wthout faile recovered and sent home this yeare: wherein we especially require the care and dilligence of mr George Sandys whose charge it is; and haue acordingly ordered that there should be ?ticuler Instruc?ons given by the Auditors and Bookeeper in this point to wch we referr. Wee thinke it very fitt that you send home by the Abigaile 60000 waight of Sassafras, in regard she is to bring it fraight free, what shalbe made thereof assure yorselues, shall according to or promise be returned in Armes, and Munition, or otherwise expended in fortifica?on, as yorselues shall desire: But we pray you in no sort to rely vppon that for the pay- ment of Capt Each in any part, much lesse in whole, in regard the price is so base, and the glutt so great, that it will not sell but at very long time, and that for very litle. There haue been many Peti?ons putt vp vnto vs of greevances, for wrong? by vniust factors and ?tners in Virginia, and of claymes to land?, and good?, by the late death of frend?: all wch together wth or desires vndr them: we haue ordered to be sent you, and very earnestly request you, to see that iustice be fully and speedily ?formed, and an accompt of all yor proceeding? endorsed vppon the back? of the Peti?ons wth all conveniencie returned; that by the relief of the oppressed and helpinge of the poore and needy, you may gaine favor both wth God and men. The Adventurers of Martins hundred, haue now sett forth a verie charge- able supply of people [27] for the reposessing of theire Plantation: the thing is very pretious to vs, that vndrstand the seasonablenes of it, and see what an advantage of reputation the whole bussines of the Plantation hath receaved by theire good example of courage and constancie, wch is more remarkable by the abundance of difficulties they haue overpast: we canot but herein acknowledge a singular obligation of orselues, and all that loue the Plantation, vnto them; wch if you do we desire you to expresse it, by the furthering and assisting theire people and affaires, wth all the favor and help, that you possibly may. And as this great body, so likewise we think it or duty to recommend vnto you, all the ?ticuler Planters that now come over; desiring you that the abundance of yor loves and cares, may be to the setling and disposing of them, as much as may be to theire content; but certainly to theire safety and welfare. These are the thing? that we haue thought good to remember thus vnto you, and for discharge of or duty to require at yor hand?: The manteyning of the Plantation by yor courage, and the providing for the plenty of it by yor industrie, by yor wisdome, and by this prsent worke of the fforte to secure yorselues from enemies, and from the famine and nakednes by a iust retribution of profitt to yor frend?: that you be carefull of the publique Revenues, wthout wch yor private cannot long flourish; and that you do iustice and right, as you desire to receaue it; that wth loue and care you entertaine them that come vnto you wth expecta?on thereof: and now lastly that you cary vpright and sinceare mynd?, and go on forward wth constancie in good, and patience in evill: So shall no doubt God? blessing be vppon you to the prosperity of all yor enterprises, and the rewarding of yor desert?. Given in a great and generall Court held for Virginia the 7th of October 1622. And ordered to be signed by the Deputy and wittnessed by the Secretary in the name of the Company.

The Secretarie &amp; his wife are also gone: who came hether so late, that they were in greate likelihood to have been left behynd. ffor boisterous Captain Each would not have stayed for anie. But whereas at yor desire, &amp; in manner by yu directed, I had caused two Quarters of Seed wheat, in chaffe, &amp; eares, to be provided &amp; packed up in 8 Barrells bored with holes for that purpose; &amp; whereas yu had written that the Captain should call for them: he was so farr from that, that no entreatie could prevaile to get him to take in anie one of the Barrells; neither yet anie thing else in Barrells here provided for my brother George. Only a Rundlet of Sack sent to him from my wife, wth som other things of small bulk; &amp; a Seller of glasses wth hote waters sent to him from my Ladie Aucher, he yielded to take in. So that we pray yu very earnestly to take sure order by yor Seaflower (to wch Captain Each put us over, as beeing to foloe him immediately;) that at their coming to the Downes these things here may be called for. ffor it is pittie they should be kept from them &amp; thence, to whom &amp; whether great want would make them so wellcome. Though my house §have§ beein full in a manner all this last week, wth my Ladie Wyatt &amp; hir train, &amp; other frends going to Virginia: yet have I not neglected, (as far as the manners &amp; regards of hospitalitie would permitt me,) to perform my Duetie toward Virginia in generall, &amp; toward Southampton &amp; Martins Hundred in particular, as farr as my advice, requests, &amp; persuasions, by woord, &amp; writing, may prevaile. Amongst other of my letters, I have caused a copie to be taken of two, (wch herewth I send yu) because they may be of som use to the Companie, if those points hereafter shall com in debate. The Copie of yor remem- brances (wch were exceeding good,) I sent &amp; commended wth great earnest- nes to my brother George: having set som marks of them wch I thought most necessarie. I commended also yor pains in them to the Governor. But the Companies letters I only saw. They beeing shewed me to late to read them. My poore wife groweth still worse &amp; weaker, beeing wasted wth the often fitts of hir tormenting pains. I dare not venter her up, wthout continuall attendance of hir Peysitian: For whom I have now sent. So that this week, if God send life yu may expect us. I would my L. Treasuror might knowe, wth what disease to my self I com hasten up, to obey his pleasure. ffor I come up in the tyme of receiving my Rents, &amp; before I can get them. I leve a multitude of woorkmen in all parts of my dir house, without oversight, account, or direction. my yonger sons I am in preparing to put out to schoole: but yet not doon. In sum I never took more pains in my life, nor never shall leve things in greater confusion. But the tor- ments &amp; danger of my wife, exceedeth all other grief. Yet seeing he summoneth me up so often &amp; so earnestly, I will hasten wthall speed possible. Yor last close of the desperate state of Virginia if I knew all, dooth trowble me exceedingly. I pray yu desire Mr Melling to write to me at large by my footman; that I may meditate in the way what coorses to take.

Document in British Museum, London. List of Records, No. 384. The manner howe to bringe in the Indians into subiection wthout makinge an vtter exterpation of them together wth the reasons. First By disablinge the mayne bodie of the Enemye from haueinge the Sinnewes of all expedi?ons. As namely by Corne and all manner of victualls of anye worth. This is to be acted two manner of wayes. ffirst by keepeinge them from settinge Corne at home and fishinge. Secondly by keepeinge them from their accus- tomed tradinge for Corne. For The first it is ?formed by haueinge some 200 Souldiers on foote, Conty- nuallie harrowinge and burneinge all their Townes in wynter, and spoileinge their weares. By this meanes or people seacurely may followe their worke. And yet not to be negligent in keepeinge watch. This first course I assure myselfe if they take it wthout the other, will make a tedious Warr. For The seacond there must provided some 10 Shallopps, that in May, June, Julye and August may scoure the Baye and keepe the Rivers yt are belonginge to Opichankanoe. By this ariseth two happie end? ffirst the assured takeinge of great purchases in skynnes and Prisoners. Seacondly in keepinge them from tradinge for Corne on the Easterne shore and from ye Southward from whence they haue fiue tymes more then they sett them selues. This Course being taken they haue noe meanes, but must yield to obedi- ence, or flye to borderinge Neighbors who neither will receiue them Nor indeede are able, for they haue but ground? Cleared for their owne use. At the North west end of his domynions the Monecans are their enymies, On the Norther most side the Patomecks and other nations are their enemyes. The keepinge of them from tradeinge wth the Easterne shore ?duceth two worthie effect? to or exceedinge profitt ffirst or assurance of Corne att all tymes. Seacondly the ventinge of much Cloth. ffor the Certentye of Corne it is best knowne to my selfe for yt by sendinge &amp; discoueringe those places, ffirst I haue not onely reaped the benefitt, but all the whole Collonye since; whoe had perished had it not bene dis- couered before Sr George Yardley came in by my Aunchient Thomas Savage &amp; servant?, besides necessitie hath made those Savages more industrious then any other Indians in or Baye, wch followeth to appeare in this seacond ?fitt. My Aunchiant &amp; seruant? haue seene in trade at one tyme 40 greate Canowes laden wth these co?odities. ffor the assured ventinge of Cloth it followeth Consequently two wayes. ffirst by Varringe them of trade for skinns they haueinge none them selues. Seacondly by the necessite of haueinge clothinge wch by vs shall &amp; may be tendered att all Convenyent tymes. Reasons why it is not fittinge vtterlye to make an exterpation of the Sauages yett. p. 459d My reasons are grounded two foulde. ffirst vppon holy writt and my owne experi- ence. Seacondly other necessarie vses and ?fitte that maye retorne by the same. Holy writt sayeth That god would not yt the Children of Israell though they were of farr greater numbrs, then wee are yet in many ages like to be, and came into a Countrie where weare walled townes, not to vtterly dis- troy the heathen, least the wood? and wilde beast? should ouer runn them My owne observa?on hath bene such as assureth me yt if the Indians inhabitt not amongst vs vnder obedience And as they haue ever kept downe ye wood? and slayne the wolues, beares, and other beast?, (wch are in greate numbr) we shalbe more opressed in short tyme by their absence, then in their liueing by vs both for or owne securitie as allso for or Cattle. Seacondly when as by ye meanes before spoken of, they shalbe brought into subiection and shalbe made to deliuer hostriges for theire obediance, there is no doubt by gods grace but of the saueinge of many of their soules And then beinge natiues are apter for worke then yet or English are, knowinge howe to attayne greate quantitie of silke, hempe, and flax, and most exquisite in the dressinge thereof ffor or vses fitt for guides vppon discou9ye into other Countries adiacent to ours, fitt to rowe in Gallies &amp; friggetts and many other pregnant vses too tedious to sett downe. They by experi- ence willing and able are to worke in the heate of ye day wch or sexe are not. Nowe for avoydinge future daynger in or Collonye that may growe Two especiall ere- vocable lawes are to be made vppon seaueare penallties. ffirst yt none of what ranke soeuer doe euer trinke or trade wth in the late prcinct of Opichankanoe nor any borderinge neighbors that ayded him in this last disaster. Seacondly for or owne people to sett &amp; sowe a sufficient propor?on of corne for their owne vses, and yearely to lay vpp into a granary a ?por?on for wch if they haue noe vse for them selues the next yeare then to be sould and euery man to haue his dewe payd him. My reason for the first is yt by this meanes the Savages shalbe frustrated of all meanes of buyinge any manner of victualls, and clothinge, but what they shall haue from vs for their labor and industrie As alsoe beinge dis- abled from hireinge anye Auxiliaries if at any tyme they would rebell. The infinate trade they have had in this 4 years of securitie enabled Opichan- kanoe to hyer many auxiliaries wch in former tymes I knowe for want thereof Pohatan was neuer able to act the like. ffor the seacond howe benifitiall the settinge and sowinge of Corne and layinge vpp thereof for store, will luculently appeare by their nowe en- dureinge want being disturbed by theis Savages at this tyme, And likewise other vnexpected accedent? may happen both by forrayne and domesticke enymies hereafter. Two Storehowses or Granaries to be erected and placed for this purpose fittest for salftie, and then for Convenience wch I will leaue to demonstrate to yor [honor] vntill you Come to the Mapp of the Countrie As alsoe a neare passage to the Southward Riuer and where the most necessarie places are for fortifica?on against a forren Enemye. fo. 460.

      <field name="fulltext">CCLXXIII. John Martin. How Virginia may be made a Royal Plantation December 15, 1622 Additional Manuscripts, 12496, fos. 456–457. (Casear Papers.) Document in British Museum, London. List of Records, No. 385. The manner howe Virginia if his Matie and his Counsell &amp; Company agree may be made a Royall plantation for gods glory his Maties and Royall progenyes euer happines and the Companies exceedinge good, &amp; all this land shall receiue dalye profitt thereby. That parte of Virginia wthin wch wee are seated and fitt to be settled on for many hundred yeares: Is wthin the Territories of Opich?kano, it lyeth on the west side of Chesepiocks baye, whoe Co?aundeth from the Souther- most parte of the first Riuer, to the Southermost parte of the fourth Riuer called Patomeck wch lyeth North-next hand to or Riuer so?e 50 leages in latitude, In longitude it extendeth to ye Monakins Countrie next hand west and west and by North of equall length wth the latytude: his owne princi- pall seate is in ye seacond Riuer called Pamiunkey in the harte of his owne inhabited territories. This revolted Indian Kinge in his square Co- ?aundeth 32 Kingdoms vndr him. Euerye Kingdome Contayneinge the quantitie of one of or sheires here in England. Eauerie such Kingdome hath one especiall towne seated vppon one of the three greate Riuers wth sufficiencie of cleared ground fitt for the plough &amp; brauely accomodated for fishinge, These three Riuers navigable and fitt to Intertayne greate shippinge Soe is the fourth. Nowe if it shall please his highnes the Counsell and Companie at once so to ordr that so many sheires in England may send ouer 100 men a peece to posesse theise 32 sheires as Servant? unto them furnished out by them and liue vndr the Co?aund of some Noble Generall fitt for so Royall a planta?on. Theis Sheires may in one yeare wth god? blessinge haue there principall stock back agayne, and some advantage to supplie more vnto them and euer after subsist of them selues, and yearely send ouer good store of Co?odities to increase their seuerall sheires wth fresh supplies and much gayne. And they neuer at further Charge. Euerie Servant soe goeinge ouer at their Tearme ended to be as tennant? Coppiehouldrs or freehuldrs as shalbe made in their agreemt? when they goe ouer. Eauerie Sheire in England to make Choise of some worthie gentleman that his Matie may thinke fitt and the Companie allowe of to be a Deputie Leiftennant to gouerne these people in their seuerall Sheires. Those Deputie Leifte?ant? to haue other sufficient men vndr them fitt to be Justices of peace there and other Officers vnder them as here in England. Euerie Sheire to take notise yt they send so many men as may furnish a Blo?arie for the makeinge of Iron, Tanners for the tannyng of leather Shippuright? and weauers the rest husbandmen and all other trades they can fitt, for in all the Countrie they shall haue Iron Ore &amp; all acco?adats for yt buysnes And for Tanners skynnes &amp; hids to tann sufficient, and all thing? fittinge their trade there, as barke, lyme, and fitting tymbr in all places for fatt? and other vses. One furnas to be built at the generall Charge of the Countrie &amp; Companie here for the castinge of Ordenance, pott?, and other necessaries wth a lawe to be made yt none be carried out of the Countrie ?land? vppon payne of death and Confisca?on of Shippe and good? wthout expresse warrant from hir Matie or Successors. fo. 456d Thus those seuerall townes yet not posessed beinge seised on at once, and this gouermt established before spoken of, This parte of his Maties dominions there will quickly furnish this land of England wth good store of Iron Shippinge and infinite other Co?odities discouered and yet vndiscouered. Shipps to be built there and their bulkes fylled wth seuerall co?odities and sent ouer here to be sould, thereby there will redound an vnspeakable Co?oditie, the passage from thence beinge so short. His Maties Customs beinge there taken, and gathered in before they be dis?ced into shipps that vsually alreadie carrie or Co?odities for the Strayt? Spayne Newfoundland and other places, Can not in verie fewe yeares be lesse worth then 40000?i sterlinge yearley, reckoninge it after the propor?on may nowe be wth willingnes yeilded &amp; payd by the Inhabitant? nowe dwellinge alreadie there. All voluntaries yt will goe ouer vppon their owne Charges wth Co?ission from the Company to be equallie devided into theis seuerall sheires, and their land there to be alloted them by ordr from the Deputie or Generall to the Deputie leiftennant? of euery Sheire. Thus this parte of the Countrie beinge possessed, it will not onely quite frustrate and disable the Indians or enymies euer to subsist of them selues, but force them to haue their dependancie vppon vs, for foode &amp; Clothinge wch their industrie will well acquite to the whole Kingdome in short space And all other borderlie Kingdomes seinge their villanyes and trecheries so rewarded wilbe euer affrayde to enterprise the like against or nation when it shall so increase that they must stretch further ther possessions and territories. [17 lines blank] Now it resteth how if it pleaseth God yt this manner of plantation be thus setled to demonstrate an honble or Noble person that shalbe appointed Deputie or Generall may be Noblye trasported and there brauely seated wthout his owne charge or the charge of the Companye. [457] First to have appointed him by his Maties Counsell and Companie two seates the first in Opichankanos Island in Pamaunkey river, beinge in the parte of the most of the 32 Sheires. The seacond at Okanahone Riuer, where would be fitter to be a planta?on for many reasons I can alledge, then on the Easterne shore as they nowe are planted. His Matie to be gratiously pleased to authorize this honble ?son chosen to be Deputie or Generall to knight as the Deputie of Ireland doth. Then theis Deputies Leiftennant? to be knighted and the benefitt to redound to the Deputie or Generall, and all other yt shalbe thought worthie. An order to be sett downe wch I knowe yt all the Inhabitant? allreadie wilbe willinge to Condiscend vnto, that euerye sheire shall send vnto the Depu- tie or Generall att such tyme as he shall sett his Corne, weede the same, and gather it in tenn men for three dayes. This will turne to Infinite benefitt vnto him and noe damage to the Sheires. Jh? Martin. [Indorsed.] 15 Dec?b. 1622. The manner howe to make a Royall Planta- tion it seemeth not improbable.</field>
