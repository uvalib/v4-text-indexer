      <field name="fulltext">Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1934-35. AN ANNUAL stock-taking in archival work during this era of rapid change gives pause for reflection. Expansion and planning, with wide variation in the modification of each by the other, may be said to characterize these recent years. The sudden expansion of research activity in the social sciences and related fields, quickened by the World War debacle, created a heavy demand for the necessary raw materials. Since economic and social planning were the crux of the new viewpoint in research, scholars called for every kind of published or unpublished material bearing upon human relationships, and those librarians in closer contact with this research took up the challenge to accomplish the impossible. Their eager acceptance of this fresh opportunity for growth echoed that expansionism so characteristic in many another channel of American development. Our highly prized individualism (paradoxically enough, considering the ultimate purpose of the new movement) had found a new means of asserting itself. For a decade the promoters and builders in these broadening fields of scholarship indulged themselves in the thrill of unlimited acquisition of research materials, and tempted others who could neither keep the pace nor afford to ignore it. Planned, co-operative collecting of such materials, except on paper for future application, was futile while the market was bullish and speculative dreams of all inclusive libraries were still soaring. During these feverish years the Social Science Research Council was studying the problem and pointing the way through its Committee on Materials for Research, from both a national and a regional point of view; and when the Public Documents Committee of the American Library Association took over this work of the Council, the rude awakening had come and the necessity for economy and retrenchment made co-operative planning easier.1 1. Cf. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1933-34 (University, Va., 1934), page 1. The large attendance and stimulating discussions at the annual sessions of this A. L. A. Committee bespeak the genuine interest in the planned collection and distribution of research materials and reveal, a meeting of minds with fine co-operative spirit. The state document center plan, which assures the preservation of all the documents of a State in at least one library within its boundaries; and the dispersion of duplicates through the H. W. Wilson clearing house to other states have, by their success, encouraged further development in related fields.2 2. Cf. "Board and Committee Reports," in American Library Association, Bulletin, June, 1935, page 373. Recognition of the research value of the materials issued by the New Deal agencies, much of it in near-print form, has led to discussion of the means of preservation and to bringing pressure to bear in Washington so that sufficient copies are available for libraries. Of special significance are the methods of reproduction of research materials, destined, perhaps, to revolutionize much of our library technique; the photographing of current newspapers on motion-picture film by the Eastman Company being one of the most recent developments. Through the meetings of the Association of Research Libraries, and of the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association, problems more directly concerned with semi-public and official manuscript collections are dealt with, whereby the program and work in Virginia, for example, can be visualized with a degree of national perspective.3 3. On the Conference of Archivists and State Historical Societies in Washington, D. C., Dec., 1934, see American Historical Review, vol. XL, no. 3 (April, 1935), page 432. The field of manuscript collecting will doubtless always retain much of its individualistic character and the interests of scholarship will be best promoted by agreement among the active agencies in a particular area upon a positive policy of preservation and of cooperation in rendering the material accessible in the original or by reproduction. Decentralization of material is less serious today with our highly developed transportation facilities and cheap methods of copying. Thus in the South, the appearance of new state or local agencies, where a few years ago only three or four existed, is evidence of a growing appreciation of manuscript (and other) source material, and should be encouraged, in view of the magnitude of the field. Experience in Virginia has shown that devotion to the State and to the University has moved many a Virginian to place in safe-keeping in the University Library family papers which he would refuse to relinquish to any institution outside the State. During the past year the Maryland archives building has been completed on the campus of St. John's College, Annapolis, and plans for the collection of original historical materials are under way at Louisiana State University. In Washington, D. C., the opening of the new United States Archives Building, with Dr. R. D. W. Connor as Archivist, is an event of far-reaching significance. When the opportunity presented itself during the past winter of accelerating the inventory of Virginia county archives, by means of United States Government funds under the FERA, a project was submitted and granted for such work in certain Tidewater counties, subject to the approval of the local relief offices. After considerable delay, workers were employed in Charles City, Hanover, and York, the last named under supervision of the National Monument Commission at Yorktown. Satisfactory results were obtained, aided by mimeographed form-sheets listing the various kinds of record-books to be found and thus guiding the worker. Some additional data on church records and historic sites and buildings were gathered during the remaining time; and in Hanover County, a friend with artistic talent accompanied one of the relief workers and made miniature drawings of the historic buildings located on a large outline map of the county. During the past summer an inventory of the Culpeper County records was made by Mr. W. Edwin Hemphill, acting archivist. To this extent, then, the routine work in the counties has advanced, though retarded considerably the past three years by other archival duties.4 4. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 2-3. The completion of the bibliography of Virginia newspapers since 1820 for publication affords occasion for some observations on the nature, extent, and distribution of this material. In addition to historical notes on each paper and on many of the editors, and an introduction sketching a century of Virginia journalism, the bibliography lists the holdings of these newspapers in editors' and publishers' offices throughout the State, in some fifty Virginia libraries, and in thirty research libraries in other states. In checking the files of current weekly papers it was found that only a few were being preserved in any library; that many college or public libraries kept only a file of one daily paper from Richmond or the nearest city; that the facilities of the State Library and the University Library were inadequate for keeping files of all current papers, besides those of years ago. Therefore the archivist, as chairman of the Virginia Library Association's Committee on Co-operation worked out a plan of allocating to each local library one or two local weeklies, with the request that a file be kept as a permanent record. While there are several obvious weaknesses in this scheme, including lack of space and uncertainty of continuity, the consent of 50 per cent of the librarians, some of whom welcomed the idea, means an appreciable addition of original local material. The State and the University Library have assumed responsibility for preserving the more important dailies and weeklies and are avoiding needless duplication. The newspaper collection in the University Library has grown steadily along lines indicated in last year's report,5 5. Fourth Annual Report, pages 3-4. the largest additions being for the period since ca. 1875. All sections of the State are represented, some of the best files donated by the editors, as, for example, the Warsaw Northern Neck News and the Pearisburg Virginian, both covering fifty years or more. Also worthy of mention are the Shenandoah Valley of New Market, Crawford's Weekly of Norton, and a bound set of The Old Commonwealth of Harrisonburg,6 6. A bound file of the National Intelligencer, Washington, D. C., for the ante bellum period has also been acquired. besides countless other scattered issues of many a paper long since forgotten. From Fredericksburg come twenty volumes of the ledgers and day-books of the Free Lance-Star, 1882-1916. The aim of the library to make all acquisitions accessible without delay has been realized through student assistants paid from FERA funds and ably directed by Mr. John B. May of the Library staff. A generation ago, when the collection of old newspapers was carried on largely by northern libraries, their interest scarcely extended beyond 1865. The indelible impression wrought by the Civil War upon the entire country turned the attention of scholars toward research on the ante bellum period and the quest for materials on the Old South. Thus many a Virginia newspaper file, offered for sale, augmented the collection in some well established library in the North. The never failing appeal of the war placed a special value on Confederate imprints which these same institutions were best able to purchase. Moreover, some of the southern papers carried off by Federal soldiers as souvenirs eventually found their way to these repositories. Nevertheless, the activity of southern libraries in recent years, with the advantage of proximity and personal contacts, has served to improve their position to such a degree that research on the South can no longer be done without prolonged work in their collections. For research on the period since 1865 the available newspapers are to be found mostly in the South. That Northern libraries and historical societies never collected so consistently for the years of reconstruction and later in the South, is doubtless to be explained by the difficulties of housing steadily increasing accumulations from all sections of the country, as well as by lack of interest in more recent papers. Research on Virginia subjects since 1865 can be carried on adequately only by using these sources in the Virginia State Library and the University Library, supplemented by files or scattered issues in local Virginia libraries or publishers' offices. Yet, the combined holdings of Virginia papers throughout the United States disclose a meager representation of the Republican press, of Negro and labor organs, and of the German press of Richmond, even allowing for the limited number produced. It is an interesting commentary on the vagaries of newspaper collecting that the best file of the Richmond Planet, oldest Negro paper of Virginia, is in the Harvard College Library. Well known by reputation and through their printed lists and bibliographies are the newspaper collections in the American Antiquarian Society, Duke University, the Library of Congress, New York Public Library, and Wisconsin State Historical Society, all of which include important Virginia files. Deserving of special mention are the Virginia papers (many of them rare issues) in the Connecticut State Library, Henry E. Huntington Library, McCormick Historical Society, Massachusetts Historical Society, New York Historical Society, University of North Carolina, University of Texas, and Western Reserve Historical Society. A number of the smaller Virginia libraries contain valuable collections, hitherto almost unknown, of papers from the locality dating back a century or more, notably the College of William and Mary, Washington and Lee University, and the public libraries of Fredericksburg, Norfolk, Petersburg, and Lynchburg. In the county clerk's offices in Charlotte, Lexington, and Staunton, and in the Alexandria city manager's office are preserved bound files of the leading weeklies covering a half century or more. The element of chance, however, plays so dominant a rôle in the survival of historical materials that complete files for long periods are lacking of such influential papers as the Abingdon Virginian, Charlottesville Jeffersonian Republican, Harrisonburg Rockingham Register, Lynchburg Republican, Petersburg Intelligencer, and Warrenton Virginian. In the Virginia Room of the University Library the ever expanding manuscript and printed materials have been rendered more useable, in spite of congested conditions, by the intelligent planning and painstaking labors of the curator, Mr. John Cook Wyllie. The General John D. Imboden Papers, 1831-95, presented to the University, are important for their legal and economic data covering this widely known Virginian's law practice in Staunton in ante bellum days, some war correspondence, and his untiring efforts to attract outside capital to the State and to develop the resources and projected railroads of southwestern Virginia. His talent for improved mechanical devices, some of which were patented, is shown in numerous plans and drawings among his papers. From Augusta County come miscellaneous deeds and other legal documents of the Smiley Family and the account books of the Smiley Mill, 1808-1901 (incomplete), on Moffatt's Creek. The Twyman Papers of Albemarle County, consisting of letters and deeds, 17501911, treat of economic and social conditions especially during 1842-65, and include a few Civil War letters. From the old home on the Miller farm near Elkton, Rockingham County, was obtained an old ledger containing a register of Confederate soldiers who were lodged there during 1864-65. A fragmentary account of the business of the Orange Farmers' Co-operative is afforded in its record book, 1917-21. A Virginian's interest in the oil industry, chiefly in Texas and Oklahoma, 1920-33, appears in the typewritten reports of Thomas K. Harnsberger and in related pamphlets. The Elizabeth Oakes-Smith and Seba Smith collection of letters and other unpublished writings, ca. 1830-95, will be of interest to students of American literature and of social life in New York and New England during the Victorian age. The Library has received on deposit the Barbour Papers, 1760-1895, from the famous Barboursville Estate in Orange County. Most valuable are the manuscripts of James Barbour (1775-1842), statesman and diplomat. It is particularly appropriate that his papers should be preserved in the University Library where many of his brother's, Philip Pendleton Barbour's (1783-1841), are to be found in the Ambler Collection, previously acquired.7 7. Cf. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist, page 4. Political and economic problems during the transitional period of the 1820's and 1830's are discussed, among other topics, in these collections. The papers of James Barbour's son, B. Johnson Barbour, make up the balance of the manuscripts for the years after the former's death. From Campbell County the Saunders Papers, 1763-1905, were received on deposit, a large accumulation revealing economic and social conditions in southside Virginia through the Watts Family, 1781-89, in Prince Edward County and vicinity, and through the Watts and Saunders kinsfolk, 1800-60, with pertinent comments on contemporary politics. Numerous Confederate vouchers for supplies, muster rolls of Virginia Volunteers, and war letters are in the collection, as well as family letters from the latter decades of the century. The consent of the Madison County court was obtained for the preservation in the Library of several merchandise firms' account books, on indefinite loan, thus continuing the policy promoted successfully in a few other counties.8 8. Third Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1932-33 (University, Va., 1933), page 2; Fourth Annual Report, page 3. The Leica camera purchased last year has become indispensable for copying material that can be borrowed for only a limited time. By this means the Library has added letters of Francis Walker Gilmer and his brother Peachy Ridgway Gilmer, Peachy's autobiography, 182326, and his sketch of Francis. The Journals of John Goss, Baptist minister from Albemarle County, tell of his successive journeys to Williamsburg, Georgia, and Kentucky, 1800-07, in three pocket notebooks. The Diary of J. Plummer Taliaferro of Orange County, 183839, was photographed because he described student life in the University of Virginia. He kept his diary in a ledger-like book in which the minutes of the Philomathean Society of Winchester (Va.) had been recorded, 1830-35. The Civil War letters of John B. Webb, Wisconsin soldier, written during 1861-64, from Virginia to his brother and sister in La Crosse, Wis., were loaned by the State Teachers College in that city through the kindness of Professor A. H. Sanford. A set of church historical sketches in manuscript, written ca. 1883 at the request of the West Hanover Presbytery of Virginia and forgotten for a half century, were also copied. Photostatic copies of the Executive Journals of the Council of Colonial Virginia, 1752-76, were acquired from the Public Record Office in London,9 9. Beginning at the point where the Virginia Historical Society's set of photostats ends, these copies complete this series. at the suggestion of Professor T. P. Abernethy. Among the more important printed materials added during the year are speeches on the Readjuster movement, and pamphlets and newspapers on Virginia Populism from the collection of Charles H. Pierson who was prominent in the movement. A copy of W. DuBose Sheldon's unpublished thesis (1934) written at Princeton on this subject and based upon this material was presented by the author to the University of Virginia. Files of mimeographed periodicals from the Civilian Conservation Corps camps in Albemarle and Montgomery counties are being preserved as local evidence concerning the New Deal. An interesting set of photographs (copies) of early Roanoke, including old buildings, street scenes, groups of citizens, and the mayors since 1883, was obtained through a local photographer who had borrowed the originals from the families of old residents. The collecting of duplicate copies of Virginia Acts from the county clerks' offices for exchange purposes10 10. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist, page 6. has been encouraged by the rapid growth of the University's Bureau of Public Administration and the plans of the director, Mr. Raymond Uhl, for consistent expansion in the field of state as well as municipal documents. The Library has continued its program of putting into use many of its duplicate volumes on history, literature, travel, etc., by offering them to other libraries, especially in Virginia, for the cost of transportation. A grant from the University's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences released the archivist from his duties during the past summer to carry on independent historical research, and made possible the appointment of Mr. W. Edwin Hemphill as acting archivist. Upon him fell the burden of necessary revisions and final checking and indexing of the newspaper bibliography. He has also prepared the appendix to the present Annual Report, supplementing the one of last year and serving as a guide to another group of important Virginia historical sources. The fine caliber of Mr. Hemphill's work in every respect is highly commendable. An annual word of thanks to the staffs of the University Library and the Research Institute for their cordial assistance is, at best, only a meager expression of appreciation; and to Mr. Harry Clemons, Librarian, and Dr. Wilson Gee, Director of the Institute, the archivist is especially indebted for their counsel and encouragement.

      <field name="fulltext">Appendix. by W. Edwin Hemphill PARISH RECORDS OF THE DIOCESES OF SOUTHERN VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA, 1648-1900 A list of the parish records in the Diocese of Virginia was published as an appendix to the Archivist's Fourth Annual Report (1934). The presentation of the following data completes for the entire state this survey of original Episcopal church records. The Diocese of Southern Virginia includes the two Eastern Shore counties (Accomac and Northampton), the four peninsular counties (York, Elizabeth City, Warwick, and James City), and the area south of the James River as far west as Appomattox, Charlotte, and Pittsylvania counties. The Diocese of Southwestern Virginia is composed of Highland, Augusta, Nelson, Amherst, Campbell, Franklin, Henry, and the counties to the south and west of them. A map of each diocese is reprinted herewith. All of this territory, originally within the Diocese of Virginia, became in 1892 the Diocese of Southern Virginia, from which the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia was cut off in 1919. Their offices have no "general" historical materials comparable to those which were listed last year. However, it should be stated that all of them written prior to 1892 are concerned with the history of the church throughout the state. Moreover, Miss Mary F. Goodwin, Historiographer of the Diocese of Southern Virginia, hopes to complete during the coming winter a report upon the parish lines within its area, which will be photostated by the Virginia State Library. This inventory of extant records was compiled largely from questionnaires addressed to the rectors; unfortunately it is, to a limited extent, incomplete, for a few clergymen did not reply. The records, with the exception of those printed (titles in italics or within quotation marks), are in manuscript or typescript. Every record is to be found in the individual parish unless its location is otherwise stated or indicated by one of the following symbols: r Offices of the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia, St. John's Parish House, Roanoke. u University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville. v Virginia State Library, Richmond. A date followed by a plus sign (+) indicates that the particular volume covers the period from that year to the present and is still continuing. As used below the word "Records" means a combination of Register and Vestry minutes. The results of this survey give further proof of the Archivist's observation of last year that many parish records of even the nineteenth century have been lost. The questionnaires, however, have served as reminders of the historical value of these materials, and the Historiographer of the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia, Rev. Devall L. Gwathmey, D.D., has recently called attention to the need for their safe preservation (cf. Diocese of Southwestern Virginia, Journal of the Sixteenth Annual Council . . . 1935, pp. 101-102). For their interest and cooperation in supplying the following data grateful acknowledgments are hereby made to the Rt. Rev. Arthur C. Thomson, Bishop of Southern Virginia, to the Rt. Rev. R. C. Jett, Bishop of Southwestern Virginia, to Mr. Thomas A. Scott, Secretary of the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia, to Miss Goodwin, to Mr. Wilmer L. Hall, State Librarian, and to the clergymen of each diocese. DIOCESE OF SOUTHERN VIRGINIA Accomac County 1. Accomac Parish: Holy Trinity church, Onancock. Register, 1897+. 2.
