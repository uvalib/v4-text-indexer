      <field name="fulltext">Second Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1931-32 THE survey and collection of manuscript materials in Virginia, now completing the second year of work, have followed the general method of procedure outlined in the first discussion of the project,1 1. First Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-31 (University, Va., 1931), pages 12-14. and the list of new counties to be covered, as indicated on the map published in last year's report,2 2. Ibid., page 3. has varied only slightly in the actual execution of the program. By geographic divisions, the following counties have been surveyed during the year: In Tidewater—Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Stafford, and York. In the Piedmont—Goochland and Orange. In the Valley—Augusta and Botetourt. In Southwestern Virginia—Washington. Isle of Wight County was substituted for Surry because of personal connections which facilitated the work; Brunswick and Lancaster were omitted temporarily because of other duties, and will be included in the list for the coming year. The survey made thus far in county archives scattered throughout the State has netted a fair sample of the local official records and has demonstrated the value of contacts with interested people who have helped to give publicity to the project in areas remote from the University. The inventory of county records has brought to light much forgotten material, such as lists of free negroes, public school records, and vital statistics for the period 1853-70. The city archives of the Norfolk Corporation Court contain some interesting volumes on eighteenth century ships and cargoes arriving in port; and research in the Norfolk Council records is greatly simplified by the detailed name and subject index compiled by the clerk. The United States District Court (in Norfolk) for the Eastern District of Virginia has fragmentary records before 1865, while its papers of bankruptcy and admiralty cases are among the most valuable for recent years. In contrast to the listing of official records, which in the case of each political unit is a perfectly concrete task, the compiling of data on private and non-governmental organizations opens an almost limitless field, involving many miles of travel in the rural districts to track down the custodians of a wide variety of minute books, account books, and miscellaneous papers of churches, charitable societies, business houses, etc. It has been found, on the whole, that correspondence yields a meager return of information; yet, in the case of lodge records, the element of secrecy and the vast number of local chapters suggested the advisability of negotiating with them by letter sanctioned by the central officers. Accordingly, with the approval of the Grand Lodge, a brief questionnaire3 3. See Appendix to present report. was mailed (with stamped return envelope) to all locals of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The thirty per cent reply received indicated that this method may well be pursued with similar organizations. A follow-up questionnaire, practically identical with the first, was restricted to lodges antedating 1900, from whom no response had come. Data on the Masonic records are being compiled by the Grand Lodge of Virginia, whose Grand Secretary has offered to provide the University with a copy of his findings. Furthermore, the library of the Grand Lodge in Richmond, with its fireproof vault, has become a depository for manuscript records which will be included in the present inventory. Most church records are in the hands of the clerks or ministers of the individual churches scattered throughout the State, and the old registers and minute books have experienced the perennial hazards of neglect and destruction in passing from one generation to another. In comparing the number of original records before 1900 preserved by the four largest denominations in Virginia (Baptist, Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Protestant Episcopal), it is interesting to note that the Methodist has hitherto ranked lowest proportionally as well as in absolute numbers. This striking paucity of source material prompted the archivist to urge certain officials to call the attention of the Virginia Conference to the matter,4 4. First Annual Report of the Archivist, page 7. with the result that that body, at its annual session in October, 1931, authorized the creation of a Methodist Historical Society. When its organization is completed, it will provide a depository for all non-current Methodist records in the area of this conference, and will take steps to collect such records. Meanwhile, the committee has approved of the archivist's suggestion that the district conferences name local depositories for the temporary safe-keeping of their books, and, as a first step, the Charlottesville District Conference, in May, 1932, accepted the invitation to place its records on file in the library of the University of Virginia. It is hoped that, within the coming year, both the Baltimore and the Holston Conference which include large areas in Virginia, will follow the lead of the Virginia Conference along this line. The other three denominations mentioned above have their own archives in Richmond, and during the past year all their manuscripts were listed for inclusion in the inventory. Most notable is the collection of original church and association minute books in the Virginia Baptist Historical Society5 5. Dr. Garnett Ryland, Secretary, University of Richmond. The Society's Collection is housed in the University of Richmond Library. which also has an excellent file of pamphlets and printed annual reports. The Virginia Diocesan Library of the Episcopal Church6 6. Dr. G. MacLaren Brydon, Secretary, 110 W. Franklin St. has recently collected some manuscript books and papers of the early church and clergy, but most of the extant parish registers and vestry books are on deposit in the Archives Department of the Virginia State Library. At Union Theological Seminary7 7. H. M. Brimm, Librarian. the Presbyterian Church has a valuable collection of session minutes, church registers, and minute books of Virginia presbyteries, in process of being catalogued, and it is hoped that the Seminary library will be increasingly recognized as the proper depository for Virginia Presbyterian records. The inventory of newspaper files throughout the State,8 8. First Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 4-5. including those in editors' offices, will very probably be completed during the coming year, and, if funds are available, this material may well be published as Part I of the proposed Guide to historical sources in Virginia. A second questionnaire to those editors who had not responded to the first, raised the percentage of replies from 30 to 40; the remainder are being obtained by personal interview. The value of the list is enhanced by a number of files discovered in private hands, some of which have been transferred to the University of Virginia. The information as compiled will include, as far as possible, the names of the editors, dates of establishment, consolidation, and discontinuance, and frequency of issue. The collection of manuscripts for the University library, carried on in conjunction with the survey, is a long-time task, the returns of which are cumulative. The increasing advantage of making the work known throughout the State cannot be over-estimated. Several individuals, because of their genuine interest in historical matters, have been most generous with their time and have opened the way to manuscript collections to which the archivist could have gained access in no other manner. To further the publicity of the work, an article by the archivist on "The Making and Preserving of Virginia History" was published9 9. In the University of Virginia News Letter, vol. VIII, no. 14 (April 15, 1932). and widely circulated. It was a popular presentation of the origin, preservation, and loss of historical records, and the present project of the University. Subsequent editorial comments and letters from individuals have indicated a real appreciation of the need for the work. Among the most valuable collections placed on deposit in the University library during 1931-32 are the Anderson Papers from Lexington, Virginia, dealing with politics, agriculture, iron, and other manufactures, 1785-1919; the Heth Papers of Mr. Charles R. Kennon, treating of the Richmond coal industry, politics, and social conditions, 1785-1870; the Tayloe Papers from "Mount Airy" (Richmond County), "Powhatan" (King George County), Washington, D. C., and Latin America, on national and local politics, diplomatic relations, agriculture, and general social conditions, 1756-1893. From "Powhatan", as a gift to the University, came also the library of the family begun over a century ago. A small collection of Tate Papers from Pittsylvania County throw light upon public education in Virginia during the third quarter of the nineteenth century; the Patterson Papers and the Early Papers are of general historical interest on the ante bellum period; from the Breckinridge Family came an interesting detailed discussion of administrative policies of the University, ca. 1827. Business records include account books of general stores in Fluvanna, Surry, and Pittsylvania counties; a grist mill in Augusta County; drug stores in Smithfield and Waynesboro; a lumber milling company in Danville; a flour mill in Staunton; and an old tobacco shipment record from the Rappahannock River (early 18th century). Unique among the gifts are eighteen letters from Thomas Jefferson to Gen. John Hartwell Cocke concerning the establishment of the University, 1813-1826, and Jefferson's specifications and drawings for the first buildings of the University, presented by a prominent alumnus, William Andrews Clark, Jr., of Los Angeles. Where unpublished historical sketches of families, churches, lodges, etc., have been found, copies have been obtained for the University library. The acquisition of ephemeral pamphlet material of all kinds as well as periodic reports of official and semi-public bodies have considerably augmented our collection of Virginiana. Likewise old maps and newspapers, mentioned above, have increased the library's facilities for research. The new counties in which the survey and collection of materials will be carried on next year are: In Tidewater—Gloucester, Lancaster, Surry, and Westmoreland. In the Piedmont—Amherst, Cumberland, and Fauquier. In Southside Virginia—Brunswick and Charlotte. In the Valley—Shenandoah. In Southwestern Virginia—Montgomery and Russell. In no county already visited, however, is the task really completed. Negotiations remaining open in almost every case add to the complexity of the project as a whole and reduce the time available for the work in new areas. The desire of the University to promote a cooperative spirit in the collection of manuscripts was emphasized when the present project began.10 10. First Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 6-7, 16. Preservation of historical materials is the primary need and this point has been stressed in presenting the subject to members of the Virginia Library Association at its meeting in October, 1931, and to countless individuals who may prefer to place their manuscripts in some depository other than the University. The cooperative idea has been demonstrated practically in the relations between the University and the National Monument Commission at Yorktown, the Virginia Baptist Historical Society, and the Union Theological Seminary; and the cordial reception which the archivist has enjoyed in visiting libraries throughout the State is evidence of interest on their part in this promotion of research. In order that its manuscripts may be available for use, the University library has provided facilities in its Virginia Room for their filing and cataloguing. For preservation is only the first step, to be followed as soon as possible by the repair and scientific arrangement of the manuscripts to insure accessibility for research. The excellent work of Miss Frances Harshbarger, curator of the University's collection, deserves unqualified praise. The archivist notes with great interest that a similar project for the survey and collection of manuscript sources was begun in western Pennsylvania in September, 1931, under the joint auspices of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and the University of Pittsburgh, with Dr. Solon J. Buck in charge; and that another for New York state has recently been sponsored by the New York Historical Association, to begin in July, 1932. Furthermore, an effort has been made by the Committee on Public Administration of the Social Science Research Council "during the last fifteen months to secure the cooperation of one or more libraries in each of the states, looking towards an intensified program of collection of public documents and related material."11 11. Social Science Research Council, Report on State Document Centres, Annual Convention of the American Library Association, New Orleans, April, 1932, page [ii]. Italics mine. It is hoped that this effort will lead to the preservation of manuscript sources as well as printed works in many of the States. In conclusion, the archivist desires to express his appreciation for the interest shown and the aid given by his associates among the faculty, in the University Library, and by citizens in all parts of the State, and especially to the University's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, without whose assistance the project could not have been continued. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist. 1 July, 1932.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix Questionnaire Sent to Local Lodges April 11, 1932. Dear Sir: The University of Virginia is making an inventory of original historical records throughout the State in order to find out to what extent they have been preserved. The purpose of this survey is to compile a detailed list of such records so that students and historical scholars can obtain information as to the location and accessibility of these materials for research work. Original minute books, account books, and other records of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows are valuable sources for the social history of Virginia, and therefore we are anxious to include them in our inventory. Mr. F. L. Flynn, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, has expressed his willingness to cooperate with us, and he is likewise interested in any information concerning the records of lodges in the State. The University desires to provide the Grand Lodge with a copy of the list which we are compiling. Will you, therefore, kindly answer the following questions and return this paper at your earliest convenience? 1. How many volumes of minute books of your lodge are in existence, and what are the inclusive dates covered by each volume? 2. What other original records of your lodge are in existence (such as account books, registers of members, etc.), and for what years? 3. Has any history of your lodge been written, published or unpublished, and when? 4. Are your records kept in a fireproof place? Thanking you for your cooperation, I am Very truly yours, Lester J. Cappon, Archivist.</field>
