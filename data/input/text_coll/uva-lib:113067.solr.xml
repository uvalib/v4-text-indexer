      <field name="fulltext">History and Introduction This is a practical age. All forces in the educational world are converging to the point of utilization. In the midst of this development there has been, until recent years, a decided lack of interest in self-expression, yet it would be hard to find a course of training that would be more practical and beneficial in the whole curriculum of the high school. The school boys and girls of today are the leaders of tomorrow, and there is no efficient leadership without the ability of self-expression. Every problem of moment is settled today by discussion, and the person who can submit his views in a well-rounded and pleasing manner can at least command the attention of any audience, if not convince it. Yet the phase of school work of oral expression, the natural ally of written English, has failed to grip the secondary schools of our country. Its importance has been minimized. In fact, there are a number of schools today which fail to value this phase of training of sufficient importance as to justify the organization of literary society work. Hence a great number of pupils are graduated from high schools who never had any of this training, the need of which is to be seen on every hand. So the Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies of the University of Virginia, being in a position to see the dire need of development of this phase of work as exhibited by the new men fresh from the secondary schools, and also realizing the importance of establishing such work for the maintenance of their own high standard of literary work, determined to work out a plan that would foster and encourage self-expression in all secondary schools. Consequently, the Virginia High School Literary League was organized by the societies in 1913. A bulletin was published which contained a question of current importance for debate and sufficient material so arranged as to enable a high-school pupil to write an intelligent argument on both sides of the question. Each year a similar bulletin is published with the same purpose in view. By the last of December in 1914, there were enrolled eighty schools as against forty in the preceding year of the same date—a remarkable increase in such a young movement. Each of these teams was pitted against another team in its own neighborhood, and the winner of this preliminary contest was booked for the final contest to be held at the University of Virginia in early spring. The question for said debate was: "Resolved. That women should be given the right to vote on the same basis as men." On the morning of April first forty high schools, each of which had already defeated some other school in its community, reported at the University of Virginia ready to debate. Each school was paired by lot with another school for the first preliminary debate, which began promptly at 2:30 o'clock. By the continuous processes of pairing off by lot and surviving by merit, the number of contesting schools on Friday morning was five. They were Roanoke, Lynchburg, Pulaski, Louisa and Portsmouth. And by a similar process the readers were reduced to four, which were New London Academy, Keysville, Chase City and Pleasant View. It was at the final contest on Friday night that excitement ran highest, when Portsmouth High School was pitted against Lynchburg High School in debate and New London Academy against Keysville High School in reading. The speeches and readings were rendered, the audience divided on probable results, until the chair announced the judges' decision, which pronounced Portsmouth High School winner in debate and Keysville High School winner in reading. The faculty and students of the University of Virginia put forth every effort to entertain the visitors while here. The visiting teachers were the guests of the Colonnade Club and Gleason Hotel, while the visiting teams were entertained by the girls and boys of Charlottesville and the students of the University of Virginia. Meals were served both at the Commons and at the Tea Room to visitors without cost. Free tickets were given the visitors to moving picture theatres; no charges for street car services and on Friday afternoon the Chamber of Commerce gave the visiting teams an axcursion to Monticello. After the final contest Friday night, a reception was given to the visitors at the Tea Room, which was artistically decorated for the occasion. During the course of the banquet members of the University faculty, representatives from the Washington and Jefferson Literary Societies, and visitors from various schools were called upon to speak. And thus the evening passed away most pleasantly. "By their fruits ye shall know them" bears quite a significant interpretation to the Virginia High School Literary League. The league's progress has been unrivalled. Besides increasing its membership very greatly and thus showing its direct accomplishments, there emanates from the movement a salutary spirit of encouragement of society work, not only in high schools, but in all public schools of Virginia. The league met with such public approval and grew so rapidly that after one year athletics were incorporated in it, thus becoming known as the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League. The work of the league for this year will include Debating, Reading, Baseball, Basketball and Track. Instead of there being just one medal given for the best girl or boy reader, as was the case last year, there will be given two medals, one to the best girl reader and one to the best boy reader. This eliminates the difficulty of boys contesting with girls. These two medals are given by the two Professors of English at the University of Virginia, in order to promote better reading in the high schools throughout Virginia. There has long been felt the need of stimulating interest in the practice in reading aloud. Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, Edgar Allan Poe Professor of the School of English in the University, offers the twenty-five-dollar gold medal to the girl winner in the public reading contest. It will be presented in the name of the Edgar Allan Poe School of English. Dr. Chas. W. Kent, Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Literature in the University of Virginia offers the twenty-five-dollar gold medal to the boy winner in the public reading contest. It will be presented in the name of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature. All athletic contests will be held under the supervision of the General Athletic Association of the University. The purpose of such contests is not only to encourage training in athletics, but also to standardize athletic requirements of all secondary schools throughout Virginia. It is earnestly hoped that every secondary school in Virginia, whether public or private, will affiliate with the league and extend its hearty support in this new field of work. We require no dues. We simply ask your undivided coöperation. We furnish the material in pamphlet form, but if you would like to have more material on the subject, the University faculty has kindly provided package libraries on the question for debate, which will be sent to any principal of a high school for two weeks without cost, save postage, by writing to Mr. John S. Patton, Librarian at the University of Virginia. Address all inquiries to Harry L. Carter, Secretary of Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League, University, Virginia. The Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies and The General Athletic Association.</field>

IV. It is not the purpose of the committee to prohibit the playing of any games a school may desire. Yet only games with other secondary schools within the same section will determine eligibility to the district contest. V. Each member of a team must be a bona fide regular student less than 21 years of age, at the beginning of the season and must have been in regular attendance at the school he represents for at least sixty days before the game in which he plays, and shall have made passing grades on a majority of his subjects in the monthly report issued last before the game.

Not later than May 3 the committee will arrange a schedule of preliminary games in each district in order to select two teams that shall contest for the cup offered by the General Athletic Association to the winner in each district. IX. It was not found feasible last year to play off the preliminary contests among the winners in each section, and so the contest for the State championship to be played at the University has been omitted, and instead a cup to the winner in each district will be awarded by the General Athletic Association. In addition to the central committee at the University, a district committee will be appointed in each district to coöperate with the central committee in arranging the schedules and supervising the contests. An admission fee of twenty-five cents should be charged at each elimination contest and at the final contest. The visiting team receiving 75 per cent of the receipts if played on the home grounds of one of the teams, or share equally if played on neutral grounds. The time and place for the elimination contests must be agreed upon within five days after teams have been paired, otherwise the district committee will decide them and each team must abide by the decision or forfeit the contest.

The second selection shall be chosen by the judges and not put in the hands of the contestant until five minutes before the time to read it, during which interval the contestants may study the selection if he so desires. In the selection which is chosen by the judges it is suggested that both contestants be allowed to read the same piece, but not in each other's presence. IV. If a school desires to take part in this contest the principal shall give the secretary notice of the same prior to the first of January. Upon receipt of such notice the secretary will pair this school with another school that they may hold a preliminary contest in public reading. The status and standards of the schools, their proximity, accessibility, and convenience of location will be considered in making the pairs. The secretary will be very glad if each principal will send a list of other schools with which he thinks such a contest desirable, and as far as possible the secretary will try to arrange a contest for him with one of the schools on this list. V. All preliminary contests in public reading must be held prior to the fifteenth of March. Otherwise the details of the preliminary contests are to be decided by the principals of the two contesting schools. VI. The school that wins in the preliminary contests is entitled to send its representatives to the University to compete in the final contests in Public Reading. VII. The final contests will be held at the University on April the twentieth and twenty-first. VIII. All competitors will be met at Union Station, Charlottesville, between 7 a. m. and 1 p. m. on Thursday, April twentieth, and will be entertained as the guests of the Literary Societies while at the University. IX. The winners of the final contests will be presented with gold medals. The Edgar Allan Poe School of English will present the girl winner a medal, while The Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature will present the medal to the boy winner. X. It is suggested that those schools which expect to participate in the debating contest as well as the public reading contest, should hold the contest in public reading with the same school with which their debate is held, and that both contests take place on the same occasion.

Resolved: That the Federal Government should cooperate with the States in constructing and maintaining post roads and rural delivery routes. The question as stated above will be debated in the preliminary contests between the schools, and also in the final contests which will be held at the University on the first and second of April. SUGGESTED ARGUMENTS. The arguments which are suggested below are not intended to be exhaustive, but merely to intimate certain broad issues involved in the question. FOR THE AFFIRMATIVE. I. Congress has the right under the Constitution to aid States in the building of good roads. II. Precedents for Federal aid. III. Federal aid will lighten farmers' burden. IV. Good roads will improve general health conditions. V. Good roads will revolutionize school system. VI. Federal assistance increases patriotic zeal. VII. The national government uses the roads, therefore it should help to maintain them. VIII. Federal aid will arouse interest among States in the building of good roads. IX. Aiding States in the construction of roads is a function of the national government. X. Good roads will foster development of waste land. FOR THE NEGATIVE. I. Federal aid—unconstitutional. II. Necessitates greater income for national treasury, thereby increasing tariff and customs tax. III. Method not adequate, because States will not exert same effort. IV. Not function of national government to assist in such measures. V. States receive benefit of roads, therefore should support and maintain same. VI. States are able to build roads. VII. An invasion of States' rights. VIII. Federal Government not able to look after roads over the country. IX. Benefits derived from Federal assistance not adequate to expense. X. Federal aid will tend to increase practice of log-rolling in Congress. MATERIAL FOR THE AFFIRMATIVE. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF FEDERAL AID FOR GOOD ROADS. By Representative Stephens of Mississippi. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 30, 1912. The Constitution says that Congress shall have the power to establish post offices and post roads. Under this authority post-office buildings have been erected at a cost of millions of dollars. Yet it is argued that we have no right under the Constitution to extend Federal aid in the construction of roads. The word "establish," when referring to post-office buildings, is held to mean that such houses can be erected, but when post offices are to be established it is contended that it means that the Government shall designate over what road the mail shall be carried, and that the Government has no right to build roads. I submit that, as the right to establish post offices and post roads is given in the same sentence, that as the language makes no distinction between the right in regard to offices and roads, this shows clearly that it is not intended by the framers of the Constitution that "establish" should be given one construction when referring to post offices and a different and more restricted construction when referring to post roads. That Congress has the right to extend aid in the matter of constructing and maintaining public highways is shown by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, from which I quote: Supreme Court Decision. Without authority in Congress to establish and maintain such highways and bridges, it would be without authority to regulate one of the most important adjuncts of commerce. This power in former times was exerted to a very limited extent, the Cumberland or National Road being the most notable instance. Its extension was but little called for, as commerce was then mostly conducted by water, and many of our statesmen entertained doubts as to the existence of the power to establish ways of communication by land. But since, in consequence of the expansion of the country, the multiplication of its products, and the invention of railroads and locomotion by steam, land transportation has so vastly increased, a sounder consideration of the subject has prevailed and led to the conclusion that Congress has plenary power over the whole subject. (California v. Pacific Railroad Co., 127 U. S. 1, le. 39.) Also: Congress has likewise the power, exercised early in this century by successive acts in the Cumberland or National Road, from the Potomac across the Alleghanies to the Ohio, to authorize the construction of a public highway connecting several States. (Lucton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U. S. 525-529; Indiana v. U. S., 148 U. S. 148.) That the Federal Government has the right to extend aid in the construction of roads was recognized by Jefferson when he said: During peace we may chequer our whole country with canals, roads, and so forth. This is the object to which all of our endeavors should be directed. Again, he said: The fondest wish of my heart ever was that the surplus portion of these taxes should be applied in time of peace to the improvement of our country by canals, roads and useful institutions. Henry Clay was always an advocate of internal improvements, and was in his day the ablest and most persistent advocate of the building of national roads. He said: Of all the modes in which a Government can employ its surplus revenue, none is more permanently beneficial than that of internal improvements. Fixed to the soil, it becomes a durable part of the land itself, diffusing comfort and activity and animation on all sides. The first direct effect is on the agricultural community, into whose pockets comes the difference in the expense for transportation between good and bad ways. Some have argued that this is a subject over which the States have absolute control, and raise the question of State rights. One of the greatest advocates of the State rights doctrine was John C. Calhoun. He saw no encroachment upon the doctrine by Federal aid to roads. While Secretary of War, in a report to the House on the roads and canals, he said: No object of the kind is more important, and there is none to which State or individual capacity is more inadequate. It must be perfected by the General Government or not be perfected at all, at least for many years. Precedents for Federal Aid. Let it not be said that internal improvement may be wholly left to the enterprise of the States and of individuals. It is interesting to note that in the early days of our country's history Congress did appropriate money for the purpose of building roads. In 1806 Congress authorized the construction of a road from Maryland, known as the Cumberland Road, and various appropriations for it were made from time to time, aggregating about $7,000,000. In 1811, 5 per cent of the sales of public land in Louisiana were given by Congress to that State for the building of roads and levees; in 1816 a like amount of a similar fund was given to Indiana for roads and canals; and in 1817 a like sum was given to my own State, Mississippi, for this purpose; in 1818, 2 per cent of a similar fund was given to Illinois for roads; in 1819, 5 per cent to Alabama; in 1820, 5 per cent to Missouri; and in 1845, 5 per cent to Iowa. Congress also appropriated money for a road from Georgia to New Orleans, and one from Nashville, Tenn., to Natchez, Miss., as well as many other public highways. I think it has been thoroughly shown that Congress not only has the power but has frequently exercised the power to contribute to the construction of roads; however, this bill does not authorize the construction of roads, but simply provides for the payment of a fixed rental on all roads used by the Federal Government in carrying the mail, if the road comes up to a certain fixed standard. It is but right that the Government should pay for anything that it uses, and in doing this it will encourage the people in the States to improve their roads. I realize, Mr. Chairman, that there has been so much written and spoken upon the subject of good roads that there is little, if anything, new to be said. If I needed any excuse for speaking on this occasion it would be that it ofttimes requires a repeated statement of facts to get it firmly fixed in our minds and to arouse us to the necessity for action. As I have said, a good deal of opposition to this measure comes from Representatives of city districts. It is a mistaken idea that no one but the farmer gets the benefit of good roads. Every citizen of this Republic will derive direct benefit from the improvement of the roads of the country, because the products of the farm must be conveyed over country roads to market, and the consumer must bear a part of the burden that is laid upon the producer because of bad roads. Even the railroads are interested in good wagon roads, because of the fact that in many sections of the country, owing to bad conditions of the roads, the farmer is forced to convey his products to the market at such time as he may be able to find the roads suitable for travel, thereby placing most of the agricultural products for transportation within a limited time. The farmer is also interested for the same reason; that is, that he is forced to sell his products within the same limited time. We have heard much comment upon the fact that people are leaving the farm and congregating in the towns and cities. One cause of this has been the bad condition of the roads. In my judgment, there is nothing that will tend more to the upbuilding of the country, making farm life more attractive, than the improvement of the road. There is no phase of life, either social or economic, which is not affected by good roads. The value of lands, the attendance of children at school, the social relations of the community are all affected by roads. Good roads-make social intercourse and communication between farm and town less difficult, thus destroying the isolation of farm life, especially in the winter season. They increase the productive area by making lands that have not been cultivated more accessible. They increase values of property, reduce the cost of transportation, cause greater interest to be taken in farming, thereby increasing the general prosperity of the country. Some Results of Good Roads. Improved roads are breeders of traffic. It is generally found that new industries, new and greater production, spring up upon the line of well-built roads, which increase commerce and enlarge business. On the other hand, bad roads keep a community from developing and cause material loss in many ways. There are no statistics which show the loss to the farmer due merely to the greater cost of transportation over bad roads, but the loss must be enormous; in fact, it is estimated that it amounts to many millions of dollars each year. As I have said, every citizen is directly interested in improving the roads of the country; that the farmer is not the only one benefited, but if he were I should vote to improve the roads of the country, because he is the first and most powerful producer of wealth and he has a right to insist that a portion of the money that he pays to the Government shall be returned to him by way of benefits from the Government. I care nothing for the suggestion made that a few great highways be built from one end of the country to the other, because I believe that that will be very largely for the benefit of those who desire to take pleasure trips in automobiles, and that those who are entitled to the benefits of good roads, or a very few of them at least, would receive no benefit whatever. Rather do I prefer to expend money in order to bring the farmer in closer touch with the towns and the town man in closer touch with the farmer to the mutual benefit of each. PUBLIC ROADS IN RELATION TO HUMAN WELFARE. By Logan Waller Page Extract. The advantages of improved roads have been carefully computed and estimated in dollars and cents, and so enormous have they been thus demonstrated to be, that they present a convincing argument of the necessity for road improvement. But there are other elements of advantage which more urgently recommend the improvement of our roads, advantages which deserve far more serious consideration than any financial advantage which may accrue, and which can not be measured according to any monetary standard, but must be looked for in the elevation of our citizenship and the moral and intellectual advancement of our people. Most of our cities and towns have good streets and driveways, which facilitate business and recreation and bring the schools and churches within easy reach of all. Contrast the lot of the country child on his way to school in the winter with that of his city cousin with only a few blocks of paved street to walk. The country child must leave home an hour or more before school opens, in order to be there on time. The roads are wet and muddy almost all of the long and cold winter months; in many places the country is open and the cold winds are merciless in their attacks upon him, so that, by the time he reaches the schoolhouse, which is oftener improperly ventilated and poorly heated, his feet are cold and wet and his body so chilled that he is unfit for study or recreation most of the day. This produces a lowered condition of resistance to the attacks of pneumonia and other disease germs, causes broken and irregular attendance, and creates an aversion for school. Parents sometimes keep their children at home rather than have them subjected to such conditions, on the theory that the injurious effects upon the body from such exposure will be greater than the beneficial effects upon the mind. In many parts of the country the roads are impassible for pedestrians at certain seasons of the year, which makes it necessary for children living near railroads to walk to school over the tracks and trestles. Many accidents occur every year in various parts of the United States on this account. Only last year two children were killed in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania while making their way to school over railroad tracks. Revolutionize School System. That improved roads would revolutionize our country school system, there would seem to be no doubt. Improved roads make it possible to consolidate or centralize the schools and to establish graded schools in the rural districts. Such schools centrally located will accommodate all of the children within a radius of from four to five miles. In many communities having the advantage of improved roads, commodious buildings have been provided, more competent teachers have been employed, and modern facilities for teaching have been supplied at a minimum cost. For instance, since the improvement of the main highways in Durham County, North Carolina, the number of country schoolhouses has been reduced from 65 to 42, of which 17 are graded and have two or more rooms, and employ two or more teachers. Facilitate Rural Free Delivery. The schools and churches of a community are its greatest moral and educational forces. Next to them, perhaps, stands Rural Mail Delivery, which brings the people of the rural districts in daily touch with the cities and business world. It places in their hands the daily papers, magazines, and all of the current literature of the country, so that they may be as well informed as to what is transpiring in the political, literary, and commercial world as their brothers of the cities. The beneficial effects of this service upon the happiness and home comforts of our rural population is immeasurable, and nothing contributes to its efficiency and regularity more than improved roads. Improves Health Conditions. The public road bears a direct relation to the public health. Although this is sufficiently obvious to those who have given attention to the matter, it is nevertheless a subject that has been overlooked by the general public. Figures and statistics do not apply to the discussion of this phase of the question, but experience and observation will justify the statement that many an infant has been sacrificed at birth, owing to the difficulty experienced by the doctor in reaching the farm at the proper time. Every country doctor is an ardent advocate of road improvement, since he knows better than anyone else the direct bearing that the condition of the roads has upon his ability to get about and provide the aid and succor which it is his business to supply. The impossibility of rendering first aid to the injured, whether child or adult, over bad roads, is undoubtedly responsible for many deaths and deformities. The danger of spreading disease by means of dust and poor drainage, particularly in relation to tuberculosis and typhoid fever, emphasizes the fact that the condition of the public highways is a subject that can not be overlooked in any earnest inquiry into the compelling reasons for systematic road improvement. It has been said that the public road is the main dust factory of a nation, and the thoughtful man can not deny the truth of the statement. ERA OF GOOD ROADS. By Congressman Saunders of Virginia. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 30, 1912. Mr. Chairman, the era of national aid to State roads has arrived, and whatever form the opposition to that policy may take, whether the form of constitutional quibbles, or form of freak or humorous amendments, such as propositions to pay for the use of the sidewalks in the cities, or the form of amendment ostensibly in aid of the bill, but really an embarrassment to the true friends of the measure, who have labored in season, and out of season to put this principle into working shape, these efforts one and all will be found as futile to stop the progress of this movement, as Mother Partington's mop proved to be as a weapon of defense in her famous contest with the encroaching waves of the Atlantic Ocean. This bill rests upon constitutional authority, and its operation will interfere with no single one of those State functions whose beauties and merits have been so eloquently acclaimed by some of the participants in this debate. The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Madden] spoke of the delight with which he paid his local taxes in aid of good roads. It is not proposed to interfere with the exquisite pleasure of that experience, or to take anything from its felicitous charm. Under this bill he may not only continue to pay local taxes with all the pleasurable emotions attendant on that operation, but when so minded he may increase the joy of that process by increasing his contributions to the roads of his community. There is not a friend of this measure who will seek to hinder him from pursuing this charming, this patriotic course of aiding local enterprise, in the rôle of a cheerful giver. The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. McCall] spoke of this measure as interfering in some wise, not very clearly depicted, with the functions of the States, and as tending toward centralization. I do not recall that New England was affected with this form of apprehension when we passed the law for the White Mountain Reserve, a proposition for an expenditure of public money which rests upon a far more narrow base, and is far more tenuously connected with the Constitution, than the proposition to aid the construction and maintenance of post roads in the States by means of a national appropriation. Many gentlemen who have criticized the pending proposition, have very clearly shown by the nature and character of their criticism, that they are absolutely unacquainted with the terms, the purport, and the purpose of this measure. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Slayden] in the course of his remarks, referred with just pride to the liberal attitude of his people toward the cause of good roads, and the extent of the local contributions in aid of that cause. We are mindful of the fact that many States in this Union have done splendid work in this direction. The thrill of this movement for betterment of roads is being felt in every State, and I rejoice that it is so. But may I ask my friend from Texas, and the other gentlemen from other States who have assailed this measure how, and wherein, will a supplemental fund derived from the National Treasury by direct appropriation, paralyze local effort, or hinder the work of local development? In many of the States, notably in my own, the roads are established and maintained by local taxation, with a supplemental State fund that is afforded upon prescribed conditions. Just a moment ago I was talking with a Member from New Jersey, and he mentioned the fact that in his State, as in Virginia, the country and local contributions to the road fund were supplemented by State aid. In that instance did State aid paralyze the arm of the community? Did State aid cause a recession of local activities? On the contrary, as a direct and immediate result of that coöperation of effort, the State of New Jersey affords a most splendid illustration of what can be done by united effort in the way of securing good roads of the highest type. When county aid is supplemented with State aid, and State aid is supplemented with national aid, pray tell me why this aggregate aid may not be efficiently employed, or why national aid would operate to paralyze local endeavor, when State aid has merely served to energize it? In the great fight now in progress in the Mississippi Valley between the States and the Father of Waters, do the States disdain the help of the Nation on the ground of its paralyzing effect on local activities? There is no great nation of the modern world which has not aided the local communities in respect of both construction and maintenance of highways, and the nations pursuing this policy are noted for the excellence of their roads. In this regard the Republic of France is the wonder of the civilized nations. But to achieve her present state of supremacy in the matter of improved highways France, as a nation, has spent over 3,000,000,000 francs upon her roads. This fact explains in large measure the present prosperity of that country. A few days ago the French Government called on its people for bids on a bond issue of $60,000,000. In the briefest possible time bids aggregating over $400,000,000 were received. Comment is unnecessary. Today France, which has done so magnificently in the direction of national aid to roads, has in contemplation a scheme of canalization of her rivers. This is but another form of domestic improvement, in aid of internal commerce, and like her roads, these canals will further increase the facilities and wealth of that wise and thrifty people. Why should this great Nation, a Nation that in other respects stands in the very forefront of the nations, hesitate to pursue a course that has been pursued in other countries with such splendid results? Is our authority to enact this measure questioned? Consider for a moment the authority of the Federal Government over rivers and harbors. This Nation exercises at present the right to regulate the height of bridges over navigable streams, to determine whether these bridges shall be built or not, to provide that bridges if built, may be built by private corporations, with the right to charge tolls, to provide for the taking of private property to afford approaches to the bridges, to provide that feeders leading into channels of interstate commerce may be constructed, and to that end that the land of private parties may be condemned. Community Benefits. Communities that have built good roads, will find their reward in this bill. Communities that desire to build good roads, will be encouraged to go forward. Every community will be stimulated to construct more good roads, and to transform existing dirt roads into improved highways, in order to receive the larger compensation attaching to permanent roads falling in the two first classes. The critics of this measure seem to fancy that the roads of the States are to be exclusively constructed, or maintained by the appropriation which it carries. Nothing of the sort. It is merely a supplement to local efforts. A permanent road on which the State spends $25 per mile, per annum, for maintenance, may not be very adequately maintained by that expenditure. But the expenditure of $50 per annum, per mile, may be ample for efficient maintenance. It is the purpose of this bill to afford the additional $25. The cost of maintenance for a well-constructed dirt road, depends upon a number of factors, and is a fluctuating quantity. Many of these roads can be well maintained during a large portion of the year, on an expenditure of $10 per annum, per mile, and admirably maintained on an expenditure of $25 per annum, per mile. This bill will afford $15 per mile, and the local authorities will be required to provide the additional amount needed to maintain the road to the prescribed standard. The State of New York will be entitled to something like $1,000,000 per year when its roads are conformed to the requirements of this measure. Will the gentlemen from that State who either directly, or indirectly, are opposing this plan of national aid to State roads, undertake to tell this House that this large sum will be rejected, or that if received as a supplement to State contributions, it will not give impetus to the State and local activities in the great cause of road improvement? The State of Texas is interested in this measure to the extent of about $800,000 per annum. That great State boasts of what it has done in the way of road building, and it is conceded that its record in this respect is altogether creditable. Will the Representatives from Texas tell this House that the sum of $800,000 as an addition to their State and local contributions, is a negligible item, or that once in hand this considerable sum, will not energize and stimulate the whole scheme of road building in that State? If road building is a State function, a material increase of road funds will induce a more efficient discharge of that function. Throughout the Union, in every State, and in every community, the stimulating effect of the compensation contemplated by this bill will be noticeably felt. The sentiment of the country favors permanent roads, and the general tendency is toward their construction, but for the present many communities are unable to build them. During the transition era, and until the existing roads are replaced by the ultimate form of permanent roads, the dirt roads should be maintained in the form most suitable for efficient use. Hence the provision of the bill in aid of dirt roads. NOT CLASS LEGISLATION. By Congressman Bowman. Extract from Congressional Record, April 30, 1912. Mr. Chairman, the district which I represent contains not only large and important cities, but also an important farming community, and they are both equally interested in the construction and maintenance of good roads. The majority of the people of Pennsylvania are interested in the construction of good roads. In my judgment there is no other thing which will so advance civilization as that which promotes the interchange of intelligence and commodities between the different parts of a country and the different peoples who reside in that country. It is a difficult matter to excite sufficient interest to construct a road. It is still more difficult to secure the continued interest which will keep that road in repair. I consider this measure as most admirably framed to produce that result. The amount which is proposed to be given as rental for the use of the different classes of roads would not amount to the interest on the money that would be required to construct any one of the roads of the class named in the measure, but it will be an inducement to keep those roads in good repair. It has been stated that it would require $16,000,000 the first year in order to meet the provisions of this measure. If it did take $16,000,000, that would mean that there were about 800,000 miles of road kept in good condition throughout the United States. At present in this country there are less than 200,000 miles of improved roads, and if by an expenditure of $16,000,000 you could have 800,000 miles of road that were passable at all times of the year for vehicles of all classes, that were graded in conformity to the topography of the country and "with ample side ditches, so constructed and crowned as to shed water quickly into the side ditches, continuously kept well compacted and with a firm, smooth surface," it would reduce the expenses of transportation from the present high figures to what it now costs in France, namely, 7 cents per ton per mile. This measure would permit the farmer, the fruit or the truck raiser to get his produce to the market at a much less rate, and thereby it would be a benefit not only to him but to each person using his products in different parts of the country. It would permit the merchant in the city to carry or send anything he had of value to the farmer at a much less cost, and the result would be an economy to each individual as well as to the Government, as the mails that were transported over the roads would be carried at a much less actual cost, which would result in a diminution of the cost per mile to the Government from what it is now paying for this service. Something has been said about the cost of inspection. Each man in charge of a rural delivery route would be a constant inspector of the road he covers, and the man who is sent out as a general inspector could, with a small expenditure of time in addition to that he now occupies, discover the condition of the roads. I consider the measure of great importance to this country, and will do as much, if not more, to advance civilization than any other measure that I have seen introduced in this Chamber. GOOD ROADS VERSUS BAD ROADS. By Senator Swanson of Virginia. Extracts from Congressional Records, July, 1911. Mr. President: There is no question before the American people today more important than the improvement of the public roads and highways. The progress of this Nation in nearly all directions has been phenomenal. We have established our preeminence in most things. We have become the greatest manufacturing people in the world, the products of our factories exceeding those of Britain and Continental Europe combined. Our mines furnish the world more than one-half of its mineral products and wealth. Our plains and prairies are recognized as the granaries of the world. Cotton continues the king of plants, and the world's comfort and clothing are dependent upon the white fields of the South. We occupy today the foremost place in the world's commerce, our exports now exceeding those of Great Britain. Our wealth today is greater than that of any other nation. Recently we have become supreme in finance, our banking capital being the greatest possessed by any people. The world's financial heart now throbs in New York, and its pulsation affects the world. We now surpass all other nations in the amount of money expended for primary and general education, in the creation of colleges and splendid universities. In miles of railroad, navigable rivers, and improved harbors we are unsurpassed. Our progress in these directions has been so wonderful that its story reads more like romance than history. Yet, Mr. President, as amazing as are these varied achievements, it is admitted that today we have the poorest public roads and highways of any civilized nation. Of the 2,155,000 miles of public roads within the United States, less than 200,000 miles are macadamized or improved with hard surfacing. Thus, more than nine-tenths of the public roads and highways of the United States during rainy seasons are almost impassable. No other enlightened people in the world are cursed with such a wretched condition. Our energies and our money have been generously expended in every other direction, except in the betterment of our public roads. After careful examination and thoughtful consideration I am satisfied that our neglect in this respect has been one of the greatest misfortunes that has affected us as a people and should be remedied as quickly as possible. No one can over-estimate the annual loss incurred by our people in traveling and hauling over these wretched public roads. Our internal commerce exceeds the interforeign commerce of the entire world. It is estimated that 90 per cent of our internal commerce must first or last be hauled over the public roads. The average haul of this vast commerce over the public highways, after careful investigation, has been estimated to be on an average of a little more than 9.4 miles. The same careful investigation fixes the average cost of hauling these products at 23 cents per ton per mile. The cost of hauling per mile over the splendid roads of France is on an average of about 7 cents per ton per mile. The average cost in England and Germany is about 11 cents per ton per mile. If the more important and main lines of our public-road system were improved as are those of France, Britain, and Germany, it is estimated by good authorities that our products could then be hauled over our entire system of roads at a cost of 12 or 13 cents per ton per mile. This would result in an annual saving in this item of hauling alone to the people of the United States of more than $250,000,000. This is the annual "mud tax" paid each year by the people of the United States in hauling their products over poor roads. This loss, if wisely and properly expended, would in 20 years macadam or furnish hard surfacing to all the public roads within the United States. But this does not include all the loss occasioned this country by its bad country roads. The poor condition of the roads makes it unprofitable to market much of the products of the farm. If the cost of transportation and the cost of production exceed the selling price, it makes it impossible for the producer to dispose of his products at a profit; hence production is arrested. In many sections farmers fail to raise certain crops because the cost of hauling them over miserable country roads is so great that they sustain loss instead of profit. The national loss from this source amounts annually to many million dollars. Our bad roads, making it impossible in many sections to market certain products of the farm, have prevented a great diversification of crops which exists in France, England, and Germany, with their splendid road system. We can not overestimate the loss and injury to agriculture resulting from this source. Bad Roads Cause People to Leave Country. Another great detriment that has come to this Nation from its wretched country roads is that it has forced the people to leave the rural sections and congregate in towns and cities. This fact is strikingly disclosed by the census returns. In 1790 only 3.4 per cent of our population dwelt in our cities; in 1850, 12.5; in 1900 the percentage was 40; in 1910 it was 46. This explains why so many acres of fertile land still remain untilled, while the city, with its unsanitary and unwholesome tenements, is crowded with human beings whose standards of living and methods of life result in their mental, moral, and physical decay. Statistics gathered by the Office of Public Roads and compared with the reports of the United States census reveal that in 25 counties, selected at random, possessing only 5.1 per cent of improved roads in 1904, the decrease of population averaged 3,112 for each county for the 10 years between 1890 and 1900. The records of this department further show that in 25 counties similarly selected, which possessed an average of 40 per cent of improved roads, there was an increase averaging 31,095 to the county. These significant facts show more eloquently than language the great benefits accruing from improved roads. Statistics gathered from the same source show how education and school attendance are affected by improved roads. These statistics show that in five States in which about 34 per cent of the roads are improved 77 out of each 100 pupils enrolled regularly attend the public schools. That in other five States in which the improved roads only amount to 1.5 per cent only 59 out of each 100 pupils enrolled regularly attend the public schools. These figures prove more forcibly than language the advantages accruing to education from good improved public highways. Each census discloses that our urban population is very rapidly increasing at the expense of our rural sections. This is not desirable. It means an immense national loss, not only financially, but morally, intellectually, and physically. The pleasures and profits of country life are largely dependent upon the condition of the public roads. Social intercourse and pleasure are only possible in those sections where comfortable traveling is possible over the roads. Good school facilities and good public roads go hand in hand. They are companions which can not be separated. Carefully gathered statistics disclose that efficient country schools and the attendance of scholars are invariably dependent upon the condition of the public roads. The country has been the great nursery which has furnished the men of genius and patriotism who have builded this mighty Nation. We should do what we can to encourage our population to remain there, and develop our wonderful soil and agricultural resources. Then, the agricultural people of this Nation are the mighty sources of patriotism and courage who will preserve this Nation in the coming hours of storm and stress. Bad Roads Hinder Development of Waste Land. Another great loss sustained by this Nation on account of its wretched public highways is that it has left undeveloped and uncultivated more than 400,000,000 acres of available and desirable land in the United States. If our roads were properly improved this land would be at once occupied by thrifty and prosperous farmers, thus adding greatly to the national wealth and power. Farm lands would greatly increase in value from improved public roads, and the country population would rapidly increase, greatly to the betterment of the Nation, both morally and materially. Some economists have estimated that the annual loss to this Nation on account of wretched country roads exceeds more than $400,000,000 annually. I do not believe this is an exaggeration. There are 850,000,000 acres of improved and unimproved farm land in the United States. It is estimated by the Agricultural Department that good roads would increase the value of this land from $2 to $9 per acre. This great increase of value would more than pay for the cost of improvement. I feel justified in saying that one of the paramount questions before the American people to-day is the improvement of our public-road system. The farmer, in the future, in order to increase his profits, must reduce the cost of transportation. As the farming lands of Canada, South America, and Africa are opened and developed, the farmers of this country will have greater competition. To meet this competition, they will have to reduce either the cost of production or the cost of transportation. I hope this Congress will not adjourn without reducing greatly the cost of production. The cost of production in this country is greatly enhanced by the excessive tariff duties imposed upon everything purchased, on account of the Payne-Aldrich bill. The Democrats of the House of Representatives have sought to bring the farmer relief from these excessive exactions by passing a bill known as the farmers' free-list bill, which, if enacted into law, will greatly reduce to him the cost of living and the cost of production. I hope the Senate will promptly concur in the passage of this bill, and this deserved relief will come to the great agricultural masses. The cost of transportation to the farmer is composed, first, of hauling over the public roads, and then over the railroad or steamboat lines to the markets. Within the last 70 years the cost of transportation over the railroads and waterways has greatly decreased, while the cost of transportation over the country roads has been increased. In 1837 railroad rates were 7? cents per ton per mile. Now it is estimated that the average cost of hauling by rail is 7.8 mills per ton per mile, or about one-ninth of the original rate. Seventy years ago the charge for hauling on the old Cumberland Pike was 17 cents per ton per mile. This charge permitted a profit. It is now estimated that the cost to the farmers, without profit, is 23 cents per ton per mile. Thus, while transportation over railroads has decreased to about one-ninth of what it was about 67 years ago, transportation over the public roads has increased about 35 per cent. Water transportation has so decreased that it now costs the farmer 1.6 cents more to haul a bushel of wheat 9.4 miles from his barn to the depot than it does to haul it from New York to Liverpool, a distance of 3,100 miles. This fact strikingly illustrates the importance of road betterment not only to the farmer, but also to the rest of the country, who are users and consumers of farm products. The greatest saving to accrue in the future to farmers from reduced transportation will come not so much from reduced railroad transportation as from reduced cost of transportation over the public roads, resulting from their improvement. * * * * * * * * * * * *  Who Uses Roads. The travel over our roads now is national, State, and local. The travel being national, State, and local, the cost of constructing and maintaining roads should be national, State, and local. It is not just to expect local communities to construct and maintain roads over which the travel of State and Nation far exceeds the local. It is utterly impossible for local communities to bear the expense of constructing macadam or hard-surface roads. To do so would require such a heavy tax as to practically bankrupt the communities. A system must be devised whereby this expense can be fairly distributed. The only way that this can be accomplished is by the appropriation of money out of the State and National Treasuries. The cities are as much interested and are as much benefited by good country roads as are the people in the rural sections. Good roads enable the people of the country to easily come to market not only with their produce, but also to make purchases. The trade and commerce of cities are greatly enhanced by being surrounded by splendid roads. In addition, it adds to the comfort and pleasure of those living in the cities. Thus, good roads enhance the value of property alike in city and country. Many of the cities, when permitted to do so by their charters, have united with country communities in appropriating money for the construction and maintenance of public roads. The charters of many of the cities prohibit them from making such appropriations. The best and the fairest way to enable the cities to aid rural sections in the construction and maintenance of good roads is by appropriating a fair share of money for this purpose out of the State and National Treasuries. By this means the cities and rich communities are enabled to share with the country sections their fair burden of road construction and improvement. Since both city and country receive benefits from good roads, each should share its part of the burden. I believe this is willingly conceded alike by the citizens of the city and country. Mr. President, in addition to the reasons previously presented as to why the National Government should extend its aid for the improvement of public highways of our country there are other considerations of justice and fair dealing which demand this. The United States Government now uses more than 1,000,000 miles of the public roads of this country in carrying its mails over them, either through its star-route contractors or its rural-delivery carriers. It uses daily this vast mileage of roads without giving to the States or communities a cent of compensation. Last year this Government paid to the railroads of this Nation $50,142,200 for using their tracks to carry its mails over their roads. The counties and States contribute their money for the construction and maintenance of these country roads as much as do the stockholders of the railroads for the construction and maintenance of their railway tracks. If it is just and fair that the Government should pay this vast sum of money for utilizing the tracks of the railroads, it is equally as just and fair that the Government should contribute a fair compensation to the States and communities for using their roads for the conveyance of the Government's mails. An argument for the one is equally as conclusive as for the other. Hence, I insist that as the carrying of mail is a Government function, and entirely monopolized by the Government, that the Government should make just and fair compensation to the States and communities for the use of their roads. The time has come when the States and local communities should insist upon this. Good Roads Is a Saving to the Government. Another consideration which strongly presents itself to my mind as to why the Government should extend national aid to road improvement is that it would result in the saving of a great deal of money to the Government. The Government now expends $42,000,000 annually for rural delivery. The average route of a rural-delivery carrier is about 24 miles. The carrier is unable to make a greater distance than this on account of the bad condition of the public roads. If these roads were properly improved, a carrier could easily and with more comfort deliver mail a third longer distance. It is estimated if the roads of the country were properly improved that in the reduced expenses incurred in its star-route service, in its present Rural Delivery Service, and in the extensions which will certainly come in the future, the Government would save $8,000,000 or $9,000,000 annually. Patriotism and wisdom alike demand that the Government should make this great saving and at the same time add materially in the advancement and prosperity of our country by generously aiding road improvement. Mr. President, I am unable to see any strong reasons why the Federal Government should further hesitate in the extension of a proper and liberal appropriation for the construction and improvement of public highways. To contend that it has no constitutional power to do so is absurd. No one has ever disputed that the Government has not power to establish, maintain, and repair post roads. It has established through its star-route and Rural Delivery Service more than 1,000,000 miles of post roads, which it daily uses; hence it not only has the power under the Constitution, but aso has imposed upon it the imperative duty to bear its fair share of the burden of improving these roads and keeping them in proper repair. Webster, Clay, Jefferson, and even Calhoun, who was very strict in his construction of the Constitution, all advocated national aid for the construction of public highways. Prior to the Civil War the Federal Government had appropriated $14,000,000 to aid in the construction of public highways. The 1,000,000 miles of public roads now made post roads by the uses of the Federal Government are the main roads traveled and the ones most needing betterment; hence no objection on constitutional grounds can be found for the Government undertaking to bear its fair share of the burden of improving the roads that it daily uses. Besides, this Government has spent large sums of money in the betterment of the public roads of Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, and also Alaska. If it has the authority to expend the public money there for these purposes, it has equal authority to expend the public money for these purposes in this country. I believe that the American people have greater demands upon the Public Treasury, filled with their contributions, than have the people of Porto Rico, the Phillippine Islands, and Alaska. * * * * * * * * * * *  MATERIAL ON THE NEGATIVE. FEDERAL APPROPRIATION—UNNECESSARY STRAIN ON NATIONAL TREASURY. By Congressman Ayres of New York. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 29, 1912. Mr. Chairman, pretty nearly every class of citizens in the United States seem to want to dip their hands in the Federal Treasury and pull them out with an appropriation sticking to them. One session it is the shipowners who want subsidies for sailing their ships and carrying their freight, and then next session it is little towns of two or three hundred population who want $75,000 post-office buildings. If it is not one thing, it is another. Anybody who finds it hard to get a living wants a Government job, and anyone who finds that he can not accomplish any particular work he has in hand wants to turn it over to Uncle Sam to do for him. Last week I had a letter from a valued constituent, who said that it was no longer profitable to breed good horses in the State of New York now that betting on races was illegal, and if I wanted to immortalize my name I should at once introduce a bill to have the Federal Government breed horses on a large scale, so that horse lovers in the different States could have them cheap. Yesterday a telegram came from an enthusiast who thought that Uncle Sam should send enough revenue cutters or Dreadnoughts towards the Arctic regions to personally convoy each iceberg that got loose till it melted into the Gulf Stream, firing off blank cartridges during the night to warn off all ships in danger. In every part of this land of the free there are men or classes of men who do not want to do some kind of work they think ought to be done and so they want Uncle Sam to do it. In many parts of our glorious country at the present time there are men or communities who have not good roads and who know they ought to have them, but they do not want to spend the money, and so— let Uncle Sam do it. And these communities get after their Congressmen and say, "We ought to have these roads, and if you are any good as Congressmen you will get them for us." And so the poor Congressmen, who know better all the time, come here and introduce bills and argue gravely that, having given the rural communities free postal carriers, it is now our duty to provide the roads for the carriers to travel on, or to keep them up. I tell you, gentlemen, it is not "conscience that doth make cowards of us all," but our constituents. Fifteen years ago, when the Rural Free Delivery Service was proposed, it was talked of as a boon to the rural population, as a gift which would cost the rest of the country many millions. No one ever supposed the time would come when the country would be asked to pay for the privilege of making this annual gift. What are the facts? For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, the Rural Delivery Service cost a little more than $37,000,000 and the total postal revenue that originated on these routes was just over $14,000,000. And now, what does this bill propose? That for the first year the United States shall pay for the privilege of using the roads the carriers travel on—$25 a mile for one class of macadam roads, $20 a mile for another class of roads, and $15 a mile for another and poorer class. It was estimated by one of the gentlemen in favor of the bill that the cost the first year would be $16,000,000. Now, the cost of constructing good macadam road varies from $3,000 to $15,000 per mile, according to the character of the soil, the grades, and the thickness and width of stone surface. It might be safe to say that the average cost is $5,000 per mile. The interest on an investment of that much is $300 per year, and it costs at least that amount to keep a macadam road in repair. That is the cost in the State of New York. How many communities will be led to expend $5,000 a mile in order to secure a vearly rental of $25 a mile? We all know how these things go. If this bill should by any unfortunate chance become a law, the next year the gentlemen who now favor this bill would come in with an amendment asking $50 a mile on macadam roads and argue gravely that even that would not be Uncle Sam's rightful share to pay. And the next year they would come in with another amendment asking that 50 per cent of the upkeep of these roads be given them by Congress. And then after this had been in operation awhile another amendment would be tacked on which would show that long usage proved that it was the duty of Congress to keep up these roads and that if any accident happened to a traveler on account of their imperfect condition he should have a right for damages. If this bill shall pass, in 15 years the Federal Government will be paying a hundred million dollars a year on account of it. Advocates of this bill have argued that inasmuch as the Post Office Department paid for the use of the railroads that it should therefore pay for the use of rural post roads. But the department does not pay for the use of the railroad right of way or the use of the rails. It pays the railroads for a service performed, for transporting the mails over the rails and right of way. And it now pays the rural carriers for a similar service, the transporting the mails over the rural roads. If the railroads came here with a bill like this and asked $15 per mile for any kind of rusty old track, and $20 per mile for fairly good standard-gauge track, and $25 a mile for first-class two-track road, and argued that if we paid them these bonuses it would be an incentive to them to improve their tracks, what gentlemen in this House would be the first to howl? If the department is to pay for keeping rural roads in shape, over which it is already paying to have the mails transported, just as it pays the railroads, why could not the superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railway come in here with equal justice and say, "We are thinking of putting in new ties and ballast between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and if you give us $25 a mile we will do it." We are all in favor of good roads. There is no more important subject before the American people to-day. But let us go at the problem in an honest and square fashion. Let each State that desires good roads build them for itself. That is good Democratic policy. We are awake to this matter in the State of New York, and we who live in that great State have just enough pride in our State to want to build our own roads. We do not ask your aid in our road building, and we do not want to pay for doing in any other State what it ought to do for itself. FUNCTION OF COUNTY AND STATE. By Congressman Slayden of Texas. Congressional Record, April 29, 1912. M. Chairman, if the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Langley] was right, I am now proceeding to align myself with the minority of this House, but conscious of the rectitude of my position, entirely confident that it is not only rational, but soundly Democratic and soundly patriotic, I cheerfully take the hazard of such a position. Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that there is a Member of this House who has a higher appreciation of the advantages of good roads than I have. Now and then for years I have shared humbly in the effort to arouse the people to a better understanding of the economic and social importance of good highways. I have worked and in a small way I have spent my own means in an effort to promote the good-roads movement. My interest in it can not be questioned. I want to see the roads improved just as fast as the people who must pay for them can afford the expense of their construction. I also want to see the best roads that can be built running through every neighborhood in each of the 48 States. This much it is proper to say, because an effort has been made—and, no doubt, will be made again—to create the impression that those who do not sympathize with this bill are against improved highways. If the subdivisions of the Federal Government—the States and the counties—have any proper function whatever, it would seem to be the construction and maintenance of roads. If there is any reason for the existence of States and counties, certainly the maintenance of the means of transportation between counties and neighborhoods is an obligation, a responsibility, and one that should not be shunted off on the Federal Government. This is a proposition to have the Federal Government assume those obligations. Supporters of the measure seem to think that the Government of the United States is an association of individuals altogether different and apart from those who reside in their congressional districts. They seem to be under the impression that contributions from the Federal Treasury are not paid by the people themselves, but are drawn from some mysterious outside source or deposit. At least that is the impression that is sought to be made, that must be made if gentlemen are to reap the political advantage from this ill-considered measure that they have maneuvered for. I can not so understand it. I can not, to save me, separate the citizen who is a taxpayer in the counties and States from the citizen who pays taxes to the Federal Government. The vast expense of all our governments—National, State, and local—must be borne by the citizen. The question that should most concern him is an economical and wise administration of his public contributions. Whether it filters through the hands of Federal or State or local agents, he must pay, and what he ought to do is to see to it that his tax money goes to its allotted work with the least possible expense. Now, I believe that whatever is done through Federal agents is apt to be more expensively done than if handled by a local agent. I believe that when the public treasure is collected through a system of indirect taxation more is taken from the people than is absolutely necessary, and that is spent with less regard for their interests. That is one of the evils of the indirect or customs-tax system. People seem to think more of the dollars that they pay directly into the hands of the tax-gatherers than of the dollars that they pay by a concealed additional charge on the tobacco they use or the clothes they wear. Increases Tariff and Customs Taxes. Pass this bill and customs taxes can never be reduced. All pretense of economy will be abandoned when a majority of this House says by its vote that they mean to commit the General Government to the policy of building highways, conducting a freight express business, and, ultimately, the ownership and operation of railways. It makes one skeptical as to the sincerity of those gentlemen who say they want a simpler and cheaper Government, but invariably vote for extravagances that compel higher and higher taxes. I also oppose this measure because it is not needed to secure good roads. Where the people have the intelligence to understand their advantages and the energy to do something for themselves they are getting them. Vast sums are now being spent for highway development. There is an enthusiastic and general movement in that direction which is most encouraging to every advocate of the policy of better highways. New York State, which great Commonwealth is too independent and proud to beg the Federal Government to do what she can do better for herself, and ought to do for herself, has, I understand, just finished the expenditure of $50,000,000 on her public roads and is about to undertake the further investment of fifty millions more in the extension of her highway system. Pennsylvania and other States have spent or are now spending proportionately large sums. It is, I am afraid, those States that are laggards in the discharge of their plain duty that are behind this measure. They seem to prefer mendicancy to independence. I further oppose this bill because, in my opinion, it means increasing appropriations in the future by you, or by more complacent Members who will follow you here, and, finally, Federal jurisdiction over State roads. The tendency to concentrate power in the Federal Government is now almost resistless. Certainly we can not expect that the Federal power will not follow large Federal appropriations. Jefferson, who sought to magnify the importance of the States and to preserve local self-government, had the best of Hamilton in theory, but in practice, when associated with the temptation of large appropriations, it begins to appear that the latter will win. We are bartering away the dignity of the States and exchanging a great constitutional birthright for a Federal mess of pottage. To me it appears perfectly plain that the States can not retain dignity and importance while they avoid all the responsibility of that position. Method Not Adequate to Promote Good Roads. I also object to this bill because, although it will cost an enormous amount, it is wholly inadequate for the purposes for which it was designed. When you apply the maximum rental per mile to the whole of any particular rural postal delivery route it will not be discoverable. To spend $25 per mile per year will be, in my judgment, sheer and inexcusable waste. It will cost the General Government dear, but is not enough to tempt any locality to the development of a better road system. It would be a mere suggestion to the local authorities to apply for more, and would, I feel sure, lead to a complete abandonment of local or State effort. Mr. Chairman, that, to me, is one of the most deplorable features of this bill. I believe it will paralyze the good-roads movement. I believe that no State not yet equipped with an admirable and excellent system of highways will undertake to do anything for itself, can be inspired to do anything for itself, because, when they turn their eyes toward Washington, they will see gentlemen here clamoring for appropriations out of the Federal Treasury to do for them locally what the obligation in honor and decency rests upon them to do for themselves. FINANCIAL BURDEN. By Representative Fitzgerald of New York. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 29, 1912. I made the statement, that States are building a system of State highways. I intend to discuss it more fully. It illustrates the tendency and the desire of localities to escape the burden they should assume. In 1899, if I recall correctly, a law was enacted in New York providing for the system of contribution whereby State aid was extended to localities. The law provided that 50 per cent of the cost of construction should be paid by the State, 35 per cent by the county, and 15 per cent by the town. Very soon it was ascertained that to some of these communities the burden was irksome, or in excess of what the people desired to contribute. Good roads were desired and the wish was equally strong that the cost should be borne other than by the localities benefited. An amendment was enacted by which it was provided that the contribution of the counties and towns should be 2 per cent on the assessed valuation of real property in the county and 1 per cent in the town, but in no instance should the county or town pay in excess of the 35 and 15 per cent proportion. The result is that in some instances the State is expending 91 per cent of the cost of the roads and the localities 9 per cent. The tendency is natural; it is human. The desire to make some one else pay is overpowering. Shift the burden from locality to the State, from the State to the Federal Government. It is as effective to avoid the eventual burden as the ostrich in escaping danger by hiding its head in the sand. The State of New York is expending $6,000,000 annually on its roads, and with this enormous expenditure it has not enough roads, if all used by the postal service were of class A, to receive, under this bill, 20 per cent of what it is itself expending. But my objection to this legislation is fundamental. It is not predicated upon expenditure alone. It is aimed chiefly at the theory upon which the legislation is based. It introduces a new, a novel, a curious principle into our government system. It purports to require the Federal Government to pay localities for the privilege of furnishing some service to the people which is legitimately within the proper functions of the Federal Government. It is based on the theory that the Federal Government is something distinct, separate, apart from, superior to, and superimposed upon the people of the country; that it has some means of acquiring wealth or resources or moneys other than by obtaining them by taxation from the people, to be distributed for their benefit. The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Shackelford] spoke of the Federal Government being liberal in its treatment of the people. This is a strange doctrine to be enunciated by a Democrat. It is a peculiar notion that seems to be spreading. The Government should be liberal in its treatment of the people! Such a statement is strange to men who have been brought up to believe and to realize and who know what our Government is and means. Free institutions are organized by the people in order to maintain order and permit them to live in the most orderly, free, and happy manner possible consistent with the rights of others, and are predicated upon the theory that all men have certain inalienable rights, and that to preserve them governments are organized. Not Function of National Government. This idea that the Federal Government is something like the Government of the Russias, or some other imperial government, in which the people are subjects, beneficiaries, supplicants, and mendicants, who beg and plead as if some great father would be persuaded to scatter his resources with generous hand and give to the people something apparently not belonging to them is a new and unheard-of and astonishing doctrine in our land. Mr. Chairman, why not charge the Federal Government for the privilege of conducting Federal troops over country roads and through city streets? If the Federal Government is annoying or unkind or illiberal, why not tax it out of existence? It would be simple for the people to punish the Government by imposing burdens it could not bear. Under the Constitution exclusive jurisdiction is placed in the Congress over all places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the States required for forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings. Under section 355 of the Revised Statutes no money can be expended upon any site or land for the erection of any public building, fortification, or similar work unless the consent of the State is first obtained to the acquisition of the property. Why not abandon the policy heretofore followed and consent that the Federal Government shall pay taxes upon its Federal buildings, taxes upon the land occupied for fortifications, and other public purposes? It is the same principle underlying this bill carried to the logical conclusion. It is something new and novel. It is merely a cloak or a cover to get the hands of the various localities into the Federal Treasury. People shut their eyes and dream that the money they take is to be obtained from some place else than from their own pockets, but it will come from there eventually and no other place. There seems to be a widespread notion that the resources of the Federal Government are boundless, that the Treasury is overflowing. The methods by which the Federal Government obtains money are indirect and remote from the people. Its gathering hand is invisible; yet it takes its mite from every article, from every commodity that is of use to the people. It may be difficult to trace the tax; that makes some people the more ready to have it imposed. To enter this new policy means additional taxes, additional burdens, It is futile to talk of reducing taxation, of relieving the people from grievous burdens, of reducing the cost of living, if at every turn we are to be confronted with some new scheme to filch money from the Federal Treasury. Great Expense to National Government. There is one source of expense to which no one has given much attention but which is a very important matter. The compensation for these roads, if there be dispute, is to be fixed by the Department of Agriculture. The condition in which the roads are to be maintained is to be determined by the Department of Agriculture. How is the Department of Agriculture to obtain the information necessary to discharge the obligation imposed? Only by the maintenance of a force of inspectors that shall continuously keep under supervision and observation all of the roads which will be entitled to compensation because of their use by the Federal Government. It will require an army of new employees to swarm through the country. It will be inevitable that crying abuses will result from such surveillance. Congress has consistently heretofore refused to pave streets in front, of public buildings and it has refused to make any contribution for the construction of sidewalks about its property, and yet gentlemen now seriously propose to compel the Government to pay the people of the various localities for the privilege of rendering an important public service to them. Why not charge the Government for every public service rendered, in the hope that in some providential manner, like manna from heaven, funds will come into the Public Treasury? [Applause.] Mr Chairman, this legislation should not be enacted. It can not be justified upon any sound theory. It is unwise. It will lead to evils that will be deplored. It cultivates among the thoughtless and the uninformed erroneous and dangerous notions of government; it subjects the Federal Treasury to burdens for nothing essential to the discharge of its legitimate functions. It is an idle attempt to get something for nothing. Whatever is expended upon our roads will be paid for by the people. It will be better if they keep the work and the expenditure close to home. They may yet succeed in frittering away rights and privileges of inestimable value, obtained only by the expenditure of vast quantities of blood and treasure, for the unsatisfactory boon of a Federal appropriation and a dominant and irresponsive and unsympathetic Federal Government. CLASS LEGISLATION. By Congressman Madden of Illinois. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 29, 1912. Mr. Chairman, the gentlemen who designate themselves as statesmen of the mud roads, in nearly every instance represent constituencies of not only farmers but of people living in villages and cities. There is no district in this country that does not contain within its borders some village or some city, and I ask those men who are warbling in the name of the mud lark, in the name of the farmer, whether they propose to represent all of their constituents or only 50 per cent of them. This amendment which I have just proposed gives to every community an equal distribution of the funds that are paid out of the Federal Treasury. My friend from Iowa [Mr. Prouty] just a moment ago said that he believed in an equal distribution of the Federal funds. If he does he will vote for this amendment, because this amendment proposes that men who live in municipalities as well as those who live on farms shall participate in the improvements that are to be made as a result of the expenditures proposed under this bill. I want to ask you gentlemen who represent rural communities whether you want to go back to your people and say that you are in favor of spending money out of the Federal Treasury for the purpose of maintaining roads throughout the rural districts and against the payment of money out of the Federal Treasury for the purpose of maintaining roads in the villages and cities of your district. You will have an opportunity here by this amendment to say by your vote whether you are really a representative of your district or whether you simply represent that part of your district in which the farmer lives. The men who live in the villages and cities of the United States are equally entitled to the consideration which this bill proposes along with the farmer. Is there any reason why the post roads running through a town or village or city should be discriminated against? Is there any reason why these eight, ten, fifteen, twenty, or fifty million dollars proposed to be expended on public highways should be paid wholly to the farmer? Is there any reason why the city dweller, who has an equal vote with the farmer, should not have equal rights and equal treatment under this bill? I ask you men who come from country sections of the Nation, are you willing to go back home and say to the men who live in the villages and the cities that we do not recognize them as any part of our constituency? Are you willing to go back home and have them say to you, How did you deport yourself on the question of the payment of money taken out of the Federal Treasury for the rent of the highways of the Nation? Why were we discriminated against when you were voting for this bill? States Able to Build Roads. I assume that the gentlemen who come here favoring the enactment of this legislation believe—because they would not act as they do unless they did believe—that the mail distributed to the rural constituency is simply done as a matter of accommodation to the Government or to the post office authorities. I do not believe, Mr. Chairman, that any dollar of the public money should be paid out of the Federal Treasury for the upbuilding of any road now in the United States, I am frank to say. I do not believe that any Federal money should be paid to aid the States in the construction of highways. The States of the Union are amply able to build their roads for themselves. The people who live in those States are patriotic, they are willing to pay their taxes, they have paid them in most of the Northern States of the land, and their roads are being constructed and will continue to be constructed out of the pockets of the local taxpayers. CONFLICTING JURISDICTION. By Congressman Kent of California. Extract from Congressional Record, April 23, 1912. Mr. Chairman, the next matter of peculiar interest to me, not in the bill but in the discussion, is the bill suggested with the intent of granting Federal pay for improving country roads. That proposition, in the form it takes, is one with which I must disagree. The bill contemplates turning over sums of money to counties scattered throughout the country which can produce evidence that roads over which rural postal deliveries pass have been of a specified quality. There are a million miles of such roads now, and the immediate subsidy would amount to about $20,000,000. There would be necessitated an enormous expense for inspection on the part of the Government and to my mind the expense would not lead to anything coherent or systematic in the way of road building. It would be a case of easy money and therefore of wasted money. While I believe thoroughly and fully in Federal help for great national highways, I can not conceive of proper expenditure in such scattering through innumerable counties. The counties in my California district have supervisors, who have very little to do except look after roads. I do not think the Government would be satisfied with the uniformity of roads they build. If the Government went into the inspection business and saw to it that these roads were properly built, Congress could next take over the rest of the local governments, and we could have county day in this House, as many county days as there are counties, just as we now waste our time on District of Columbia Day, when 5 commissioners with authority could govern Washington better than 400 Congressmen and 90 Senators. This bill is a piecemeal, patchwork sort of scheme, and much as I believe in the necessity of improving the highways of the country, I do not believe that the Federal Government should chop up its efforts into small, incoherent fragments, that must necessarily result in waste. Moreover, if a given road in a given county receives Government help on account of its being used for rural postal transportation, we can rest assured that there will be pulling and hauling from every direction to shift the rural routes to other roads or to get as many rural routes in each county as possible, just for the sake of the subsidy, whether or not such additional routes are justified. In the way this bill is drawn it is a tremendous temptation, and I am afraid that at least some few supervisors scattered here and there throughout the Nation might get into trouble. I once heard of a man who was an exile in Canada because, as he said, he had forgotten to build a church. The question has arisen as to how taxes ought to be raised to construct roads. To my mind the Government might well help in the construction of great national highways where the work should be uniform in character and where there would be a chance for pride in the thoroughness with which the great arteries were built. The States may properly play their part, and in many cases are so doing by aiding with State highways. The little rural route is a local affair, a matter for the counties and the minor districts. The expense can and will be properly borne by these communities by whatever system of taxation they may choose. It is impossible to have a just system of pay for roads based on a frontage tax. There is no question about the iniquity of that as a final scheme. A frontage tax to support a great highway which passes a farm upon which the owner has trouble in subsisting is an obvious injustice. On the other hand, when we find cases where land for profit is subdivided for speculation owners certainly ought to pay all the primary cost of roads on a frontage basis. The question of taxation for road purposes, as well as for other purposes, will probably be best worked out under the Oregon system of giving counties the right to determine the nature of their own taxation. The Federal treasure never ought to be scattered in the heedless way this bill would scatter it. If the bill is a bona fide attempt to create national highways, it ought to provide for national highways; but if it is an attempt to scatter Federal money throughout the country for the popularization of reelectable Congressmen, that result could be much better attained by paying a subsidy on eggs, 30 cents a dozen for strictly fresh, 15 cents a dozen for fresh, and 10 cents for plain eggs. GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO A SOCIALISTIC POLICY. By Congressman Driscoll of New York. Extracts from Congressional Record, April 29, 1912. Mr. Chairman, efforts have been made nearly all the time since I have been in this House, by a certain gentleman and certain sections of this country to commit the Federal Government to the construction of the ordinary roads throughout the country. And those agitations and efforts to commit the Federal Government to the policy of construction of ordinary country highways have come largely from Southern and Western States of the Union. Because these States are large in territory and sparse in population and taxing power they would like to have the Federal Government to build their roads. I will not assume to discuss the constitutional aspect of this question. I do not think it is constitutional, but I certainly believe if it is within the limits of the Constitutional power for the Federal Government to go into the State of New York and build common, ordinary highways, then it is within the same power to go into the City of Syracuse, where I live, and build asphalt pavements and concrete sidewalks. I analyzed a batch of bills introduced into this House for the construction of roads several years ago. I found there were then eighteen of them, nearly all by Democrats and the great majority Southern Democrats, although there were some Republicans from Kentucky who had introduced bills. I do not know but that the late Mr. Brownlow of Tennessee was the father of these good road bills. These bills were of two or three classes. Some provided that the surplus in the treasury every year be divided among the States pro rata for the construction of roads, the money to be spent by the executive officers of the State. Those bills were introduced by the State-rights Statesman of the House. But none of them were fair, because they all provided that in the distribution of these funds among the States the cities would not be counted in the population in order to determine the proportion of the money to be given to the several States. Some of them provide that cities of fifty thousand should be excluded from the count, and some provide that cities of thirty-thousand, and some that cities as low as ten thousand, should be excluded. Everybody who introduced a bill figured up the cities in his own State, and estimated the proportion that his State would receive, by the exclusion from the count of cities above the figured population in order to give his State the greatest possible advantage. I opposed those bills then and I have opposed them in every possible form in which they have come up since, because a law providing for the distribution of money according to the population and excluding cities would exclude eighty per cent of the population of New York State, and that State would get only one fifth of what it would be entitled to according to its population, because New York is a State of cities, although it is a splendid agricultural State as well. Those bills were introduced by States-rights Democrats who did not want, in theory at all events, the United States of America government to send its agents into the States and build the roads. They wanted the money delivered to the officers of the State and the roads built by them. There was another class of gentlemen who introduced bills providing that the Federal Government send its agents into the several States and construct the roads and maintain them. States Fully Able to Build Roads. I shall attempt to analyze in a few minutes the bills introduced in this House, and I think there are thirty-nine such bills and resolutions providing for the construction of such roads by the Government. Twenty-nine have been introduced by the Democrats and ten by the Republicans, but not one from an Eastern State, not one from a middle State, very few from the Mississippi Valley, but all from the great broad States of the South and West, of large areas, long roads and sparse population and small taxing power. The farmers in those States have been unusually prosperous during the last ten or twenty years, and there prosperity has been increasing from year to year. The mortgages and other encumbrances which were on their farms a few years ago have been lifted. Many of them have deposits in the savings banks and many others are able to afford automobiles. I saw a statement a short time ago that there were 76,000 automobiles owned by farmers west of the Mississippi River. Those machines are luxuries; and usually automobiles are considered liabilities rather than assets. Old Dobbin and a cheap wagon would do their necessary business quite as well, whereas those are used for comfort and pleasure, because the farmers are so prosperous that they can enjoy the luxuries of life. But they are not satisfied. They are jealous of the manufacturers and business people of the East, who they think have been getting more than their share of the country's wealth. This jealousy, envy and antagonism have been manifestly developing during the several years past, and while they were not in a nebulous condition they were constantly developing and organizing for a general assault on what they considered concentrated wealth in the East, and just now it is in the form of a wave of national socialism, sweeping up the great West and Southwest. It is very largely the same spirit and motive which is back of this proposition to buy up all the express companies of the country. They want to commit the Federal Government, not only to build the country's roads, but to the policy of buying up all the old junk of the many express companies of the country—the old wagons, horses, trucks, and old stuff of every kind —which will be of no use to the Post Office Department when once acquired. The Federal Government did not authorize or encourage the organization of the express companies, and the Federal Government is under no obligation to them in any possible way. It can develop its parcel post or postal express if it seems wise to do so, and if they act on that proposition the Government tends to reduce the profits of the express companies or drive some of them out of business, they have no cause for complaint against the Government or against the people, whose agent the Government is, for they have taken advantage of their opportunities and have made all the profits their business would stand without regard to the complaints of the people who were obliged to patronize them. Paternalism Would Be the Outcome of Federal Aid. What next? Why if the Government goes into the business of postal express it will need the use of many cars in order to handle the express business. The railroad companies are now charging the Post Office Department very much higher rates for transporting its mail matter than they are charging the express companies for transporting express matter; and if the Department can not make what the people or Congress consider satisfactory rates, will the railroad companies? In the future the people will demand that the Government buy its own cars and fit them up for express business, which will be more commodious, and it will be claimed that they will be cheaper. Then if the Government buys one car, why not two? Why not ten? Why not the whole train? The express company will be very large if carried out according to the conceptions of the gentlemen who agitated this measure. This means the nationalization of all railways and also all the ships and steamboats in this country, and it means national socialism. Your people from the South and West who have been agitating for the construction of the country roads by the Federal Government are bent on getting money into the treasury with one hand and drawing it out with the other to build your roads, and do many other things in the way of domestic improvements which the States or the municipal divisions thereof should do for themselves. The people in this country have got the idea into their heads that with a parcel post or postal express the express wagon will come up to the farmhouse door every morning and take the butter, eggs, apples, berries, grapes, chicken, hens and turkeys, and that they can put a two-cent postage stamp on the box and that the express agent will haul them away. That may be the next step in this comprehensive scheme of paternalism. They think that for that stamp they will send these things to the consumer in New York City or Chicago or St. Louis or San Francisco. Then they expect to buy everything they want, from a piano to a paper of pins from the catalogue department house, and that all those things will come back and be delivered in nice packages, and set on their front porch, all for a two-cent stamp. They are going to eliminate the small merchant, not only in the village but in the city. They are going to save all the expense and the farmer is going to get all that the consumer pays, less the two-cent stamp. That is the idea some people have now, and that is what has been drummed into some farmers' heads by the champions of this measure, who are putting before us this first step in socialism. Can these dreamers expect to persuade any considerable part of either the city or county residents that this service can be done without being paid for by somebody; and if done by the Government, do they not know that it will cost very much more than if done by a private concern? Do they not know that all work done by the Government costs at least fifty per cent more than if done by private concerns or individuals? This service will be paid for out of one pocket or the other; either by the people who patronize the Government express or by the people at large in making up the deficit in the Post Office Department, and I am one of those who believe that a service of this kind, either in the form of parcel post or parcel express, should be paid for by the people who patronize it; in the transportation and distribution of merchandise the people for whose benefit it is done should pay the necessary expense of the service, and not shift the burden on the body of the people. Now, Mr. Chairman, I want to say a word to those thirty-nine gentlemen who prepared those thirty-nine separate bills. Some of you who in theory are States-righters would prefer to have the money sent to your State and there spent by your own officials. But you can not always have your own way in this regard, and when an appropriation is before you by which your district or State may get some advantage it is then a condition and not a theory that confronts you. You are human, and yield to the demands of your people at home who are constantly looking for help from the Federal Government, and you waived your academic views and grabbed for the appropriation. This is your practical notion of States' rights, to dip into the Federal treasury as deep and as often as possible. You came together, you thirty-nine gentlemen, and made up this composite bill. You have reduced thirty-nine to one. You think it looks mild and harmless and that it will appeal to one State as much as to another and thus commit the Congress to a policy of giving Federal aid to country roads. But let us not be deceived; when you get this bill into law on the statute books you will demand more. You will then demand that the Federal Government build your roads in some States, and send the money into others for that purpose. I have been watching the development of this Federal aid for ordinary highways movement for some years, and I think I understand the motive of the gentlemen who are back of it. There is a National Good Roads Association of which some years ago Mr. Final Contestants in Reading MISS ATKINSON MISS ELIZABETH RICE KEYSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL NEW LONDON ACADEMY KEYSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL, WINNER 1914-1915 Batchelder was president. He was also a Granger and an officer in that organization. He went into the State of New York, as I was informed, and made some speeches and circulated some literature and persuaded some New York Grangers to submit to this policy. I made a speech here in Congress against it and the Grange of my county sent for me to come home and explain my position. I did so and discussed the matter before them for two or three hours and explained to them that it was to their advantage to stay in partnership with New York and other great cities of the empire State for the construction of country roads in our State rather than go in pool with North Dakota, Montana and other large States with long roads for the construction of country roads out of the Federal treasure and at the common expense, and I think they saw it that way. ROAD CONSTRUCTION NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNCTION. By Congressman Madden of Illinois. Extract from Congressional Record, April 22, 1912. Now, I wish to call to the attention of the House another matter that is proposed to be inserted in the bill, but which was not recommended by the committee, and that is the provision which calls for expenditures from the Federal Treasury for the construction of highways in the rural districts of the country. In the State from which I come the people gladly contribute of their own funds for the construction of highways, and I may say that this is true of almost every other Northern State. I believe that we ought to have good highways. I am a believer in good roads. I believe that everything ought to be done that ingenuity can devise to make the roads of the country the best that can be had. But I believe that this is strictly a State function, and that it ought to be done by the States themselves. As a property owner in the State where I live, I have gladly contributed of what means I have had to help build the roads in my neighborhood. Illinois levies a tax on the abutting property. This tax is paid into the treasury of the township. The township trustees or the highway commissioners have jurisdiction over the expenditure of this money. They expend it wisely. We are getting good roads. We are meeting the conditions. We are abreast of the times. We are moving forward. We are making progress. We have no complaint to make. We make no complaint because we are called upon to pay out of our own pockets for the construction of the roads that we use. Why should not every community throughout the land pay for the improvements that the community requires? Why should the Government of the United States be called upon to build the highways of the country? Oh, the gentleman is technically correct; but we ought not to be dealing in technicalities. We ought to face the measure squarely. It does not matter whether you use the language that this money is to be paid out of the Federal Treasury for the purpose of paying the State for the use of highways used as post roads or whether the money is to be taken out of the Federal Treasury to put the foundations into these roads and put the surface on the foundations. It amounts to the same thing. Now, of course the people of the United States are not taxed directly for the maintenance of the Federal Government, and it may be that they think in many cases that the expenditure of money from the Federal Treasury does not take it out of their pockets; but the truth is that it comes out of their pockets just the same; and if they were called upon to pay a direct tax, out of which should be paid the money for the construction of highways, they would object to it; and I, who have already been paying a direct tax for the purpose of constructing roads in my neighborhood, object seriously to it. Mr. Byrnes of South Carolina. I understood the gentleman to say that he favored taxing the adjoining landowners, as is the system in his State? And then I wish to say, in addition to that, if the highways in the rural districts are to be considered as post roads, the highways known as the streets in the great cities of the country are also to be considered as post roads, and that if the highways in the country are to be paid for because of the fact that the mails go over them, then the men who live in the great cities of the country will demand that payment shall be made out of the Federal Treasury for the construction of the streets in the great cities which are also used as post roads. I see no distinction. I see no justice in the contention that the man who lives in a city and owns property abutting on a street should be taxed for the construction of that street while the man who lives in the country and owns property abutting on a highway is to be relieved from such a tax. The same rule ought to apply everywhere. If country roads are post roads, then city streets are post roads. The Government of the United States has the power to come into the city of Chicago and tear up any street in that city without asking the consent of the local authorities. They can tear the streets up, they can build their pneumatic tubes, they can operate these tubes without regulations from the local authorities. If that be true, why should not the Government of the United States be placed in the same position toward the citizens of the great centers that you seek to make with relation to the people who live in the more sparsely settled sections of the country? We are asking for no appropriation for any purpose out of the Federal Treasury that is not justified under the Constitution of the United States. The people who live in these cities are making no demands to put their hands into the Treasury of the United States for the construction of their streets. The people of the country districts are coming here and making demands that the Federal Treasury shall be used to construct their roads, and we object unless we are placed on an equality with the men that make those demands. We are citizens of the United States and our rights are equal to theirs. We have every right to make complaint, and the Constitution never intended that one class of citizens should do one thing and another class do another. The Constitution of the United States never contemplated the expenditure of money for the construction of highways in one place that it did not accord to every other place, and as a representative from one of the great cities of this Union I solemnly protest on behalf of the people of that city to the expenditure of one dollar of public money out of the Federal Treasury for the construction of any highway, anywhere, that does not give equal justice to the people of the territory from which I hail. COUNTRY ROADS VERSUS CITY STREETS. By Congressman Moore of Pennsylvania. Extract from Congressional Record, April 23, 1912. You are preaching economy by introducing a proposition which proposes to saddle upon the taxpayers of this country the business of the express companies and their pay roll of 50,000 men, together with all their equipment, contracts, and damage claims, all of the risks, and labor conditions, and all those other conditions that are incident to Government control. Preaching economy! Yet you propose by this bill to make the Government of the United States, whose money are sent here to justly and wisely appropriate, take this money out of the Treasury, the people's money, under the guise of an appropriation bill for the benefit of clerks and free rural delivery carriers, and to do what? Expend it on three classes of roads, to be supported by the Government of the United States, upon the pretense that somewhere, at some time, they are to be used by a wagon carrying the mail of the United States, or are to be footed by some one who has a mail sack upon his back. If you want to be fair in your proposition, why do you not make provision for another class of roads to be paid for by the Government of the United States, namely, the highways of the city, within the limits of the various congested centers, where the people have already paid for them, and where the heels of the carriers and the wheels of the wagons do as much damage as they do upon any country road in the United States? Are you going to make provision for the sidewalks used by the letter carriers in carrying the mails of the United States, or are you going to continue by your policy of economy to provide only for one section of the United States and leave the others entirely out of consideration? Oh, in this bill you propose another radical change in regard to the parcel post. You propose that those of us who live in the cities shall pay 12 cents a pound upon packages which we deliver through the mails, and that that rate shall be fixed and uniform with regard to us, but so far as the residents of the country upon rural routes are concerned, you provide a sliding scale of rates which means, in the last analysis, that if we move out of a city and live in the country we can have our packages carried in the mails on Government-built roads by rural carriers at 5 cents a pound. In other words, you are specializing as between the city and the country—we pay 12 cents and you pay 5—and you are violating the very essence of the Constitution of the United States. We might as well be frank about these matters. Why do your States not go and build your own county roads? Why do you come to the Government of the United States and ask us to use the money of the people, the money of your people, the money of my people, to build the roads that you ought to build yourselves? You ask, Do we build our roads? I answer, Yes; we do, because we are industrious, because we are saving and because we want to thrive and prosper. The great Commonwealth of New York has appropriated millions and millions of money to provide roads which are used by every farmer who wants to use them, by every man who wants to carry the mails, by any man, whether he comes from California or whether he comes from New Mexico or whether he comes from Austria. Why do not you build roads in order that the rest of the country may have the same advantage that those of us who build roads for ourselves accord to others? The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has just made provision for the construction of roads to the extent of $50,000,000 and yet my good friend from Iowa comes into this House, along with others who are now preaching this good-roads doctrine, because it carries an appropriation and because it pleases the farmers and because it pleases the rural-delivery men, and says that he wants the Federal Treasury to build roads in Iowa. Some other gentleman wants the Treasury to build roads in his State. What are you doing for yourselves? References. The University of Virginia Faculty has generously provided a package library on this subject for debate. A package of pamphlets and books will be sent to any principal of a high school for a term of two weeks, free of cost, save postage, by his writing and asking Mr. John S. Patton, University Librarian, to send a package for the use of a certain school. A wealth of material can be gotten from the Congressional Records, which can be procured for a mere song. Regulations for Package Libraries. A package library service has been organized and will be in effect January 15, 1916. These packages will be made up of pamphlets and other publications containing information needed in these debates. Package libraries are lent through the principals or superintendents of schools. They are lent for a period of one or two weeks, as may seem desirable, and the loan may be renewed if renewal will not inconvenience other borrowers. The person to whom the package is lent is held responsible for the return of every item in it. The package is dispatched by parcel post or as third class mail matter, the cheaper carriage being used. The borrower is expected to pay the cost of transportation both ways. All communications touching package libraries should be addressed to John S. Patton, Librarian, University, Va.
