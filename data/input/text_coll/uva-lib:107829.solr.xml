      <field name="fulltext">THE NEW LAW BUILDING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I ACCOMPLISHMENT THE University of Virginia was conceived, founded, and organized by Thomas Jefferson. It was established by the Legislature of Virginia January 25, 1819, and opened to students March 7, 1825. The total number of young men enrolled as students during the eighty sessions which preceded the election of President Alderman as its first President in June, 1904, was fifteen thousand nine hundred and twelve. During this period three hundred and sixty-one students received baccalaureate degrees; the degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon three hundred and ninety-three candidates, and that of Doctor of Philosophy upon thirty-five. Degrees in Engineering were conferred upon ninety-nine candidates; the degree of Doctor of Medicine upon one thousand two hundred and fifty-seven, and that of Bachelor of Law upon one thousand three hundred and thirty-five. No honorary degree has ever been conferred by the University. *Reprinted in part from "The University of Virginia in the Life of the Nation."â1905. The alumni of the University have been largely represented in executive, judiciary, and other services of the National Government, and in Congress, as well as in State governments and legislatures. Four alumni have served as Cabinet officers; one as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; one as a Justice of the International Court of Appeals; and eight as Ambassadors or Foreign Ministers. Twenty-five have been members of the Senate, from thirteen States, and eighty-six have been members of the House of Representatives from fifteen States, many of them for several terms. Eight Senators and fourteen Representatives in the present Congress are alumni of the Universityâa larger representation than that of any other American university. Eighteen alumni have been Governors in ten States, and forty-eight Judges of Supreme Courts in seventeen States, many of whom are now in office. A large number have served or are serving as members of State Legislatures, Secretaries of State, Attorneys General, and in other offices of trust and importance. Alumni of the University took an important part in the formation of the Confederate government, and a still more prominent part in the Confederate army and navy. Thirty-eight alumni were in the convention which on April 17, 1861, passed what is popularly known as the ordinance of secession. Five alumni were members of the Confederate Cabinet; fourteen were members of the Provisional Congress, from eight States; ten were Senators, from seven States, and eighteen were Representatives, from seven States, in the first and second Permanent Congresses. The number of students matriculated up to the close of the Civil War was less than nine thousand; of these, two thousand four hundred and eighty-one (over twenty-seven per cent.) served in the field or at sea; and of this number, four hundred and seventy-one (nearly one-fifth) died in service. One thousand four hundred and eighty alumni (nearly sixty per cent. of the entire number serving) were commissioned as officers of various grades, among whom were four major-generals, twenty-four brigadier generals, and ninety-eight colonels, from ten States. In addition to the large number of alumni who have served as teachers in public and private high schools, or as assistant professors, instructors, or tutors in collegiate institutions, four hundred and eleven alumni have occupied chairs in one hundred and fifty-one universities, colleges, and professional schools, located in thirty-three States and four foreign countries; of these one hundred and seventy-one are now in positions. Sixty-five alumni have been made presiding officers of fifty-one institutions located in nineteen States. Alumni of the University have held chairs in ninety-nine institutions, located in sixteen Southern States; of these, one hundred and forty-one are at present serving in sixty-six institutions, located in fourteen States, including nearly all of the State universities and technical schools, and the leading private foundations, of the South. Alumni have held chairs in fifty-seven institutions located in seventeen Northern and Western States; of these, thirty are now serving in eighteen institutions, located in eight States. While the University has no Department of Theology, nor any denominational affiliation, over five hundred of its alumni (over three per cent. of its total enrollment) have entered the ministry, chiefly of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches; a large number of these have served or are serving as missionaries in all parts of the world. Eleven alumni have been made bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church; one of the Methodist Episcopal Church; and one of the Reformed Episcopal Church. From the opening of the University to students in 1825, to June, 1904, it had conferred the degree of Bachelor of Law upon one thousand three hundred and thirty-five of its graduates (a little over eight per cent. of its total enrollment). To these may with propriety be added a still larger number of its matriculates who, without completing the entire course in Law at the University, have there obtained the larger part (if not the whole) of their professional education, and have since been in successful practice. Alumni in the Law have attained distinction in every branch of the profession, and have been prominent in public life, alike in the National Government and in that of their respective States. Without taking account of a large number of practitioners who have there received their academic (and in many instances the larger part of their professional) training, the University at the close of the eightieth session had conferred the degree of Doctor of Medicine upon one thousand two hundred and fifty-seven of its students (about eight per cent. of the total enrollment). Representatives of this body have been and are prominent in their profession in nearly every State and large city of the land. They comprise a larger number of the surgeons of the Army, Navy, and Marine Hospital Service of the United States than the graduates of any other medical school, forming at the present time about twenty per cent. of the National Medical Staff. Alumni of the University constitute a large proportion of those American writers who, especially in the South, have attained distinction as authors in various fields of literature, or as editors of leading periodicals and newspapers, both religious and secular. Although the Department of Engineering is of comparatively recent organization, its graduates are filling positions of importance throughout the land; the same may be said of graduates of the School of Chemistry and of Geology.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II A Statement of Recent Growth ON JUNE 16th, 1909, the University of Virginia completed the ninetieth year of its life. Founded by Thomas Jefferson, nourished by the Commonwealth of Virginia, enriched and guided by the ability and devotion of a rare group of scholars for three generations, it may be justly said to have achieved and maintained a certain distinct intellectual leadership in higher education. It has clung steadfastly to old ideas of character and thoroughness, and yet it has sought and is now seeking so to readapt its life to the needs of society as to be always a source of strength to the Commonwealth and to the Nation. Through the wisdom and generosity of the State, and through the beneficence and public spirit of the individual, it has recently been able to extend its power in unusual and striking ways. The purpose of this statement is to set forth simply the lines of this expansion, for it is expansion in scope, and not subversion of ideals. In the Installation Address of President Alderman, April 13, 1905, he thus defined the character of the University as it had been worked out through the generations: "One does not have to search for this institutional character as for something elusive and subtle. It shines out before the face of the stranger in five clear points of light: "A sympathetic understanding of democracy as a working hypothesis of life, guaranteeing to every man a chance to realize the best that is in him. "An absolute religious freedom, combined with wide and vital religious opportunities. "An appeal to the best in young men, resulting in the creation of a student public opinion and a student system of honor, which endowed the University of the past, and endows the University of to-day with its richest asset of reputation and fame. "A high standard of scholarship, rigidly maintained in an air of freedom of learning and freedom of teaching, begetting an austere ideal of intellectual thoroughness and honesty. "A conception of culture as a compound of sound learning and gracious conduct, as an inheritance of manhood and moral will won through discipline and conquest, and as a capacity to deal with men in the rough work of the world with gentleness and simplicity." It is desired to add one other distinctive and ever-increasing characteristic to this estimate, service to the people, to the end that no cry for help in any academic, educational, spiritual, or political direction, can be heard without immediate answer from the University of Virginia. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL FUND. At the time of the installation of President Alderman the Alumni of the University, upon the initiative of the Washington Chapter, inaugurated a movement to raise a million dollars for the endowment of the institution. The entire fund was completed on February 1, 1909, and is held by the Alumni of the University through an Alumni Board of Trustees, consisting of the following members: E. A. Alderman, President; Eppa Hunton, Treasurer; Chas. J. Faulkner, Wm. W. Fuller, Alex. P. Humphrey, Thos. Nelson Page, Wm. H. White. Of this fund $500,000 was given by Mr. Carnegie and forms the permanent endowment of six existing schools in the University, to which are given the names of great men who have helped build the University and the republic, as follows: First, the James Madison School of Law; second, the James Monroe School of International Law; third, the James Wilson School of Political Science and Political Economy; fourth, the Edgar Allan Poe School of English; fifth, the Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering; sixth, the Walter Reed School of Pathology. Gratitude is due to the large-minded men of all sections who have contributed to this fund, and thereby established a nucleus of permanent strength to this University. Great praise is due to the gentlemen of the Alumni Association, who set this movement on foot, and lasting credit belongs to President Alderman, upon whom fell the burden of actually bringing to pass the great plan. STATEMENT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.* * Extracts from a statement submitted to the General Assembly of Virginia of 1910 by the President for the Rector and Visitors of the University. Endowment. In a statement made to the General Assembly of 1906 it was shown that the Commonwealth of Virginia and private beneficence had created at Charlottesville an institution of higher learning representing at that time a monetary value of $2,328,000, subdivided as follows: 1. Buildings, equipment and land, $1,550,000 With the exception of the original buildings, valued at $400,000, the land at $100,000, and the new hospital valued at $70,000, this great property had come to the State in the form of gifts from private personsâequal in value to $980,000 2. Endowment Fund, 778,000 3. Bonded debt, incurred by fire and restoration (not included in total), $200,000 $2,328,000 A similar statement made to-day would show that the University of Virginia represents a monetary valuation of $3,780,268, subdivided as follows: 1. Buildings, equipment and land, $1,550,000 2. For new buildings and equipment,âhospital, dining hall, President's house, law building, 168,079 3. Remodelling old buildings, repairs, etc., for laboratory purposes, 25,357 4. Electric plant, 4,300 5. Laboratories, all departments, new equipment, 38,992 6. Library, Law and General, 15,540 7. Endowment Fund, 778,000 8. Increase in Endowment Fund since 1904, 1,200,000 9. Bonded debt (not included in total), $200,000 $3,780,268 Increase in monetary value of this foundation since 1904, $1,452,268. One million two hundred thousand dollars of this sum represents the gifts of private individuals; one hundred and fifty thousand represents direct appropriation from the State; and one hundred and fifty-two thousand represents the application of income from all sources to material equipment. The fact that the University of Virginia has attracted to its use private gifts amounting to nearly two millions of dollars is unique in the history of State institutions. I believe this beneficence would quickly cease if, by reason of it, the State itself should in any way slacken its commendable efforts to build up its chiefest seminary of learning. Income and Expenditures. Total annual income of the University of Virginia in 1904-1905: 1. From State appropriation, $50,000 2. From tuition and other fees, 71,000 3. From interest on endowment funds, 32,390 4. From rents and other sources, 10,260 $163,650 Annual expenditures of the University of Virginia in 19041905: 1. Salaries of professors, instructors, executive, $103,320 2. Interest on debt and sinking fund, 12,000 3. Insurance, labor, improvements, repairs, 31,480 4. Summer School, advertising and printing, fellowships, scholarships and all other expenses, 29,500 $176,300 In 1904-1905, then, it will be seen that the annual deficit of the University of Virginia was in the neighborhood of $13,000, and the University was shorthanded in every department and far from satisfactorily equipped. The student attendance for that year was 706. Total annual income of the University of Virginia for 19091910: 1. From State appropriation, $80,000 2. From tuition and fees (estimated), 73,000 3. From endowment funds, 81,234 4. From rents and all other sources, 6,946 $241,180 It will thus be seen that in the five year period under consideration, the University of Virginia has increased its value as a permanent educational foundation by the sum of $1,452,268, and has increased its annual income by the sum of $77,530. Thirty thousand dollars of this income increase is due to the wisdom and generosity of the State, and $47,530 of this increase is due to the interest on private gifts from citizens of this country interested in the higher education in general and in this University in particular. The total expenditures of the University for the session 19091910 are as follows: 1. General Administration, $21,616.00 2. College and Graduate Department, 85,250.00 3. Law Department, 14,080.00 4. Medical Department and Hospital, 47,345.00 5. Engineering Department, 10,940.00 6. Summer School, 1,500.00 7. General Library, 5,771.00 8. Business and Grounds, 25,314.00 9. Gymnasium, 1,305.00 10. Business advertising and bonded debt, 14,650.00 11. Commons Hall, 2,000.00 12. Miscellaneous, 3,700.00 13. General appropriation for equipment, 6,440.00 Total $239,911.00 The expenditures of the University of Virginia in 1904-1905 were, as has been stated, in round numbers, $176,000, being $13,000 in excess of income. The expenditures for 1909-1910 are, in round numbers, $240,000, or $64,000 in excess of the former period. Increase of Power. This increase of income has been used to add to the power of the University of Virginia in the following directions: 1. The deficit of $13,000 has been liquidated. 2. Twelve new professors and adjunct professors and eighteen new instructors have been added to the staff of teachers in the college, at a cost of $26,633. 3. Salaries, and expenditures in Library, for additional instruction in Law: 1 Professor, $2,500 2 Instructors, 1,500 Library, 1,000 $5,000 4. Salaries, and expenditures in laboratories, for additional instruction in Medicine: 7 Professors, 2 Adjunct Professors, 6 Instructors, $16,000 Increased laboratory appropriation, 1,650 Hospital, etc., 7,500 $25,150 5. Salaries and expenditures for additional instruction in technical Engineering: $3,500 6. Additional expenditures for Library (general), Gymnasium, fuel, administration and miscellaneous: $4,417 The total cost of these new departments, increased teaching power, and improved laboratories amounts to $64,700, or a few dollars in excess of the increased income. 1. Total increase in teaching staff, 35; or 96 per cent. 2. The increase in the number of courses offered has been about 25 per cent. 3. The increase in the number of students has been 126; or 16 per cent. New Professorships. The new professorships which have been established are the following: (1) In the College and the Department of Graduate Studies.

It should be clear, therefore, that the added income both from State appropriation and private endowments, which has come to the University, was absolutely necessary to make this University what it should be in the modern world, offering the best instruction in the five great departments of the College, Law, Medicine, Engineering, and the Graduate School. On its old income, however devoted and able its teachers, it must have languished and fallen away from leadership. Owing to just or inevitable causes, our numbers have not greatly increased, though we have now passed the eight hundred mark, but the scope and quality of instruction have increased many hundred fold. A great modern university of 800 students, comprising well equipped professional schools, cannot do the highest quality of work on an income less than $300,000 a year, as may be discovered by examining the resources and services rendered by other institutions. The Board of Visitors in its memorial to the General Assembly of 1906 petitioned that the sum of $154,000 be appropriated for the pressing needs of the institution in the direction of buildings, equipment, and repairs. The amount appropriated was $85,000. The Board again in 1908 set forth the need for $324,000 for similar purposes. The amount appropriated was $65,000. The amounts appropriated have been wisely used, but, of course, many of these needs still exist and cannot be supplied from any endowment funds. I shall not re-enumerate all of the unsupplied needs, for I am aware of the State's necessities and its other obligations. The Rector and Visitors will ask for no increase in the regular appropriation for purely instructional purposes of the University. They beg, however, most earnestly to set forth three urgent and practical needs of the institution, and to ask that the General Assembly provide for these needs, if the State's resources permit. Two of these needs involve additional annuity, and one necessitates a special appropriation. I. Additional annuity for maintenance of the State Hospital located at the University, $10,000. II. Increase of Fund for the Maintenance of the Property of the University, $5,000. III. A Building for the Department of Chemistry, $75,000. [As a result of the finanical condition of the State only the first of these needs could be provided for by the General Assembly.] GENERAL EQUIPMENT. The beneficence of generous friends and the wise liberality of the State of Virginia have made possible, in addition to an enlarged teaching corps, the following material improvements and additions: 1. The repairing and better equipment of the Anatomy Hall. 2. The provision and equipment of a Histological Laboratory. 3. Further equipment of Bacteriological and Pathological Laboratory. 4. Provision and equipment of a Laboratory for Physiology and Physiological Chemistry. 5. Provision and equipment of an additional Chemical Laboratory. 6. Provision and equipment of a Laboratory for Clinical Diagnosis. 7. Provision and equipment of a Laboratory for Pharmacology, Materia Medica, and Toxicology. 8. Provision and equipment of a Geological Laboratory. 9. The decorating and furnishing of the Public Hall. 10. The repairing, decorating, and refurnishing of the University Chapel. 11. The refurnishing and lighting of the University Library. 12. The erection of Madison Hall, the home of the Young Men's Christian Association. 13. A Residence for the President of the University. 14. The University Commons, which provides an attractive Dining Hall with all modern conveniences and comforts and at the same time furnishes board at such reasonable rates that students in straitened circumstances need not thereby be deprived of daily association with their more fortunate fellows. This Dining Hall will in time become a sort of Memorial Hall; for its stained glass windows will probably commemorate our martial heroes and its walls be hung with portraits and mementoes of our distinguished Alumni. 15. An additional Wing to the Hospital. The Hospital now consists of an administration building and two wings. The addition of the new wing has greatly increased the usefulness of the Hospital, but the wards are already crowded and further enlargement is urgently needed. 16. A Law Building. To meet the demands of the rapidly growing Law Department, a commodious building is in process of erection, to contain suitably arranged and equipped lecture, library, and study halls. 17. A Modern Dispensary Building, as outlined hereafter in connection with the Department of Medicine. BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. During the past four years the heating of the University dormitories, laboratories, and lecture rooms has been extended so as to include East and West Lawn, East and West Range, Anatomy Hall, Medical Hall, Infirmary, Brooks Museum, two Chemical laboratories, Physiological and Pharmacological laboratories; in fact the entire group of University buildings except Dawson Row, Monroe Hill, and the Chapel. Several thousand feet of new sewers have been laid, many old sewer lines which had become congested have been replaced by larger ones, many new water lines put in place, and a new bath room located on West Range. The lighting system has been doubled, both on the grounds and in the buildings. The wiring for the Lawn has been placed underground, which greatly improves the appearance of the Campus. The University has retained the services of Mr. Warren H. Manning of Boston as landscape architect, who is constantly in touch with the needs of the University. He has devised an entrance with a system of drives and walks which will greatly add to the beauty of the grounds. The waste spaces between the Lawns and Ranges have been cleaned out, graded, and planted in grass and shrubs. Part of the Lawn has been underdrained and renovated. Cement walks have been extended to the entrances of the new buildings at the foot of the Lawn. The Dining Hall approach has been terraced and connected with the main lawn by cement walks. Carr's Hill has been graded and terraced, and is now for the first time seen covered with grass. The old ditches and galls have disappeared, and hedges have been planted on many boundaries in order to break up the random and unsightly paths. ORGANIZATION. There are at present 110 officers of instruction and administration in active service, of whom, beside the President, there are 35 professors, 13 associate and adjunct professors, 42 instructors and assistants, and 19 other officers. As now organized, the University comprises twenty-five distinct and independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional (or technical); viz.: The Academic Departments. The College, with the degrees of: Bachelor of Arts; Cultural Bachelor of Science; Vocational Bachelor of Science. The Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of: Graduate in a School; Master of Arts; Master of Science; Doctor of Philosophy. The Professional Departments. The Department of Law, with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The Department of Medicine, with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering, with the degrees of: Civil Engineer; Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; Mining Engineer; Chemical Engineer. The Department of Agriculture, with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. The College. The reduction of the University Fee for Virginia Academic Students to $10, makes the University of Virginia one of the great inexpensive institutions of America. It should be repeated that the sum of $10 entitles the Virginia Academic Student not only to tuition and matriculation but to all the advantages of Gymnasium, Hospital, Library, etc. The reduction of living expenses by means of the new Commons, it is believed, enables the student to live here as cheaply as at any State University in this country. Since 1904-05, the numerical strength of the College Faculty has been nearly doubledâthe increase being about 90%, counting instructors of all ranks; and the programme of Academic electives has been greatly broadened at the same time. In spite of the fact that within five years the formal entrance requirements have been raised to fourteen units, the number of Students enrolled in the College has increased; while the enrollment for the present session breaks all previous records. The usefulness of the College in the life of the Nation has been much enhanced by the institution of the degree of Bachelor of Science. The Cultural B. S. is open to candidates for a Collegiate degree who cannot offer a classical language; while the Vocational B. S. is designed for those who desire to fit themselves for some vocation for which special training in one of the Natural or Mathematical Sciences is necessary. For prospective students of Law, Medicine, or Engineering, the time of procuring the B. A., or the Cultural B. S., may be shortened, since the first year's work in a professional course may be counted in lieu of a year of College work. The notable increase in power and efficiency of the College is the source of profound gratification to the friends of the institution. Department of Graduate Studies. Graduate courses are now offered in all the Academic Schools of the University, and the number of students pursuing them is rapidly increasing. Just credit is given for equivalent work done at Colleges and Universities of recognized grade, and credit is further given for graduate work in any University holding membership in the Association of American Universities. The University of Virginia is the only Southern institution holding membership in this Association, and its work is recognized by all members of this Association and by the German and English Universities. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. The teaching staff of this Department has been recently enlarged by the addition of a professor and two instructors, and another professor will be added shortly. With the session of 1909-10, the new Three Year Course was inaugurated with a large entering class. The new course is unusually comprehensive and the large number of elective courses offered gives the student a broad scope for his selection. All of the old subjects have been also retained and expanded. Work on the Law Building is now being rapidly pushed, so that it is hoped that the building will be ready for occupancy by September. Last session the total enrollment in the Law Department reached two hundred and ninety-four, going far beyond all previous records; while the list of graduates, the largest in the history of the University, numbered seventy-four. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. The Medical Department has received perhaps the largest share of expansion in the extension of its laboratories and teaching force, and attention is invited to its growth in efficiency, and to the following additions and improvements: 1. A renovated and re-equipped Anatomy Building. 2. An additional Laboratory for Histology and Embryology, with an Adjunct Professor. 3. A Professor of Pathology and an Assistant. 4. A Laboratory for Physiology and Physiological Chemistry. 5. A Professor of Physiology and an Assistant. 6. A Laboratory for Clinical Diagnosis. 7. A Laboratory for Pharmacology, Materia Medica, and Toxicology, placed under the direction of a Professor. 8. Various additions and improvements in the facilities and equipment of the other laboratories; so that the Department is doing very efficient work in all the fundamental sciences. 9. The addition of a new wing to the Hospital, which enabled that institution to treat over 1200 cases last year. 10. Through the generosity of Mr. Charles Steele, of New York, there will be added during the coming year another building to the Hospital plant which will contain a modern teaching Dispensary and a new Clinical Laboratory. 11. The General Assembly of 1910 made an appropriation of $10,000 for the annual maintenance of the Hospital, the appropriation to take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year 1911-12. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. The conspicuous items in the development of this Department have been 1. The addition to the Faculty of Professors of Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Inorganic Chemistry, and Economic Geology. 2. The reorganization of the Courses of Instruction, so that each student is now for three years in constant touch with his special technical studies. 3. The gradual improvement of the facilities for practical work in the Drafting Rooms, the Shops, the Laboratories, and the Field. 4. The provision of an adequate corps of Instructors and Assistants to give to the student individual guidance in his practical exercises. 5. The formulation of the Entrance Requirements on such conditions as will ensure adequate preliminary training on the part of entering students. 6. Large additions of equipment, instruments and machinery for Electrical and Field work. ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. At the beginning of the session of 1905-1906, entrance requirements equivalent to those adopted by the Southern Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools went into effect for all Departments of the University. This was an entirely new departure in the policy of this University; and the change was made with misgivings on the part of some. While the increase in attendance in the College was somewhat affected by the new regulations, the total effect of the change has been recognized as being so highly beneficial that two sessions ago the General Faculty voted to introduce a system of entrance examinations making the requirements for entering this University as exacting, practically, as those of any university in America. The new entrance requirements went into effect in June, 1909. LIBRARY. The Library has been handsomely furnished with reference shelves, working tables, and electric reading lamps, and is much frequented by students. The collection of Virginia and other Southern literature is becoming particularly valuable, while the general appropriation for the purchase of books has been largely increased. The use of the library has grown with its increasing facilities and improved service. The circulation of library books up to January 1, 1910, shows an increase of just 50 per cent. over the circulation of the same period ending January 1, 1909. The Library is a great force in the life of the University, and it is designed to add constantly to its power. PHYSICAL CULTURE. To the Director of the Gymnasium and his Assistant has been added an Associate Director of Athletics. This plan of having a regularly employed officer in charge of the training of athletes and in control of all athletic sports has proved so valuable that it has been put on a permanent basis. The regulations relating to athletics have also been thoroughly revised, and the success of athletics under these strict regulations has given much encouragement to all lovers of pure sport. RELIGIOUS WORK. The University authorities encourage in every way the work of this department. An elective course in Biblical history and literature with academic credits is offered under an exceptionally capable professor. This provides for a scholarly and non-sectarian study of the scriptures. Through the Faculty committee on religious exercises some of the leading divines in America are secured for the Sunday services in the chapel. The Young Men's Christian Association with its handsomely equipped building is the center of religious life at the University. The majority of the students are members of this organization, and hundreds of them are enrolled in its Bible and mission study classes. In addition to the regular weekly prayer meetings occasional evangelistic meetings are conducted. Visiting the hospital and mountain sections, teaching and preaching in the neighboring Sunday-schools and chapels, and providing the partial support of an alumnus in China are some of the many good works of the Association. ATTENDANCE. The number of students thus far registered in the University during the session of 1909-1910 is 801. This is the largest number ever enrolled in the history of the institution. SUMMER SCHOOL. Since the reorganization of the Summer School two years ago, when the majority of the classes were arranged with special reference to the needs of high-school and college teachers, and college and university students, the growth in attendance has been remarkable, the number for the summer of 1909 reaching 1144, of whom 648 were in the School of Methods and 596 in the University courses. 212 of these were holders of college degrees. The faculty consisted of nearly fifty men and women representing many of the best colleges, universities, professional schools, and technical schools in the United States. Including the Summer School, the University of Virginia now gives instruction to nearly two thousand students each year. THE COLONNADE CLUB. One of the most significant features of our University life has been the establishment of the Colonnade Club, considered in the light of its remarkable progress during the past year. From a purely local membership, chiefly confined to the Faculty and teaching staff, the scope of the Club has latterly broadened into an earnest effort to make the Club a practical means of bringing the general body of Alumni into closer personal and social relations with their University and with each other, to the manifest advantage of all concerned. Basing its activities on the belief that alumni-visiting on a broad scale is essential to every general movement for the University's upbuilding, the Colonnade Club, numbering now nearly 800 membersâall influential, and many occupying positions of high distinction in the professional, official, and business life of forty States and several distant countriesâaims to develop the habit and increase the pleasure of alumni-visiting. Having already accomplished much in both these directions, it has also made a most promising beginning in the work of providing the facilities needed for such visiting.
