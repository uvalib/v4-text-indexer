      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 133. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 153. For admission to the College, the Department of Law, or the Deparment of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of units for entrance to the three departments mentioned above, see, for the College, page 117; for the Department of Law, page 139; for the Department of Engineering, page 173. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are given below in tabulated form. Fuller definitions of the units may be had upon application to the Dean.

ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty (see pages 66-69). The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this State. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1919 9-11 A.M. 11 A.M.-1 P.M. 3-5 P.M.

      <field name="fulltext">ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Conditions for the Accrediting of Schools.âA school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the University should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the University will be sent to inspect the school, and to report on such matters as the quality of instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, and the efficiency of the equipment, especially library and laboratory facilities. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of accredited schools and published in the catalogue of the University. Each school must meet the following requirements: (1) A course of study covering not less than four years of high-school work, based on at least seven years of competent elementary instruction, and embracing at least sixteen units. These sixteen units must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, and one unit of History. Those schools that wish to prepare students for the study of Latin in the University must offer instruction in this subject to the extent of four units. (2) A teaching force of not less than three teachers, each of whom devotes his entire time to high-school instruction, and conducts not more than seven recitation periods a day. The University will scrutinize with extreme care any school in which any instructor teaches more than six periods a day. All teachers should possess college training, and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. List of Accredited Schools.âThe following is a list of the schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University. This list is revised annually by the Committee, and any school which fails to report to the Committee when requested to do so, or which fails to maintain the standard above specified, may be removed therefrom: Academy of Eastern College (Manassas).

Graduates of such schools will be credited with the thirteen approved units and will be given examinations upon the other two units required for entrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will be admitted to registration only provided he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of three dollars. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee of three dollars, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the ninteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-fifth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on REGULATIONS. excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 211. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several department faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments; The College, page 119; the Department of Law, pages 149-151; the Department of Medicine, page 159; the Department of Engineering, page 191. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license REGULATIONS. to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pages 75-76. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Commons, see page 75. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Feyerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 114. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 208.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES. EXPENSES. Payment of Fees.âAll University charges and rent of rooms in the university buildings are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit, but deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for that term. Return of Fees.âUnder no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the University is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees pro rata. Remission of Fees is made in the following cases: (1) In accordance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), fees are remitted to Virginia students as detailed below under University Charges. In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. (2) White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. (3) Ministers of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. University Fee. The university fee, $40 ($10 for Virginia students in the Academic Departments. $20 for Virginia students in the Department of Engineering), goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the EXPENSES. use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff (see page 208); and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 72). It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. Contingent Deposit. The contingent deposit of $10 is intended to cover any damage to university property for which the student is responsible, and any fines incurred by violating the rules of the library. (See page 205.) It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it. Tuition Fees. In the College: For Virginia students, nothing; for students from other States, $95 for a regular course; those who, by special permission of the faculty, take courses aggregating less than fifteen session-hours in any one session (see page 118), must pay for tuition, in one School $50, in two Schools, $60, in three Schools $75, in four Schools $95. In the Department of Graduate Studies: For Virginia students, nothing; for students from other States, $50 in one School, $60 in two Schools, $25 each in three or more Schools. In Analytical Chemistry: $40 for each course.* * In addition to the tuition fee, there is a laboratory fee of $10 for each course, and a deposit of $10 is required ($15 for two courses) to cover cost of apparatus. The courses in Analytical Chemistry, being professional courses, are not provided for by the regular tuition fees in the Academic Departments, nor are they included among the courses in which free tuition is given to Virginians and other privileged students. Students from other states than Virginia taking one or both courses in Analytical Chemistry in connection with other courses in the College or the Department of Graduate Studies pay a total tuition fee of $100. In the Department of Law: For regular course, $100; students taking an irregular course pay for tuition according to the relation which the amount of work taken bears to the regular course. For such course the tuition fee may be estimated approximately in dollars as three-tenths of the total number of lecture periods. In the Department of Medicine: $100. In the Department of Engineering: For each collegiate course, $25. For courses in Analytical Chemistry, see above. Virginia students are relieved of tuition in collegiate courses. The fee for each technical lecture course is $30; for each practice course in Drawing, $15; for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-work, or Fieldwork, $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials, but the student is held further responsible for breakage. EXPENSES. Laboratory Fees. These fees, which vary in amount for different courses, will be found under the Announcements of Courses in the several departments. BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Commons or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Registrar. The University Commons. This building, conveniently situated near the center of the University, provides an attractive dining hall, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Table board is now furnished at $19 per single calendar month, or, if taken for the entire session, at $18 per month. It is hoped that it will be possible to continue these rates. University Dormitories. Rules.âStudents desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May 1. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Two students may occupy a room together, each paying half the rent. Rates.âAll rooms are rented unfurnished, but the University has arranged with a local dealer to place in each room the necessary articles, consisting of one three-piece enameled bed with comfortable springs, one thoroughly sanitary all-cotton mattress, one good feather pillow, one solid oak six-drawer chiffonier with mirror, one student rocker with cane seat and back, one student straight chair and one student table with 24 Ã 36-inch top. This furniture will be placed in the room before the opening of the session, so that the room will be ready for occupancy immediately upon arrival. The student will pay the local dealer $15 per session as rent for the furniture. The rental for the necessary furniture for a room occupied by two students will be $20. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, etc., or be prepared to purchase them here. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat and electric light, except where otherwise specified. Janitor service is included in the rate given, except in the case of the Randall Building. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelors' EXPENSES. Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. Randall Building. Single rooms, 10 Ã 14, 10 Ã 15, 10 Ã 16 (32) $35 Double rooms, 14 Ã 15, 15 Ã 15, 15 Ã 17 (9) 40 Double room with study, 9â² 6â³ Ã 11â² 6â³ (1) 50 East Range. Rooms in old gymnasium building (8) $60 Other rooms (26) 72 West Range. Rooms, no heat, but provided with grate (4) $60 Other rooms (20) 72 East and West Lawns. Rooms in Bachelors' Row (9) $70 Other rooms (27) 75 Dawson's Row. Rooms (56) $75 APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate. THE COLLEGE.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 86.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS.

This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professors in charge of the courses accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the college, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer School or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 63. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided he is more than twenty years old on the day of registration and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. REGULATIONS. The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. Maximum and Minimum of Session-Hours in One Session.âEach student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours. This number may be increased in the following cases: THE COLLEGE. (1) First-year students may take eighteen session-hours, provided (a) three of these be in Greek A1, Greek A2, German 1, French 1, or Spanish 1; or (b) the student in question is credited with six hours of advanced standing. (2) Other than first-year students may take eighteen session-hours, provided the student (a) has passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is repeating a course on which he failed in the preceding session, or (c) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (3) Other than first-year students may take twenty-one session-hours, provided they have passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, with a general average of at least ninety per cent. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Academic Faculty. Physical training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Grade Required for Reexamination.âA student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent, but not below sixty-five per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to reÃ«xamination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each reÃ«xamination is five dollars, and must be paid to the Bursar on or before July 15. An applicant for a degree who fails on a single term of not more than one of his courses during the last year of his candidacy, is entitled to a special examination before Final Day on the work of that term, and will receive credit for the course, provided the result of this special examination entitles him to a grade of seventy-five per cent for the term in question, considered independently and without reference to his grade for the other two terms. In such cases no reÃ«xamination fee is charged. Minimum Grade Required.âAny student whose average grade in all his courses for any term is less than fifty per cent, will be dropped from the rolls. Any first-year student whose average grade for any term is fifty per cent or more, but who attains in no one of his courses a grade of sixty-five per cent, will be put on probation for the term next ensuing, and if THE COLLEGE. he again fails to attain for the current term a grade of sixty-five per cent in at least one of his courses, he will be dropped from the rolls. Any student other than a first-year student whose average grade for any term is fifty per cent or more, but who attains in no one of his courses a grade of seventy-five per cent, will be put on probation for the term next ensuing, and if he again fails to attain for the current term a grade of seventy-five per cent in at least one of his courses, or sixty-five per cent in at least two of his courses, he will be dropped from the rolls. A student who through neglect of his work is evidently making no real progress in a course may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question; and if, for the current term or for any succeeding term of the current session, his grade in any one of his remaining courses falls below forty per cent, he will be put on probation. Advisers.âTo each first-year student is assigned, before his registration is completed, a member of the faculty as his adviser, whose acquaintance he should cultivate, and whom he may feel free to consult on any question touching his work or his life as a student of this university. Subjects of Study in a student's schedule may be changed, dropped, or added to, only with the consent of his adviser and of the professors concerned, and only within the first two weeks of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes at any time during the first month of the session. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to such penalties as his professors may impose, or, in serious cases, to faculty discipline. No student who has, for any reason, been absent from more than fifty per cent of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of the examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge, not later than the end of the registration period of the following session. Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade in each course. Preliminary reports on attendance and class-standing are made on November 4 to the parent or guardian of every first-year student. The Dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. THE COLLEGE. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the college. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Education and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degrees, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer School on which college credit is given (see page 200). For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 117. The requirements for a baccalaureate degree are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen, subject to the specific requirements detailed below, from the following groups, among which are distributed all the undergraduate courses having credit value toward a baccalaureate degree.

The following programs of study for inducted members of the Student Army Training Corps in the College were drawn up at the beginning of the session 1918-1919, in accordance with the orders of the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department, in such a way as to provide for three of the four terms of three months each into which the academic year was to be divided. The supposition was that students of twenty years or more would remain in college for one term, those of nineteen years for two terms, and those of eighteen years for three terms. Each student was required to take courses aggregating fifty-three hours a week, which must include Military Instruction and the course on the Issues of the war, the remaining number of hours to be distributed as prescribed below among subjects designated by the War Department as "Allied Subjects." The number of hours assigned to each course is given in parenthesis. For the method of computing this number, see p. 129. In the choice of elective courses, the student was advised to take such courses in the various terms as would secure for him as great a continuity of work as possible.

      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President Richard Heath Dabney, M.A., Ph.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Required for Admission to the Department.âA candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. Required for Admission as Applicant for a Degree.âIn order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least eight professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for their successful prosecution. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiences. REGULATIONS. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Change of Subjects of Study after registration can be made only with the consent of the Dean and of the professors concerned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any Academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School. The Master's Degrees. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from this university, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements, is entitled to a master's degree upon his successful completion of four graduate courses, chosen in accordance with the restrictions detailed below: No C course which a candidate has offered as part of the work credited for baccaleureate degree (pp. 123-124) may be counted for a master's degree. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses during the last year of his work for a master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the Academic Faculty. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has successfully completed four graduate courses, chosen with the approval of the Academic Faculty. These four courses must be in at least three distinct subjects, and in three different Academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty. Three of the subjects must be cognate, which means that they must be selected from kindred groups of subjects, such as, for example, languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics, and government, or philosophy, education, and biology. The degree of Master of Science is conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science (page 123), who has successfully completed four graduate courses chosen in accordance with the regulations prescribed for the Master of Arts above. The degree of Master of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is conferred upon a holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject (page 124), who has successfully completed four graduate courses selected from among those offered in his special subject, or from among other courses which meet with the approval of the professor or professors in charge of his special subject. Doctor of Philosophy. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts or the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in three subjects, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. These subjects must be cognate (see page 134), and must be chosen, with the approval of the Committee on Rules and Courses, from at least three Academic Schools. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. Any student taking a D course in any subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the Academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's major subject. The dissertation must be submitted to the Academic Faculty not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the faculty's approval shall be written (typewritten, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size, shall be bound, and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If the dissertation is accepted by the faculty as satisfactory the copy submitted shall immediately become the property of the University. Before the degree is conferred the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $245 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginians and other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pages 73-77. Applicants for degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a period of their candidacy, under the conditions above stated, are required to register each year during such period of non-residence, and to pay the annual university fee ($10 for Virginians, $40 for students from other States). SCHEDULE OF LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES, 1918-1919. Any change in the lecture-hours of a course involves a corresponding change in the examination date. The lecture-hours of courses which meet at hours not corresponding to the periods indicated below will be found under Announcement of Courses (pages 93-117). Their examination dates will be announced later. Many C courses and most D courses meet at hours not arranged until the beginning of the session.

Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised DEPARTMENT OF LAW. the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-95, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âBy action of the Visitors, the new home of the Law School has been named Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other University buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Liberal provision has been made for heat, light, and ventilation. Special care has been taken to provide comfortable seats and desks in the lecture halls. Law Library.âThe Library contains about fourteen thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from an endowment of ten thousand dollars, by Mr. W. W. Fuller ('78), of New York City, make possible the addition of several hundred volumes annually. The Library contains the English Reports, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; modern selected and annotated reports, such as the American Decisions, Reports and State Reports, Lawyers' Reports Annotated, American and English Annotated Cases, English Ruling Cases, etc., together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests (including the Century and Decennial editions), and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of text-books, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have all the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes, without extra charge. The Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of The Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its fifth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of at least eighteen years before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fifteen units, of which three must be in English and one in History. Notice is given that an additional requirement of one year of work in a standard college will become effective with the beginning of the session of 1920-21. The Subjects accepted for Admission and their values in units are given in tabulated form on page 140. The applicant for admission may enter (1) by certificate or (2) by examination. (1) For Admission by Certificate the candidate must file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from some recognized institution of collegiate rank or from an accredited high school; but admission by certificate from accredited public high schools in Virginia is extended only to graduates of four-year high schools. The certificate must bear in all cases the signature of the head of the school; must specify the character and content of each course offered for entrance credit; must give the length of time devoted to the course, and the dates of the examinations; and must give the candidate's grades in percentages. Each unit in the entrance requirements is the equivalent of one full year of high school work, including five periods a week at least forty mintues each during not less than thirty-six weeks. For schools in which the number of periods given to any study, or the length of the period, is below the DEPARTMENT OF LAW. standard here specified, the credit for such study will be reduced pro rata. In the scientific subjects two hours of laboratory instruction will be counted as the equivalent of one hour of recitation. High school courses in physics and chemistry, otherwise adequate, will be allowed half credit, when individual laboratory work is not done by the student or is not attested by proper note-books filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must, in all cases, take the entrance examinations. (2) For Admission by Examination the candidate must present himself for test at the University in June or September, according to the dates given in the Programme of Entrance Examinations, which may be had by applying to the Registrar.

The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which an additional fee of five dollars is charged. The fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. Satisfactory certificates as to character and age are in all cases required. Special Students.âAn applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. Every applicant for admission as a special student shall make written application to the Dean of the University, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for reigstration. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the DEPARTMENT OF LAW. student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $425 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, washing and books. An average estimate would be $500 per session, reckoning board, lodging, and washing at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $40; and the tuition fee is $100 for the regular work of each session. For special students who desire to take selected courses, the tuition fee is estimated according to the ratio which the work chosen bears to the whole. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-six weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and lectures, and partly through the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles, and in forcing the student to extract for himself the doctrine which the cases establish. The course as now arranged gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the case-book will, therefore, be used more extensively than heretoforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbook and lecture. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconception of legal principles on the part of the student. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the course on Equity Procedure, Virginia Pleading, Practice at Law, Code Pleading, Criminal Procedure, and Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the Pleading and Procedure courses, every student is required to draw, and submit for correction and criticism, all of the principal pleadings, orders, decrees, and other forms encountered in actual litigation. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have attained the age of twenty-one years; have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be either the course in Virginia Pleading or that in Code Pleading. It follows that of the courses termed "elective," a required minimum is in fact obligatoryâthe candidate being permitted to exercise an election among them. OUTLINE OF COURSES. The course, as outlined below, contemplates an average of ten lecture periods (or fifteen hours) per week. Each session is divided into three terms. See table, page 147. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term. See Schedule of Examinations, page 148. The following outline indicates the extent of the courses offered: TABULAR OUTLINE OF COURSES. [Asterisks indicate elective courses.âLecture periods are one and a half hours each.] FIRST YEAR.

The prize consists of fifty dollars in cash, and is awarded each year to a student in the Department of Law for the best essay on some legal or sociological subject. GENERAL REGULATIONS. 1. Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a certificate from the Dean of the University that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the office of the Dean of the Law School and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new DEPARTMENT OF LAW. or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the Dean, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work.âStudents who are deficient in the work of one year will be permitted to take but a limited amount of the work of the succeeding year. 6. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than ten periods per week. 7. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 8. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See Requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 143. 9. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures upon any subject may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on a limited number of such subjects the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. 10. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause by the faculty. 11. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 150 periods, or, in lieu thereof, a grade of 75 per centum on courses aggregating 200 periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. The result of one or more special examinations, granted for cause under existing regulations, may be considered in determining whether this requirement has been met. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. The foregoing provisions do not affect students who have been permitted, for cause, to take less than two-thirds of a full year's work. Such students will be subject to exclusion or other conditions as may be prescribed. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 13. Students Admitted on Terms of Diligence, by reason of previous unsatisactory record in the Law School or other department of the University, will be held to an average class grade (or examination grade, in classes in which class grades are not recorded) of 75 per centum, in the work of the first term. Failure to attain this grade without satisfactory cause, unless the result of his other examinations shall raise his average grade to the required standard, will operate to exclude such delinquent from the Law School for the remainder of the session. An average class grade of less than 75 per centum, at the end of any term, will be regarded as evidence of a lack of the diligence required by the terms of this condition. 14. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per centum on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of such student's work is indicated at the end of the second term, he will be required to withdraw from the Law School. 15. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 16. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or other providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 17. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted, unless prompt application be made therefor. 18. ReexaminationsâThird-Year Students.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects during their third year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 19. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 20. Honor System.âAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System. 21. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15th of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied on application to the Dean. 22. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School.</field>

A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The minimum requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four year high school education or its full equivalent and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS. (a) For admission to the two year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four year course of at least fourteen units (fifteen after Jan. 1, 1920) in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. (b) Credits for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least eleven units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (Three units required) Literature and Composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (Two units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (Two units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (One unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commerical Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, freehand and mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, Musicâappreciation or harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. PREMEDICAL COLLEGE COURSE. In addition to the high school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion of thirty session hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. Chemistry (a) 6 Physics (b) 4 Biology (c) 4 English Composition and Literature (d) 3 Other non-science subjects, including one modern foreign language (e) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. French or German. Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy. Psychology. Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry. Additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGIATE SUBJECTS. (a) Chemistry. Six session-hours required, of which at least four must be in general inorganic chemistry, including two session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in qualitative analysis may be counted as general inorganic chemistry. The remaining two session-hours may consist of additional work in general chemistry or of work in analytic or organic chemistry. (b) Physics. Four session-hours required, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in trigonometry and solid geometry. (c) Biology. Four session-hours required, of which two must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of four session-hours in general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany, but not by botany alone. (d) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (e) Non-Science Subjects Including One Modern Foreign Language. Of the thirty session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least nine, including three session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biologic sciences. At least three of these nine session-hours must be in a modern foreign language. When the student has presented for admission to college two units of high school work in a modern foreign language, he must complete three session-hours in the same language, this work to be the continuation and not a repetition of his high school work. When he does not present two units of a modern foreign language for admission to college, he must complete work aggregating at least four session-hours in a modern language. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this university are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credits early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. Further information concerning the character of entrance requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine. In planning the two-year college work, students are advised to take English, mathematics, biology, and a modern language during the first year, and to take physics and chemistry during the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics, and it is desirable to avoid the lapse of a year between the general chemistry of the college and the organic and physiological chemistry of the first year of the medical curriculum. Students who have completed general chemistry and who have one more year of college work for entrance to the medical school, are advised to take some courses in chemistry (e. g., analytical, physical, or organic chemistry) during their last year in college. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places in the First-Year Class.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to thirty-six. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. Those intending to enter the Department of Medicine are advised to ascertain at once by correspondence with the Dean of the Department of Medicine whether their high-school and college courses entitle them to admission to the first-year class. For this purpose there may be obtained from the Dean a blank form on which the necessary information may be entered in full. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 18, 1919). DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Any applicant whose record, certified by the proper official of the college last attended, has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the first-year class, may at any time before the registration period have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee of the first year. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or other providential cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. There are well-equipped laboratories for the study of organic chemistry, biochemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year to the study of disease in living persons. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accomplished by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 3,000 cases. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Journal Club reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. REGULATIONS, EXPENSES, ETC. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination, a grade of eighty per cent is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent but not less than seventy per cent, the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record conditioned is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this university, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in point as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Organic Chemistry, 15 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Biochemistry, 8 points. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points; Pharmacology, 8 points. Whenever in the judgment of the faculty a student is receiving too many records below the grade of passed, the faculty may prescribe special conditions upon which the student may remain in the Department of Medicine, or may require his withdrawal therefrom. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent, but as much as seventy per cent, on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are admitted to these examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. For a special examination held at any other time than the regular stated periods during the session or in September a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. The Fall Examinations for 1919-1920 begin September 15 and close September 20. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe tuition fee for each year is $100. The annual expenses, exclusive of tuition, are $40 for the university fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $315 for living expenses, and $30 for books. In the courses in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. The University also offers a course leading to the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This course includes two years of group electives in academic subjects followed by the first two years of the medical course. Since the academic group-electives satisfy the entrance requirements DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. of the Medical Department, students who can spend only two years in college before entering upon the study of medicine are advised to plan their work so as to secure this degree. For further information regarding these degrees, see pp. 123-125. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. One will be awarded in September, 1919. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least three hundred and fifty hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âSix hours weekly until November 1; twelve hours weekly from November 1 to the end of the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course and Anatomy 3 each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the third term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and eight hours of laboratory work weekly until November 1; three lectures or recitations and six hours of laboratory work weekly from November 1 to the end of the second term. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues, and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of seventy per cent in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent for admission to pathology. Dr. Jordan, assisted by Mr. Pierce. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE.

A grade of seventy per cent on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough, assisted by Mr. Lewis, Mr. McCutchan and Mr. Reynolds. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âTen hours weekly through the first and second terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. In addition, a course is given in topographic anatomy, with the aid of cross sections of the human body. At the end of this course a practical examination is given, covering the work of Anatomy 1, 2 and 3. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Physiology.âFour hours' work weekly of lectures, recitations and demonstrations throughout the year. Six hours weekly of laboratory work in the first and second terms. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition, and the central nervous system. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures as an integral part of the study of each subject. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of seventy per cent in Histology and in Biochemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the session and two additional hours a week in the third term. The work in pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of passed in Histology. Bacteriology and pathology are taught in a combined course. Emphasis is laid upon the medical and public health aspects of bacteriology. Autopsies and the study of gross and microscopic specimens supply the practical work accompanying the systematic study of pathology. Opportunity is given selected students for advanced work. Dr. Marshall. Pharmacology.âFive hours of lectures, recitations and demonstrations and six hours of laboratory work during the third term. In this course a study is made of the chemical characteristics and physiological action of representative drugs from the different pharmacological groups. An average grade of seventy per cent on the first two terms of Physiology together with the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Fox and Mr. Vonderlehr. Journals.âIn connection with the work in Physiology, Bacteriology and Pathology, the second-year students meet with their instructors for one hour each week from the first of December to the end of the session for reports and discussion of the current literature of the above sciences. Three reports are made at each meeting by the students. Physical Diagnosis.âFour hours weekly during the third term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is especially given to study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin and Dr. Magruder. THIRD YEAR. Materia Medica.âThree hours of lectures and recitations and three hours of laboratory work weekly during the first half of the third year. The more important drugs and preparations of the PharmacopÅia, together with newer non-official remedies which bid fair to attain or have attained considerable use, from the subject of study. In the laboratory the student becomes familiar with the peculiarities and methods of preparation of the different preparations of the PharmacopÅia, as well as with the solubilities and other characteristics of the more important drugs. Especial attention is paid to chemical and pharmaceutical incompatibility. Prescription writing is dealt with by lecture and frequent practical exercises. Dr. Waddell. Toxicology.âThree hours of lectures and recitations and three hours of laboratory work weekly during the last half of the second term. This course is, to a considerable extent, a review of the pharmacological actions of poisons and their antagonists. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Some attention is given to the methods of separation and identification. Dr. Waddell. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the first and second terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those laboratory methods which are helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the examination of blood, urine, sputum, gastric contents, feces, spinal fluid, exudates and transudates. Instruction is given in the recently completed Clinical Laboratory in the north pavilion of the hospital, which is well equipped with the most modern instruments and apparatus. Dr. Bray. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the session; nine hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the out-patient department and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the out-patient department, and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Daniel, Dr. Nelson and Dr. Smith. Surgery and Gynecology.âFive hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; with six hours weekly in the out-patient department, two hours weekly in ward rounds in the hospital, and one hour weekly in X-ray diagnosis for one-fourth the session. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the principles and practice of surgery, surgical diseases, surgical diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialties, orthopedics, genito-urinary surgery, etc. The out-patient department course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the out-patient department affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Woodberry and Dr. Wright. Obstetrics.âFive hours weekly of lectures, recitations and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with patients in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. These records are considered in the final grading of the student. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time between them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the first term. In this course is given also instruction in electro-therapeutics. Dr. Davis. Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the second term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Dermatology.âA brief course of lectures is given on this subject, embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical practice. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the third term. Dr. Davis. Therapeutics.âThe treatment of internal diseases is discussed in a systematic course of lectures and practically demonstrated in the wards of the hospital. Especial attention is given to the bedside teaching of this subject, the student being required to follow closely and make a record of the results of the therapeutic agents employed in cases assigned to him. Dr. Flippin. Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; three hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offers many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Woodberry and Dr. Wright. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery: Surgical Pathology.âAn optional course. Two hours weekly during one-half the session. This course is intended to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery and consists of lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, demonstrations of fresh tissues obtained from the operating rooms, and examination of microscopic sections. The student reviews pathological technique and frozen section work is emphasized. Omitted, 1918-1919. Dr. Goodwin. Clinical Pathological Conferences.âOne hour weekly is assigned for the study of pathologic material in connection with the clinical aspects of cases coming to autopsy. A history of the case is presented by the student in charge, the autopsy is reviewed, the tissue and microscopic sections are examined, and all the information thus derived is collated and contrasted. Omitted, 1918-1919. Dr. Marshall. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, and is required to prepare the history of patients and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new-born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department, and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. Dr. Macon. Forensic Medicine.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. Dr. Waddell. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly during the first two terms, supplemented by regular two- to three-hour clinics twice weekly throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Hygiene.âOne hour weekly throughout the session, and thirteen additional hours in the second term. The course begins with a historical sketch of the developments of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH. The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor.

The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time three additional units of three stories each. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The three pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 200 beds; of these, upwards of 160 are available and used for clinical teaching. The recently completed north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designed series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT. CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS. Dr. Flippin, Chief of Staff. Dr. Daniel. Dr. Hedges. Dr. Goodwin. Dr. Compton. Dr. Nelson. Dr. Rea. Dr. Neff. Dr. Woodberry. Dr. Wright. Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. Clinics are held three times a week for general medical, surgical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and twice weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service, and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student, under the supervision of an instructor, are a part of the organization of this department. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital.

Other electives which may be offered are History of English and American Literature (1 unit), History (4 units), Latin (4 units), Greek (3 units), German (4 units), French (4 units), Spanish (4 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. PROGRAMS OF STUDY. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, or Mining Engineering. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechaniical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer.

EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expenses of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: Outside Students Virginians University Fee $ 40 $ 20 Tuition and Laboratory Fees (average) 120 80 Living Expenses (for nine months) 290 290 Books and Drawing Materials 20 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 45 Total for average conditions $515 $455 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College. The fee for each collegiate class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 per class for Physics and $15 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. The fee for each technical lecture-course is $30, for each practice-course in drawing $15, for each laboratory or practice-course in Engineering, Shop-work, or Fieldwork, $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average under war conditions is $32 a month, the minimum $22, and a reasonable maximum $37. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $80 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sore. No allowances are made for clothing or travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the university fee, the contingent deposit of $10 and the tuition and laboratory fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. work of that term. The result of the examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing is estimated at 20 points; the written examination at 80 points. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. 10. A student on probation, who in the next term makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, shall be at once dropped from the rolls. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professors in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. and must in addition pass a practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on.

They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense social and economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the commonwealth, the Faculty of the Department of Engineering has rearranged the courses of instruction in this topic and brought them together into the Spring Term, so as to form a special course in highway engineering for the benefit of young men from Virginia who wish to go into public highway work. To such Virginians, if adequately prepared and recommended, free scholarships will be given. Application should be made to the Dean, accompanied by recommendations from the DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. State Highway Commissioner or from the Board of Supervisors of the applicant's county. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. During 1912 still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternating-current generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the applicances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Duddell double projection oscillograph, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, the Carey-Foster bridge and others.

CREDIT IN OTHER COLLEGES. The work of the Summer School is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students who satisfy the entrance requirements of these colleges have no difficulty in securing transfer of credit, not only for the courses for which University of Virginia college credit is allowed, but for a very large number of other courses, professional and vocational, which are not offered in the regular session of the University. These courses are numbered from 100 to 199 in the summer school catalogue. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. Courses are offered meeting the requirement of the Department of Public Instruction for every form of summer-school certificate issued by the Department, but especial emphasis is placed upon courses leading to the summer-school professional certificateâhigh-school gradeâwhich entitles the holder to teach in the high schools of the State.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES. STUDENT ACTIVITIES. THE VIRGINIA UNION. The Virginia Union was organized for the general purpose of directing and coÃ¶rdinating various phases of student activity. It has set for itself the three-fold function of initiating, promoting, and supervising movements that merit student attention and deserve student patronage. Its activities include intercollegiate debating, oratorical contests, and, through the coÃ¶peration of the faculty Committee on Public Celebrations, the control of miscellaneous lectures, concerts, and other entertainments. The union gives at least one public program each term and holds informal entertainments at frequent intervals. Membership is extended to students, faculty and alumni of the University, on payment of an annual fee of one dollar. All business is conducted through an executive board composed of both student and faculty members, elected annually. LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University are two literary societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls they hold debates and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debating and oratory, and each organization contests for intersociety prizes. PUBLICATIONS. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students, is published by the students with the advisory assistance of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, and appears at monthly intervals, eight times during the session. As a stimulus to literary activity, the Magazine offers every year three medals: One for the best poem, one for the best short story, and one for the best essay, of student authorship, appearing in one of the numbers of the publication. The awards are made by alumni committees, one committee for each of the three medals. College Topics is a semi-weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association, and devoted to the interests of athletics and the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. Under the title of The Virginia Law Review the undergraduate students of the Law Department conduct a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other state university in America. The purpose of the Association is to promote growth in Christian fellowship among its members and enlist them in Christian work for their fellow students and for others not connected with the University. The Association actively promotes the moral, social and spiritual life of the University. Work.âThe Association organizes classes for the voluntary study of the Bible, of Home and Foreign Missions, and of Social Work, under the leadership of students and members of the faculty; maintains a weekly meeting held on Tuesday evening at 7.30; assists through its membership the work of the churches and Sunday schools in the vicinity of the University; sends deputations of students to various preparatory and high schools in the State; sends speakers on educational and religious topics to all parts of the State; supports a representative in the Foreign Mission Field; maintains medical clinics and night schools in the surrounding country; invites eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters; and stimulates social intercourse among the students by means of receptions, lectures, entertainments and other social events. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained by an endowment fund of over $16,000, subsbcribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the university grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. For many years regular Sunday services were conducted in it until easy access to the city churches rendered that needless. It is now used for occasional services addressed by religious leaders of national repute, thus supplementing the religious meetings of the churches and the Y. M. C. A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHYSICAL TRAINING. PHYSICAL TRAINING. William Alexander Lambeth, M.D., Ph.D. Director of the Gymnasium Henry Haden Lannigan Associate Director of Athletics Fletcher Drummond Woodward Instructor in Physical Training Frank Wesley Davies Assistant Instructor in Physical Training Frank McCutchan Assistant Instructor in Physical Training The method of instruction pursued does not follow blindly any so-called system, but proper attention is given to all methods which in whole or in part have proved useful or effective. The importance of individual training is in every case recognized, especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue with safety or profit general or concerted exercises. Students are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the director, and are urged to avail themselves of this privilege soon after they enter the University. The examination includes an accurate measurement of the student's physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs, and the strength of the principal muscular groups. Upon the basis of the facts thus ascertained, advice is given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances. The examination is repeated at intervals, note is taken of any improvement, and new exercises are suggested. In addition to individual work, daily instruction is given to classes in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure-running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubsâadapted as nearly as possible to the needs of individuals of varying age and physical condition. The exercises are gradual and progressive commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to others more complicated and difficult. During the winter months instruction in gymnastics which require great strength and agility is given to those who are fitted for it by previous training. This work is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament held usually in the early part of March. The faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the university athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by passing in doubtful cases a strength test, in addition to the regular physical examination. For members of the football teams, 1,300 points are required; for members of the baseball team, 1,100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: Strength of back in pounds, strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most developing appliances, as well as with apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined PHYSICAL TRAINING. running track, a visitors' gallery, lavatory, trophy room, and various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains hot and cold baths (needle, shower, spray, tub, and plunge), bowling alleys, ball cage, boiler room, lockers, locker room, and dressing rooms. The building is heated by hot water, ventilated by airshafts, registers and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and is free of cost to every student. Classes are held at hours which do not conflict with other university duties. For the course in Physical Training with credit value for the B.A. and B.S. degrees, see page 114. ATHLETICS. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, and includes two athletic fields, Lambeth Field and Lefevre Field, as well as a driving park, set with trees and hedges and containing the site for the proposed Athletic Club-house, which is now in process of erection. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained and fenced, for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and involved the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A concrete stadium has been erected, seating eight thousand persons. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to encourage this phase of physical exercise. The faculty, by means of its Committee on Athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management. A strict supervision is maintained over the character of intercollegiate games, and the number of these which may be played away from the University is definitely limited. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the university athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University, acting in his stead and by his request and with the approbation of the Director). *The Faculty Committee on Athletics may permit the employment of coaches other than alumni for a period not exceeding two weeks for any one individual during any one season. But in no case shall such coach be in responsible charge of the team. 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the PHYSICAL TRAINING. athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University. 4. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any departmental faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 6. To be eligible for an intercollegiate athletic contest an applicant must be a bona fide student who is pursuing a course of at least ten hours of undergraduate work or a course of study certified by the proper faculty authority. 7. Before any student can take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and secure the endorsed approval of his application from the committee. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is a registered student of the University. 8. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Committee on Athletics to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, who shall appear before the committee and answer on his honor such questions as the committee may see fit to ask. 9. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Committee on Athletics, before it endorses an application, to require of the applicant a written pledge, certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof, for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 10. No student shall participate in any intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contest during his first college year, and in no case shall a student be eligible for these teams unless he shall have been a resident student for at least six months. 11. No person who has participated in intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contests for four sessions, consecutive or not, is eligible; provided, that his total time of participation in these sports shall not include more than five college years. 12. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the university teams. 13. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is PHYSICAL TRAINING. above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 14. No coach, not an alumnus, and no trainer, not an officer of the University, shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this university.* 15. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible charge of the details of the athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the code of rules adopted by this faculty. 16. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days' leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days' leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose. 17. Not more than four days' leave of absence from the University shall be given to those First-Year Athletic teams which are regularly organized by the General Athletic Association. 18. The football team is permitted to play games only on the home grounds of one of the contestants, with the exception of the Thanksgiving Day game with the University of North Carolina in Richmond, which may be continued until such time as can be agreed upon by the authorities of the Universities of North Carolina and Virginia. 19. "Training Tables" for football, baseball, basketball and track teams are hereby abolished. 20. No student of this university shall be eligible for any athletic team who has played upon or been a member or substitute member of any of the professional or league teams named in Classes A, B, C, and D, in the publication of the American Sports Company. To the list of professional teams thus prescribed shall be added all league teams in any State or States which the leading university of such State or States declares professional, and from which it debars its own players. 21. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning athletics is hereby interpreted to mean any college named in Table 28 of the Report of the United States Commissioner of Education of 1902, which has not less than 150 male students of at least collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this University. In case such catalogue fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the president of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official statement as to the number of college students. 22. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 23. The term "general conformity," as used in the Faculty Regulations, is interpreted by the faculty to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing.</field>
