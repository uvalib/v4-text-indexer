[6] ANNOUNCEMENTS This is a preliminary announcement. The complete catalogue will be ready for distribution about April first. It will be mailed only to those who apply for it. If interested, write to Secretary Summer School, Box 149, University, Va. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give three plays and The Players Club one or two plays. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $5.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $5.00 to $6.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. [7] One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price will be $6.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $9.00 for a double room. The price for the second term will be $3.50 for a single room, and $5.00 for a double room. All checks for rooms should be made payable to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 21st. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperon. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, conducted by Mrs. S. I. Carter, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $5.00 for a single week. $18.00 a month or $4.50 per week, if paid weekly, or $25.00 for the first term of forty-one days and $20.00 for the second term from August 2 to September 6th. A lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page â, or write to Secretary Summer School, Box 149, University, Virginia. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first and second grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary [8] courses without special permission in writing from the Director and without paying an extra fee of $5.00 for advanced courses, or $3.00 for elementary courses. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the regulations under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 50 cents will be charged each person who registers in the Summer School, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. W. E. Bray, the Summer School Physician, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 565; office hours at the hospital 11:30 to 12:30 and 4:00 to 5:00. Greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Summer School Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for the maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer School Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 24th, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays except on June 28th, and July 5th and 12th, when classes will meet at the usual hours to make up for registration day and Fourth of July. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another.

At this time there will be devotional exercises, music, short addresses on timely topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, or some other interesting exercise. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common [9] service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which is always kept within one hour, begins at seven o'clock. When weather permits, the service is held out of doors on the North Rotunda steps. Otherwise in Cabell Hall.

Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room.

YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION CLUB.â Open to every woman in the Summer School, this club is organized for the purpose of promoting a pleasant social atmosphere, giving an opportunity for social service and religious development, and for study of methods in club work and church work. The activities include "stunt parties," camp breakfast, Camp Fire Girls demonstrations, weekly meetings on religious and social questions and special lectures on rural life questions. A secretary devotes her entire time to the work and has charge of the club headquarters at Madison Hall. Her office hours are from 9 to 11 a. m. and from 2 to 3 p. m. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. [10] TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Registrar. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS.âThe News is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 7 and 12 will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and to the Community Centre in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of farmers, and farmers' wives, and community leaders and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course.

A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer chool, and mailed to the student. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instructions. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School.
