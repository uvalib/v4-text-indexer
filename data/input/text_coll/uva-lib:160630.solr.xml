      <field name="fulltext">THE RECENT FIRE. On the 27th of October, 1895, the University of Virginia suffered a serious loss in the destruction by fire of the central building, known as the Rotunda, and its Annex, the former part erected under the careful eye of Mr. Jefferson, the latter an addition made some thirty years further on in the history of the institution. Full enquiry has failed to determine with entire certainty the cause of the fire, which broke out in the north end of the Annex on Sunday morning, when the building was closed and empty. There is much reason to suspect an electric current accidentally and irregularly thrown upon the wires used for lighting, but not in use at the time. The destruction of the Annex was practically complete. Of the Rotunda the whole interior and the dome roof were burned, but the well-constructed cylindrical wall and the inside partition walls remain, injured but little, and quite capable of being used in the restoration of the building in accordance with its original design, as has been determined upon. By active exertion, chiefly on the part of the students of the University, there were saved between a fourth and a third of the books from the Library, including nearly all those belonging to the department of Law, the marble statue of the illustrious founder, the bust, also in marble, of Professor Minor, all the portraits which hung in the Library-room, and a valuable part of the apparatus belonging to the school of Natural Philosophy. The fine copy of Raphael's "School of Athens" which adorned the Public Hall in the Annex was lost, as well as much to which both sentimental and money value attached, and not a little which was cherished by reason of association, and can never be replaced. But the building destroyed formed only a part, though an important one, of the many structures on the University grounds. No damage was done to the Natural History Museum, the Astronomical Observatory, the Chemical and Biological Laboratories, the buildings belonging to the Medical Department, the Chapel, the Gymnasium, the Halls of the Literary Societies, and the dwellings and dormitory rooms of the professors and students. Arrangements were at once made for re-distributing the classes whose regular lecture-rooms had been burned, and the work of the University went on regularly on Monday morning, the day following the fire, not a lecture being lost. No small inconvenience has resulted from the temporary occupation by many classes of rooms not intended for them, but this inevitable trouble has been cheerfully borne with the feeling that it will not extend beyond the present session. The Legislature of Virginia has just passed a bill from which it is expected that the University will secure a sum not much less than two hundred thousand dollars for the work of restoration. There is on hand, from insurance and the Fayerweather bequest, about fifty thousand dollars available for the same purpose. The generous subscriptions of our alumni and the friends of the University, not only in Virginia, but in many other States, North and South, added to these resources, will enable the Visitors promptly to reconstruct the Rotunda, to erect the necessary additional buildings, and to renew the equipment of the schools that have suffered by the fire. Among these subscriptions special mention should be made of the gift of twenty-five thousand dollars from Mr. Charles B. Rouss, formerly of Virginia, now a resident of the City of New York. A general expression may well be made here of grateful appreciation on the part of the Visitors and Faculty, not only for the generous donations which have been made, but for the words of sympathy and encouragement which have been called forth by the disaster. The next session of the University, beginning on September 15th, 1896, may be looked forward to as finding the institution, which has done so much good work in the past, at least as well prepared as ever in its material arrangements for its continued career in the future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Announcements. 1896-'97. The University of Virginia is in a picturesque and healthy location among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railwayâthe Chesapeake and Ohio, and the Southernâand is thus of easy access from every part of the country. It has a post-office, with numerous daily mails, is in communication by telephone with the neighboring city of Charlottesville, and is connected by telegraph with every quarter of the world. The climate is invigorating and healthful, and at all times free from malarial conditions. The Sanitary Arrangements are excellent. The water supply is pure; the system of drains and sewers is complete; the new Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and medical treatment is furnished by the Professors of the Medical Department, and skillful nursing in a well-equipped Infirmary in case of serious illness. The Session begins on the 15th of September, and continues nine months. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 19th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither the public also are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six departmentsâthe Academical, the Engineering, the Law, the Medical, the Pharmaceutical, and the Agricultural Department. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-two distinct schools, each affording an independent course, under Professors who are responsible only to the Visitors for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the times appointed for lectures and examinations permit. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Equipment.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, both in the Academical and the Professional Departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Physical Laboratory,* * Badly damaged by the late fire, but soon to be restored to efficient condition. the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory and the Pathological Laboratory. Ample opportunities are afforded for the practical study of Human Anatomy. The Engineering Department possesses a newly-equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop.* The University Library is common to all the Departments; originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has been since much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contained at the beginning of the present session and until the recent loss by fire, about 53,000 volumes.â  â  Considerable progress has already been made toward replacing the lost books, by generous contributions from sister institutions of learning and from publishing firms and private individuals. It is expected that liberal money appropriations will be made by the Visitors toward the speedy restoration of the Library. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for six hours daily to attend to their wants. Preparation.âSome special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek, Modern Languages and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning, which he may not wish to pursue here. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purpose of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome the disadvantages of inadequate training, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. Admission.âTo be admitted as a student of the University the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement. If the applicant has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence, of general good conduct. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They strictly forbid drunkenness, gaming, dissoluteness, swearing, habits of expense, and the introduction of wine or other intoxicating drinks into the University. They require a decorous observance of Sunday, and forbid all outdoor sports on that day. They forbid the use or possession by a student of pistols or other weapons, and the introduction of them into the University precincts. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfil them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defence. Discipline and Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel, by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. Entrance examinations are not required except from Academical students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirements for these examitions are stated elsewhere. But applicants for admission to the different classes in the several Schools are expected to exhibit to the Professors suitable evidences of adequate preliminary training. The method of instruction in all departments of the University is partly by lecture, partly by the study of appropriate texts. The regulations require that at each meeting the Professor shall examine the class orally on the subject-matter of the previous lecture before beginning the new lecture. Associated with this instruction in the class is a large amount of practical laboratory work in the scientific courses, and of private parallel reading and essay writing in the literary courses. The examinations in each class are twoâone about the middle of the session, the other near the end. They are in writing, and the standard is in no case less than three-fourths. A student who attains this standard is entitled to a PASS-CERTIFICATE. The examinations in each School are conducted by a committee of the Faculty, of which the Professor in charge is chairman. No special examination is granted, except upon the physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty may accept as adequate ground. Candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the specific details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures, the correlative text, and the prescribed courses of private reading. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at the daily oral examinations, as well as at the written examinations, are taken into the account. Reports.âAt the end of each month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, together with such other information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may especially request. Parents and guardians cannot be too earnest or prompt in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in the B. A. course of each Academical School, and students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. course in any School are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, Bachelor of Science, Doctor of Medicine, Graduate in Pharmacy, and Bachelor of Law. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No merely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures.</field>

COURSE. A. First Year.âA student who is able to translate CÃ¦sar or Vergil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this course, which begins with Sallust or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Ovid, Curtius, and Vergil. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. There are two examinationsâthe Intermediate, held about the middle of the session; the Final, near its close. These examinations are conducted in writing. B. Second Year.âThe work of this year will be directed to the acquirement of readiness in translation and syntactical interpretation, with as little specialistic investigation as is consistent with a general but sound and permanent knowledge of the language. As an indispensable auxiliary to this end, written exercises in translating English into Latin and Latin into English will be required. Proper attention will be given to Roman History and Literature. The metrical work will be limited to the structure and accurate recitation of the Dactylic, AnapÃ¦stic, Trochaic, and Iambic verses, with the verses occurring in the odes of Horace. Translation will be confined to Livy, Horace, Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus. Selections from each author will be assigned as parallel reading. There are two written examinationsâIntermediate and Final. The student who completes the work of this year will be entitled to a diploma of graduation in the B. A. course in Latin. M. A. COURSE. This course commences with Juvenal or Livy, and includes selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is taken up early in the session and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the language. Portions of the authors read in the lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the lectures. In this class there are two examinationsâ one occurring about the middle of the session, the other near its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the second or Final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In Roman History and Literature the work is that of the B. A. course. The completion of the work of this year entitles the student to the diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in Latin, if the work of the B. A. course has been completed. Text-Books.âAny approved edition of the authors above named. Grammars.âGildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History.âLiddell's with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature.âBender's, as a Hand-book and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. PH. D. COURSE. This course is intended for students who propose to teach, or desire to equip themselves for original investigation in the language. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize them with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which cannot be considered to any great extent in the under-graduate course. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. In this School there are three courses: I. A general course, comprising what is deemed essential to a liberal classical education. This course extends over two years. A. First Year Class.âAs a preparation for this class an accurate knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translating are necessary. A thorough study of two books of Xenophon's Anabasis may be regarded as the minimum of preparatory reading. The work of the class is directed to the acquirement of practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is carefully reviewed, and weekly exercises, based on Greek authors, are written. The authors read are Xenophon and Lysias. B. Second Year Class.âThis class, for which the work of the preceding year, or some equivalent, is the appropriate preparation, continues the study of Attic prose, and enters upon the study of Epic and Ionic Greek and the Drama. The Syntax is reviewed, and weekly exercises are given for translation into Attic prose. The authors read are Plato, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus and Homer. Instruction is given in History, Literature, Antiquities, and the simpler Metres. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of B. A. II. An advanced course, adapted especially to the requirements of those who desire to become teachers of the classics. It extends through one session of nine months. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required; but, when sufficiently prepared, students may be allowed to pursue both courses simultaneously. In this course the Syntax of the Verb is thoroughly studied, and weekly exercises, including passages from modern English authors, are given to be translated into idiomatic Greek. Lectures are given on Rhythm and Metres, and the students are practiced in reading rhythmically the lyric parts of the Drama and the works of the Lyric Poets. The authors read are Demosthenes, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Pindar, and other Lyric Poets. The course will be varied and modified as occasion may require. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of M. A. III. A special course designed for those who wish to devote themselves to classical scholarship. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required, but in special cases students may be permitted to prosecute both courses at the same time. The work of this course will be adapted to the special aims of those pursuing it, but will, in all cases, include extensive reading of Greek authors and minute study of some branch of Greek philology. Those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of Ph. D. will be required to pursue this course for two years. In all the courses private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. Text-Books.âGoodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Hogue's Irregular Verbs; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (Intermediate, and in courses II. and III., unabridged seventh edition); Smith's History of Greece; Jebb's Primer of Greek Literature. Any editions of Greek authors may be used, except when particular ones are specially prescribed; but students should always have at hand Teubner's texts for reference, and for use on examinations. At present Rhythm and Metres and some other subjects are taught wholly or partly by lecture. Hebrew.âElementary instruction in Hebrew will be given when the demand for such instruction is sufficient. SCHOOL OF ROMANCE LANGUAGES. FRENCH, SPANISH, ITALIAN. Professor Harrison. The courses offered in this School are General (B. A.), Special (M. A.), and Advanced, or Post-Graduate (Ph. D.). B. A. COURSE. The General Course embraces such a knowledge of the selected language as an intelligent student may be expected to acquire in one year. Some previous preparation is most desirable. The aim of this course is to acquaint the student with the pronunciation, phonology, grammar, and general syntax of the language through systematic oral and written practice, to initiate him into the literature through easy and abundant reading, and to lay a solid foundation for the prosecution of his Special and Advanced courses, if he elects to continue his studies in this School. M. A. COURSE. The Special Course embraces a systematic extension of the General Course along the same lines, but is at once more comprehensive and more specialized in certain directions; incessant practice in translation and composition, gradually increasing in difficulty, is continued; instruction in syntax, in historical grammar, and in literature is given by lecture and abstract; and an orderly reading of the great writers in each language, chronologically arranged, is planned and accomplished by class work and collateral reading. PH. D. COURSE. The Advanced or Post-Graduate Course is intended for those students that elect Romance Languages for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. It embraces two years of post-graduate work in any two languages of the group, and is especially adapted to students who have graduated in Latin and Greek. Study of the comparative grammar, vocabulary, and literature of these languages is made a special feature of this course. Most attractive combinations can be made in this department, such as French-Italian, Spanish-French, Portuguese-Spanish, ProvenÃ§al-French, Latin-French, etc. Graduation in Latin is indispensable for the prosecution of a Ph. D. course in Romance Languages. Instruction will be given by conference, assigned private work, and stated examination, and a dissertation evincing original research in some department of grammar, phonetics, syntax, literature or history, will in every case be required. Detailed courses for intending students will be arranged by the Professor on application. FRENCH. B. A. COURSE (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 9-10). Texts: Whitney's Large French Grammar and Introductory French Reader; Bruno's Tour de la France; Joynes' Classic French Plays; Fontaine's Prosateurs et PoÃ¨tes du XIX SiÃ¨cle. Exercises. Parallel reading (completion of the texts begun in class). Heath's, Gasc's or Bellows' Dictionary. The texts used have been so chosen as to form a suitable general introduction (a) to the grammar, (b) to the vocabulary, (c) to the history and geography, and (d) to the literature of France in the XVIIth and XIXth centuries. M. A. COURSE (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 10-11). For pronunciation: Koschwitz' Parlers Parisiens; Passy's Sons du FranÃ§ais (Association FonÃ©tique). For reference: Harrison's French Syntax. For reading: Fasnacht's Select Specimens of Great French Writers; Crane's Series of French Prose (for the study of select periods of French culture and civilization); Voltaire's SiÃ¨cle de Louis XIV (for the study of one typical reign); Fortier's LittÃ©rature FranÃ§aise (reference-text for professor's lectures on Eminent French Writers); Chardenal's Advanced Exercises. Examinations on definite assigned work. SPANISH. B. A. COURSE (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 12:30-1:30 or 10-11.) Texts: Edgren's Spanish Grammar (for rapid survey); Knapp's Reader (for current Spanish prose); Todd's Don Quijote, with Selections from Lope and Calderon (for classical prose and poetry); Valera's Pepita JimÃ©nez; Harrison's History of Spain; Seoane's Dictionary. Exercises. Definite collateral reading and examinations on assigned work. M. A. COURSE (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 1:30-2:30). Texts: Knapp's Grammar, with lectures based on Foerster's Sprachlehre and Wiggers' Grammatik der Spanischen Sprache; Selections from the lyric and dramatic poets and from the great prose writers, in connection with Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature; Isla's Le Sage's Gil Blas; El Romancero del Cid; Seoane's Dictionary. Exercises, assigned collateral reading, and stated examinations on definite assigned work. Ph. D. Courses in Old French, ProvenÃ§al, and Old Spanish will be arranged and offered as they are required. The texts, editions, grammars, and chrestomathies of Schwan, Bartsch, Keller, Groeber, Suchier, Vietor, Gaston Paris, Meyer, Darmesteter, and others, will be used, and the professor's extensive collection of Modern Language works will be freely open to students of the School. ITALIAN. B. A. Course.âGrandgent's Grammar; Foresti's Reader; De Amicis' Cuore; Pellico's Le Mie Prigioni. M. A. Course.âVockeradt's Grammatik; Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi; Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata; Dante's Divina Commedia. [The courses in Italian will be for the present directed by Professor Perkinson.] SCHOOL OF TEUTONIC LANGUAGES. GERMAN. Professor Perkinson. Three courses are offered in this language. B. A. COURSE. Students who desire to enter this course must possess an accurate knowledge of English Grammar, and some familiarity with the rudiments of German. They will study the grammar of the language, and will be trained in pronunciation, on which special stress will be laid, and in translation, supplemented by weekly exercises, parallel reading of easy texts, and a course in the history and literature of the language. The object of this course is mainly to enable the student to read and appreciate ordinary German at sight, and to give him an insight into the literature of the language. Three hours a week. M. A. COURSE. In this course the syntax and historical grammar will be treated, and the historical grammar illustrated by short selections from Old High German and Middle High German authors. Practice in translation and composition will be continued, and a minute study of certain authors made. Candidates for graduation will be expected to translate at sight any passage that may be assigned, and to render selections from English into German. Three hours a week. PH. D. COURSE. This is designed for students who wish to make a special study of the literature or the philology of the language. Only those who have completed the lower courses are admitted to it. The work will be adapted to the aims of the student, but in all cases the study of Gothic, Old High German and Middle High German will be required. Applicants for the degree of Ph. D. will be required to prepare a dissertation showing original research. Three hours a week. The text-books vary from time to time. Parallel reading will be assigned at the beginning of the year. B. A. German.âWhitney's Brief Grammar; Thomas' Grammar; Whitney's Introductory German Reader; Hauff's Das Bild des Kaisers; Schiller's Maria Stuart; Goethe's Hermann und Dorothea. M. A. German.âWright's Old High German Primer and Middle High German Primer; Whitney's Grammar; Heine's Prosa: Scheffel's Ekkehard; Lessing's Nathan der Weise and Emilia Galotti. Ph. D. German.âUlfilas, Tatian, Otfried, Nibelungenlied, Gudrun, Wolfram von Eschenbach. SCHOOL OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. Professor Garnett. B. A. COURSE. Modern English.âIn this class the study of the English drama and of the descriptive history of the language is pursued; Shakspere is made a special subject of study. The critical study of one or two plays of Shakspere, with private reading of about one-fourth of the plays, is followed by similar study of selected works of other dramatic authors. Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama are given in connection with the study of Shakspere. These treat the early dramatic forms prevalent in Englandâi.e., the Mysteries, Moralities and Interludes; the rise of regular comedy and tragedy as seen in Ralph Royster Doyster and Gorboduc; the Pre-Shaksperian dramatists, Lyle, Peele, Greene and Marlowe; the Shaksperian period, including Shakspere, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Webster; and the Post-Shaksperian dramatists to the closing of the theatres in 1642. The study of the English drama occupies the first half-session; that of the history of English, treated from an elementary point of view, the second half-session. The course closes with the reading of some work, usually of Chaucer, in practical illustration of the formation of English. The aim is to give such a knowledge of the history of the language as every educated man should possess. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âFor 1896-'97, Richard II. and Richard III.; Tancock's or Ward's Old English Drama; Dowden's Shakspere Primer; Abbott's Shaksperian Grammar; Champneys's History of English; Chaucer's Prologue and Knight's Tale; Pollard's Chaucer Primer. For Reference.âThe Globe Shakspere; Fleay's Life of Shakspere; Fleay's History of the Stage, 1559-1642; Halliwell-Phillips's Life of Shakspere; Keltie's British Dramatists; Dowden's Shakspere, His Mind and Art; Emerson's History of the English Language; Skeat's Student's Chaucer. M. A. COURSE. Old and Middle English.âIn this class the historical and philological study of the language is pursued, the class beginning with its oldest forms and tracing the language, by the study of specimens, through its different periods to the formation of modern English. After a thorough study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read, with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English. Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages, and on the history of the language, are also given. These treat in outline the other branches of the Indo-European family of languages, and in detail the Teutonic branch. Special stress is laid upon the development of the language during the Old and Middle English periods, and the infusion of the Romance elements which so greatly affected its character. The study of Old English (Anglo-Saxon) occupies the first half-session; that of Middle English, the second half-session. In addition to what is read in class, assigned parallel reading of Old and Middle English works is also required. It is well for the student to have studied the history of English as given in the class of Modern English, or some similar course, before entering upon the study of the course in Old and Middle English, although this is not essential, as the two may be studied together. Some antecedent philological study is, however, necessary. The aim is to lay the foundation for more advanced studies in English Philology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âBright's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English, Parts I. and II.; Cook's Sievers's Grammar of Old English; Earle's Anglo-Saxon Literature; Skeat's Primer of English Etymology. For Reference.âTen Brink's Early English Literature; Brooke's History of Early English Literature; Skeat's Principles of English Etymology, First and Second Series; Henry's Comparative Grammar of English and German. PH. D. COURSE. This course is arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further their work in English Philology. It will comprise the further study of Old and Middle English works, especially of Old English poetry, and the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. In addition to such examinations as may seem advisable, a dissertation will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued. The selection of the course and subject is left to the student himself under the guidance of the Professor. The completion of the M. A. Course in Old and Middle English is absolutely necessary to the prosecution of the Ph. D. Course, and a knowledge of German is desirable. The first year course includes the reading of the Exodus and Daniel, Andreas and Elene, Judith, and Beowulf, or any other old English poetry; and the study of Wright's Gothic Language Primer, with additional readings in Skeat's Gothic Gospel of St. Mark and Braune's Gothic Grammar. The second year course embraces the study of Fourteenth-Century English and the writing of a dissertation. LINDEN KENT MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. Professor Kent. Experience has shown that of the large number who elect English Literature as one of their studies here, a few are prepared to do work even more advanced than that offered in the B. A. Course, some are able to accomplish successfully, but without ease, the work assigned, and many find it too difficult. It seems advisable, therefore, to divide the course, not for the purpose of making graduation materially more difficult, though the nature of the work be slightly changed, but in order to adapt it more closely to the requirements of the students. This division will also enable the instructor to readjust the work and thereby add to its interest and widen its scope. B. A. COURSE. A.âFirst Year. In addition to a certain maturity of mind and general mental training, students who desire to pursue this course with profit should have an accurate knowledge of the principles of English grammar, including orthography, and some knowledge of the elements of rhetoric. Previous practice in composition is well-nigh essential to the successful prosecution of the work of the class, while information about the history and contents of English Literature will add materially to appreciation of the lectures. Three hours a week. In evidence of the successful completion of this course a certificate is awarded. For convenience of presentation, the course is divided as follows: 1. Rhetoric.âThis will comprise a careful study of the principles of style in prose discourse. Particular attention will be paid to frequent written exercises, and to the critical analysis of selected specimens of English prose. Text-Books.âGenung's Practical Rhetoric; Genung's Hand-book of Rhetorical Analysis; Hill's Foundations of Rhetoric; Scott and Denney's Paragraph-writing. 2. General History of English Literature.âThis course will follow in the main the outline provided by Pancoast's Introduction to English Literature. The text will be prefaced by a few lectures on the development of English literature prior to Chaucer, and be supplemented throughout by explanations, assigned topics for class-study, lectures, etc. Besides the various written exercises of this class, two essays will be required. These will be due on December 3d and April 2d. B.âSecond Year. Admission to this class presupposes preparation in character similar, if not equal, to that offered in Course A., which is intended to lead directly into this course. This class will meet three times a week, and graduation in this Course B. is necessary for those who elect English Literature as one of their studies for the B. A. degree. This course is as follows: 1. Rhetoric.âThis will comprise first a rapid review of the principles of style as illustrated by the Sentence and the Paragraph, and then a careful study of invention in prose discourse. There will be occasional written exercises, and particular attention will be given to the critical analysis of selected specimens of Descriptive, Narrative, Expository, and Argumentative Prose. The course will be based on Genung's Rhetoric, but will not be limited to it. Text-Books.âGenung's Rhetoric; Genung's Hand-book of Rhetorical Analysis; Baldwin's Specimens of Prose Description; Brewster's Specimens of Narration; Lamont's Specimens of Exposition, and Baker's Specimens of Argumentation. 2. Versification.âThis course will be based upon the Professor's Notes on Poetics, and will consider the mechanism of verse, the artistic elements in versification, history of verse-forms, kinds of poetry, etc. Class-exercises of various kinds will be assigned from time to time. Text-Book.âProfessor's Notes. References.âGummere's Hand-book of Poetics; Guest's English Rhythms; Schipper's Englische Metrik; Lanier's Science of English Verse, etc. 3. Literature.âAs members of this class are supposed to have some general acquaintance with the historical development of English Literature, this course will comprise some period of time, some literary form, some author or group of authors, or some general division of literary history. For '96-97 there will be offered a course in American Literature. Text-Book.âRichardson's American Literature, supplemented by general and special references. Essays.âBesides the occasional written exercises of the class, four essays will be required of each student applying for graduation in this B. A. Course. These will be due October 14th, December 18th, March 18th, May 1st. The subjects will, in some cases, be assigned and at other times be left to the choice of the student, but will fall under these general heads; Description, Narration, Exposition, Argumentation or Persuasion. M. A. COURSE. In this course there will be occasional lectures, but in general the exercises of the class will be conducted by questions, conversation and conference. Readings will be assigned, independent investigation insisted upon, and written reports required from time to time. The students will be encouraged to form their own judgments and to express them orally or in writing. References for each author, period, or subject studied will be given, and the free use of the library in this and all courses is cordially recommended. COURSES HERETOFORE OFFERED. I.

The theme of this dissertation may be selected by the student, with the Professor's approval; or, if desired, will be assigned by the Professor, but in either case the subject must be recorded by the Professor on or before January 15. PH. D. COURSE. This course will be, in some measure, adapted to the needs of the students desiring to pursue it. Its purposes will be to cultivate more fully the love of letters, to encourage independent and scholarly research, and to further the art of literary expression. It will include the study of some writer, or school of writers, or of some period or movement of literature, and will take into consideration the political, social, and literary characteristics of the time under discussion. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Political Economy and Science of Society. Professor Holmes. In this class there are two courses, each of three lectures a week throughout the session. Political Economy will be prosecuted for the B. A., and Science of Society for the Ph. D. degree. Political Economy.âIn the treatment of this department of knowledge there is no rigid adherence to the school of Smith, Ricardo and Mill. The modification of older doctrines, necessitated by the increase of productive inventions and productive operations, is steadily regarded. Attention is paid to the inquiries and criticisms of Thornton, Cairnes, Jevons, Marshall, Nicholson, etc.; and to the altered views propounded by Laveleye, Walker, and the school of the Cathedrists and other German schools. Text-Books.âWalker's Political Economy (advanced course); Mill's Political Economy (abridged). A later book than Mill's, and special lectures will be introduced. Science of Society.âIn this (the Post-graduate course) is prosecuted the investigation of the laws and movements, the growth, decay, and constitution of Societies, in the different phases and stages of social development. The necessary organic functions of society are studied in their several forms. They are also regarded in their reciprocal relations and in their conjoint action in successive forms of civilization. All systems are interpreted; no ideal constitution is contemplated. The course is descriptive of processes by which experienced results have been obtained, not speculative in advocacy of theoretic dreams. This class is dependent on notes for the Lectures, as no text-book exists or has been attempted. History. Associate Professor Dabney. General History.âIn this class, which comprises the historical work required for the B. A. degree, great stress is laid on the view that the career of man, as revealed in History, is not a mere jumble of disconnected dates and facts, but a continuous stream, having its sources and tributaries in the far-off past, its outlet in the remote future. No attempt is made, however, to traverse in the class-room the entire length of this stream; for, although constant efforts are made to demonstrate the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development, the lectures are confined to the more important periods, the student being required to fill the gaps by private reading. The periods, and, therefore, the text-books studied, may be more or less varied each year. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âFisher's Outlines of Universal History; Abbott's Pericles and the Golden Age of Athens; Froude's CÃ¦sar; Capes's Age of the Antonines; Duruy's Middle Ages; Seebohm's Era of the Protestant Revolution; Gardiner's Thirty Years' War; Longman's Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War; Dabney's Causes of the French Revolution; Morris's French Revolution and First Empire. English and American History.âIn this advanced class the principles taught in the preceding course will be applied to a more special field; and in order that the students may be encouraged to exercise independent thought and judgment, they will be required to write essays on assigned topics. Moreover, it should be distinctly understood that the text-books are by no means regarded by the professor as infallible authorities. On the contrary, some of them contain much that is emphatically rejected by him. And yet such books may be exceedingly useful; for to educate a man is not to stuff him full of cut-and-dried opinions, but rather to draw forth and develop his own judgment by presenting to his mind opinions that oppose and even clash violently with each other. With this end in view different text-books are studied side by side, the professor giving his own views of each and encouraging the students also to think for themselves. Graduates in General History will derive most benefit from this course. It may be taken, however, by others; and, as considerable attention will be paid to constitutional development, students intending to study Law will find the course of advantage. Candidates for the M. A. degree selecting History as one of their four subjects must graduate both in this course and in the preceding. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âGardiner's History of England; Green's Short History of the English People; Gardiner's Atlas of English History; Percy Greg's History of the United States; Thwaites's Colonies; Hart's Formation of the Union; Wilson's Division and Re-union; Curry's Southern States of the American Union. The Post-Graduate Course.âThis course is designed for those students who aim at the Ph. D. degree and expect to become professors of History. A large amount of reading will be assigned, and frequent discussion of important points will be held between student and professor. The aim will be to cultivate the habit of original research; and, if History be the major subject of a candidate for the doctorate, a dissertation embodying the fruits of such research will be required. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Davis. There are two classes arranged for two successive sessions. The First Class studies during the first half-session, Deductive and Inductive Logic; during the second half-session, Psychology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Elements of Deductive Logic, Elements of Inductive Logic, Theory of Thought, and Elements of Psychology.

SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Professor Stone. B. A. AND M. A. COURSES. General Astronomy.âFirst Year.âThe aim of this course is to give such a knowledge of the facts, principles, and methods of Astronomy as every well-educated person should possess. The preparation required is a good working knowledge of Arithmetic, Algebra through Quadratics, Plane and Solid Synthetic Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry through the Solution of Triangles. Text-Book.âYoung's General Astronomy. Second Year.âThis course is intended to elucidate selected portions of the subject more fully and from a more strictly mathematical point of view than can be taken in the course of the first year. Text-Book.âGauss's Theoria Motus (Davis's translation). Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts are required to complete the work of the first year; those for the degree of Master of Arts must pass examinations on the subjects embraced in both classes. PH. D. COURSES.

A. course of these schools. The Astronomical Observatory is situated upon an elevation known as Mount Jefferson, which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda forty-five feet in diameter, and contains the great Clark refractor of twenty-six inches aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining, and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a three-inch Fauth transit and a four-inch Kahler equatorial. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Smith. This School offers four courses, each extending through the session of nine months, and including lectures, text-book study, and laboratory work, as follows: General Physics.âThe object of this course of lectures (which embraces the work for the B. A. degree) is to furnish the student with an introduction to Modern Physics. With the design of laying a scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential; and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of sensible masses. This discussion, while it is elementary, is designed to be in harmony with the more thorough mathematical treatment of the same topics and to be a helpful introduction to it. With this preparation, the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, prominence being given to those divisions, like Heat and Electricity, in which the transformations of energy are most easily followed and measured. Indeed, throughout the course the laws of energy are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. This course includes a series of exercises in the Physical Laboratory, selected with a view of training the student in the measurement of phenomena. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. Sound and Light.âThis course (which embraces the work for the M. A. degree) treats of the theory of undulation and the transfer of Energy by waves. It includes careful work in the Physical Laboratory. Text-Books.âPreston's Theory of Light; Everett's Vibratory Motion and Sound; Glazebrook's Practical Physics. Electricity and Magnetism.âThis class studies Electricity and Magnetism, with special reference to Electrical Engineering, to which the course is designed to be an introduction. Besides the mathematical theory, it embraces Laboratory practice in electrical and magnetic measurements. To enter this class, the student should be familiar with the elementary facts of the science, and also with the simpler processes of differentiation and integration. Text-Books.âEmtage; Ewing; Jackson. Advanced Physics.âThis course includes the study of original memoirs in special departments of Physics, and of the history of Experimental Science, together with laboratory work showing independent research. The report of this work may be the dissertation offered for the attainment of the Ph. D. degree. The Physical Laboratory had at its disposal before the recent fire five connected apartments, all on the same floor. One of these was also used as a lecture-room; another one was permanently darkened, and in two others the light could be excluded at pleasure. A fourth room was so supported on massive piers as to be practically free from sensible tremors. The needful appliances, in the way of fixtures and apparatus, had been so far supplied as to furnish a sufficient range of practice for undergraduates, and some facilities for the advanced student in Practical Physics.* * These rooms were destroyed by the fire. It is the purpose of the authorities to restore them in a much improved form. Should the new apartments not be ready by the autumn of 1896, temporary arrangements will be made, adequate to the needs of the school. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School the following courses are offered: General Chemistry.âThis course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws expressing the facts of chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present developed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the Descriptive Chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in the arts and manufactures of the facts mentioned. Text-Books.âFownes's Chemistry (last edition); Syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. Recommended for Reference.âRoscoe and Schorlemmer's (or Miller's) Elements of Chemistry; Lothar Meyer's Outlines of Theoretical Chemistry (English translation); Bernthsen's Text-book of Organic Chemistry, translated by McGowan; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. Industrial Chemistry.âThis course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which the development of the natural resources of the country in large measure depends, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar-refiner, etc. Text-Book.âWagner's Chemical Technology. Recommended for Reference.âRichardson and Watts's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Girardin's LeÃ§ons de Chimie ÃlÃ©mentaire appliquÃ©e aux Arts Industriels; Percy's Metallurgy, etc. The lectures in both courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good; amongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. Post-Graduate work is offered in either course, and either or both may be taken by the candidate for the Ph. D. degree. Laboratory work will be required on subjects involving original investigation. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. Graduation in General Chemistry is required for the B. A. degree, graduation in both General and Industrial Chemistry for the M. A. For admission to a post-graduate course in the School of Chemistry or in the School of Analytical Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is arranged in two divisions, as follows: 1. A regularly arranged course in Chemical Manipulation is first given. This is followed by Blow-pipe Analysis and Fire Assays of ores of lead, silver, and gold. A systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis follows, with practice in the analysis of mixtures of salts, alloys, ores, and so on. Stoichiometry is taught by exercises and occasional lectures. Instruction in the elements of Quantitative Analysis completes this division of the course, which extends over the first half-session. 2. The work of the second division is an extended course of Quantitative Analysis, both gravimetric and volumetric. The student determines the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, manures, technical products, and so on. As he advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assisted in its prosecution; and, in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having great weight. Five lessons are given each week, and the Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the Full Course or for the First Course, but candidates for graduation are required to complete the Full Course. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (2d ed.); Greville Williams's Hand-book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-book of Mineralogy; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. In addition to the foregoing, the following Special Courses are given in this School. They are open without additional charge to the regular students of the School. For fees to others, see Expenses. 1. A laboratory course on Determinative Mineralogy for students of Engineering, embracing Blow-pipe Analysis, Determinative Mineralogy, and the application of chemical processes to the examination of potable waters, coals, clays, building stones, and other materials employed in Engineering. 2. A laboratory course in Assaying, including all of the above mentioned course on Determinative Mineralogy, together with Fire Assaying of ores of lead, silver, gold, etc., and practice in volumetric and galvanic determinations, such as are commonly employed in the valuation of certain technical products and ores. 3. A laboratory course of twelve lessons in Practical Pharmacy, including the compounding and dispensing of drugs. The pursuit of this course will enable the practitioner satisfactorily to dispense medicines, and it will afford him needed familiarity with handling chemicals and the forms of prescriptions. 4. A course of twenty-four lectures on Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life as far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and so on. This course is open without charge to students from Virginia and to farmers who are not matriculated students. For Reference.âJohnston's and Cameron's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology (17th ed.); Johnson's How Crops Grow; Johnson's How Crops Feed; Armsby's Manual of Cattle Feeding. The Post-Graduate Course comprises practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, study of methods, and original investigations in the composition of rare materials and technical products presenting scientific or economic interest. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. The Museum of Industrial Chemistry, contained in the same building, consists of a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country and abroad, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two coursesâfirst, a course embracing the requisites in Geology for the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts; and second, a course covering what is required in Mineralogy and Geology for the degree of Master of Arts. B. A. COURSE. Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.âDana's Manual of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. M. A. COURSE. This course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.âThe course in Mineralogy closes with the examination which takes place in January. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Geology.âThis division of the course begins after the examination on Mineralogy in January. Three lectures a week will be given. A knowledge of the principles taught in the B. A. course will be assumed. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and PalÃ¦ontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Ph. D. Text-Books.âDana's Manual of Geology. For Reference.âGeikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. PH. D. COURSE. The Post-Graduate Course in this School is so arranged as to enable the student to concentrate his efforts in some special line of study. Selections will be made from one or both of the subjects taught in the School. The work will be adapted to the wants of the student, and, as far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the branches chosen. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts are required to pass in the B. A. Course, and those for the degree of Master of Arts in the M. A. Course in Geology and in Mineralogy, in addition to the B. A. Course. For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy the candidate must, in addition to the requisites for the degree of Master of Arts, complete the Post-Graduate Course. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main sub-divisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc.; the general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.; the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing Post-Graduate courses of study in Geology and Mineralogy. The Professor, when the number of applicants is sufficient, organizes a party of geological exploration. The field-work is done in the month of July, and is entirely optional with the students. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy may, although not members of the University class, with the consent of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Professor Tuttle. The work of this School is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of Biology to Agriculture. Two introductory courses are offered, each of which is intended to serve as a means of rendering the student familiar with the method, the aims, and the fundamental laws of Biology while he is engaged in the one case with the study of plants, in the other with that of a large and important group of animals. Each course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session, the lectures being accompanied in each case with associated laboratory exercises. Graduation in either of these courses may be offered as one of the electives for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. I. Botany.âThis course comprises a brief survey of the principal groups of the Vegetable Kingdom, beginning with the lowest and simplest forms. As the more complex forms are reached, their histology is discussed in its physiological as well as its morphological relations. Special attention is paid, as far as time will permit, to those groups of plants which have special economic importance, and to the flora of the region. On account of the great economic and sanitary importance of the Bacteria, their morphology and physiology is made the subject of a special course of lectures before the students of the Medical Department as a suitable preliminary to the specific discussion of the principal pathogenic species in the School of Pathology. To this course members of the class in Botany are admitted at their option. Text-Books.âWarming's Systematic Botany (Potter tr.); Gray's Manual (6th edition). II. Comparative Anatomy.âThis course is devoted to the study of the anatomy, histology, and embryology of Vertebrata, and to the principles of animal physiology. The anatomical and histological structure of the vertebrate body will be studied, as illustrated by a representative series of forms; and one or more systems of organs discussed and examined comparatively in both the adult and the developing organism. The amount of histological work involved in this course includes (and exceeds) that of the course in Histology of the Medical Department; and members of the class who pass with the required standing will receive credit for that subject in the medical course if they so desire. Text-Books.âWiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy (Parker tr.); Parker's Zootomy; the Professor's Notes on Histology and Embryology. In addition to the introductory or B. A. courses above described, the following advanced courses are offered to students prepared to undertake them. In each the work will be chiefly done in the laboratory, the student being in large measure independent of his associates; such lectures will be given from time to time and such reading indicated as will aid the student in an independent investigation of the subject in hand. The relation of these courses to degrees is indicated below; the completion of course V, as a Ph. D. course, involves summer work at a seaside laboratory as an essential. III. Vegetable Morphology.âAn advanced course in Botany, devoted chiefly to the study of the Algae and Fungi, and to the Histology of the Vascular Plants. The completion of Course I., or its equivalent either here or elsewhere, is required as a preliminary to this course. Text-Books.âBennett and Murray's Cryptogamic Botany; Strasburger's Practical Botany (Hillhouse tr.). The library of the department contains numerous standard works of reference. IV. Vertebrate Morphology.âAn advanced course based on Course II., the completion of which, or its equivalent, is required as preliminary. The work will consist of more detailed comparative study of vertebrate structure and development, and of the forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically related to the Vertebrate stock. Text-Books will be indicated as needed. The library of the department contains a good amount of standard and periodical literature bearing on the subject of this course. Courses III. and IV. will not both be given the same year, that one being chosen which is elected by the greater number of eligible students, at the beginning of the session. Graduation in Courses I. and II. and either III. or IV. will be required of candidates for a diploma of graduation in the School of Biology, and of those offering Biology as one of their electives for the degree of Master of Arts. V. Zoology.âThis course, open to graduate students only, includes the study of Animal Morphology, as illustrated by the Anatomy, Histology and, as far as possible, the Embryology of a series of representative species chosen from the principal divisions of the Animal Kingdom, the principles of classification, and the arrangement of the various orders and classes of animals in larger groups as indicated by their structural affinities. Text-Books.âRolleston's Forms of Animal Life; Claus's Text-Book of Zoology; Lang's Text-Book of Comparative Anatomy; Balfour's Embryology. This course will be required of all students who elect Biology as one of their studies for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; those who choose it as a major study will be required, in addition, to do such work as may be assigned to them individually. VI. Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the diseases or the parasites of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic Zoology (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). Text-Books for 1896-'97.âWard's Timber and its Diseases; Hough's Elements of Forestry; Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals. Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete Courses I., II. and VI. The Biological Laboratory is well provided with instruments for the gross and minute dissection of animals and plants; microscopes, microtomes, reagents, and materials for the staining and mounting of preparations; apparatus for photography and microphotography, and other necessary appliances, not only for student work, but for investigation and research as well. In addition to the large and valuable collections of the Brooks Museum, an abundant supply of other necessary specimens and material is furnished. A library of reference is attached to the Laboratory, and students have access to a number of leading biological and agricultural journals, thus acquiring practice in the intelligent use of current literature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Academical Degrees. In each Academical School a diploma of graduation is conferred in the B. A. Course. Students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. Course in any School are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred in the Academical Department are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy. The degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed to secure in the candidate such a thorough and well-proportioned general training in all of the great departments of human knowledgeâAncient Languages, Modern Languages, History and Literature, Philosophy, Mathematical Science, Natural Science and Natural Historyâas will fit him to fill his part in the vocations of life, whether in the field of business, in the pursuit of the learned professions, or in the special studies preparatory to didactic or scientific work. This degree is accordingly conferred upon a student who has been graduated in nine B. A. Courses, selected from the following list, of which, however, at least one must be taken from each group: A.âAncient Languages. LatinâGreek. B.âModern Languages. FrenchâGerman. C.âHistory and Literature. General HistoryâEnglish LiteratureâModern English. D.âPhilosophical Science. Political EconomyâLogic and PsychologyâEthics and Philosophy. E.âMathematical Sciences. MathematicsâAstronomyâMechanics. F.âNatural Sciences. PhysicsâGeneral Chemistry. G.âNatural History. GeologyâBiology. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed for students who desire to extend their work in certain departments of learning, so as to lay a broader foundation for professional study, to equip themselves for the work of teaching, or to prepare for specialized lines of research in letters or science. It is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has been graduated in each of four Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty. The utmost freedom of election will be encouraged in the arrangement of these courses, subject to the condition that the four lines of advanced work chosen shall be so related as to form a rationally connected whole. It is expressly ordered, however, that none of the work done for the B. A. degree shall be counted again as part of the advanced work required for the M. A. degree, nor shall the advanced work done for the M. A. degree be counted also for the B. A. degree. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the M. A. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree shall be submitted for approval to the Faculty, who have absolute power to accept or reject the degree offered. The candidate must in all cases be graduated in the B. A. Course in each School before he is admitted to the M. A. Course in that School. But this last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of a candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the M. A. Course simultaneously with the B. A. Course of the School. A Bachelor of Arts of any other chartered institution of learning who enters this University as a candidate for the M. A. degree, must submit to the Faculty a statement showing the four major studies in which he proposes to pursue the M. A. Courses, and five associated minor studies, which would complete the requirements for the B. A. and M. A. degrees. Under the regulations of the Visitors, he will be required to pursue here both the B. A. and the M. A. Courses in the four major studies. But in any or all of the five minor studies he will be excused from attendance upon the regular B. A. Courses upon presenting his diploma and passing a SPECIAL EXAMINATION at this University in such studies. This examination will, in all cases, be of a practical character, designed to test the permanent acquisition by the student of a sound general knowledge of the several subjects. Bachelors of Arts who are deficient in any of the minor studies may fill out their schemes of study by attending the regular B. A. Courses at this University in those subjects and passing the regular examinations. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia is offered to students who propose to devote their energies to specialized research in any of the various departments of letters or science. At least two years of special advanced study is required; in the case of professors in chartered schools of learning in departments embracing the studies elected, residence at the University is obligatory for but one of these two years. This degre will be conferred on a Bachelor of Arts or Master of Arts who has passed examination in the Post-graduate Courses of two Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty, and in addition has prepared and printed a dissertation, accepted by the Professors of the Schools elected, as showing independent research or original treatment of some subject belonging to the School chosen as his major study. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the Ph. D. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree must be approved by the Faculty, and the candidate must in all cases be graduated in each of the two Schools elected before he is admitted to the Ph. D. Course in that School. The last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of a candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the Ph. D. Course at the same time with the M. A. Course of the School.</field>

JOHNSON BARBOUR,* * Died December 2d, 1894. GEORGE W. PALMER, CHARLES E. VAWTER. R. T. W. DUKE, Treasurer. R. T. W. DUKE, Jr., Secretary. The Agricultural Department is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va. It comprises the Schools named above. Students of Agriculture may either elect a special course of study entirely from these Schools, or may combine with them certain of the Literary Schools, with the view of becoming candidates for the degrees of B. A., M. A., or Ph. D. For example, such a student might offer for his B. A. degree Latin, French, English Literature, and Political Economy, with Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Mechanics, and might then proceed to his Ph. D. degree in the Schools of Biology and Agriculture, and Analytical Chemistry. The Miller Scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the student who then passes the graduating examinations in the B. A. courses of Biology I., Chemistry and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Agricultural Department. The Miller scholar is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Expenses. (IN THE ACADEMICAL, ENGINEERING AND AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENTS.) In the Academical Department the necessary expenses of a student for the session of nine months are estimated as below, for the lowest rate and for a more liberal scale of living, assuming in each case that the student attends three Schools. Tuition $75 $75 Matriculation* * The matriculation fee is subject to a reduction in the case of a student residing at his home is Charlottesville or its neighborhood. 40 40 Contingent deposit 10 10 Dormitory rent 15 30 Servant's attendance 9 9 Furniture for dormitory 9 19 Fuel and lights 12 24 Washing 14 14 Board 99 162 Total 283 383 Payable on entrance 203 259 Reduced charges to Virginians 208 308 Payable on entrance 128 183 The contingent deposit of $10 is assessed for any damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on, with which the student himself may be chargeable; the balance remaining to his credit is returned to him on his leaving the University. To the above total must be added the cost of books, stationery and laboratory materials. In the Engineering Department the tuition fee is usually $100 (instead of $75), with a reduction of $50 only to Virginians, other charges remaining the same. In the Agricultural Department the tuition fee is usually $100, which is remitted to Virginians, other charges remaining the same. In all cases a moderate allowance of pocket-money for contingent expenses must be made. For this purpose $5 a month should usually suffice; more than $10 a month is ordinarily excessive. Students from Virginia.âIn compliance with the statute (Virginia Code, 1887, ch. 68, Â§ 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia over the age of sixteen years instruction without charge for tuition in all the Academical Schools, except the Laboratory courses in Chemistry and Practical Physics. The total University fees of an Academical student from Virginia are only $50; his necessary expenses amount to but $208, exclusive of laboratory materials, books and stationery; of this about $128 must be paid on entrance. The Faculty are required by law to be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a diploma or certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission are required as follows: 1. For admission to the School of Latin, on forms, syntax, and Books i., ii. of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Catiline. 2. For admission to the School of Greek, on forms, syntax, and Books i., ii. of Xenophon's Anabasis. 3. For admission to the School of Mathematics or Natural Philosophy, on Arithmetic, Plane Geometry, and Algebra through quadratics. For admission to the other Schools, a good knowledge of English and Arithmetic is alone required. White Male Teachers and superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academical Department of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools. Applicants for admission are requested to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $4 to $6 a week.</field>

During the second session (of nine months): Physiology, Pathology, Materia Medica and Obstetrics. During the third session (of nine months): Surgery, Gynecology, Practice of Medicine, Hygiene and Medical Jurisprudence. Relations of the Student in the Second and Third Years.âStudents who pass a satisfactory examination on the subjects studied during the first session are not required to attend the lectures or stand the examinations on these subjects the second year; but if a student fail to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time on one or more of the subjects included in the first year's course, he will be permitted to take such subject or subject over during the second year, without the payment of any additional fee. In like manner, if he fail to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time on one or more of the subjects included in the second year's course, he will be permitted to take such subject or subjects over during the third year, without the payment of an additional fee, and if he pass a satisfactory examination on these subjects, as well as those of the third session, he will be permitted to graduate at the close of that session: Provided, however, that no student whose failure to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time shall extend to all the subjects of a given year will be permitted to go on to the work of the succeeding year; he will be required to confine himself to a repetition of the work of the year on which he has failedâand no student will be allowed to undertake the work of the third year until he has completed that of the first, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. Students who have taken the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the University of Virginia, on a scheme including such medical subjects as, in connection with other subjects associated therewith, shall be approved by the Medical Faculty, may be admitted to the studies of the second year. Requirements for Graduation.âNo student is permitted to graduate from the University of Virginia with the degree of Doctor of Medicine till he shall have attended the regular course of not less than three years in this institution, and passed a satisfactory examination on all the subjects included in the Medical course, unless in lieu of either the first or the second year's study here, he shall have attended one course of lectures of not less than seven months, or two courses of less than seven months each, in some other reputable medical school, in which case he may apply for graduation at the end of his second or first session in this institution; but in order to obtain the degree he must pass a satisfactory examination at this University on all the subjects heretofore mentioned as included in the Medical course. Certificates of Attendance.âNo student will receive a certificate as a member of the Medical Department of the University unless he has attended the whole regular course of one or more of the three years. Methods of Instruction.âThe instruction is given by systematic lectures and daily oral examinations, with associated practical work in Anatomy, Histology, Bacteriology, Pathology and Obstetrics. The daily oral examinations on the subjects of the previous lectures are of great value in stimulating the student to regular and systematic habits of study, and furnishing the Professor an opportunity of discovering and removing difficulties met with by the student. The Graduating Examinations are in writing and of a rigorous character. Two sets of these are held each yearâone near the close of the session, after completion of the lecture courses; the other at the beginning of the next session. To the latter are admittedâ (a) Students of the previous session who from illness or other cause approved by the Faculty were unable to present themselves for examination. These may be examined on any part of the course, and will not be required to matriculate anew. (b) Students who at the close of the preceding session have passed satisfactory examinations in two of the studies pursued during that session, and have attained on one or more of the remaining subjects such a standard (but little lower than that required for graduation) as the Faculty may approve. This slightly lower standard must have been reached on the particular subject or subjects on which the student presents himself for re-examination. (c) Students who present certificates of attendance on one or two seven-months' courses or their equivalent at some other reputable medical school. Students falling under classes (b) and (c), after first matriculating and then passing the Fall examinations on the studies of the preceding one or two sessions, may proceed to the work of the second year, or to that of the third year, and to graduation, without attending the lectures on, or passing further examination in, the studies of the preceding session or sessions, except the general oral examination which immediately precedes graduation. No special examination will be given in the Medical Department except under extraordinary circumstances, to be carefully weighed by the Medical Faculty. A General Oral Examination is held each year prior to graduation (at the close of the session) on all the different branches on which the student has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. Clinical Instruction.âThe Piedmont Hospital, in the adjoining city of Charlottesville, is utilized as far as its capacity will permit, and during the past year the second-course students have had the opportunity of seeing a number of operations there. The University Dispensary is in successful operation, and during the past year more than three thousand new patients have been treated. Clinics are held five times a week, to which third-course students only are admitted. In recognition of the impossibility of giving practical instruction by the ordinary clinical lectures, the class is divided into sections, so that each student may have the opportunity of examining patients for himself under the guidance of the teacher. Messrs. Lyman Skeen, Jr., M. D., John A. Crowther, M. D., Stephen T. Barnett, Adam T. Finch, Joseph K. Combe, and Charles P. Eichelberger (apothecary) have acted as student-assistants at the Dispensary during the session 1895-'96. ANATOMY. Professor Christian. Descriptive Anatomy.âThe instruction is given by didactic lectures, combined with the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; no statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on the actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection, the effort being to convey knowledge by the so-called natural methodâthat is, by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the School for this purpose is most ample. Practical Anatomy.âFor this course dissecting material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Attendance in the dissecting-room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the ordinary oral and written examinations, each student is required to stand eight practical examinationsâone upon osteology, four upon different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, one on the ligaments, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being questioned alone. They consist in the identification of the truths of anatomy on the bones, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of the student's acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body. Regional Anatomy.âThis subject is taught to second-course students by the same practical methods as are described above. HISTOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Normal Histology is taught by lectures, accompanied by practical work in the laboratory, which is amply equipped for the purpose. The class is divided into working sections of forty-eight, that number of desks being provided with microscopes, accessory apparatus, and all necessary reagents. The primary object of the course is to make the student practically familiar with the normal appearance and characteristics of the structural elements of the body, their groupings into tissues, and the disposition and relations of the latter as making up the various organs of the body. As a means to this end, students are carefully trained in the use of the microscope, and, as much as practicable, in histological technique. The accuracy and readiness of the knowledge acquired is tested for each student by individual practical examination, in which he is required to name and describe at sight preparations of tissues and sections of organs submitted to him; the usual written examination must also be passed. Embryology.âThe course in Histology is followed and supplemented by a course discussing the formation of the embryo and the fÅtal appendages, of the tissues, and of the organs of the body. The laboratory is provided with a valuable set of preparations illustrating the embryology of the lower vertebrates, and a collection of human embryos of various stages from which anatomical and histological preparations are made. Text-Books.âKlein's, Piersol's, or Shaefer's Histology; Shaefer's, Haddon's or Minot's Embryology; the Professor's Syllabus. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Bacteriology is taught by lectures and practical work in the laboratory. It is the object of the course to give the students a clear idea of the biology of the bacteria; their affinities as plants, their structure, and their physiology being considered as the basis for the further discussion of their economic relations, their action as causes of disease, and the methods resorted to for their manipulation: the specific discussion of the pathogenic bacteria of clinical importance is relegated to the course in Pathology. The various processes of bacteriological technique are fully illustrated and demonstrated in the laboratory. The work of the students comprises special practice in those processes which are of value to the general practitioner as a means of diagnosis. Text-Books Recommended.âAbbott's Principles of Bacteriology; Fraenkel's Bacteriology; the Professor's Introduction to the Bacteria; Sternberg's or Crookshank's Manual of Bacteriology. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this course the students are taught Chemical Physics and the general principles of Chemistry, and are carried through a course of Descriptive Chemistry, inorganic and organic; their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to Physiology, the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology, and Sanitary Science. Text-Books.âFownes' or Witthaus' Chemistry; Syllabus of the Professor's lectures. For Reference: Charles' Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Barringer. The study of Physiology is not begun until the student has completed the courses in Chemistry, Anatomy and Histology and is hence well prepared to appreciate the broader principles of this subject. The entire work of the school is designed with reference to its practical bearings on the subsequent studies of Pathology and Therapeutics. In the elucidation of this subject the large collection of plates belonging to the Department is supplemented by original preparations and models. Text-Book.âThe Professor's Abstract. For Reference: Landois' Physiology; Foster's Physiology or Kirke's Physiology. PATHOLOGY. Adjunct Professor Davis. The principles of General and Surgical Pathology are discussed in lectures and illustrated in the laboratory, where ample facilities are provided to enable each student to make permanent preparations for himself. Instruction is also given in the method of conducting a post mortem examination, in which the object of preserving for future investigation such parts as may demand it is kept particularly in view. This involves pathological technique, which is accordingly taught. Students are individually required to recognize, by the aid of the microscope the nature of tumors, and to make examinations of urine, in addition to the regular written examination, covering the entire work of the course. Instruction in Surgical Diseases and their treatment follows the course upon Pathology. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Syllabus of General Pathology; Green's Pathology and Morbid Anatomy, or Ziegler's General Pathology; Senn's Principles of Surgery, or Warren's Surgical Pathology and Therapeutics. MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS. Professor Barringer. In Materia Medica particular stress is laid upon the physiological action of drugs as furnishing the only basis for a rational system of therapeutics. The Department is provided with a good collection of drugs, both crude and prepared, which are shown to the student as dealt with in the lectures. Exercises in prescription-writing are given weekly for several months. Text-Book.âWhite's Materia Medica and Therapeutics. For Reference: Brunton's Pharmacology; Wood's Materia Medica. The subject of Therapeutics is taken up among the studies of the third year. The range of the work will embrace both General and Special therapeutics, whether rational or empirical, but a constant effort will be made throughout to trace those general underlying principles, the existence of which alone enables this subject to be called a science. The method pursued will be that of taking up in order the perversions of the various organs and functions rather than the individual forms of disease. Text-Book.â(To be named hereafter). For Reference: Bruce's Materia Medica and Therapeutics; Brunton's Pharmacology. OBSTETRICS. Professor Buckmaster. In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained by the use of suitable preparations and models. The systematic use of the manikin with the fÅtus has made it possible for the student to obtain a knowledge of obstetric manipulation which he can acquire in no other way. Routine work with the manikin is obligatory. The class is divided into sections of eight members, and each student becomes practically familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of normal and abnormal labor. The number of cases applying to the dispensary for treatment at their homes during labor is steadily increasing. Text-Book.âOutlines of Obstetrics, by Charles Jewett (W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia). For Reference: The American Text-Book of Obstetrics for Practitioners and Students (W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia). SURGERY. Professor Christian. In Operative Surgery the first aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles and technique of modern aseptic surgical procedure. All amputations and ligations, the application of splints, bandages and apparatus for different fractures, are shown upon the cadaver. To insure a practical knowledge of the subject, each student will be required to perform operations upon the cadaver as a part of his examination for graduation. GYNECOLOGY. Professor Buckmaster. In Gynecology instruction is given by lectures and recitations, and the plastic operations necessary to repair injuries of the pelvic structures are shown during the course. Practical training in the details of gynecological treatment is given at the Dispensary. Text-Book.âThe Professor's Syllabus. For Reference: Principles and Practice of Gynecology, by T. A. Emmet (Lea Bros. &amp; Co., Philadelphia); Treatise on the Diseases of Women, by A. J. C. Skene (D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York). PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Buckmaster. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of one hundred and fifty didactic lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching twice a week. Ample material is furnished by the University Dispensary, and the student is required to become familiar with the normal organs. Clinical instruction in physical diagnosis will be given, and will form part of the required course. The additions to our knowledge made by the bacteriologist, when of use in diagnosis or in treatment, receive particular attention. Text-Books.âA Hand-Book of Physical Diagnosis, etc., by R. C. M. Page (J. H. Vail &amp; Co., New York); The Principles and Practice of Medicine, by William Osler (D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York); a Treatise on Mental and Nervous Diseases, by Landon Carter Gray (Lea Bros. &amp; Co., Philadelphia). HYGIENE. Adjunct Professor Davis. In this course the chemical and bacterial contamination of food, water, air and soil first engages the attention of the student. With this preparation he takes up the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with especial reference to modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in Military and Naval Hygiene. Text-Book.âRohÃ©'s Text-Book of Hygiene. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Professor Buckmaster. In this course the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in court of law. Text-Book.âReese's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. EXPENSES. [IN THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.] The necessary expenses of a student in the regular course of the Medical Department for the session of nine months are estimated as below, both for the lowest rate of living and for a more liberal expenditure: Tuition (including fees for laboratory materials). In the first year $120 $120 In the second year 100 100 In the third year 60 60 Matriculation* * The matriculation fee is subject to a reduction in the case of a student residing at his home in Charlottesville or its neighborhood. 40 40 Contingent deposit 10 10 Dormitory rent 15 30 Servant's attendance 9 9 Furniture for dormitory 9 19 Fuel and lights 12 24 Washing 14 14 Board 99 162 Total necessary expenses: In the first year $328 $428 Payable on entrance 228 268 In the second year 308 408 Payable on entrance 208 248 In the third year 268 368 Payable on entrance 168 208 Books, stationery and dissecting instruments for the entire course cost about $45. The contingent deposit of $10 is assessed for any damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on, with which the student himself may be chargeable; the balance remaining to his credit is returned to him on his leaving the University. Separate fees are charged when students who are not candidates for a degree pursue an elective instead of the regular course. A laboratory course in Practical Pharmacy. under Professor Dunnington, is also open to medical students, who are charged $3 to cover the cost of laboratory materials, tuition being free.

      <field name="fulltext">Pharmaceutical Department. JOHN W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., LL. D., F. R. S. Professor of Chemistry. FRANCIS P. DUNNINGTON, B. S. Professor of Analytical Chemistry. ALBERT H. TUTTLE, M. S. Professor of Botany. PAUL B. BARRINGER, M. D. Professor of Materia Medica. This Department is designed to furnish thorough and practical instruction in Pharmacy and in the sciences on which its principles rest. For this purpose facilities are provided in the Academical and Medical Departments, both in the way of teaching and material equipment. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The Course of Instruction comprehends the classes of Medical Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (First Course), Botany, Materia Medica, and Practical Pharmacy. In the course of Analytical Chemistry the Preparation of Medicines and the Detection of Adulterations in Drugs are substituted for Fire Assaying. EQUIPMENT. The Equipment consists of a very complete collection of chemical apparatus and specimens for illustrating the lectures on Chemistry; a large and well-arranged Chemical Laboratory, with all the necessary fittings and apparatus; a similar Botanical Laboratory; a museum of Botany and an extensive Herbarium; and a full set of specimens of Materia Medica. DEGREE. The degree of Graduate in Pharmacy is conferred on one who has passed examination in all the above-prescribed subjects of instruction. A well-trained and laborious student will be able to accomplish the work in a single session of nine months. EXPENSES. The necessary Expenses of a student in the Department of Pharmacy, with board at the lowest rate ($11), will be about $328, of which $225 must be paid on entrance. This is exclusive of the cost of books, stationery and chemical apparatus. Virginians save $25 in tuition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Law Department. JAS. H. GILMORE, LL. D., Professor of Law. WM. MINOR LILE, B. L. Professor of Law. WALTER D. DABNEY, B. L. Professor of Law. RALEIGH C. MINOR, M. A., B. L. Adjunct Professor of Law. COURSE OF STUDY. The course is arranged for two years, and, since the future professional success of the student depends upon his full mastery of elementary principles, it is not prudent to devote less time to preparing himself for the practice of the law. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with legal principles and to digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation must accompany the reception of knowledge, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially. The course is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Especial care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered that it is better for the student to follow the principle to its legitimate conclusion, even though that conclusion be at variance with the decision of the courts, than to arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory, or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures, with careful daily examinations upon both. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court, with its accompanying instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to write opinions upon supposed cases; to draw wills, contracts, conveyances, and other assurances; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct actions at law and suits in equity; to argue questions of law and of fact; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of practising counsel. LIBRARY. The department is provided with an excellent law library, which has recently received considerable additions, and contains several thousand volumes of well-selected reports and text-books, English and American. Its location has been chosen with especial reference to the convenience of the student. And, while he is not encouraged to venture for himself into either cases or text-books, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, the student is especially incited to familiarize himself with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To this subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are especially devoted. The student is taught how to look up authorities, where to look, and how to run down cases; how to ascertain the doctrine of a case, and to distinguish it from the dicta; to analyze, criticise and compare cases; how to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; what the leading text-books are on the various subjects taught, with some reference to their comparative merits; how to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar. ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES. The course of instruction in the Law Department comprises eight separate classes, the arrangement of which contemplates that two years shall be devoted to the completion of the course. As shown in the subjoined table, four of these classes constitute the first year's studies, and four the studies of the second year. In the first year's course there are eight lectures, and in the second year's course seven lectures, weekly. The lectures occupy an hour and a half each. The first year's course therefore calls for twelve hours of class work, and the second ten and a half hours, each week. In addition, any Professor has the privilege of requiring attendance upon one extra lecture each alternate week, in each class, for the purpose of review or such other instruction as does not add new matter to the prescribed course upon which the class is to be examined for graduation. The following table exhibits an outline of the course, the number of lectures in each class, and a list of the text-books used: FIRST YEAR'S COURSE. 1. Constitutional and International Law, Prof. Gilmore. Text-Books.âVattel's Law of Nations; Professor's Printed Notes; The Federalist; Printed Notes of Professor on the Constitution. Two lectures a week throughout the session to April 1. 2. The Law of Personal Relations; Personal Property; Partnership; Probate and Administration, Prof. Lile. Text-Books.âVols. I. and III. Minor's Institutes; Printed Notes of Professor; Burks' Property Rights of Married Women. Two lectures a week throughout the session to April 15. 3. The Law of Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases, Prof. Dabney. Text-Book.âVol. IV. Minor's Institutes. Two lectures a week throughout the session to May 15. 4. The Law of Contracts; Torts; Carriers, Prof. Dabney. Text-Books.âClark on Contracts; Webb's Pollock on Torts; (Text-Book on Carriers to be announced.) Two lectures a week throughout the session. SECOND YEAR'S COURSE. 1. The Law of Evidence; Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure, Prof. Gilmore. Text-Books.âVol. I. Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams' Equity; Printed Notes of Professor. Two lectures a week throughout the session. 2. The Law of Negotiable Instruments; Sales; Insurance; Corporations, Prof. Lile. Text-Books.âBigelow's Bills, Notes and Cheques (Student's Series); Tiffany on Sales; Richards on Insurance; Printed Notes of Professor on Corporations, (Text-Book to be announced.) Two lectures a week throughout the session. 3. The Law of Real Estate, Prof. Minor. Text-Book.âVol. II. Minor's Institutes. Three lectures a week throughout the session until April 1. 4. The Law of Crimes and Punishments, Prof. Minor. Text-Book.âMinor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Three lectures a week from April 1 to close of session. EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREE. The degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those students who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all of the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing all the written examinations, intermediate and final, in each of the eight classes, and who have satisfactorily performed the Moot Court, or other assigned, work. The rule formerly prevailing in this department required applicants for the degree to attend the lectures in all the classes, and to stand all the regular written examinations on every subject in the course, during the year of their candidacy, without credit for any class completed in a previous yearâexcept in the class of Constitutional and International Law. With the beginning of the session of 1895-'96 a radical departure was inaugurated, by permitting a candidate to complete a portion of the course in one session and the remainder the following session, without requiring attendance upon the lectures, or further examination, in such classes as he may have previously completed. But a re-examination in the work of a previous year may be required, whenever, in any case, it may be deemed proper. Two written examinations, an intermediate and a final, are held in each class (save in that of Criminal Law, in which a single examination is held at the close of the session), making fifteen examinations in the entire courseâseven in the first and eight in the second year. The general policy of the University is to permit students to elect their own work, and to give them due credit for its satisfactory completion, without regard to the time devoted to it. There is, therefore, no positive rule forbidding students to undertake the whole course in a single year, or withholding from them the degree in case of its successful completion. But the student is warned that even though he may have had exceptional legal training he can scarcely hope to complete the course in a single year; and if by extreme diligence and industry he should succeed in the effort, he is apt to find that he has acquired more than he has been able to digest. The fact is emphasized that since the reorganization of the Department and the very considerable enlargement of the course of study, it is practically impossible to complete the work, as had not been unusual before, in a single year. Students who can attend but a single session are earnestly advised to take special courses, which the arrangements of the classes readily permit. No entrance examinations are held, and no advanced standing can be secured by certificates of work accomplished at other law schoolsâthe whole course must be completed here. Candidates who attain a standard of seventy-five per centum in any Junior class, but who fail to reach the minimum grade required for graduation (eighty-three per centum), are entitled, after matriculation, to stand an examination at the beginning of the following session on the subjects comprised in the class or classes in which they have so failed, and to receive the same credit for the result as if achieved during the previous session. This will enable the earnest student to make up during the summer any deficiency of the previous year, and to go forward with his second year's course, unhampered by work brought over from his first year. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations, as may be prescribed. Seats in the Law Lecture-room are assigned in the order of matriculation. EXPENSES. (IN THE LAW DEPARTMENT.) The necessary expenses of a student in the Law Department, for the session of nine months, are estimated as below for the lowest rate and for a more liberal scale of living: Tuition, $100 $100 Matriculation,* * The matriculation fee is subject to a reduction in the case of a student residing at his home in Charlottesville or its neighborhood. 40 40 Contingent deposit, 10 10 Dormitory rent, 15 30 Servant's attendance, 9 9 Furniture for dormitory, 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing, 14 14 Board 99 162 Total $308 $408 Payable on entrance, 230 284 The contingent deposit of $10 is assessed for any damage to property, violation of library rules, etc., by the student; the balance remaining to his credit is returned to him on his leaving the University. To the above estimate must be added the cost of books and stationery, about $90 for the entire course. The books are not fairly to be accounted amongst the expenses, since they constitute a permanent investment, and will form the nucleus of a library when the student becomes a practitioner. The tuition fee of $100 covers the charges for the regular first or second year's course, including any first year class taken but not completed the first year, and brought over into the second year. It also covers any other combination of four classes. For more than four classes the fee is $115; for three classes $85; for two classes, $65; for one class, $40. In estimating the fees, the classes in real estate and criminal law are regarded as one. Mr. James B. Green, B. L. (U. Va., 1871), acts as Licentiate Instructor in the Law Department.

      <field name="fulltext">Physical Culture. WILLIAM A. LAMBETH, M. D., Director of the Gymnasium. The work offered in Physical Training and the privileges of the Gymnasium, with the services of the Director, are given free of cost to every regularly matriculated student of the University. The exercises, whether individual or concerted, are optional, but all students are advised to take advantage of at least the regular class exercises. These are arranged at such hours as not to encroach upon time which should be spent in lecture or study, and include instruction in all forms of gymnastic apparatus, and in boxing, wrestling and fencing. Advice as to the use of various appliances is given upon the basis of a thorough physical examination, and with a view to securing uniform physical development. The Fayerweather Gymnasium provides in the basement baths of all kinds, with cold and hot water, a swimming-pool, lockers, and bowling alleys. On the first floor are the main exercise-hall and the various offices, and in the gallery above are the running-track and a loft for spectators. The supply of apparatus is ample and of the best quality. The Campus, adjacent to the Gymnasium, and the Athletic Field, on the southern side of the grounds, furnish ample space for foot-ball, base-ball, tennis, and track-athletics. The former contains a well-drained and ballasted quarter-mile running track; on the latter the exhibition games of foot-ball and base-ball are held. Athletics among the students are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, an organization of students whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its Gymnasium Committee, exercises only a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or unwise excesses in physical exercises, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management. But a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University, and students are not allowed to play upon the University ball teams except after examination by the Director of the Gymnasium and with his approbation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Expenses. The University Fees paid by all students in the regular courses are for the entire session of nine months, as follows: Department. Academic. Law. Medicine. Pharmacy. Engineering Agriculture. Matriculation $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 $ 40 Contingent 10 10 10 10 10 10 Tuition 75 100 120* * In the first year; in the second year, $100; in the third year, $60. 120 100 100 Total $125 $150 $170 $170 $150 $150 Reduced charges to Virginians 50 145 100 50 The unassessed portion of the contingent deposit of $10 is credited in the final settlement. The Living Expenses of the student vary with the cost of the board, which is $11 a month at the Mess Club, $16 at Mrs. Elsom's and Mrs. Harris' hotels, and from $16 to $20 at private boarding-houses; and depend also upon whether the student shares his dormitory with a room-mate or is the sole occupant. The following estimates are for the lowest and highest ordinary rates: Dormitory rent $15 $ 30 Servant's attendance 9 9 Furniture for dormitory 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing 14 14 Board 99 162 Total, $158 $258 Board at the University hotels is deposited with the Proctor, and must be paid monthly in advance; but the student may change his hotel at the end of any fiscal month on application to the Chairman. The Total Necessary Expenses for the session of nine months vary, therefore, between the following limits for the regular courses, exclusive of books, stationery, laboratory materials, etc.: Department Regular Charges. Charges to Virginians.

Starred (*) courses include the charges for laboratory materials. In Graduate Chemistry the fee for materials varies according to the work done. Applied Mathematics $ 50 Agricultural Chemistry 15 Analytical Chemistry (15) 100* Analytical Chemistry, first course ($10) 60* Assaying ($10) 50* Biology and Agriculture 45* Botany 20* Determinative Mineralogy ($5) 20* General Biology 35* Graduate Chemistry ($10) 50 Mechanical Drawing 10 Practical Physics 10* Shop Work 20* Lawâone class 40 Lawâtwo classes 65 Lawâthree classes $ 85 Lawâfour classes 100 Lawâfull course 115 Medical Chemistry The fees for special courses in the Medical Department will be announced as soon as revised by the Visitors to accord with the new three-year plan. Medical Biology Anatomy Physiology Practice Surgery Materia Medica Gynecology and Obstetrics Medical Jurisprudence Hygiene Pathology Clinics Except as above stated, the tuition fee for one School, taken alone, is $50; for two Schools, $60; for three or more, $25 each. All of the foregoing items are payable on entrance, except board and washing. An abatement of one-third in fees for matriculation, dormitory rent, and tuition, is made to students who enter after December 15th; two-thirds after March 15th. Privileged Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Literary or Scientific Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarships and Fellowships. Eleven University Scholarships are open to new-comers from any of the States at the beginning of the academic year; five are in the Academical Department and two each in the Departments of Law, Medicine, and Engineering.

      <field name="fulltext">Societies of Students. There are two Literary Societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Societyâconnected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session and at its close. The two Societies jointly maintain the University Magazine, and annually invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them in the Public Hall at the close of the session. In each Society medals are givenâone to the best debater, another to the best orator, and a third medal is awarded for the best original contribution to the University Magazine by a member of either Society. MEDALISTS. 1894-'95. Jefferson Society Orator Wm. Kinckle Allen, Va. Washington Society Orator Aubrey E. Strode, S. C. Washington Society Debater John R. Rew, Va.

      <field name="fulltext">Regulations. 1. Admission.âThe age of the student must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended, or other evidence of general good conduct, is required. The student must matriculate in at least three academical schools, or their equivalent, except by special order of the Faculty. 2. Dormitory.âThe occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Proctor before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Proctor on or before September 1st, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sub-let or used for other than its proper purpose. 3. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the University precincts, or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the Chairman to withdraw the license from any house, in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Chairman's office. 4. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, may be made by the student within one week after registration: thereafter it is permitted only by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same school with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. 5. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the student's professors and the Chairman, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or the musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. 6. Absence from Lecture may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses should be rendered at the first lecture attended after the absence. The Chairman is required to present for discipline every student charged with eight or more unexcused absences in all classes during either half-session, that is, before or after midnight of January 31st. 7. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by the physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. In such cases a special examination will be granted, but in no other. 8. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Chairman. When the permit is granted upon the physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are retured pro rata. 9. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault, which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. 10. Conduct.âDrunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the Chairman is instructed to dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them. Profane swearing, habits of expense, visiting bar-rooms or gaming tables, the use or possession of fire-arms or other deadly weapons, the unauthorized contraction of debts, and the use by the student in his lodgings or in the University precincts of intoxicating drinks, except on prescription of the University physician, are also violations of University law, and punishable by admonition or suspension. In all cases of discipline the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defence. ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on the Gymnasium is entrusted with the general oversight of field and track athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or the morals of the participants. 2. No one shall be a member of any University athletic team, or act as such in any intercollegiate contest, who is not at the time of such contest a regularly matriculated student or an instructor in the University. 3. No student will be permitted to play upon the University foot-ball and base-ball teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium, and with his approbation. 4. Leave of absence for the purpose of playing intercollegiate match games may be allowed to the base-ball and foot-ball teams, such leaves not to exceed four days in the session in the case of either team. 5. No student under twenty-one years old will be permitted to play with either team in games away from the University, either as a regular member of the team or as a substitute, except upon written permission from his parent or guardian, addressed to the Chairman of the Faculty. 6. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be permitted to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacations and holidays. 7. Special monthly reports will be made to the Faculty with respect to the class standing and progress in study of each player on the athletic teams during the foot-ball and base-ball seasons, whether such player be a regular or substitute member of either team or an applicant for either position. 8. Any member of an athletic team who is reported for neglect of his studies or nonattendance on lectures may be required by the Faculty to server his connection with such team. 9. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 10. Experts for purposes of instruction and professional teams for purposes of practice may be employed on the University grounds, but only with written permission from the Chairman of the Faculty. The foregoing regulations shall be applicable also, mutatis mutandis, to Musical Clubs.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Young Men's Christian Association. This was founded in 1858, and is the oldest of the College Christian Associations. Its object is to promote the religious and moral welfare of the students by furnishing opportunities for religious work in and near the University, and facilities for various kinds of healthful recreation and instruction. Under the former head it conducts Sunday-schools at the University and among the poor of the neighboring mountains, carries on a system of central and district weekly prayer-meetings, and arranges for courses of Bible-study under the direction of competent and experienced teachers. Under the latter head it publishes a compact and useful Students' Hand-Book to the University, secures periodical public lectures and discourses, conducts the Students' Reading-Room, and has purchased and put-into a high state of improvement a valuable field near the Fayerweather Gymnasium as a free Campus for athletic sports. The Students' Reading-Room was, until the recent fire, convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It has been re-established in temporary quarters, and will be much better provided for in the new buildings soon to be erected. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $2 to meet its current expenses. The Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the good work of this Association to the students of the University, all of whom are invited to unite in its membership and privileges.</field>
