      <field name="fulltext">Extract from minutes of a meeting of the Board of Visitors, held on April 25, 1928. The Rector stated to the Board that a compilation of all the Statute Law of Virginia, affecting the University, has been completed by Mr. Berkeley Minor and Mr. James Fontaine Minor, both of whom are Alumni of the University, and presented by them to the University, which compilation has been heretofore ordered printed by this Board, and is now in the hands of the printer. It was thereupon RESOLVED—That the labor performed by Mr. Berkeley Minor and Mr. James Fontaine Minor for their Alma Mater, involving the examination of all Acts of Assembly from 1802 down to and including the Extra Session of 1927, and the transcription of all relevant matter, is of the greatest value to the University, to its Officers and to this Board. Through their painstaking efforts the records of the University have been richly added to, and the Rector and Visitors now desire to record their appreciation and express their sincere thanks to these gentlemen for their generous gift. The treatment is chronological entirely, and no attempt has been made to set forth here the Chapters of the various codes relative to the University, and for some phases of the present law as to the University, the Code of 1919 and Acts subsequent thereto should be consulted. Much of what is contained in this compilation is obsolete as legislation, but of great historical interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Legislative History While the University of Virginia, eo nomine, was not, legislatively speaking, started until 1817, several statutes that may be considered as leading in that direction, and laying what afterwards proved to be the foundation or beginnings of the University, were enacted several years earlier. The first inkling that we have found of an intention looking towards another higher institution of learning, besides the College of William and Mary, is a resolution of the House of Delegates, adopted Tuesday, December 1st., 1795, and agreed to by the Senate the following day, reading as follows: "Whereas the migration of American youth to foreign countries for the completion of their education, exposes them to the danger of imbibing political prejudices disadvantageous to their own republican forms of government, and ought therefore to be rendered unnecessary and avoided: Resolved, That the plan contemplated of erecting an university at the federal city, where the youth of the several states may be assembled, and their course of education finished, deserves the countenance and support of each state. And whereas when the general assembly presented sundry shares in the James River and Patowmac Companies, to George Washington, as a small token of their gratitude for the great, eminent, and unrivalled services he had rendered to this commonwealth, to the United States, and to the world at large, in support of the principles of liberty and equal government, it was their wish and desire that he should appropriate them as he might think best: And whereas the present general assembly retain the same high sense of his virtues, wisdom and patriotism: Resolved therefore, That the appropriation by the said George Washington of the aforesaid shares in the Patowmac company to the university intended to be erected in the federal city, is made in a manner most worthy of public regard and of the approbation of this commonwealth. Resolved also, That he be requested to appropriate the aforesaid shares in James River company, to a seminary at such place in the upper country as he may deem most convenient to a majority of the inhabitants thereof". December 2nd, 1795. Agreed to by the Senate. Va. Stat. at Large, Vol. 1 (Shepherd) p. 434 (1792-1806). George Washington did so appropriate the shares subscribed in his name in the James River Canal Company, to the use of Liberty Hall Academy in Rockbridge county, which soon became Washington College, and then Washington and Lee University. 1802-3. We come then to the act to establish an academy in the county of Albemarle, and for other purposes. (Passed January 12, 1803) Chap. 34 of Laws of Virginia December 1802. "Be it enacted by the general assembly, That Wilson E. Nicholas, Francis Walker, George Divers, John Nicholas, William Wardlow, Thomas M. Randolph, John Carr, Dabney Carr, Peter Carr, Edward Garland, Samuel Murrell, Charles Everitt, William D. Meriwether, and Thomas W. Lewis, gentlemen, be, and they are hereby constituted a body politic and corporate, by the name of "The Trustees of Albemarle Academy", and by that name shall have perpetual succession and a common seal. 2. The said trustees and their successors, or a majority of them, by the name aforesaid, shall be capable in law to purchase, receive and hold to them and their successors forever, any lands, tenements, rents, goods and chattels, of what kind soever, which may be purchased by, or sold, devised or given to them for the use of the said academy; and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same in such manner as to them shall seem most conducive to the advantages of the said academy. 3. (Empowers the trustees to sue and be sued; to make by-laws, rules and regulations and to appoint a president and other officers, erect buildings, etc.; to take and receive subscriptions and enforce the same.) 4. (Provides for filling vacancies.) 5. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the said trustees and their successors, or a majority of them, to raise by lottery or lotteries, the sum of three thousand dollars, to be applied by them towards the erection of buildings necessary for the said academy. 6. This act shall be in force from the passing thereof." Vol. 2, Shepherd's Va. Stats. at Large, p. 427. 1803. Then, by Chap. 78 of Laws of Va., Dec. 1803, the Act incorporating "The Trustees of Albemarle Academy", was amended by adding to the trustees the following: James Lewis, Isaac Miller, William W. Herring, John Harris, Benjamin Brown, Thomas C. Fletcher, John Kelly, Christopher Hudson and Rice Garland, gentlemen. Vol. 3, Shepherd's Va. Stats. at Large, p. 60. 1816. We next come to the incorporation of "The Central College" by Chap. 75 of the Acts of 1816, passed Feb. 14, 1816. 1. "Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That there shall be established in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be elected by the Trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy, an institution, for the education of youth, to be called, "The Central College", which shall be established, governed and administered as follows: 2. The Governor of this Commonwealth for the time being shall be the Patron of the said College, and shall have power to appoint the visitors thereof in the first instance, and to fill up such vacancies in the board of visitors as may exist afterwards from time to time. 3. There shall be six visitors, who shall hold their offices each for the term of three years, if he shall so long demean himself well; of which the Chancellor of the district shall be the competent judge. 4. The said board of visitors shall have two stated meetings in every year, in the said college; to-wit; on the day of the commencement of the Spring term of the Albemarle Circuit Court, and on the day of the commencement of the Fall term of the said Circuit Court; and such occasional meetings as may be called from time to time by any three members, giving effectual and timely notice to the others; and if, from any cause, the said visitors do not attend the said stated meetings, or such occasional meetings as may be called from time to time, the said meetings may be adjourned from day to day, until a general meeting shall be had. 5. They, or a majority of them, shall have power to appoint a Treasurer and Proctor; to establish professorships, prescribe their duties, and the course of education to be pursued; determine the salaries, and accommodations they shall receive from the College, and the perquisites from their pupils; to lay down rules for the government and discipline of the students; for their subsistence, board and accommodation, and the charges to which they shall be subject for these, and for tuition; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants and others, with respect to the buildings, lands and other property of the College, and to the providing subsistence, board, accommodations, and all necessaries for the students and others appertaining to the same; and to fix the allowance and emoluments for their salaries; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which to them shall seem best for promoting the purposes of the institution, and for securing, improving and employing its property; which several functions may be exercised by them in the form of by-laws, rules, orders, instructions, or otherwise as they shall deem proper. 6. There shall be a Treasurer, to be appointed by the visitors, to hold his office during their pleasure; whose duty it shall be to receive all monies which shall become due, or accrue to the college; to pay all monies which shall be due from it, according to such directions, general or special, as shall be given by the board of visitors, and to render his accounts at such times, in such forms, and to such persons, as they shall require or to themselves. 7. There shall be a proctor, to be appointed by the visitors, to hold his office during their pleasure. In him, in trust for the college, shall be vested, transmissible to his successors, the legal estate in all property of the College, whether in possession, in interest, or in action; and he shall have authority to maintain the same in all suits, as plaintiff or defendant; which suits shall not abate by the determination of his office, but shall stand revived in the name of his successor; he shall be capable in law, and in trust for the College, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, of purchasing, receiving and holding, transmissible to his successor, all property, real and personal, in possession, interest or action. 8. It shall be his duty to superintend, manage, preserve, and improve all the property of the College, in possession, interest or action, to erect, preserve, and repair the buildings, improvements, and possessions; to provide subsistence and other necessaries, and to direct and control the due and economical dispensation of them; to employ and control all agents, servants and others necessary for the works or the services praedial or menial of the institution; and in all these functions he shall act conformably with the provisions and principles established by the visitors, of whose laws, regulations and orders he shall have the general execution, when not addressed to any other person. 9. And be it further enacted, That the rights and claims, now existing in the said Albemarle Academy and its Trustees, shall by this Act become vested in the said Central College, and its proper officers, so soon as they shall be appointed; and that, in aid of the subscriptions and donations obtained, and to be obtained, and of the proceeds of the lottery authorized by the Act for establishing the Albemarle Academy, the said College shall, by its proper officers, when appointed, be authorized to demand and receive the monies which arose from the sales of the Glebe Lands of the parishes of Saint Ann and Fredericksville, in the County of Albemarle, or such part thereof as belongs to the County of Albemarle or its citizens, in whatever they may be, to be employed for the purposes of the said College. 10. And be it further enacted, That the act passed in the year one thousand eight hundred and three for establishing the said Albemarle Academy, that of the same year amending the said act, and all other provisions of other acts contrary to the purview of this act shall be repealed from and after the appointment of Visitors, as therein (sic) provided. 11. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." Acts of Assembly, 1816, p. 191. 1817-18. Then we come to the Act establishing "The University of Virginia". It is Sec. 8 of an act entitled, "an Act appropriating part of the Revenue of the Literary Fund, and for other purposes", being Chapter XI of the Acts of 1817-18, p. 11. The first seven sections created school commissioners of the several counties, cities and towns and borough of Norfolk, and provided for their meetings, powers, duties, education of poor children, etc. The eighth section then begins: "8. Be it further enacted, That there shall be established, in some convenient and proper part of the State, a university to be called, "The University of Virginia",—wherein all the branches of useful science shall be taught. In order to aid the Legislature in ascertaining the permanent site of the said University and in organizing it, there shall be appointed without delay by the Executive of this Commonwealth twenty-four discreet and intelligent persons, who shall constitute a board to be called "The board of commissioners for the University". One member of the said board, shall be appointed from each of the Senatorial Districts, as they were arranged, by an act of the last session of the Legislature. If any person so appointed shall fail or refuse to act, his place shall be supplied from the same district, by appointment of the president and directors of the literary fund. The said board shall meet on the first day of August next at the Tavern in Rockfish gap on the Blue Ridge for the purpose of performing the duties hereby assigned to them. At least three-fourths of the whole number shall be necessary to form a board for the transaction of business; but any smaller number may adjourn from day to day, until a quorum shall attend. The said board, when assembled, shall have power to adjourn from time to time, and from place to place, until their duties shall have been performed. It shall be their duty to enquire and report to the Legislature at their next session: First—a proper scite for the University; Secondly—a plan for the buildings thereof; Thirdly—The branches of learning, which should be taught therein; Fourthly—The number and description of professorships; and Fifthly—Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature, for the better organizing and governing the University. The said board are also authorized and required to receive any voluntary contributions, whether conditional or absolute, whether in land, money or other property, which may be offered, through them, to the president and directors of the literary fund, for the benefit of the University; and to report the same to the Legislature, at their next session. The members of the said board of commissioners shall be allowed for their services the same pay and travelling expences as are allowed to members of the General Assembly, to be ascertained and certified by the board, and paid out of the literary fund. 9. Be it further enacted, That, as soon as the scite of the said University shall be ascertained by law, there shall be appropriated, out of the revenue of the literary fund, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars per annum, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of procuring the land and erecting the buildings, and for the permanent endowment of the said University; Provided, however, that the appropriation, hereby made to the University, shall in no manner impair or diminish the appropriations hereinbefore made to the education of the poor in the several counties and corporations. 10. Be it further enacted, That the University aforesaid shall be under the government of thirteen visitors to be appointed by the president and directors of the literary fund, and to hold their offices for seven years, and until their successors shall be appointed, unless sooner displaced by the said president and directors. All vacancies in the office of visitor, by death, resignation, or removal out of the Commonwealth, or failure to act, for the space of one year, shall be supplied by the said president and directors. 11. The said visitors shall appoint one of their own body to be rector, and they shall be a body corporate, under the name and style of "The rector and visitors of the University of Virginia"; and, as such, they may have and use a common seal, receive and hold property for the benefit of the University, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded. They shall have power to appoint a clerk for their own body, and allow him a reasonable compensation for his services; to appoint and remove the professors and all other officers of the University; to regulate their salaries and fees; and to make all such by-laws, rules and regulations, as may be necessary to the good government of the University, and not contrary to the laws of the land. But the said rector and visitors shall at all times conform to such laws, as the Legislature may from time to time think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, at all times, be subject to the control of the Legislature. 12. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the first day of March next." Acts of 1817-18. p. 11. It will be noticed that this Act did not locate the University, but left that important choice to "The board of commissioners for the University" 1818-19. This board proceeded to function, and as the result of their action and choice, Chapter XIX, of the Acts of Assembly of 181819, passed January 25, 1819, Entitled "An Act for Establishing An University", (p. 15 of said Acts), was enacted, reading as follows: "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use, and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. 2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the scite provided for the said college, an university, to be called, "The University of Virginia"; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. 3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others from time to time, as may be necessary. 4. In the said university shall be taught the Latin, Greek and Hebrew Languages, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Anglo-Saxon, the different branches of mathematics, pure and physical— natural philosophy, the principles of agriculture, chemistry, mineralogy, including geology, botany, zoology, anatomy, medicine, civil government, political economy, the law of nature and nations, municipal law, history, ideology, general grammar, ethics, rhetorick, and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. 5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student, as the visitors shall from time to time establish. 6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a Bursar, employ a Proctor, and all other necessary agents, to appoint and remove professors, two thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties, and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate the tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances and other property, and interests of the University; to draw from the Literary Fund such monies as are by law charged on it, for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient, for promoting the purposes of the said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, rules, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. 7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit: on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings shall be at the University; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business, and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with like advice shall appoint a successor. 8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the university, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the university, of receiving subscriptions and donations real and personal, as well from bodies corporate, or persons associated, as from private individuals. 9. And the said rectors (sic) and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the Legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said university shall, in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the Legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby required to make report, annually, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, (to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding session,) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the said university. 10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said university, enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excell in any branch of science, there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and excite to industry and emulation. 11. On every twenty-ninth of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest, day thereafter, on which a meeting can be affected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said university, either the same or others, at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as herein-before provided; Provided, That nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting the objects of the said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. 12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the Literary Fund, in aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner, and upon the same conditions in all respects, as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled, "an act appropriating part of the revenue of the Literary Fund, and for other purposes", passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen. (Repealed immediately, see infra). 13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof. Acts of Assembly, 1818-19, pp. 15-18. (This Act appears as Chap. 34 of the Code of 1819, p. 90.) Then follows immediately in the Acts of Assembly, though passed March 3rd., 1819, Chapter XX, entitled "Part of the Act to reduce into one the several acts concerning the Literary Fund". Secs. 21 and 22 alone were printed here, as they alone related to the University. They follow (repealing section 12, supra): "21. All Acts, and parts of acts, coming within the purview of this act, and especially so much of an act passed during the present session of the General Assembly, entitled, "an act for the establishment of an University", as appropriates the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars, annually, out of the revenue of the literary fund, to the education of the poor, shall be and the same are hereby repealed: Provided, that all rights and remedies, fines, penalties, and forfeitures, and proceedings, heretofore accrued, incurred or commenced, shall be and remain in the same state and condition, as if this act had never been passed. 22. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the first day of January eighteen hundred and twenty; except so much thereof as repeals the additional appropriation of twenty thousand dollars, annually, out of the revenue of the literary fund; and so much of this act as repeals the said appropriation shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." p. 18. Note. However it seems that Sec. 20 should have been printed there also, as it supplied the place of Sec. 12 of the Act Establishing an University, repealed by Sec.21. We reproduce it here as it appears in this connection in the Code of 1819, as Sec. 20 of Chap. 33, p. 89. "20. Be it further enacted, That there shall be appropriated out of the revenue of the Literary Fund, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars per annum, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of procuring land, and erecting the buildings, and for the permanent endowment of the University of Virginia; Provided, however, That the appropriation hereby made to the University, shall in no manner impair or diminish the appropriations hereinbefore made, to the education of the poor in the several counties and corporations". Note. Compare Acts 1817-18, Chap. 11, pp. 9, 11, Supra. Chapter LXXXVII of the Acts of 1818-19 (p. 134), is merely "An Act authorizing the Auditor to renew a lost certificate in favor of the Central College". Passed Dec. 31, 1818. 1819-20. The only legislation in 1819-20 was Chapter XIII, Entitled, "An Act authorizing the Visitors of the University of Virginia to borrow money for finishing the buildings thereof". Passed February 24, 1820; See p. 14 of Acts, as follows: "1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That the visitors of the University of Virginia, shall be, and they are hereby authorized, for the purpose of finishing the buildings thereof, to borrow from any of the banks of this commonwealth, or from any other person, body politic or corporate, any sum of money not exceeding sixty thousand dollars, at a rate of interest not exceeding six per centum per annum, and to pledge for the payment of the interest, and redemption of the principal, of the money so borrowed, any part of the annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars heretofore made by law to the said university: Provided, That the aforesaid pledge shall not extend to the commonwealth, or beyond the aforesaid annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars. 2. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." p. 14 of Acts of 1819-20. Also appears as Chap. 29 of Supt. to Rev. Code 1819, p. 44. 1820-21. The only legislation this year was Chapter IX. entitled "An Act concerning the University of Virginia". Passed Fabruary 24, 1821. See p. 15 of the Acts. It follows: "1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That, out of such money as shall hereafter be received by the president and directors of the literary fund, from the government of the United States, or out of such other money as may be at the disposal of the said president and directors, and not otherwise appropriated by law, there shall be loaned by the said president and directors, to the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia, for the purpose of completing the buildings and making the necessary preparations for putting the said university into operation, any sum which may be required by the said rector and visitors, not exceeding sixty thousand dollars, at an interest of six per centum per annum, to be paid out of the annual appropriation heretofore made by law for the endowment of the said university: Provided, always, That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to affect the appropriations made or intended to be made, for the support of primary schools. 2. Be it further enacted, That, if there shall not be sufficient funds, at the disposal of the said president and directors, to make the loan hereby authorized, it shall be lawful for the said rector and visitors to borrow, within the limit aforesaid, from any person, body politic or corporate, for the purpose aforesaid, any sum which they may deem expedient, at an interest not exceeding six per centum per annum, payable out of the appropriation aforesaid, and to pledge, for the redemption of the principal of such loan, the surplus of the said appropriation, over and above what may be necessary to pay the interest upon loans negotiated by them. And it shall be lawful for any of the banks within this commonwealth to lend to the said rector and visitors, upon the terms and conditions herein prescribed, the whole, or any part of the money which they are hereby authorized to borrow: Provided, That the said rector and visitors shall not be authorized, in virtue of this act, to borrow more than the aforesaid sum of sixty thousand dollars. 3. Be it further enacted, That the payment of the principal sum of money heretofore loaned by the president and directors of the literary fund, to the rector and visitors of the university, shall be deferred, if the said rector and visitors require it, until the same shall become payable pursuant to the provisions of this act: Pro- vided, however, That the interest thereon shall be annually paid out of the appropriation aforesaid. 4. Be it further enacted, That the surplus of the said annual appropriation made for the endowment of the university, over and above what may be necessary for payment of the interest on loans already made to them, and the loan or loans that may be negotiated under this act, shall be, and the same are hereby pledged, for the redemption of the principal sums loaned and to be loaned as aforesaid, after the following manner, that is to say: first, for the redemption of the principal sum or sums which may be borrowed of any person, body politic or corporate, other than the president and directors of the literary fund, in such manner as shall have been agreed upon between the lender and the said rector and visitors; and next, for the redemption of the principal sum borrowed and to be borrowed of the said president and directors, in such manner as the legislature may hereafter prescribe: Provided, That nothing in this act contained, shall be so construed as to pledge the faith of this state to the payment of any sum or sums of money, other than the fifteen thousand dollars annually appropriated to the university. 5. Be it further enacted, That whenever the annual income of the literary fund shall exceed sixty thousand dollars, the surplus above that sum, until such surplus shall amount to twenty thousand dollars, shall be appropriated, and the same is hereby appropriated, to the endowment of such colleges, academies, or intermediate schools, within this Commonwealth, as the General Assembly may hereafter designate as fit institutions for such endowment. 6. All acts and parts of acts, coming within the purview of this act, shall be, and the same are hereby repealed. 7. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." Acts 1820-21, pp. 15 &amp; 16. Appears as Chap. 30, Rev. Code 1819. p. 44 Supt., Chap. 17. p. 32. 1822-23. At this session—begun Dec. 2, 1822—we find two acts affecting the University, viz; Chapters 10 and 11. The Chapter 10, entitled "An Act to require all annual reports to be made to the Legislature on the first day of the session, and for other purposes", was passed February 15, 1823. After the preamble, and Sec. 1, with a general provision as to annual reports, Sec. 2 follows: "2. And be it further enacted, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, shall hereafter make their annual report, to the president and directors of the Literary Fund, on or before the first Monday in December in each year, to be laid before the General Assembly at the commencement of each session. 3. Be it further enacted, That whensoever any Visitor of the said University, shall have failed to perform the duties of his office for twelve months, it shall be the duty of the board, at their next meeting after the expiration of the said twelve months, to enter such failure in the minutes of their proceedings; and, if no sufficient cause for such failure be shown to the board, they shall cause it to be certified to the executive, that the seat of such Visitor is vacated, in order that the vacancy may be supplied: But, if sufficient cause for such failure be shown to the said board, at any time before they shall have certified the same to the executive as aforesaid, the seat of such Visitor shall not thereby be vacated. If, however, so many of the said Visitors shall, at any time, fail to perform duty for one whole year, as not to leave a quorum to form a board without them, it shall be the duty of the Rector to certify such failure to the executive; and thereupon the seats of such Visitors shall be vacated, and the executive shall proceed to fill the vacancies. 4. This act shall commence and be in force from the passing thereof." Acts 1822-23, p. 12. It also appears as Chap. 14 of Supt. to Revised Code of 1819, p. 31, and Chap. 31. p. 45. It is noteworthy that in this act, for the first time are capital letters prefixed to the words "Rector", "Visitors" and "University" throughout the act. Then follows Chapter 11, entitled "An act concerning the University of Virginia, and for other purposes". Passed February 5th., 1823. "Whereas it is represented to the General Assembly, by the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia (sic, as to capitalization), that the sums of money heretofore appropriated for the buildings of the said University, have been found insufficient for that object, and that it is highly expedient, that the said buildings should be completed, before the institution is put into operation: 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That out of the uninvested capital, now lying in the Literary Fund, there shall be loaned by the president and directors of the said fund, to the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia, for the purpose of completing the buildings and making the necessary preparations, for putting the said University into operation, any sum which may be required by the said rector and visitors, not exceeding sixty thousand dollars, at an interest of six per centum per annum, to be paid out of the annual appropriation, heretofore made by law, for the endowment of the said University. 2. Be it further enacted, That the surplus of the said annual appropriation made for the endowment of the University, over and above what may be necessary for the payment of the interest on loans already made to them, and the loan or loans which may be negotiated under this act, shall be, and the same is hereby pledged for the redemption of the principal sums loaned, and to be loaned as aforesaid, in such manner as the legislature may hereafter prescribe. (Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, relating to school commissioners and their duties, are omitted.) 8. All acts and parts of acts, coming within the purview of this act, shall be and the same are hereby repealed. 9. This act shall commence and be in force, from and after the passing thereof." Acts 1822-23, pp. 13, 14. Also appears as Chap. 32, Supt. to Rev. Code 1819, p. 46. 1823-24. Lack of funds still embarrassed the University, and payment of interest on loans to it from the Literary Fund, and relief was sought. Chapter 7, entitled, "An act concerning the University of Virginia", was passed January 27th, 1824. It follows: "Whereas it is represented to this General Assembly, by the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia, that, were its funds liberated from their present incumbrances, the institution might go into operation at the close of the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four; and it is deemed expedient to adopt the necessary measures for effecting so desirable an object: 1. Be it therefore enacted, That the annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars, made by law to the said university, shall be, and the same is hereby discharged from the payment of interest on the several loans made by virtue of the several acts following, to-wit; one act, passed February the twenty-fourth, eighteen hundred and twenty, entitled, "an act authorizing the visitors of the University of Virginia to borrow money for finishing the buildings thereof"; one other act, passed February the twenty-fourth, eighteen hundred and twenty-one, entitled, "an act concerning the University of Virginia"; and one other act, passed February the fifth, 1823, entitled, "an act concerning the University of Virginia, and for other purposes"; and, also, from all liability for the redemption of the pledge or pledges contained in all or any of the acts aforesaid: Provided always, That nothing in this act contained, shall be so construed as to prevent the General Assembly of this commonwealth, at any further session thereof, from directing the funds hereby liberated, to be again applied to the payment of the debts created by authority of the several acts herein referred to, if, in their discretion, such a measure shall be deemed proper. 2. Be it further enacted, That the aforesaid interest upon the said loans shall be paid, in conformity to the terms thereof, out of any surplus revenue, or uninvested income, belonging to the Literary Fund: Provided always, That, if any portion of the income of the Literary Fund, derived, or to be derived, from escheats, confiscations, forfeitures, derelict personal property, fines, and pecuniary penalties, shall be used by virtue of the provisions in this act contained, and the calamities of war should at any future time render it proper for the Legislature to withdraw from the Literary Fund any part of the capital thereof, remaining vested therein under the authority of the tenth section of the act passed March the third, 1819, entitled, "an act to reduce into one act the several acts concerning the Literary Fund", such portion of the said capital shall be exempted from the operation of the act authorizing the same to be withdrawn, as may be sufficient to leave in the said fund a sum equal to the amount, with interest, arising from escheats, confiscations, forfeitures, derelict personal property, fines, and pecuniary penalties, which may have been used as aforesaid, by virtue of the provisions of this act: And provided, also, That nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to affect the appropriation made for the support of the primary schools. 3. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passage thereof." Acts 1823-4. pp. 9, 10. Also appears as Chap. 33 of Supt. to Rev. Code 1819, p. 461. Some of the sections of Chapter 8 also look towards providing funds for the University, although entitled "an act for extending the charter of the Farmers' Bank of Virginia", passed March 6th., 1824. Sec. 1 extends said charter for fifteen years longer. Sec. 2 provides that the said bank shall, on May 1, 1824 (in consideration of said renewal and extension), or as soon thereafter as application shall be made for the purpose, on behalf of the ex officio members of the Board of Public Works, "pay into the fund for internal improvement, the sum of fifty thousand dollars, to be reimbursed to the bank out of the profits of their stock, other than that now held by the Commonwealth, or by the Board of Public Works, or by the Literary Fund. 3. The aforesaid sum of fifty thousand dollars, or such part thereof as shall be required, shall be loaned by the president and directors of the Board of Public Works, if the said board think it expedient, to the rector and visitors of the University of Virginia, (for the purposes hereinafter mentioned,) for a period not exceeding one year: Provided, That satisfactory assurance can be given to the Board of Public Works, that the sum so loaned can be reimbursed to them, with lawful interest, out of the fund herein appropriated to that purpose. 4. Be it further enacted, That the rector and visitors shall be entitled to receive, out of the first monies which shall be paid by the government of the United States, for the balance of the debt due to this commonwealth, on account of advances and expenditures during the late war, a sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, and so much more as will be sufficient to pay the interest on the loan aforesaid; and the monies so received by the rector and visitors, out of the debt due from the government of the United States, are hereby pledged for the re-payment of the money so to be loaned by the Board of Public Works. 5. The money so borrowed by the rector and visitors, or, if none be borrowed by them, the money so received from the government of the United States, shall be applied to the purchase of such books and apparatus for the University, as the said rector and visitors shall think proper. (See Chap. 34 of Supt. to Rev. Code 1819, p. 47.) 6. (Provides for office of discount and deposit at Danville, Va., etc.) 7. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the time when its provisions shall have been approved by the stockholders in the said bank, at a general meeting to be convened therefor, on or before the first day of May next, and such approval shall have been made, duly certified to the Executive of this Commonwealth. At such meeting, no stockholder shall vote by proxy, unless such proxy be appointed after the 31st. of March next." pp. 11 &amp; 12. Acts 1823-4. 1826-7. After two sessions of the General Assembly without legislation affecting the University, we find Chapter 5 of acts 1826-7, passed March 7, 1827, entitled, "an act altering the stated meetings of the Visitors of the University, and for other purposes", at p. 9. It follows: "1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That the Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and they are hereby authorized, for the purpose of paying the debts of the said University (it had attained the full dignity of capital letters again), to borrow from the banks of this Commonwealth, or from any other person, body politic or corporate, any sum of money not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars; at a rate of interest not exceeding six per centum per annum, and to pledge for the payment of the interest, and redemption of the principal of the money so borrowed, any part of the annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars heretofore made by law to the University, and any part of its other income which has not been otherwise applied: Provided, That the aforesaid pledge shall not in any manner bind the commonwealth. 2. Be it further enacted, That instead of the stated meetings of the University on the first Mondays in April and October, as heretofore prescribed by law, the stated meetings shall be held at times not less than once in each year, as the Visitors shall from time to time prescribe. 3. This act shall be in force from and after the passage thereof". Acts 1826-7, p. 9. Also Chap. 35 of Supt. to Rev. Code 1819. p. 48. Section 9 of Chapter 6, entitled, "an act concerning the Armory, and for other purposes", passed March 8th, 1827, also relates to the University. It follows: "9. Be it further enacted, That the Executive be, and they (sic) are hereby authorized to loan to any person who may be authorized by the Visitors of the University of Virginia, to open a school of military instruction at the University, a number of muskets not exceeding one hundred: Provided, That said person shall give bond and security for the preservation and return of the said arms, when required by the Executive; the arms to be hereby loaned, to be of the smallest calibre. 10. This act shall be in force from and after the passing thereof." Acts 1826-7, p. 11. Also Chap. 36, Supt. to Rev. Code 1819. p. 48. 1827-8. At this session there were two short acts passed affecting the University: Chapter 17, entitled, "an act providing for furnishing the University of Virginia with additional books and maps, and for other purposes", was passed Jan. 15, 1828. See p. 14. It follows: "1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That the Executive of this Commonwealth be, and they are hereby authorized and required, upon the application or order of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to deliver to the librarian of the said University, to be deposited therein, for the use of the same, and to the president and Masters, or Professors of William and Mary College, for the use thereof, copies of Hening's Statutes at Large, the Revised Code, Reports of the Supreme Court of Appeals, the Sheet Acts, and Journals of the Legislature, and any other books and maps, which now are, or may hereafter be, published under the authority of the State. 2 &amp; 3. (Not relating to University.) 4. This act shall be in force from the passing thereof". Acts 1827-8, p. 14. Also Chap. 37 of Supt. to Rev. Code of 1819, p. 49. Chapter 18, entitled, "an act authorizing the Visitors of the University to appoint a Rector pro tempore", was passed Jan. 9, 1828. See p. 14. It follows: "1. Be it enacted, That the Visitors of the University of Virginia, or a majority of them, at their future meetings, in the absence of the Rector, may appoint a Rector pro tempore; and the proceedings of the said Visitors and Rector so appointed, shall be as valid in all respects, as if the Rector was present. 2. This act shall be in force from and after the passing thereof." Acts 1827-8, p. 14. 1834-5. After an interval of several years, we find a resolution, to-wit, No. 10, entitled, "Preamble and resolution calling for information from the president and directors of the literary fund, relative to the condition of the university and the various colleges and academies throughout the commonwealth, and for other purposes", agreed to by both houses Feb 26, 1835. See p. 253 of Acts of 1834-5. It follows: "Whereas, the general assembly on the 24th. day of February, 1821, enacted, that whenever the annual income of the literary fund should exceed sixty thousand dollars, the surplus above that sum, until such surplus should amount to twenty thousand dollars, should be appropriated to the endowment of such colleges, academies and intermediate schools within this commonwealth as the general assembly might thereafter designate, as fit institutions for such endowment; and whereas, it appears from the report of the second auditor, that there will accrue during the fiscal year a surplus of more than twenty thousand dollars above the charges on the literary fund, and that the said surplus will probably continue to increase every year, so as to render it expedient to devise some general system for its appropriation and distribution in fulfillment of the original designs of this assembly, which amount (sic) cannot now be done for the want of certain requisite information in relation to all these institutions. Be it therefore resolved by the general assembly, That the president and directors of the literary fund be requested to report to the next general assembly the condition and wants of the university, colleges and academies in this state, which have been endowed by the present or former government, or by private munificence, and the state of their funds, and amount of their annual revenues, with an account of the sources of their derivation, and the modes of their investment; also, a detailed statement of the condition of each of those seminaries in respect to its accommodations for teachers and pupils, the number of its professors or teachers, with the amount of their respective salaries, the number of students and branches of science and learning taught in it, the fees of tuition, and the rules of its government; and further, which of those seminaries have been incorporated by law. And in order to enable the aforesaid president and directors to make the statement and report herein required, they are hereby authorized and empowered to call upon the directory of the several colleges, the trustees of the several academies, so far as they can be ascertained, and the boards of school commissioners of the several counties and corporate towns of the state, to furnish such detailed statements as they may deem necessary to enable them to accomplish the objects of this resolution." 1836-7. Then, in the acts of 1836-37, we find Chapter 11, entitled, "an act to provide for the payment out of the annuity of the university, in the hands of the president and directors of the literary fund, of a loan made by Mrs. Martha Randolph to the University under authority of an act altering the stated meetings of the visitors of the university, and for other purposes."

Approved March 7, 1903. "Whereas, after thirty years experience it has been found impracticable to maintain the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia, under the terms of the Charter enacted by the general assembly of this State February 6th, 1873, because said society was founded on the basis of individual membership only; and Whereas, after much consideration and discussion at the annual meetings of the Society of Alumni, it was resolved to organize a General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia, to be composed of local associations throughout the United States, including the State of Virginia, and also of individual alumni from points where no local associations exist; and, Whereas, the organization of such an association was fully consummated at the meeting of the General Alumni Association at the June 17th, 1902, commencement of the University of Virginia by its merger of the Society of Alumni, with its consent, into said General Alumni Association, and fully put into operation by the adoption of a constitution and by the election of officers to serve for two years from the said 17th. of June, 1902; Therefore, Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, That from and after the passage of this act, there shall be legally organized, 1. An incorporation, to be known as the General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia, as a necessary auxiliary to the progress and success of that institution, and to be subject at all times to the control of the board of visitors of the University of Virginia, with the following named persons as incorporators, to-wit, the same being named and designated as its first officers, having been chosen for their respective positions by the General Alumni Association June 17th, 1902, viz: James B.

Those named herein, except the two vice-presidents, to constitute the executive committee of said association. The successors in office of all before mentioned officials to be chosen at the annual meeting of the General Alumni Association, to be held at the University of Virginia during the June commencement, 1904. This association, through its executive committee, is charged with the special duty of using its best endeavors to promote the welfare of the General Alumni Association, and to use its active efforts in cooperation with the board of visitors and faculty of the university to promote the success and prosperity of the university. 2. The principal office of said association and the chief business is to be at the University of Virginia. All the funds which the association may acquire shall be used, after paying its running expenses, for the use and benefit of this association and of the University of Virginia. It is intended that the General Alumni Association, which is to be made up and composed of local associations and of individual members throughout the country where no such associations exist shall take the place of the Society of Alumni as incorporated February 6th, 1873, and succeed to all the rights, privileges, and property, real, personal and mixed, of the Society of Alumni of the University, which is hereby dissolved, the General Alumni Association being the legal successor of said Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia as incorporated February 6th, 1873; it being further intended that this association by this succession shall have and enjoy all the powers of the Society of Alumni which it possessed at the time of its merger into this association, this association having in view the general purposes and objects of the society of Alumni as set out in its charter of February 6th, 1873, save as herein modified. 3. This association shall have authority to grant certificates of membership not only to the local alumni associations now composing it, but to such new ones as may be hereafter formed, and also to individuals as contemplated in this act, such certificates to bear the signatures of the president and secretary of the General Alumni Association and the seal of the association, which is given power to adopt a suitable one, and to require that all such local alumni associations, whether now or hereafter formed, shall pay into the treasury of the General Association annually a reasonable tax per capita on the alumni forming such associations, which in no instance shall exceed one dollar per capita per annum; and before any individual member shall become a member of the General Alumni Association he shall pay to the said association the sum of one dollar, and be required to pay the annual per capita tax levied upon the local associations, and shall remain an individual member only so long as there shall exist at the place of his residence, or within convenient distance near thereto, no local association to which he can attach himself; and whilst so a member of the General Association such individual member shall be entitled to a voice in the meetings of the General Assoociation and to hold office in the Association and to such fraction of one vote as the constitution of said General Alumni Association shall permit. 4. This association is authorized, subject to the control of the board of visitors as to location, to build a hall on the grounds of the university for the use and benefit of the association, it being intended that whatever funds have already been raised by the Society of Alumni, as heretofore constituted, for the purpose of building such hall, shall pass to and belong to this association, and be used strictly for that purpose and none other. And the executive committee is to make all contracts for the building of said hall whenever there shall be sufficient funds in hand to do so. 5. The meetings of the General Alumni Association shall be made up of delegates from local alumni associations, to be chosen at the annual meetings of such local associations, and of individual members as hereinbefore provided; but if for any cause it should become impracticable for any local association to hold an annual meeting, then the delegates from each and every such local alumni association may be appointed by the executive committee thereof. The number of such delegates from each local association shall be on such basis of representation as the General Alumni Association shall prescribe. 6. The General Alumni Association shall meet at least once a year at the University of Virginia for the transaction of its business. The time and place of its meetings, which shall be during the university commencement of each year, shall be fixed by the executive committee, and in the event of its failure to do so, by the president of the General Association.

At least ten days notice shall be given in like manner of the time and place of the annual meeting of the association. The Alumni Association shall hold an annual celebration on Tuesday during commencement week in the public hall of the university, and this day shall be known as alumni day. The executive committee of said Alumni Association shall have full charge and control of the exercises of that day in the public hall and elsewhere, subject only to the superior authority of the board of visitors. 7. The General Association, by its executive committee, as in general meeting it may direct, shall have power to raise an endowment fund for the use and benefit of the university, to be held by the treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds, and all funds belonging to said association in excess of one thousand dollars, and all those donated for the purpose of building a public hall, shall be similarly invested, and only disposed of as they may be needed for the purposes of the association or of the university. The management and application of all the funds of the association and the income therefrom are to be under the control of the executive committee of the association and their successors in office, subject, however, to any instruction and direction of the General Alumni Association in annual meeting, which instruction or direction in every instance shall be given upon a registered aye and nay vote of the association, cast according to their respective numerical strength. The treasurer of the State shall honor all requisitions on the funds in his hands or under his control belonging to said General Alumni Association, when signed by the treasurer of said association, countersigned by the president or acting president thereof, and attested by the secretary thereof, with the seal of the association thereto attached. The General Association may, in any proper way consistent with its general policy and the laws of the university, and not inconsistent with the laws of the State, plan and carry into effect ways and means for the advancement of the interests and prosperity of the University of Virginia. 8. The association shall have power to receive and hold property, real and personal, donations, passing by grant, conveyance, devise, and bequest under the general powers of endowment granted in the seventh section of this act, and also for the building of an alumni hall, as mentioned in the fourth section. The association may sue and be sued. Any real estate which the association may acquire by gift, devise, or otherwise in excess of five acres may be sold as soon as it can conveniently be sold at a fair price. The property held by this association shall, as to taxation thereof, stand in all respect upon the same footing as the property belonging to the University of Virginia. 9. The association may from time to time adopt any constitution and by-laws and any regulations it may think proper in regard to admitting or rejecting members of the General Association or of the local associations, and for any other purposes not inconsistent with the laws and constitution of this state or the United States, or the constitution of this association, and it shall also have authority to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, and in any other proper manner to solicit donations for the proper objects in connection with the university, and to pay all expenses incident to the conduct and management of the association, or of the executive committee. 10. The executive committee and other officers of the association shall hold their offices until their successors are chosen, and if it should so happen that the association should fail at the time appointed for the election of such officers to choose their successors, then those in office shall hold on until an election can be legally held. Five of the executive committee shall constitute a quorum for business and the executive committee shall have power to fill vacancies in its own body, to hold until the next election after the happening of such vacancies. It shall be the duty of the executive committee, through the president of the association, to make an annual report to the association in regard to the condition and progress of the association and the formation of new alumni local associations, and this report shall also contain statements by the secretary and treasurer as to the number and condition of the local associations, and this report shall also contain statements by the secretary and treasurer as to the number and condition of the local associations and the financial condition of the General Association. 11.

The members of the board shall always be apportioned among the several grand divisions of the State as hereinbefore provided, and shall in all cases continue to discharge the duties of their office after their terms have expired until their successors have been appointed and qualified. Beginning with the visitors who shall be named for the term beginning on the twenty-eighth day of February, in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-six, and biennially thereafter, the governor shall appoint at least one visitor in the years in which he has four visitors to appoint, and two visitors in the years in which he has five visitors to appoint, from a list of not less than eight persons, qualified to fill the office of visitor, two of whom shall be from each of the grand divisions of the State, which list shall be submitted to him, whether he shall have taken office or not, by the general alumni association of the University of Virginia not later than the first day of December of the year preceding that in which the terms of said visitors are to begin; and in filling vacancies the governor shall likewise make appointments from the list last submitted to him when it is necessary to do so in order to have at least three visitors who shall be nominees of the general alumni association as aforesaid. If the said general alumni association of the University of Virginia shall in any such year fail to submit such a list in accordance with the provisions hereof, the appointments of visitors whose terms would commence in the year next succeeding the date on or before which said list should have been submitted, shall be made just as if said association had not been empowered to submit such a list." Acts 1924, p. 145. Chapter 174.

For the appropriation year ending February twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and twenty-seven: For additions to the medical group of buildings, sixty-two thousand and five hundred dollars $62,500.00 Provided, however, that this appropriation of sixty-two thousand and five hundred dollars shall not be available unless and until satisfactory evidence has been furnished to the governor of Virginia that the sum of five hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars in addition has been made available for the erection of said buildings by the alumni, friends, and officials of the university.

The rector and visitors of the University of Virginia are hereby authorized, if and when the conditions are met upon which the foregoing appropriations are made, to proceed to enter into contracts for the immediate construction and equipment of the additions to the medical group of buildings, as aforesaid, notwithstanding the fact that such additions will or may cost the sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in excess of amounts available for such additions during the biennium ending on the twenty-ninth day of February, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight." Acts 1926, p. 798. Chapter 489. An ACT to authorize the governing boards of certain State institutions of higher education to issue and sell, through the commissioners of the sinking fund, and subject to the approval of the State Board of Education, certificates of indebtedness in the names and on behalf of their institutions, respectively, to raise funds for dormitory construction purposes, subject to the conditions and limitations contained in this act; to provide for the payment of the interest thereon and the principal thereof at maturity, and to authorize the State Board of Education to sell any State bonds held as a part of the Literary Fund and to invest the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds in the certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this act, such certificates so purchased to become a part of the Literary Fund. Approved March 25, 1926. "Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, as follows: 1. Subject to the approval of the State board of education first obtained, the governing boards of the University of Virginia, the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute, the College of William and Mary in Virginia, the State Teachers Colleges at Farmville, Radford, Harrisonburg, and Fredericksburg, the Virginia Military Institute, and the Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute are hereby severally authorized, through the commissioners of the sinking fund, to issue and sell certificates of indebtedness in the names and on behalf of their institutions, respectively, to raise funds for dormitory construction purposes, subject to the conditions and limitations hereinafter set out. 2. The amount of certificates of indebtedness which may be issued on behalf of each of the institutions herein named shall be as agreed upon by the governing board of each institution and the State board of Education; but the aggregate amount of certificates issued on behalf of all the institutions herein named shall not exceed the sum of one million dollars. The attention of the State board of education is hereby directed to the message of the governor of Virginia to the general assembly dated January 13, 1926, in so far as such message deals with the needs of the several institutions mentioned in this act. 3. The certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this act shall be signed on behalf of the institutions in the names of which they are issued, by the presiding officers of their governing boards, respectively, and shall be countersigned by the second auditor, who shall keep an account thereof in his office. The certificates of indebtedness issued under this act are the certificates of the institutions issuing them, respectively, and not the certificates of the State. 4. The said certificates of indebtedness shall bear interest payable semi-annually January first and July first of each year, at a rate to be fixed by the commissioners of the sinking fund with the approval of the State board of education, but not exceeding four per centum per annum. The said certificates shall be issued in such denominations and shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty-two years from their date, as may be prescribed by the State board of education, and shall be in such form, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as may be approved by such board. The governing board of each such institution on behalf of which such certificates are issued may secure the payment of the interest thereon and the principal thereof at maturity by giving a deed of trust upon the property of such institution. 5. The commissioners of the sinking fund with the approval of the State board of education, shall from time to time, sell the said certificates of indebtedness for cash at such prices, not less than par, as may be approved by them. 6. The sums of money received from the sale of the certificates of indebtedness issued and sold under the provisions of this act shall be paid into the State treasury by the commissioners of the sinking fund to the credit of the institutions on behalf of which such certificates are issued and sold, respectively, and such amounts so paid in to the credit of such institutions, respectively, are hereby appropriated to and may be expended by their governing boards, respectively, for the construction of dormitories for the use of students of the respective institutions, and for no other purposes whatsoever. But all payments out of the treasury shall be made upon the order of the second auditor. All plans, bids and costs of the buildings shall be acted upon by the governing board of the respective institutions and the State board of education. The idea of the utility of the said buildings shall be paramount and adhered to in their design for the purposes intended, and the consumption of space for any non-essential purpose shall be avoided. In constructing a dormitory at the State Teachers College at Radford, the general design of the present dormitory shall be adhered to and it shall also harmonize with the original building plan. 7. The State board of education is hereby authorized, in its discretion, to sell any bonds of the State held as a part of the literary fund and to invest the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds in the certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this act, such certificates so purchased to become a part of the literary fund. 8. In order to provide for the payment of the interest on certificates issued under this act and the creation of a sinking fund to retire them at maturity, the governing boards of each of the institutions on behalf of which such certificates are issued, shall cause to be paid quarterly into the State treasury to the credit of special accounts to be opened on the books of the second auditor for each of such institutions, all net rents and fees received from students or other persons for the use of the dormitories constructed with funds derived from the issuance of such certificates of indebtedness. The rents charged for the use of such dormitories shall not be less than six dollars per month for each student occupying a room therein, and on the basis of not less than two students to a room, and the same price for each student in excess of two to a room who may occupy any of the rooms. The term "net rents and fees", as herein used, shall be construed to mean the gross rents and fees received for the use of such dormitories, less the cost of operation and maintenance of such dormitories, including insurance premiums, which cost of operation and maintenance including insurance premiums shall not exceed twenty-four hundred dollars each per annum, on the basis of dormitory costing one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, nor shall such cost exceed twenty-eight hundred dollars in the case of a dormitory costing two hundred thousand dollars, and a proportionate cost for less sums expended in building construction. It shall be the duty of the State accountant semi-annually to audit the accounts of the rents and fees received and disbursed by each institution, and if it shall come to his knowledge that such accounts are not being kept properly, or that any of such rents and fees are being devoted to purposes not authorized by this act, he shall report the facts to the governor. 9. If at any time any default should be made by any institution in the payment into the State treasury of the moneys hereby required so to be paid in for interest and sinking fund requirements, the commissioners of the sinking fund shall direct the second auditor to make requisition on the auditor of public accounts who shall draw his warrant upon the then current annual State appropriation of such institution for the amount estimated to be due. Such warrant shall thereupon be honored and such amount disposed of in the same manner as if it had been paid into the State treasury by such institution as required by section eight of this act. 10. The moneys so received into the State treasury to be placed to the credit of the special accounts mentioned in section eight of this act shall be used by the commissioners of the sinking fund, first to pay the interest on such certificates of indebtedness issued on behalf of such institutions, respectively, when and as it becomes due and payable, and the balance shall constitute a sinking fund in each instance to retire the certificates of indebtedness at maturity. Each of such sinking funds may be used by the commissioners of the sinking fund to purchase and retire certificates of indebtedness for which such sinking funds are provided, in which case such certificates so purchased shall be cancelled and not re-issued. To the extent that each of such sinking funds is not used to purchase such certificates, as aforesaid, the moneys belonging to it shall be invested by the commissioners of the sinking fund in safe securities at the highest rate of interest obtainable, and all interest received on such investments shall become a part of the sinking fund in each case. When and as such certificates of indebtedness mature, they shall be paid by the commissioners of the sinking fund out of the sinking funds respectively provided for that purpose. All moneys disbursed by the commissioners of the sinking fund under this act shall be paid out by the State treasurer on warrants of the second auditor issued on the order of such commissioners. 11. All buildings constructed with funds derived from such certificates of indebtedness shall be practically fireproof. They shall be kept adequately insured by the respective governing boards of such institutions. 12. The moneys made available by this act to the institutions named in this act shall be used only for the construction of dormitories. All such dormitories shall be furnished by donations, gifts, or otherwise and shall be so kept furnished until the certificates issued have been retired. 13. No purchasers of any certificate of indebtedness issued under this act shall be required to see to the application of the purchase money. Acts 1926, p. 829.</field>
