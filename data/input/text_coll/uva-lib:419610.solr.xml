      <field name="fulltext">Preface This volume constitutes the first revision and codification of the general ordinances of the City of Charlottesville since 1932. It contains the Charter of the city, as amended to the date of this publication, and such of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature in effect on the date of the adoption of this Code as were found desirable for retention. The ordinances were codified, edited and indexed by the Editorial Staff of Michie City Publications Company, Charlottesville, Virginia, under the supervision of A. Hewson Michie, Chas. W. Sublett, W. M. Willson and Samuel G. Alrich. Special recognition is due Miss Elsie K. Dunn of the publishers' secretarial staff for her very able work during the preparation of this publication. The publishers wish to express appreciation to Mr. Lyttelton Waddell, City Attorney, for his assistance and co-operation throughout the course of the work. The publishers also acknowledge appreciation for the assistance received from Mr. James E. Bowen, Clerk of the Council. The new City Code is presented to the officials and citizens of the City of Charlottesville in the belief that it will merit their approval. It is now a recognized fact that if any City Code is to accomplish its intended purpose it must be kept up to date by means of an adequate supplemental service. Accordingly, the publishers point out the advisability and the necessity of keeping this present Code up to date by means of the pocket supplement service, provision for which has been made in the inside back cover of each volume.

The said city shall be divided into wards as now constituted, but the number of wards may be hereafter increased or diminished and the boundaries thereof changed by the city council as authorized by law. For present division of the city into wards, see ch. 1, § 10 of this volume. Sec. 4. Elective officers; qualifications; terms; form of government; corporate powers vested in council; salaries of councilmen and mayor; city manager. (a) The municipal authorities of the said city shall consist of council of five members, one of whom shall be mayor, as hereinafter set forth, unless and until this form be changed in manner prescribed by law, a clerk of the corporation court, a Commonwealth's attorney, a treasurer, a sergeant, a commissioner of revenue, a civil and police justice, two justices of the peace, who shall be elected by the qualified voters of the City of Charlottesville at elections held at the intervals and on the days prescribed for such elections by the laws of the State. All persons who are qualified voters of the City of Charlottesville shall be eligible to any of the said offices. The terms of office of all of said officers shall begin and continue for such length of time as is prescribed by law; provided, that any one of said officers shall be eligible to one or more offices to be filled by the council—that is to say, that any officer elected by the people may hold office to which he was elected as well as one or more offices to which he may be elected or appointed by the council. All the corporate powers of said city shall be exercised by said council, or under its authority, except as otherwise provided herein. (b) The form of government for said city shall be modified commission plan as follows: All corporate powers, legislative, financial and police authority vested in the City of Charlottesville by law shall be and is hereby vested in a council of five members to be elected at large from the qualified voters of the city, except as hereinafter provided. (c) Each of said councilmen shall receive an annual salary of three hundred dollars each (except the president of said council, who shall be mayor, and shall receive five hundred dollars) from the city for their services. (d) An election shall be held in the said city pursuant to law, at the time for the next regular election for councilmen in June, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight. At said election the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four years and the two receiving the next highest number of votes shall hold office for two years. Thereafter the term of office of the councilmen shall be four years. As soon as the said councilmen shall qualify, they shall meet and elect from their number a president, who shall be mayor without veto power, and who shall preside and also have vote on all questions. Said council shall also elect a vice-president. Said council so composed shall take office on September first, nineteen hundred and twenty-eight. (e) It shall be the duty of the said council of five members to immediately elect for a period of one year a business manager, whose title shall be city manager, at the salary to be fixed by them, who may be removed from office by said council at their discretion. (f) Said city manager shall have full executive authority in the management of all ministerial affairs, and shall have the right to employ and discharge all employees under his control. Said city manager shall give a bond for the faithful performance of his duties for such sum as said council may require. The duties and responsibilities of said city manager are to be fixed by ordinance of the city council. Except as said council so fixes his duties and responsibilities, the said city manager shall have the powers vested in city managers by sections two thousand nine hundred and forty-four and two thousand nine hundred and forty-five of the Code of Virginia, nineteen hundred and nineteen,* * Sections 2944 and 2945 of Michie's Virginia Code of 1942. and general laws amendatory thereof. In all other respects the said council shall have and be vested with the same authority heretofore exercised by the council, and in all other respects their duties and liabilities shall be regulated by the existing laws, not in conflict herewith. (1928, c. 287, p. 830; 1940, c. 201, p. 302.) The 1928 amendment so changed this section that a comparison here is not practical. The 1940 amendment deleted the words "a constable" from the first sentence of subdivision (a) and divided subdivision (d) into two paragraphs. Sec. 5. Officers and clerks elected by council. There may be elected by the council such officers and clerks as said council deems proper and necessary, and any one or more of said offices may be held and exercised by the same person. The officers herein mentioned shall be elected or appointed by the council on the first day of September, nineteen hundred and twenty-two, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and biennially thereafter, except when elected to fill a vacancy (which may be done by the council), in which case the election shall be for the unexpired term. It may be competent for the council, in order to secure the services of a suitable person, to elect non-residents, but such officer shall reside in the city during his tenure of office. Sec. 6. Oaths of office and qualification of officers; failure to qualify. The councilmen, and other officers elected by the people shall each, before entering upon the duties of their offices, take the oaths prescribed for all other officers by laws of Virginia, and qualify before the corporation court of said city, or the judge thereof in vacation, and in the cases of the mayor and councilmen a certificate of such oaths having been taken, shall be filed by them, respectively, with the clerk of the council, who shall enter the same upon the journal thereof; but if any or either of said officers shall fail to qualify, as aforesaid, for ten days after the commencement of the term for which he, or they, were elected, or shall neglect for a like space of time to give such bond as may be required of him, his office or their offices shall be deemed vacant. Sec. 7. Vacancy in office of mayor or councilmen. Whenever, from any cause, a vacancy shall occur in the office of mayor, it shall be filled by the council and a vacancy in the office of councilmen shall be filled by that body at its next regular meeting from the qualified electors of said city, and the office [officer]* * In the original act the word "office" appears but it is obvious that the word "officer" was intended. thus elected shall hold his office for the term for which his predecessor was elected, unless sooner vacated by death, resignation, removal, or from other causes. An entry of said election shall be made in the record book. If the mayor of said city or a councilman shall remove from the city limits, such removal shall operate to vacate his office. Sec. 8. Council—President and vice-president. At its first meeting in September, nineteen hundred and twenty-two, and biennially thereafter, the council shall elect one of its members to act as president, who shall preside at its meetings and continue in office two years. Or if a vacancy occur in the office before the end of his term, such vacancy shall be filled as provided in section seven. At the same time the council shall elect one of its members to be a vice-president, who shall preside at such meetings in the absence of the president, and who, when the president shall be absent or unable to perform the duties of his office, by reason of sickness, or other cause, shall perform any and all duties required of, or entrusted to, the president. The president, or the vice-president, when authorized, as above stated, to act, shall have power at any time to call a meeting. Sec. 9. Same—Quorum. Three councilmen shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of that body. (1928, c. 287, p. 831.) The amendment of 1928 substituted the word "three" for the word "two" in the first line of this section. Sec. 10. Same—President and vice-president entitled to vote. The president, or vice-president, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a vote on all questions as any other member, but in no case shall he be entitled to a second vote on any question, though it be necessary to break a tie—that is to say, his office shall not entitle him to a vote. Sec. 11. Same—Authority generally; meetings; journal of proceedings; general ordinance book; inspection of documents and papers. The council shall have authority to adopt such rules and to appoint such officers and clerks as it may deem proper for the regulation of its proceedings, and for the convenient transaction of business, to compel the attendance of absent members, to punish its members for disorderly behavior, and by vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to it, expel a member for malfeasance or misfeasance in office. The council shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and its meetings shall be open, except when, by a recorded vote of two-thirds of those members present, it shall declare that the public welfare requires secrecy. The council shall also require to be kept by its clerk a separate book, termed "the general ordinance book," in which shall be recorded all ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent character, properly indexed and opened to the public inspection. Other documents or papers in the possession of the clerk of the council which may affect the interest of the city shall not, without special order of the body, its president or vice-president, be exhibited, nor copies thereof furnished to other persons than the committees or city officials entitled thereto. Sec. 12. Same—Minutes. At each regular meeting of the council the proceedings of the last regular meeting and all intervening called meetings, shall be read, and thereupon be corrected, if erroneous, and signed by the person presiding for the time being. Upon the call of any member the ayes and noes shall be recorded in the journal. Sec. 13. Same—Powers enumerated. The council of the city, except as hereinbefore provided, shall have power within said city to control and manage the fiscal and municipal affairs of the city and all property, real and personal, belonging to said city; they shall have power to provide a revenue for the city, and appropriate the same to its expenses, also to provide the annual assessments of taxable persons and property in the city, and it may make such ordinances, orders, and bylaws relating to the foregoing powers of this section as it shall deem proper and necessary. They shall likewise have power to make such ordinances, by-laws, orders and regulations as it may deem desirable to carry out the following powers which are hereby vested in them: First. To close, extend, widen, narrow, lay out, grade, improve and otherwise alter streets and public alleys in the said city, and have them properly lighted and kept in good order, and it may make or construct sewers or ducts through the streets or public grounds of the city, and through any place, or places whatsoever, when it may be deemed expedient by all the said [council]* * In the original act the word "councils" appears but it is obvious that the word "council" was intended. councils.

That is, the new line of each abutter shall be the middle of the former street.

The title to any land acquired by condemnation hereunder shall vest in the City of Charlottesville. Seventh. To establish a quarantine ground within or without the city limits, and such quarantine regulations against infectious and contagious diseases as the said [council]* * In the original act the word "councils" appears but it is obvious that the word "council" was intended. councils may see fit, subject to the laws of the State, and of the United States.

Ninth. If any ground in the said city shall be subject to be covered by stagnant water, or if the owner or occupant thereon shall permit any offensive or unwholesome substance to remain or accumulate thereon, the said [council]* * In the original act the word "councils" appears but it is obvious that the word "council" was intended. councils may cause such ground to be filled up, raised, or drained, or may cause such substance to be covered or removed therefrom, and may collect the expense of so doing from the said owner or occupant by distress or sale, in the same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate for the benefit of said city are authorized to be collected; provided, that reasonable notice shall be first given to the said owner or occupant or his agent. In case of non-resident owners, who have no agent in said city, such notice may be given by publication for not less than ten days, in any newspaper published in said city, such publication to be at the expense of said owner, and cost thereof to be collected as a part of the expense hereinbefore provided for.

Twelfth. Insofar as not prohibited by general law.* * In the amendment of 1938 a period appears in the act at this point but obviously a comma was intended.

Sixteenth. And the said council shall also have power to make such other and additional ordinances as it may deem necessary for the general welfare of said city; and nothing herein contained shall be construed to deprive said city of any of the powers conferred upon it, either by general or special laws of the State of Virginia, except insofar as the same may be inconsistent with the provisions of this charter. Seventeenth. Said council shall have power to require and take from the city's business manager, chief of police, treasurer, auditor, commissioner of the revenue, and all other bonded officers, bonds with security and in such penalty as they may see fit, which said bonds shall be made payable to the city by its corporate name, and conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties; said bonds shall be entered on the record of the council and shall be filed with the clerk of the corporation court of the city.

(1938, c. 201, p. 322.) The 1928 amendment to this section made changes in the sixth and twelfth subdivisions. The sixth subdivision was so changed that a comparison here is not practical. The words "insofar as not prohibited by general law" were added at the beginning of the twelfth subdivision. The powers granted in this section in regard to motor vehicles must be read in the light of the provisions of the State Motor Vehicle Code which defines the powers of local authorities in respect to such subject. —Ed. note. Sec. 13½. Same—Borrowing in anticipation of taxes; evidences of debt; interest. The council may also borrow money in anticipation of the collection of the taxes and revenues in the city, in any amount or amounts not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars at any one time.

Such notes or other evidences of debt may be renewed from time to time, but all such notes or other evidences of debt shall mature within twelve months. No money shall be borrowed under this section at a rate of interest exceeding six per cent per annum, and it shall be the duty of the council to provide in the next bond issue for the bonding of the floating debt thus created. (1928, c. 287, p. 831.) This section was added by the amendment of 1928. Ch—2 Sec. 14. Special assessments for local improvements. Local assessments upon abutting landowners for making and improving the sidewalks upon the streets and improving and paving the alleys, and for either the construction or for the use of sewers, may be imposed not in excess of the peculiar benefits resulting therefrom to such abutting landowners. And the same shall be regulated as prescribed by the general law. Sec. 15. Enactment of ordinances, etc.; punishment for violation; enjoining violation; use of county jail; appeal to corporation court. To carry into effect the powers herein enumerated, and all other powers conferred upon said city and its council by the laws of Virginia, said council shall have power to make and pass all proper and needful orders, by-laws, and ordinances not contrary to the Constitution and laws of said State, and to prescribe reasonable fines and penalties, including imprisonment in the city jail, and for the enforcement of the collection of fines, to impose imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety days, which fines, penalties or imprisonment shall be imposed, recovered and enforced by and under the civil and police justice. The city may maintain a suit to restrain by injunction, the violation of any ordinance, notwithstanding such ordinance may provide punishment for its violation. And the authorities of said city may, in accordance with the contract between the council of said city and the county of Albemarle, continue to use the jail of said county for any purpose for which the use of a jail may be needed by them, under the acts of the council or of the State of Virginia; provided, however, that in all cases where a fine or imprisonment is imposed by the civil and police justice, or by the council, the party or parties so fined or imprisoned shall have the right of appeal to the corporation court of said city. All fines imposed for the violation of the city charter, by-laws, or ordinances, shall be paid into the city treasury. (1936, c. 273, p. 462.) The 1936 amendment to this section deleted a former provision limiting the term of imprisonment to not exceeding six months and deleted provisions in regard to the imposition of fines, etc., by aldermen and council. It also changed the references to "police justice" to "civil and police justice." Sec. 16. Conservators of the peace. Each councilman, and the police justice* * The office of "police justice" is now the office of "civil and police justice." of said city, for the time being, are declared to be, and are hereby, constituted conservators of the peace within said city, and within one mile from the corporate limits thereof, and shall have all the powers and authority, in civil, as well as in criminal cases, as justices of the peace. And the chief of police and the policemen of the city shall also be conservators of the peace within the limits aforesaid, and all proper arrests may be made and warrants of arrest executed by such chief of police and policemen. Sec. 17. Budget; levy of taxes. At least thirty days prior to the time when the annual tax levy or any part thereof is made, the council shall cause to be prepared a budget containing a complete itemized and classified plan of all proposed expenditures and all estimated revenues and borrowing for the ensuing appropriation year. Opposite each item of the proposed expenditures the budget shall show in separate parallel columns, the amount appropriated for the preceding appropriation year, the amount expended during that year, the amount appropriated for the current appropriation year and the increases and decreases in the proposed expenditures for the ensuing year as compared to the appropriation for the current year. This budget shall be accompanied by an itemized and complete financial balance sheet at the close of the last preceding appropriation year. A brief synopsis of the budget shall be published in a newspaper published in the City of Charlottesville and notice given of at least one public hearing at least fifteen days prior to the date set for the hearing, at which any citizen of the said City of Charlottesville shall have the right to attend and state his views thereon. After such hearing is had, the council shall by appropriate order adopt and enter on the minutes thereof a synopsis of a budget covering all expenditures for the next appropriation year hereinbefore required. The said council shall order a city levy of so much money as in its discretion shall be sufficient to meet all just demands against the city. (1928, c. 287, p. 831.) The 1928 amendment so changed this section that a comparison here is not practical. Sec. 18. Tax levy; persons and property liable; amount; additional taxation. The levy so made shall be laid on all persons who are residents of said city over twenty-one years of age, upon dogs and upon all tangible personal and real estate within said city, except such persons, personal and real estate as are exempt from taxation under the laws of this State, and also upon all other such subjects within said city as may at the time be assessed with State taxes; provided, however, that the tax on real estate and tangible personal property shall not exceed in any one year, one dollar and eighty-five cents on every hundred dollars value thereof; and provided, also that lands while used for agricultural or grazing purposes included in this charter, at the time they are taxed, may be assessed at a lower rate. In addition thereto the council of the said city shall provide for such levy for the maintenance and operation of the public schools and for interest and sinking fund on bonds issued for school purposes as may be authorized or provided for by the general laws of the State, provided, however, that nothing in this act contained shall authorize the imposition of a tax upon intangible personal property at a rate in excess of that authorized by general law. But nothing contained in this section, as hereby amended, shall limit or restrict the power of the city council to levy such additional taxation as they may deem necessary for the use and benefit of the city; provided, such additional taxation shall be authorized and sanctioned by a vote of the qualified voters of said city, in the mode and manner prescribed in section twenty-three of this charter or be authorized by the council by a vote equal to at least two-thirds of the total membership. Provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or amend any general law of the State now in effect. (1928, c. 287, p. 831.) The 1928 amendment so changed this section that a comparison here is not practical. Sec. 18½. Appropriations for advertising city. The council may each year make appropriation out of the city revenues of an amount not exceeding three cents on each one hundred dollars of the assessed value of the property in the city assessed for taxation for use in purposes which will, in the judgment of the council, advertise the city. (1928, c. 287, p. 832.) This section was added by the amendment of 1928. Sec. 19. Licenses and license taxes; regulation of vehicles for hire. License taxes may be imposed by ordinance on businesses, trades, professions, and callings and upon the persons, firms, associations and corporations, engaged therein and the agent thereof, except in cases where taxation by the localities shall be prohibited by the general law of the State, and nothing herein shall be construed to repeal, or amend any general law with respect to taxation. And this right to require a license and impose a tax thereon shall apply to all persons who use the streets of the city for delivery wagons; provided, that the license tax paid by any merchant to the City of Charlottesville shall, if the council consent, be in lieu of any tax on a delivery wagon used by him in said city. And said council may also grant or refuse license to owners or keepers of wagons, drays, carts, hacks, and other wheeled vehicles kept or employed in said town for hire or as carriers for the public, may prescribe a schedule of charges for their services, and may require the owners of such wagons, drays, carts, and so forth, using them in the city, to take out a license therefor, and require taxes to be paid thereon, and subject same to such other regulations as they may deem proper. Sec. 20. Collection of revenue; custodian of city funds. The revenue from these and other sources shall be collected, paid over, and accounted for at such times and to such persons as the council shall order, and pursuant to such ordinance as now exists or may hereafter be passed by the council. The city treasurer shall be the custodian of all the funds of the city. Sec. 21. Reports of treasurer; publishing. The council shall require the treasurer of the said corporation to make out a quarterly report of the receipts and expenditures, together with a balance sheet of said city for the preceding quarter, which report shall state on what account the expenditures were made, and from what source or sources the receipts were derived, which report when approved by the council, or in such manner as the council may direct, shall be published in one or more newspapers of the city on or before the twentieth day of December, March, June and September of each year. Sec. 22. Refunding bonds. The council of said City of Charlottesville is hereby authorized to make and issue the registered or coupon bonds of said corporation, payable not exceeding forty years after their date, bearing interest at not more than five per centum per annum, payable semi-annually; said bonds to be used exclusively in paying off and discharging the principal and interest of the present bonded debt of the corporation of Charlottesville. The said [council]* * In the original act the word "councils" appears but it is obvious that the word "council" was intended. councils shall not be authorized to dispose of such bonds at less than par value, except by a recorded affirmative vote of all the members elected to the council. Said registered and coupon bonds shall be regularly numbered, signed by the mayor, clerk and treasurer of the city, and recorded in a book kept for that purpose. Sec. 23. Sinking fund. To provide for the payment of the bonded debt of the city there shall be set apart annually by the council from the revenues of the city such sum as will be sufficient to meet each issue of bonds, either heretofore or hereafter issued, as the same shall become due, except that for any issue of bonds a definite amount of which is payable annually and known as serial bonds, no sum shall be so provided; but for such serial bonds the council shall make in their annual budget definite provision for their payment.

Persons using the sidewalks and streets of the city shall comply at all times and places with any direction by voice, hand, whistle, sign, or signal from any member of the police force as to the starting, stopping, slowing, parking or setting down passengers, and in loading or unloading vehicles. The chief of police shall have authority to place upon the sidewalks and streets of the city such signs, signals and other devices for handling traffic as he may deem necessary, provided the same are placed in accordance with traffic regulations which have been approved by the mayor. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any such traffic regulation, sign, signal or other device for handling traffic, and any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be liable to a fine of not less than two dollars and fifty cents nor more than twenty-five dollars.

The mayor or chief of police shall have power to regulate traffic by means of traffic officers or semaphores or other signaling devices on any portion of the highway where traffic is heavy or continuous, or where in their judgment conditions may require, and may prohibit other than one-way traffic upon certain highways and may regulate the use of the highways by processions or assemblages. The mayor and chief of police may also, when and where conditions require: Adopt any such regulations not in conflict with the provisions of this article, as they shall deem advisable and necessary; and repeal, amend or modify any such regulations; provided, however, that such regulations, laws, or rules shall not be deemed to be violated, if, at the time of the alleged violation the designation placed in conformity with this paragraph was missing, effaced, mutilated or defaced, so that an ordinary observant person, under the same circumstances would not be appraised of or aware of the existence of such rule. Adopt regulations requiring all vehicles to come to a full stop at any street intersection other than a street which has been designated as a part of the primary system of state highways. (Code 1932, § 489(34).) Sec. 8. Direction of traffic by officer. Officers of the law, authorized or permitted under this chapter, shall by voice, hand, or signal, direct all traffic, but shall not forbid or prevent anyone from proceeding or standing in a manner permitted or required by law. (Id.) Sec. 9. Signals by traffic officers. Signals by traffic officers shall be as follows: 1. By hand, to stop traffic, stand with shoulders parallel with moving traffic, and with arm raised forty-five degrees above shoulder toward moving line of traffic, hand extended, palm toward traffic to be stopped. Repeat movement with other hand to stop traffic from opposite direction. By hand, to move traffic, stand so that shoulders are parallel to line of traffic to be moved. Extend right arm and hand full length, height of shoulder toward traffic, fingers extended and joined, palm downward; bring hand sharply in direction traffic is to move. Face about and repeat the same movement to move traffic proceeding from opposite direction. 2. By whistle, one blast—moving traffic to stop; two blasts— traffic in opposite direction to move; three or more short blasts— to warn of approach of fire apparatus, or of an emergency, when all traffic shall immediately clear the intersection and stop. (Id.) Sec. 10. Signals by lights or semaphores. Red indicates that traffic then moving shall stop and remain stopped as long as the red signal is shown. Green indicates that traffic shall then move in the direction of the signal, and remain in motion as long as the green signal is given. Amber indicates that a change is about to be made in the directions of the movement of traffic. When the amber signal is shown traffic which has not already entered the intersection including the crosswalks, shall stop, but, that which has entered the intersection shall continue to move until the intersection has been entirely cleared. When semaphores are not in operation the use of an amber light indicates need for caution. (Id.) Sec. 11. Local traffic signs. The mayor or city manager may cause appropriate signs to be erected and maintained, designating residence and business districts, highways and steam railway grade crossings and such other signs as may be deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of this article and to control traffic. (Code 1932, § 489(59).) Sec. 12. Other than official traffic signs prohibited.

Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than six months, either or both, in the discretion of the court or jury trying same, for a first offense, and the court may, in its discretion, suspend the sentence during the good behavior of the person convicted. Any person convicted of a second, or other subsequent offense under this section, shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars and by imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than one year. The judgment of conviction, if for a first offense under this section, shall of itself operate to deprive the person convicted of the right to drive or operate any such vehicle, conveyance, engine, or train in this state for a period of one year from the date of such judgment, and if for a second or other subsequent offense, for a period of three years from the date of judgment of conviction thereof. If any person has heretofore been convicted of violating any similar act of this state or ordinance of this city and thereafter is convicted of violating the provisions of the first paragraph of this section, such conviction shall for the purpose of this section be a subsequent offense and shall be punished accordingly; and the court may in its discretion, suspend the sentence during the good behavior of the person convicted. If any person so convicted, shall during the time for which he is deprived of his right so to do, drive or operate any such vehicle, conveyance, engine, or train in this state, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred, nor more than one thousand dollars and by imprisonment for not less than one month nor more than six months, and no court shall suspend the sentence in any such case. The clerks of all courts of record and every justice of the peace, including police, trial and juvenile justices, shall, within thirty days after final conviction of any person in their courts under this section, report the fact thereof and the name, post-office address, and street address of such person, together with the license plate number on the vehicle operated by such person, to the commissioner who shall preserve a record thereof in his office.

(a) Irrespective of the maximum speeds herein provided, any person who drives a vehicle upon a highway recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger life, limb or property of any person shall be guilty of reckless driving; provided, that the driving of a motor vehicle in violation of any speed limit provision of section 18 of this chapter shall not of itself constitute ground for prosecution for reckless driving under this section. (b) Any person who shall (1) Drive a vehicle when not under proper control, or with inadequate or improperly adjusted brakes upon any highway of the city, or (2) While driving a vehicle, overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the same direction, upon or approaching the crest of a grade or upon or approaching a curve in the highway, where the driver's view along the highway is obstructed, or (3) Pass or attempt to pass two other vehicles abreast, moving in the same direction, or (4) Overtake or pass any other vehicle proceeding in the same direction at any steam or electric railway grade crossing, or at any intersection of highways, or while pedestrians are passing or about to pass in front of either of such vehicles, unless permitted so to do by a traffic light or police officer, or (5) Fail to stop at a school bus while taking on or discharging school children, whether going in the same or the opposite direction and to remain stopped until all school children are clear of the highway, or (6) Fail to give adequate and timely signals of intention to turn, partly turn, slow down, or stop, as required by section 31 of this chapter, or (7) Exceed a reasonable speed under the circumstances and traffic conditions existing at the time, or (8) Fail to bring his vehicle to a stop immediately before entering a highway from a side road when there is traffic approaching upon such highway within five hundred feet of such point of entrance, shall be guilty of reckless driving.

In addition to the foregoing punishment, any justice or court may suspend any license issued to such convicted person under an act of the General Assembly, approved March twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and thirty-two, and amendments thereof, known, designated and cited as the Virginia Operators' and Chauffeurs' License Act* * Section 2154(170) et seq. of Michie's Virginia Code of 1942. for a period of not less than ten days nor more than six months, and such justice or court shall require such convicted person to surrender his license so suspended. If such person so convicted has not obtained the license required by the said act, such justice or court may direct in the judgment of conviction that such person shall not, for such period of not less than ten days nor more than six months as may be prescribed in the said judgment, drive or operate any motor vehicle in this state. It shall be the duty of such justice or court, or the clerk of such justice or court, to transmit such license to the commissioner, along with the report of such conviction required to be sent to the division. If any person shall drive any vehicle upon any highway while his license is so suspended, or while so forbidden to drive or operate a motor vehicle in this state, he shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a period not less than two days nor more than six months, and there may be imposed in addition thereto a fine of not more than five hundred dollars. (Id., § 489(2); Ord. Aug. 17, 1936.) Sec. 18. Restrictions as to speed; other acts declared misdemeanors. Any person who shall (a) Drive any vehicle upon a highway in the city at such speed as to unnecessarily block, hinder or retard the orderly and safe use of the highway or so as to cause congestion on the highway, or (b) Drive upon any highway in the city any motor vehicle at a speed in excess of (1) Fifteen miles an hour when passing a school during recess or while children are going to or leaving school; provided, that markers be placed on the highway so as to indicate the location of such schools, or (2) Fifteen miles an hour in a business district as defined in this article, or (3) Twenty-five miles an hour in a residential district as defined in this article, or (4) Such speed as shall be fixed by the State Highway Commission or the council of the city, for congested areas or curves, right angle turns or other dangerous points on the highways, when such areas or points are clearly indicated by markers or signs, or (5) Drive anywhere else upon a highway in the city any school bus carrying school children to or from school at a speed in excess of thirty-five miles per hour, or any other passenger-carrying bus at a speed in excess of thirty-five miles per hour, or any passenger motor vehicle or motorcycle at a speed in excess of thirty-five miles per hour, or any other motor vehicle, including trucks, at a speed in excess of thirty-five miles per hour; provided, however, that the speed limit established by this section shall have no application to the operation of any motor vehicle while being operated by any member of the armed forces of this state or of the United States, acting in his line of duty and on the orders of a commissioned officer of such forces, or (c) Drive to the left of a center of the street except upon one-way streets, or (d) Violate any provision of the right-of-way laws, as set forth in sections 32 and 33 of this chapter, or (e) Drive a vehicle out of an alley, lane or building into a street without first bringing such vehicle to a stop immediately before entering such street, or (f) Make a left turn without passing to the right of the center of the intersection, whether marked or not, or (g) Make a right turn without keeping close to the curb, or (h) Coast or operate a motor vehicle with the gears in neutral, or (i) While operating a vehicle upon any highway, fail or refuse to control the lights of such vehicle by shifting, depressing, tilting or dimming the headlight beams thereof so as not to project into the eyes of the driver of any oncoming vehicle a glaring or dazzling light, shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of section 68 of this chapter. (Code 1932, § 489(3); Ord. Feb. 5, 1940.) Sec. 19. Special speed limitations on bridges. It shall be unlawful to drive any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer upon any public bridge, causeway or viaduct at a speed exceeding that indicated as a maximum by signs posted thereon or at its approach by or upon the authority of the State Highway Commission. The city manager upon request, or upon his own initiative, may conduct an investigation of any public bridge, causeway or viaduct, and he shall determine and declare the maximum speed of vehicles which such structure can withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed to be erected and maintained at a distance of one hundred feet beyond each end of such structure. The findings and determination of the city manager shall be conclusive evidence of the maximum speed which can, with safety to any such structure, be maintained thereon. (Code 1932, § 489(7).) Sec. 20. When speed limit not applicable. The speed limitations set forth in this article shall not apply to vehicles when operated with due regard for safety under the direction of the police in the chase or apprehension of violators of the law or of persons charged with or suspected of any such violation, nor to fire department vehicles when traveling in response to a fire alarm or pulmotor call nor to county or municipal ambulances when traveling in emergencies. This exemption shall not, however, protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequence of a reckless disregard of the safety of others. (Id., § 489(8).) Sec. 21. Drive on right side of highways. Except as otherwise provided in section 23 of this chapter, upon all highways of sufficient width the driver of a vehicle shall drive the same upon the right half of the highway, unless it is impracticable to travel on such side of the highway and except when overtaking and passing another vehicle subject to the limitations applicable in overtaking and passing set forth in sections 25 and 27 of this chapter. (Id., § 489(9).) Sec. 22. Keep to the right in crossing intersections or railroads. In crossing an intersection of highways or the intersections of a highway by a railroad right-of-way, the driver of a vehicle shall at all times cause such vehicle to travel on the right half of the highway unless such right side is obstructed or impassable. (Id., § 489(10).) Sec. 23. Special regulations applicable on streets and highways laned for traffic. Whenever any highway has been divided into clearly marked lanes for traffic, drivers of vehicles shall obey the following regulations: (a) A vehicle shall normally be driven in the lane nearest the right-hand edge or curb of the highway when said lane is available for travel except when overtaking another vehicle or in preparation for a left turn. (b) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as is practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety. (c) Upon a highway which is divided into three lanes a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except when overtaking and passing another vehicle or in preparation for a left turn or unless such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is proceeding and is signposted or marked to give notice of such allocation. (d) Wherever a highway is marked with double traffic lines consisting of a solid line immediately adjacent to a broken line, no vehicle shall be driven to the left of such line, if the solid line is on the right of the broken line. (e) Wherever a highway is marked with double traffic lines consisting of two immediately adjacent solid lines, no vehicle shall be driven to the left of such lines. Sec. 24. Passing vehicles proceeding in opposite directions. Drivers of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right, each giving to the other, as nearly as possible, one half of the main traveled portion of the roadway. (Code 1932, § 489(11).) Sec. 25. Overtaking a vehicle. The driver of any vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass at least two feet to the left thereof, and shall not again drive to the right side of the highway until safely clear of such overtaken vehicle, except as hereinafter provided. The driver of an overtaken motor vehicle outside of a business or residence district as herein defined shall give audible warning with his horn or other warning device before passing or attempting to pass a vehicle proceeding in the same direction. The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of another vehicle which is making or about to make a left turn and the driver of which has given a signal as required in section 31 of this chapter. (Id., § 489(12).) Sec. 26. Driver to give way to overtaking vehicle. Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of a vehicle about to be overtaken and passed by another vehicle approaching from the rear at a lawful rate of speed shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle on suitable and audible signal being given by the driver of the overtaking vehicle, and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle. (Id., § 489(14).) Sec. 27. Limitations on privilege of overtaking and passing. The driver of a vehicle shall not drive to the left side of the center line of a highway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless such side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be made in safety, and such overtaking vehicle shall give way to an oncoming vehicle. (Id., § 489(13).) Sec. 28. Following too closely. The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard to the speed of both vehicles and the traffic upon and conditions of the highway at the time. The driver of any motor truck drawing a trailer shall not follow another truck drawing a trailer within two hundred feet when upon any public highway outside of a business or residence district. (Id., § 489(15).) Sec. 29. Turning around in street. The driver of a vehicle within a business district shall not turn such vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction except at an intersection of public highways; provided further, that no such turn shall be made on Main Street between Seventh Street, East, and the west side of the Lewis and Clark Monument. (Id., § 489(16).) Sec. 30. Turning at intersection. Drivers of vehicles in turning to the right shall keep as closely as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of any highway and when turning to the left shall pass beyond the center of the intersection, as closely as practicable to the right of the center of such Ch—17 intersection before turning such vehicle to the left, unless otherwise marked or indicated; and shall turn the corner at a rate of speed not to exceed ten miles per hour. (Id., § 489(17).) Sec. 31. Signals on starting, stopping or turning. (a) Every driver who intends to start, stop or turn or partly turn from a direct line, shall first see that such movement can be made in safety and whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement shall give a signal as required in this section plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicle of his intention to make such movement. (b) The signal herein required shall be given by means of the hand and arm, or by some mechanical or electrical device approved by the commissioner. Whenever the signal is given by means of the hand and arm, the driver shall indicate his intention to start, stop or turn or partly turn by extending the hand and arm from and beyond the left side of the vehicle, in the manner following: (c) For left turn, or to pull to the left, the arm shall be extended in a horizontal position straight from and level with the shoulder. (d) For right turn, or to pull to the right, the arm shall be extended upward. (e) For slowing down or to stop, the arm shall be extended downward. (f) Such signals shall be given continuously for a distance of at least fifty feet before slowing down, stopping, turning, partly turning, or materially altering the course of the vehicle. (g) Drivers having once given a hand, electrical or mechanical device signal must continue the course thus indicated unless they alter the original signal and take care that drivers of vehicles and pedestrians have seen and are aware of the change. (h) Drivers receiving a signal from another driver shall keep their vehicles under complete control, and shall be able to avoid an accident resulting from a misunderstanding of such signal. (i) Drivers of vehicles, standing or stopped at the curb or edge before moving such vehicles, shall give signals of their intention to move into traffic, as hereinbefore provided, before turning in the direction the vehicle will proceed from the curb. (Id., § 489(18).) Sec. 32. Right-of-way. (a) When two vehicles approach or enter an intersection at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right except as otherwise provided in section 34 of this chapter. The driver of any vehicle traveling at an unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise have hereunder. (b) The driver of a vehicle approaching but not having entered an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle within such intersection and turning therein to the left across the line of travel of such first-mentioned vehicle; provided, that the driver of the vehicle turning left has given a plainly visible signal of intention to turn left as required in section 31 of this chapter. (c) The driver of any vehicle upon a highway within a business or residence district shall yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing such highway within any clearly marked crosswalk or any regular pedestrian crossing included in the prolongation of the lateral boundary lines of the adjacent sidewalk at the end of a block, except at intersections where the movement of traffic is being regulated by traffic officers or traffic direction devices. (Id., § 489(19).) Sec. 33. Exception to the right-of-way rules. The driver of a vehicle entering a public highway from a private road or driveway shall, immediately before entering such highway, stop, and upon entering such highway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on such public highway. (Id., §§ 489(20), 489(21).) Sec. 34. What to do on approach of police or fire department vehicle; following fire apparatus, etc. Upon the approach of any police or fire department vehicle giving audible signal by siren or exhaust whistle, the driver of every other vehicle shall immediately drive the same to a position at or near as possible and parallel to the right-hand edge or curb, clear of any intersection of highways, and shall stop and remain in such position, unless otherwise directed by a police or traffic officer until the police or fire department vehicle shall have passed. This provision shall not operate to relieve the driver of a police or fire department vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway, nor shall it protect the driver of any such vehicle from the consequences of an arbitrary exercise of such right-of-way. It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle other than one on official business to follow any fire apparatus traveling in response to a fire alarm at any distance closer than five hundred feet to such apparatus or to drive into or park such vehicle within five hundred feet of where fire apparatus has stopped in answer to a fire alarm. (Id., § 489(22).) Sec. 35. Pedestrians. (a) When crossing highways or streets, pedestrians shall not carelessly or maliciously interfere with the orderly passage of vehicles. They shall cross wherever possible only at intersections. Pedestrians crossing highways or streets at intersections shall at all times have the right-of-way over vehicles making turns into the highways or streets being crossed by the pedestrians. (b) At intersections where no traffic officer is on duty, pedestrians shall have the right-of-way over vehicles. (c) No pedestrian shall enter or cross an intersection regardless of approaching traffic. (d) The drivers of vehicles entering, crossing or turning at intersections shall change their course, slow down, or come to a complete stop if necessary to permit pedestrians to safely and expeditiously cross such intersections. (e) Pedestrians shall cross highways or streets only at right angles. They shall not step into that portion of a highway or street open to moving vehicular traffic at any point between intersections where their presence would be obscured from the vision of drivers of approaching vehicles by a vehicle or other obstruction at the curb or side, except to board a passenger bus or to enter a safety zone, in which event they shall cross the highway or street only at right angles. (f) When actually boarding or alighting from passenger buses, pedestrians shall have the right-of-way over vehicles, but shall not, in order to board or alight from passenger buses, step into the highway or street sooner nor remain there longer than is absolutely necessary to do so. (g) Pedestrians shall not use the highways or streets other than the sidewalks thereof, for travel, except when necessary to do so because of the absence of sidewalks, reasonably suitable and passable for their use, in which case they shall keep as near as reasonably possible to the extreme left side or edge of the highways or streets. (h) No person shall play on a highway or street other than upon the sidewalks thereof. No person shall use on a highway or street where play is prohibited roller skates, coasters or similar vehicles or toys or other devices on wheels or runners, except bicycles, tricycles and motorcycles. The mayor and chief of police may designate areas on highways or streets in which persons may be permitted to use roller skates, coasters or similar vehicles or toys or other devices on wheels or runners, and if such highways or streets have two traffic lanes, such persons shall keep as near as reasonably possible to the extreme left side or edge of the lefthand traffic lane so that they will be facing oncoming traffic at all times. (i) Any persons convicted of violating any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall be fined not less than two dollars nor more than twenty-five dollars for each offense. (Id., § 489(67).) Sec. 36. Driving through safety zone prohibited. The driver of a vehicle shall not at any time drive through or over a safety zone. (Id., § 489(24).) Sec. 37. Railroad warning signals must be obeyed. It shall be unlawful for any person driving a vehicle to fail to obey a clearly visible or audible crossing signal at a highway and interurban or steam railway grade crossing, which signal gives warning of the immediate approach of a railway train. (Id., § 489(4).) Sec. 38. Slowing down or stopping at railway grade crossings. It shall be the duty of every person driving any vehicle on a public highway, on approaching a place where a railway crosses such public highway at grade, at which crossing no railway gates are maintained or no flagman is stationed and on duty at the time, to bring his vehicle to a speed not exceeding five miles per hour before passing over such crossing, at a distance of not less than fifty feet from the nearest rail of such railway track; provided, that such person shall stop at such crossing where gates are maintained when such gates are closed down, or being lowered, and where a flagman is stationed and on duty at the time, whenever signaled to stop by such flagman. The provisions of this section shall not change or alter in any manner the existing laws as to the duty or liability of railway companies for damages to persons or property, and failure to comply with the provisions of this section on the part of the driver of the vehicle shall not be considered contributory negligence in an action against the railway company for damage to persons or property, whether the same be injury to the person or property of the driver or any other person. It shall not be necessary to establish the fact that the driver complied with the provisions of this section in order to recover any action for damages to persons or property against a railway company. (Id., § 489(5).) Sec. 39. Stopping on highway. (a) No vehicle shall be stopped in such manner as to impede or interfere with or render dangerous the use of the highway by others; and, except upon one-way streets, as provided in this section, no vehicle shall be stopped except close to the right-hand curb, unless otherwise provided by the council or by police regulations. The mayor and chief of police may adopt and put into effect regulations designating the time, place and manner vehicles may be allowed to park on the city streets and to make and enforce such additional rules and regulations as parking conditions may require. (b) No person shall leave standing any vehicle, attended or unattended, upon the paved, improved or main-traveled portion of any highway, outside of a business or residence district, when it is practicable to leave such vehicle standing off of the paved, improved or main-traveled portion of such highway. (c) No vehicle shall be stopped with its left side to the curb, except upon one-way streets, or unless otherwise permitted by police regulation. (d) No vehicle shall be backed up to a curb, except during the time actually engaged in loading or unloading merchandise therefrom. (e) Unless in an emergency or where otherwise indicated by signs, or to allow another vehicle or pedestrians to cross in front, no vehicles shall be stopped in any street except close to and parallel with the curb, and in no instance shall such vehicles be parked less than four feet apart, nor with the near wheels further than six inches from the curb, except as herein otherwise provided. (f) Vehicles shall not be stopped in such manner as to block or obstruct the orderly and lawful passage of other traffic nor upon any crossing nor between a safety zone and curb, nor within fifteen feet of the ends of any obstruction opposite the vehicle. Vehicles stopped two or more abreast, parallel with the curb, shall be deemed to obstruct traffic and shall be in violation hereof. (g) Stopping a vehicle at any time, upon any highway, for the purpose of advertising any article of any kind, or displaying thereupon advertisements of any article, or advertisement for sale of the vehicle itself, is prohibited. (h) If any officer charged with the enforcement of this section shall find a vehicle standing upon a highway in violation of the provisions of this section, he is hereby authorized to move or cause such vehicle to be moved. (i) The driver of any vehicle which is temporarily disabled while on the paved surface of a highway shall remove same as expeditiously as conditions and circumstances may permit. (Id., § 489(25).) Sec. 40. Parking in front of fire hydrant, fire station, private driveway or intersection. No person shall park a vehicle or permit it to stand, whether attended or unattended, upon a highway in front of a private driveway or within fifteen feet in either direction of a fire hydrant or the entrance to a fire station nor within twenty feet from the intersection of curb lines, or if none, then within fifteen feet of the intersection of property lines at an intersection of highways. (Id., § 489(26).) Sec. 41. Driving on steep grades.

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of health, safety, morals, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the public. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way to impair or interfere with any existing provision of law or ordinance, or any rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use or construction of buildings or premises; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises, or upon heights of buildings, or requires larger yards, courts or other open spaces than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance or by such rules, regulations or permits, the provisions of this chapter shall control. (Code 1932, § 495(16); Ord. March 29, 1939.) Sec. 17. General regulations. Except as hereinafter provided for existing non-conforming uses in section 18, no building, structure or premises shall be used and no building, or part thereof, or other structure shall be erected, reconstructed, enlarged or altered except in conformity with the regulations prescribed by this chapter; except that nothing in this chapter shall affect the height, setback building line, yards or courts of any building or lot as such exists at the time of the passage of this chapter. (Code 1932, § 495(17); Ord. March 29, 1939.) Sec. 18. Existing non-conforming uses. (1) If, at the time of the enactment of this chapter, any lot, building or structure is being used in a character or manner or for a purpose which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, and which is not prohibited by some other section, such character or manner of use or purpose may be continued, and no change of title or possession or right to possession of any such lot, building or structure shall be construed to prevent the continued nonconforming use of such lot, building or structure as hereinbefore provided. Any such nonconforming use which is not otherwise unlawful may be hereafter extended throughout any part of a building or structure which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of enactment of this chapter. (2) No building, structure or premises in which a nonconforming use is abandoned for a period exceeding two years or is superseded by a permitted use, subsequent to the enactment of this chapter, shall again be devoted to prohibited use. (3) Any nonconforming building or structure which is hereafter damaged to an extent exceeding fifty per cent of its then reproduction value exclusive of foundations, by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, storm or so-called act of God, may not be restored, reconstructed and used for any other than a purpose permitted under the provisions of this chapter governing the district in which the building or structure is located. (4) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of a building or structure declared unsafe or unlawful by the building inspector, the chief of the fire department, or any other duly authorized city official. (5) The occupancy of a building or premises by a watchman or caretaker for sleeping quarters shall not constitute residence occupancy within the meaning of this chapter. (Code 1932, § 495(18); Ord. March 29, 1939.) Sec. 19. Enforcement. (1) This chapter shall be enforced by the building inspector, who shall in no case grant any permit for the construction or alteration of any building if the building as proposed to be constructed or altered would be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by plans in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact sizes and locations on the lot of the buildings and accessory buildings then existing, and the lines within which the proposed building or structure shall be erected or altered, the existing and intended use of each building, or part of a building, the number of families or housekeeping units the building is designed to accommodate, and such other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this chapter. One copy of such plans shall be returned to the owner when such plans shall have been approved by the building inspector. (2) It shall be unlawful to use or permit the use of any building or premises, or part thereof, hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, altered or enlarged, wholly or partly, in its use or structure, until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued therefor by the building inspector. Such certificate shall show that such building or premises, or part thereof, and the proposed use thereof are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (3) Any persons who propose to construct or alter any building or to make some use of a lot, building or structure of any kind which proposed construction, alteration or use is apparently in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall file with the building inspector his application therefor, which application shall furnish such information to the building inspector as may be necessary to enable him to pass on such application intelligently. If such proposed structure, alteration or use is in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the building inspector shall refuse a permit for such construction, alteration or use, and from such decision of the building inspector an appeal shall lie to the board of zoning appeals. (4) It is the intention of this section that all questions arising in connection with the enforcement of the chapter shall be presented first to the building inspector; that such questions shall be presented to the board of zoning appeals only on appeal from the building inspector; and that from the decision of the board of zoning appeals recourse shall be had to the courts, as provided by law. It is further the intention of this section that the duties of the council in connection with this chapter shall not include the hearing and passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection with the enforcement thereof, but that the procedure for determining such questions shall be as hereinbefore set out in this section; and that the duties of the council in connection with this chapter shall be only the duty of considering and passing upon any proposed amendment or repeal of this chapter as provided by law. (Code 1932, § 495(19); Ord. March 29, 1939.) Sec. 20. Violations and penalties. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter, shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than ten dollars nor more than two hundred dollars for each offense, and each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. The court may, after due notice, order conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (Code 1932, § 495(20); Ord. March 29, 1939.) Sec. 21. Board of zoning appeals; cost of appeals. A board of zoning appeals is hereby established. It shall consist of five members to be appointed, and exercise such powers as provided by the laws of the state. In addition to the requirements of the state law relative to an appeal from a decision of the building inspector to the board of zoning appeals, every such appellant, before delivering a notice of appeal to said board, shall deposit the sum of ten dollars as costs with the director of finance, who shall note on said notice that the deposit required has been paid. Should the decision of the building inspector on appeal be sustained by the board, said deposit shall be paid into the city treasury, but should the decision of the inspector be reversed, in whole or in part, said deposit shall be returned to the appellant. Each member of the board of zoning appeals shall be allowed a fee of two dollars for each appeal considered and heard by such member, which shall be paid by the city treasurer upon presentation of proper voucher, after being approved by the director of finance. (Code 1932, § 495(22); Ord. March 29, 1939.) For provisions of state law as to board of zoning appeals, see § 3071(7) et seq. of Michie's Virginia Code of 1942. Sec. 22. Amendment. (a) The city council may from time to time on its own motion or on petition, after public notice and hearing, amend, supplement or change the regulations and districts herein established. Every such proposed amendment, supplement or change shall be referred by the council to the board of zoning appeals for report before the above public hearing. (b) All petitions provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be in writing, signed by at least a majority of both the property owners and residents who are within the area in which the proposed change is requested. Said petition shall specify the reasons for the proposed change, the change desired in terms of districts, the names and addresses, as far as practicable, of all property owners and residents within the area in which the proposed change is requested, and shall specify clearly by metes and bounds, or by courses and distances, or by plat and survey attached thereto, the boundaries of the proposed area in which the change is requested. Said petition, together with a copy thereof, shall be presented to the clerk of the council, and at the first succeeding meeting of the council it shall be presented to the council for consideration, whereupon if the council deem it advisable, they shall name a committee from their own number, who shall investigate the advisability of having a public hearing on the proposed change, and shall report their findings at the next meeting of the council. Upon said council's approval of a favorable report by the committee, notice of the proposed change shall be published in the newspaper at least fifteen days prior to the hearing date, which notice shall state the time and place for the holding of a public hearing, on the proposed change, the boundaries of the area which will be affected, and the change proposed in terms of districts. Whenever the council shall order that notice of a public hearing shall be given as hereinbefore provided, it shall at the same time refer a copy of the petition to the board of zoning appeals for report as to the proposed change.
