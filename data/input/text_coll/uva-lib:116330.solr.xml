A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least fifteen units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credits for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least eleven units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (Three units required) Literature and Composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (Two units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (Two units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (One unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, freehand and mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, Musicâappreciation or harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. PREMEDICAL COLLEGE COURSE. The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than thirty session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking thirty-three or thirty-six session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion of at least thirty session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects, including one ancient or modern language (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGIATE SUBJECTS. (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. Four session-hours are required, including two session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in qualitative analysis may be counted as general inorganic chemistry. (b) Organic Chemistry. Three session-hours are required of which at least one must be laboratory work. Four session-hours including two session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in organic chemistry. Students are advised to take, in addition to the required general and inorganic chemistry at least four session-hours in qualitative analysis and two session-hours in quantitative analysis. (c) Physics. Four session-hours required, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in trigonometry and solid geometry. (d) Biology. Four session-hours required, of which two must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of four session-hours in general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany, but not by botany alone. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects Including One Modern Foreign Language. Of the thirty session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least nine, including three session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biologic sciences. At least three of these nine session-hours must be in an ancient or modern foreign language. When the student has presented for admission to College two units of high school work in an ancient or modern foreign language, he must complete three session-hours in the same language, this work to be the continuation and not a repetition of his high-school work. When the language studied in College was not studied in high school, he must complete work aggregating four and should preferably complete six session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Training and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the thirty session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least three session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this university are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. Further information concerning the character of entrance requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, mathematics (solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and advanced algebra), biology, and general inorganic chemistry the first year; and organic chemistry, physics, foreign language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics and general inorganic chemistry must precede organic chemistry. Those who have to take four or more session-hours of college work in foreign language may find it advisable to take foreign language both years and take the mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places in the First-Year Class.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to sixty-five. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. Those intending to enter the Department of Medicine are advised to ascertain at once by correspondence with the Dean of the Department of Medicine whether their high-school and college courses entitle them to admission to the first-year class. For this purpose there may be obtained from the Dean a blank form on which the necessary information may be entered in full. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 14, 1922). Any applicant whose record, certified by the proper official of the college last attended, has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the first-year class, may at any time after June 25 and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee of the first year. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or other providential cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. There are well-equipped laboratories for the study of organic chemistry, biochemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year to the study of disease in living persons. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 3,500 cases. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Journal Club reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. REGULATIONS, EXPENSES, ETC. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination, a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent.; the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record conditioned is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this university, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 36 points; Anatomy 2, 6 points; Histology, 18 points; Embryology, 9 points; Biochemistry, 30 points. Anatomy 3, 8 points; Physiology, 24 points; Bacteriology, 12 points; Pathology, 28 points; Pharmacology, 11 points; Clinical Diagnosis, 12 points; Physical Diagnosis, 4 points. Whenever in the judgment of the faculty a student is receiving too many records below the grade of passed, the faculty may prescribe special conditions upon which the student may remain in the Department of Medicine, or may require his withdrawal therefrom. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are admitted to these examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examination agree to the change of date. For a special or condition examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student: one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical workâin which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; in no case will the two grades be averaged. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1922-1923 begin September 11 and close September 16. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the university fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; and 3, special laboratory fees, as specified below: FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR Tuition $160.00 $160.00 $135.00 $135.00 University fee 40.00 40.00 40.00 40.00 Laboratory fees: Biochemistry 10.00 Anatomy 17.50 2.50 Histology and Embryology 7.50 Physiology 10.00 Bacteriology and Pathology 12.50 Pharmacology 5.00 Clinical Diagnosis 10.00 Materia Medica and Toxicology 5.00 Total $235.00 $240.00 $180.00 $175.00 The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. The University also offers a course leading to the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This course includes two years of group electives in academic subjects followed by the first two years of the medical course. Since the academic group-electives satisfy the entrance requirements of the Medical Department, students who can spend only two years in college before entering upon the study of medicine are advised to plan their work so as to secure this degree. For further information regarding these degrees, see the General Catalogue of the University. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. The last awards were made in 1919. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919 a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. The following have been elected to membership from the class of 1922: John Throckmorton Bate, Jr., and Edward Joseph Ottenheimer, B.S. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least six hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âTwenty-one hours weekly during the first term and fifteen hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. The work in gross anatomy is completed by Anatomy 3 of the second year. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the third term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and six hours of laboratory work weekly during the first and second terms. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan, and Dr. Nicholson. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the third term. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Nicholson. Biochemistry.âLectures and recitations, three hours weekly during the first and second terms, six hours weekly during the third term; laboratory work, six hours weekly during the second term; twelve hours weekly during the third term. The chemical structure and reactions of carbohydrates, lipins, proteins, and other compounds occurring in the body. Blood, milk, and bile. The chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. The laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, fatty acids, soaps, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; blood, milk, and bile; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough, Mr. Strang and assistants. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âFour hours weekly through the first and second terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic study of topographic anatomy, with the aid of cross sections of the human body, special dissections, and wet preparations with a review of the whole body in relation to the needs of the student in general medicine and surgery. At the end of this course a practical examination is given, covering the work of Anatomy 1, 2 and 3. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Physiology.âLectures, recitations, and demonstrations, six hours weekly during the first and second terms; laboratory work, ten hours weekly during the first term, two hours weekly during the second term. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition, and the central nervous system. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures as an integral part of the study of each subject. Open only to students who have obtained grades of seventy per cent. in Histology and Biochemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough and Mr. Strang. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the session and four additional hours a week the second term. The work in pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of passed in Histology. Bacteriology and pathology are taught in a combined course. Emphasis is laid upon the medical and public health aspects of bacteriology. Autopsies and the study of gross and microscopic specimens supply the practical work accompanying the systematic study of pathology. Opportunity is given selected students for advanced work. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Sheppe. Pharmacology.âLectures, recitations and demonstrations five hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the third term. The physical and chemical characteristics and the mode of action of representative drugs and other chemic agents are dealt with in both didactic and practical exercises. Special attention is given to analysing and interpreting the results obtained in the laboratory. An average grade of seventy per cent. on the first two terms of Physiology together with the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Hiden and Mr. Johnson. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the second and third terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those laboratory methods which are helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the examination of blood, urine, sputum, gastric contents, feces, spinal fluid, exudates and transudates. Instruction is given in the Clinical Laboratory in the north pavilion of the hospital, which is well equipped with the most modern instruments and apparatus. Dr. Bray, assisted by Mr. Norfleet. Journals.âIn connection with the work in Physiology, Bacteriology and Pathology, the second-year students meet with their instructors for one hour each week from the first of December to the end of the session for reports and discussion of the current literature of the above sciences. Three reports are made at each meeting by the students. Physical DiagnosisâFour hours weekly during the third term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is especially given to study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin. THIRD YEAR. Materia Medica.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the first three-fourths of the fall term. A thorough study is made of the sources, preparation, composition, properties and interactions of medicinal substances to the end that they may be intelligently prescribed. Special attention is paid to their standardization for purity and potency. Prescription writing and incompatibility are dealt with in frequent practical exercises. While the consideration of the more important preparations of the Pharmacopeia and the New and Non-Official Remedies consumes the greater portion of the allotted time, the course is concluded with a critical study of many of the so-called patent medicines. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Pearre. Toxicology.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the last quarter of the fall term. A systematic review is made of the pharmacological action of such chemic agents as are particularly liable to cause injury to health or loss of life, special attention being given to their quantitative effects. Practical instruction is given in the methods of isolating and identifying. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Dr. Waddell. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the session; six hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the outpatient department and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the out-patient department, and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Daniel, Dr. Nelson and Dr. Smith. Dermatology and Syphilology.âOne hour weekly of lectures during second and third terms; one hour of ward rounds and six hours of clinic weekly to the class in sections throughout the year. The importance, etiology, prophylaxis, pathology, clinical history, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis are discussed. After review of the anatomic and histologic structure and physiology of the skin the diseases commonly met with are discussed. Out patient material is utilized by third-year students. Selected cases, admitted to the hospital, are studied by fourth-year students. Dr. Smith. Surgery and Gynecology.âFour hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; with six hours weekly, in the out-patient department, two hours weekly in ward rounds in the hospital, and one hour weekly in X-ray diagnosis for one-fourth the session. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the principles and practice of surgery, surgical diseases, surgical diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. The out-patient department course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the out-patient department affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Bigger and Dr. Banks. Urology and Proctology.âOf the total time assigned to surgery, one lecture hour weekly for the first and second terms, and six hours weekly in the outpatient department for one-fourth of the session are devoted to urology and proctology. In the classroom a general survey of the surgery of the genito-urinary tract and rectum is made by lectures and recitations. Especial emphasis is placed upon modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. In the out-patient department, one-fourth of the class at a time obtains supervised experience in handling clinical cases and performing minor operations. Ample opportunity is afforded for the observation of cystoscopic, urethroscopic and proctoscopic procedures. Dr. Neff and Dr. Jones. Orthopedics.âTwo hours weekly of lectures and recitations during the second and third terms; with six hours weekly in the out-patient department. Dr. Voshell. Roentgenology.âSix lectures, and practical demonstrations to the class in sections throughout the year. The applications of the X-rays to medicine and the interpretation of plates in diagnosis. Dr. Wiatt. Phthisiotherapy.âSix hours weekly for eight weeks, with each of the four sections of the class. The work is given in three two-hour sessions a week, held at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium, and consists of demonstrations, ward rounds and assignment of cases for history taking and physical examination. At the end of each clinic session the case history, physical signs, X-ray plates and laboratory findings are compared in conference. The section is also invited to be present at the fluoroscopic examinations on Friday mornings at the University Hospital. The procedure followed aims to instruct in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis by systematically presenting each step separately at first and later combining them all in the full consideration of the case, including the management and treatment of the patient both in institutions and private practise. Dr. Brown. Obstetrics.âFive hours weekly of lectures, recitations and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with patients in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. In the second and third terms each student is required to take an elective course of approximately five hours weekly. Elective courses vary from year to year, and include both pre-clinical and clinical subjects. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. These records are considered in the final grading of the student. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time among them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the first term. In this course is given also instruction in electrotherapeutics. Dr. Davis Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the second term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. There is also a baby welfare clinic once a week in the outpatient department. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the third term. Dr. Davis. Internal Medicine.âTwo lectures weekly throughout the session. In this course the endeavor is made to bring to the attention of the senior student the more important problems of Internal Medicine. The relationship of recent investigations in the fields of normal and pathological physiology, biochemistry, immunology, etc., to internal diseases is especially emphasized. No text-book is used; students are referred to the files and current issues of journals and to reference works in the Medical Library as sources of information. Dr. Flippin. Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; five hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operaative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offers many of the opportunities that an interneship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology, urology and orthopedics the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Voshell, Dr. Bigger, Dr. Banks and Dr. Jones. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery: Surgical Pathology.âAn optional course. Two hours weekly during one-half the session. This course is intended to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery and consists of lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, demonstrations of fresh tissues obtained from the operating rooms, and examination of microscopic sections. The student reviews pathological technique, and frozen section work is emphasized. Dr. Goodwin. Clinical Pathological Conferences.âThe pathological material from the operating tables and from the autopsy is correlated with the clinical findings. The conference is participated in by the students and internes in charge of the patients, the physicians in charge and the pathologist. Dr. Marshall and the visiting staff of the hospital. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, and is required to prepare the history of patients and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new-born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department, and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. A clinic for third year students is held one day in the week in the out-patient department for recording and examining pregnant women. The patients are instructed in prenatal care, and students are assigned to each case for attendance during labor under the guidance of an instructor. Dr. Macon. Medical Jurisprudence.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. The application of medical knowledge and skill to the needs of the law is presented. References to literature are assigned for the fuller development of special topics. Dr. Waddell. Phthisiotherapy.âTwo lectures weekly for four weeks supplemented by demonstration clinics at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium. Dr. Brown. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly during the first two terms, supplemented by regular two- to three-hour clinics twice weekly throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. Hygiene.âOne hour weekly throughout the session, and thirteen additional hours in the second term. The course begins with a historical sketch of the developments of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. TABLE OF SCHEDULED HOURS IN EACH SUBJECT. (Exclusive of examination periods.) First Year.

Medicine Surgery Obstetrics 2 and 3 Medicine Surgery Obstetrics Dermatology and Syphilolophy Electives FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH. The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor.

The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time three additional units of three stories each. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The three pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 200 beds; of these, upwards of 160 are available and used for clinical teaching. The north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designated series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness. THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT. CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS. Dr. Davis. Dr. Flippin, Chief of Staff. Dr. Voshell. Dr. Daniel. Dr. Hedges. Dr. Goodwin. Dr. Compton. Dr. Jones. Dr. Nelson. Dr. Rea. Dr. Neff. Dr. Mulholland. Dr. Banks. Dr. Smith. Dr. Brown. Dr. Bigger. Dr. Preston. Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. Clinics are held three times a week for general medical, surgical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and twice weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service, and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student, under the supervision of an instructor, are a part of the organization of this department. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM. The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, lies within easy reach of the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director of the Sanatorium teaches phthisiotherapy in the Medical School, and the 120 beds of the Sanatorium afford excellent clinical material for first hand, practical experience for internes, medical students and nurses of the University Medical School. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course of the Medical School. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>
