ANNOUNCEMENTS THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 16th and will close July 26th, with lectures 5 times a week. The Second Term will begin July 28th and close August 29th, with 6 lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is 3 courses; but in a few exceptional cases, permission may be obtained to take 4 courses. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra course. See page 26. The Summer Quarter is conducted for white men and women students as follows: Elementary teachers seeking certificate or degree credit, high school teachers desiring certificate or degree credit, students just entering college desiring advanced standing, undergraduate students, pre-medical students and pre-law students desiring to meet entrance requirements, medical students, graduate students working for the master's degree or wishing to engage in research, school officials, supervisors and superintendents, and serious minded men and women who wish a wider knowledge of some special subject or seek broader general culture. Institute of Public Affairs.âThe fourth session of the Institute of Public Affairs will be held from August 3rd to 16th for the study and discussion of outstanding issues in national, state and local government and the economic and social problems underlying them. The Institute of Public Affairs was inaugurated in 1927 as an experiment for the purpose of advancing the popular understanding of public questions and stimulating in the public mind a more vital interest in public affairs. Its program in 1927 was a comparatively simple one consisting of 7 Round Tables and 18 Public Addresses. It succeeded far beyond the expectations of those who conceived and planned it, and because of the fact that it emphasized particularly the domestic problems of the United States and had amongst the speakers outstanding men in public affairs, made a wide appeal to the American people. The Institute since 1927 has grown both in the number of those participating in the program and in the members and visitors in attendance, and also in the scope and richness of its program. There were 8 Round Tables in the 1929 session, 21 evening speakers, 28 invited speakers who participated in the Open Forum discussions and 85 persons invited to speak at the Round Table sessions, making a total of 142. This shows an increase over the 139 in 1928 and a remarkable advancement from the 25 persons who participated in 1927. The attendance has grown from 95 registered members and 1,819 registered visitors, which included most of the students enrolled in the Second Term of the Summer Quarter, in 1927, to 301 registered members and 737 registered guests, not including the Summer Quarter students, in 1929. The members were from 34 states, the District of Columbia, the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Peru, Nicaragua and Spain. In addition to these, there were 200 delegates present in 1929 who had been appointed by Governor Byrd. This increase in the number of those participating as well as those attending is gratifying evidence that the Institute is meeting a popular need. The fourth session of the Institute will be planned on lines similar to those of last year, but there will be a natural enlargement of program. The Institute offers unusual opportunities to graduate students in the social sciences. A complete announcement will be sent to any person upon application. All the railroads in the Southeastern Passenger Tariff Association will grant reduced railroad rates. Attendance.âA change from a six weeks' summer session to a full Summer Quarter was approved by the faculty and authorized by the Rector and Visitors in 1920 and its rapid growth has justified the wisdom of these bodies in establishing it. The total enrollment for both terms in 1929 was 2,596. Deducting duplicates in the second term there was a total attendance of 2,016 individual students. Of the total enrollment 1,743 were from Virginia and 853 from 39 other states and countries. There were 1,654 women and 942 men. Entrance Requirements.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students are admitted to such courses as instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage, but they should be graduates of accredited high schools or have had equivalent preparation. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Students who wish to enter the courses leading to the Normal Professional Certificate are required to make formal application on blanks which will be furnished by the Registrar of the Summer Quarter. Such applications should be filed in the Office of the Registrar before the opening of the Summer Quarter. Location.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about 650 feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir 6 miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperatures from 1901 to 1929, taken from the records of the U. S. Weather Bureau station at the University Observatory, were: June, 72.2; July, 76.4; August, 74.4. There are golf links, swimming pools, and many other attractions for summer visitors. Excursions.âOne of the most attractive features of the Summer Quarter are the trips to nearby points of interest and of beauty. Under the directorship of a competent guide there will be excursions to Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; to Natural Bridge; the battlefields in Virginia; the Endless Caverns and the Grottoes and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The trips to the famous caverns located in the Valley of Virginia have always been exceedingly popular. The underworld wonders of these caves are famous throughout the entire country and many tourists come from all over the world to see them. These trips are made by automobile and the scenic beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Piedmont Valley and the Valley of Virginia greatly enhances the pleasure and profit derived from them. The proximity to Richmond, Petersburg and Old Point Comfort should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the observatory. In addition to the trips suggested above, well planned and personally conducted trips are arranged to Washington and New York. Since these are conducted by competent and experienced guides and are arranged for large numbers, a student can see more in less time and for less money than if traveling alone. To Endless Caverns and the Grottoes.âSaturday, July 19th. Total cost, including transportation, entrance to both caves, and meals, about $7.50. To Natural Bridge and Lexington.âSaturday, June 21st. An auto trip over the beautiful Blue Ridge and through the famous Shenandoah Valley. Cost about $6.50. To Monticello.âDates to be announced. Automobile round trip, including admission to grounds and buildings, $1.25. To Washington.âSaturday, July 12th, returning late July 13. Total cost, including sightseeing trips through public buildings, Arlington and Mount Vernon, the services of a guide and chaperon, hotel bills (the party stopped at the famous Mayflower Hotel in 1929), and railroad fare, from $18.00 to $19.00. To New York.âSaturday, June 28th. The New York Excursion includes passage to and from New York, meals and all sightseeing cost except incidental car fare, and subway charges. The sightseeing includes, among numerous other features, Fifth Avenue, Broadway, Grant's Tomb, Columbia University, Chinatown and East Side, Aquarium, Brooklyn, the top of Woolworth Building, Statue of Liberty, and, if time allows, Coney Island. If sufficient number desire it, a trip to Atlantic City will be arranged. Approximate cost from $16.00 to $18.00. Rooms and Board.âThe dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range and Dawson's Row. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. No cooking will be allowed in dormitory rooms. No transfer of a reservation will be allowed unless permission is given by the Secretary of the Summer Quarter. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. No room will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. If a room is not claimed by June 17 and no notice has been received by the Secretary, the reservation may be regarded as cancelled and the room rented. Rooms will be ready for occupancy June 13th. Applications for rooms in The Halls must be accompanied with a retaining fee of $10.00, the remainder to be paid on arrival at the University, and the full fee of $15.00 for a single room or $10.00 for a double room each person is required for the Lawns, Ranges and Dawson's Row. All checks should be made payable to UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA and sent to the Secretary, Box 149, University, Virginia. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. Meals may be obtained at the University Commons, formerly conducted as a Cafeteria, at the rate of $7.00 a week. Excellent meals are provided with service. This building is within two minutes' walk of any of the dormitories. Accommodations are ample and reservations need not be made. Other Accommodations In addition to the University dormitories and the Commons, there are private lodging and boarding houses situated near the University. A list of these can be found on page 91 of this bulletin. No student will be permitted to room in a house not approved by the Administrative Board of the Summer Quarter. If the name is not on the approved list in the catalogue, inquiry should be made before accommodations are engaged. Girls will not be permitted to visit fraternity houses for men, whether chaperoned or not. If accommodations are not secured before arriving, students should go immediately to Peabody Hall, where there will be listed the available boarding places still open. A guide will be at the station with the Summer Quarter badge to aid students with baggage; but not to designate boarding places. Students are cautioned against solicitors at the station or on the grounds and are advised to accept advice and directions only from official sources. All inquiries concerning rooms or board should be addressed to Secretary of Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. Of these one hundred and fifty-three apartments, eight are provided for women faculty members, and four for men faculty members and nine basement apartments for married couples without children. The remaining one hundred thirty-two for women students in the Summer Quarter. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large builtin clothes closets, and is furnished with two single steel beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bed-room, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided for incoming long-distance messages and for all outgoing messages at regular pay-rates by a station in the Manager's office in the basement of Venable Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for these apartments is $3.50 per week or $21.00 for the First Term and $17.50 for the Second Term for each person. The rental for one occupant will be $42.00 for the First Term and $35.00 for the Second Term. A deposit of $10.00 for each person is required in order to reserve an apartment. East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental is $15.00 a term of six weeks for a single room and $10.00 each person for a double room per term. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. East Range will be reserved for men students and West Range for women students. The rental is $15.00 per term for a single room and $10.00 each person per term for a double room. Dawson's Row consists of a series of five eight-room and one ten-room two-story brick houses, and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. House A is for men, B for women, C for women, D for men, E and F for married couples and G for families. The rental is $15.00 per term of six weeks for a single room and $10.00 each person for a double room. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bath-house is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Keys for each room, except those in The Halls, are furnished at the Summer Quarter Office. Those for The Halls will be furnished by the Manager at his office in the basement of Venable Hall on West Terrace. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of six weeks. Necessary expenses are reckoned as University and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

The basis will be one and one-half fare for the round trip, minimum excursion fare $1.00, and tickets will be sold only to students and members of their families upon presentation of identification certificates to ticket agents at time of purchase of tickets. Ask your station agent in advance of your coming about rates. Tickets will be sold June 12th to 18th, inclusive, and July 24th to July 30th, inclusive, final limit of all tickets September 5th, tickets to be validated by the regular ticket agents of the Charlottesville terminal lines over which such tickets read before return journey is commenced. Application for identification certificates should be made to Secretary, Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. Fees for Virginia Teachers and Students.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, leading to certification. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional course. To meet local expenses, a registration fee of $5.00 for a six weeks' term and a medical fee of 75 cents is charged all students except Virginia teachers, who pay no tuition, and are charged $10.00 registration fee. An extra fee of $5.00 will be charged for each graduate course. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged the registration fee of $5.00 and $15.00 tuition. Virginia Teachers Other Virginia Students Students From Other States First Term Second Term First Term Second Term First Term Second Term Tuition $â $â $ 15 00 $ 15 00 $ 20 00 $ 20 00 Registration fee 10 00 10 00 5 00 5 00 5 00 5 00 The term "Virginia teachers" includes those who are now teaching in Virginia or whose last teaching was in Virginia. The term cannot be construed as meaning any of the following: 1. Those who are now teaching in another state. 2. Those whose last teaching was in another state. 3. Those who are planning to teach but have not yet taught. Women students from Virginia who are planning to teach but have not yet taught may secure a State Scholarship which entitles them to free tuition in return for their pledge to teach two years in the public schools of Virginia. A student applying for such a scholarship should have her application endorsed by the Superintendent of the Division in which she lives. Fees for Non-Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 for each term and a tuition fee of $20.00 for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra course. See page 26. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of courses to the regulations under which Virginia licenses are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer Quarter for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 75 cents will be charged each person who registers each term, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. Staige Davis Blackford, the Physician of the Summer Quarter, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 934-R; office hours at the hospital 8:30 to 9:30 and 5:00 to 6:00. Sundays, holidays, and Saturdays, 12:00 to 1:00 only. Moderate charges will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Physician of the Summer Quarter; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for maintenance while there. This reduced charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of the student, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital upon the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer Quarter Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Late Registration and Transfer Fees.âStudents who fail to register on the days specified for the purpose must pay a special fee of $1.00. Registration is not completed until all fees are paid; therefore, if fees are not paid on the registration days, $1.00 is added to the total of fees charged. A fee of $1.00 is charged for each change from one course to another after registration has been completed. No auditors or visitors are allowed in classes unless this privilege is mentioned in the description of the course. All who attend must be regularly registered and enrolled. Refund of Fees.âStudents who withdraw within the period allowed for registration and changes in program, that is, within the first week of the session, will be reimbursed the full amount of tuition fees and half the laboratory fees, but no other fees. Students who withdraw after the time allowed for registration and changes cannot be allowed reimbursement for any fees. Formal application for withdrawal, by notice to the Registrar before leaving the Summer Quarter, must be made and permission granted or no remission of fees will be allowed. Payment of Fees and Other Expenses.âThe Bursar does not cash personal checks, but will accept them in payment of the exact amount of fees, and they will be accepted at the Commons for meal tickets. Students should provide themselves with Travelers checks, or New York Drafts, which may be obtained from their home banks, or Postal Money Orders. A Branch of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville is located at the University where accounts may be opened, if desired. Time and Place of Recitations and Lectures.âRecitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 17th, at 8:30 A. M. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except Saturday, June 28th, and Saturday, July 12th, to make up for registration day, June 16th and Fourth of July, when there will be no classes. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Sunday Vesper Service.âThe Vesper Services held in McIntire Amphitheatre every Sunday evening at 7:30, draw thousands not only from the Summer Quarter but from the community for miles around. They consist of a religious address from a distinguished speaker, special music by the Vespers Choir and individual soloists, community singing and selections played on the big pipe organ in the amphitheatre. These Vesper Services have always proven to be one of the most attractive features of the Summer Quarter. The Vespers Choir.âThis Chorus (for women's voices) is conducted along the lines of a city church choir of high standards. Students of the Summer Quarter, particularly those with some experience in choral singing, are invited to join; membership is limited to thirty. Regular rehearsals are held each Wednesday from 7:30 to 8:30 P. M. at Madison Hall and programs will be prepared and performed during the Vesper Services. The organization takes place Wednesday, June 18th, at 7:30 P. M. in Madison Hall. General Assembly.âEvery evening except Saturday and Sunday, from 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock, a general assembly of students and faculty will be held in Cabell Hall. The program will be informal and varied, and will be musical, devotional, educational, or recreational. Assembly will be under the direction of a faculty committee, and will be led by members of the faculty and prominent visiting speakers. Commencement.âIn order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, commencement exercises will be held Friday evening, August 29th, at 8 o'clock, when degrees will be conferred. Registration in Person.âThose students who will need advice before registering will register in person on June 13th, 14th, 16th, in Peabody Hall. No student will be allowed to attend any class until his registration has been completed. Registration is completed and the student's card filed only after his fees have been paid in full. No student will be enrolled in any course without a card showing that he has been regularly registered for such a course and that his fees have been paid. Students are urged, therefore, to register and pay fees promptly on the days set aside for that purpose. A delayed registration fee of $1.00 will be charged all persons after June 18th. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 to 4:30 P. M. on registration days. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 24th, except a certificate of attendance. Registration by Mail.âRegistration may be completed by mail to June 7th. For the necessary blanks, address, Registrar Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Va. Registration by mail is intended only for those who know the program of studies which they may or should take. All such prospective students are urged to register by mail. This will avoid the great congestion on registration days, and enable the students to arrive a day or two later. Students who register by mail are not expected to pay fees until after arrival at the University. Classes of students who should register by mail: Teachers who are working on a prescribed program of study. These students should send an official transcript of their credits to the Registrar. More careful attention can be given to the planning of such students' work than if left until the Registration days. Graduates of accredited High Schools, who are beginning work toward a teacher's certificate. As the work for such students is outlined for them, there will be no difficulty in their registering by mail. Teachers from out of the State. The work of such students is outlined by the Board of Education of their own State and therefore, they would not need advice in planning their work. College Students who have decided on a definite course of study. Procedure for Registration by Mail.âAfter receiving the registration blank from the Registrar, the student should answer all questions on the front of the card, and on a separate sheet of paper, list the classes which he wishes to pursue. After this card is returned to the Registrar, if the program is approved, the Registrar will fill in the classes on the back of the registration card. A list of the fees due will be sent to the student. Upon arrival at the University, the student should go immediately to the Bursar, in the Basement of Peabody Hall, pay his fees and receive a card showing he may enter the clases for which he registered. Upon payment of fees, registration will be considered complete and the registration card filed in the Registrar's office. The General Library.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer Quarter, from 9 A. M. to 9:30 P. M. The collection contains about 90,000 volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. At the end of each term, the names of students who owe library fees or who have not returned borrowed books, are sent to the Registrar. No grades or credits are issued for such students until their names have been cleared at the Library. The Heck Memorial Library.âThe Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. At present the library consists of over 6,400 well selected volumes covering most fields of Education, and files of national, state, and foreign publications. This Library will be open from 8:30 A. M. to 9:30 P. M. Rest and Study Rooms.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer Quarter, from 9 A. M. until 10 P. M. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. The Secretary in charge requests the co-operation of all and invites each student to make the Y. W. C. A. her "home" while at the University. The New Memorial Gymnasium.âThe new Memorial Gymnasium is situated between the athletic field and the University golf links, and offers facilities unsurpassed in any American university. The main exercise room is 180 by 96 feet, with a 10-foot running track gallery of 12 laps to the mile. There is also an auxiliary gymnasium 30 by 70 feet. The swimming pool is 30 by 75 feet, with a gallery for spectators. A general locker room provides for 1,700 full-length steel lockers, with two shower rooms. There are also spacious locker rooms and baths for home and visiting teams as well as special rooms for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, and three handball courts. The administration wing includes offices for the staff, examination rooms and a large lecture room. Students' Mail.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. Before leaving, each student should file at the post office his or her forwarding address; otherwise, mail without return address which comes after the student has departed, will be sent to the dead letter office. Teacher's Positions.âThe Appointment Committee of the Summer Quarter receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer Quarter file their applications. There will be no charge for this service except a small registration fee of $1.00 to assist in the expenses of the Committee. Regulations Concerning Credit.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Dean of the Summer Quarter the general average grade of each student in each course. Absence or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A report of each course completed will be signed by the Registrar of the Summer Quarter and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes his or her report sent, should file with the Registrar not later than July 13th, the First Term and August 14th, the Second Term a self-addressed government stamped envelope for mailing it. Credit Allowed by Other States Than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia State Board of Education. Credit is now allowed toward the extension of certificates by most of the Southern States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Entrance Credit.âWhere college courses in the Summer Quarter are taken to absolve conditions or to meet entrance requirements, no more than 3 units of entrance credit may be obtained in a full quarter. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer Quarter. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer Quarter. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer Quarter in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificate of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses for which degree credit is designated in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students, both men and women, who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit in the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer Quarter, but the summer work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (e) Graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter if approved by the Committee on Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; residence work aggregating three Summer Quarters shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this University. In no case will credit be given on more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining 15 session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the Summer Quarter. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters in this University. REGULATIONS The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the regular session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work; or five hours a week of lecture or recitation or five laboratory periods of two hours each a week for a term of six weeks in the Summer Quarter. It is equal to two semester-hours or three quarter-hours. Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student may undertake each term courses aggregating 3 session-hours (with the exception noted in paragraph I.) (I) A student may take 4 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 4 session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Dean of the Summer Quarter and all of the professors concerned. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercise) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course a grade of 75 per cent. is required. For certificate regulations, see page 36. Report of Grades.âA report of the final grade in each course pursued is mailed to each student as soon as practicable after the close of each term. The names of students who passed will be posted as soon as reported after each examination but no grades will be given out from the Registrar's Office. Transcript of Records.âAfter the original record is issued, a charge of twenty-five cents will be made for each transcript of a record. Remittance should accompany each application. Report of State Credits.âState credits and State certificates will be sent from the Department of Public Instruction, Richmond. Students who fail to get their certificate should communicate with the Supervisor of Certification, State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with above, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. Re-examinations.âA student whose grade in any course falls below 75 per cent. but not below 65 per cent. may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course during the first two days of registration of the following Summer Quarter. All applicants for re-examination must register and pay the fee of $2.50. The Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students through the Honor Committee.

Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the regular session of the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed in the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. Appropriate courses taken in the Summer Quarter count toward these degrees. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, exclusive of Physical Education, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. Each applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter must submit to the Dean of the Summer Quarter for approval by the proper Committee on Degrees, the program of work leading to the degree sought, not later than April 1st of the year in which the degree is to be obtained. If the Committee approves the program, it will be submitted to the proper faculty of the University for recommendation to the General Faculty and will be finally approved by the General Faculty at the meeting in June at which other degrees are approved. Each student who expects to receive a degree at the close of the Summer Quarter is required to leave his or her name with the Registrar of the Summer Quarter on or before August 1st. This is necessary in order that credits may be checked, caps and gowns ordered, diplomas engraved, etc. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREES OF BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 30 session-hours of required subjects as stated below in addition to Physical Education.

GRADUATE STUDIES Registration.âGraduate students of the Summer Quarter, new or old, are required each summer of their residence, if they wish to become candidates for the Master's Degree at this University, to register at the office of the Dean of Graduate Studies, Graduate House, West Lawn, where they will be advised in regard to a program of studies. This registration should promptly follow registration at the Summer Quarter Office in Peabody Hall. Graduate students must register in person and not by mail. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application as set forth below. NoteâEach graduate student is urged to consult with the professor of the Major Subject, and to have his course of study finally arranged and approved before registering in Peabody Hall. No student may enter a graduate course for credit after three days. No graduate student is entitled to a special examination on any course in the Summer Quarter on which his or her grade has been unsatisfactory. This deficiency may be made up during another summer or in the regular session. Final approval of candidacy will depend upon the record made during the first term or quarter of residence. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least 6 collegiate session-hours of foreign language credit are required. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Commencement must hand in their these by August 1 and take their final comprehensive examinations as soon as their theses have been approved. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, or three Summer Quarters, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, and an examination written or oral, upon the program of study, to be accepted as satisfactory by the professor of the candidate's Major Subject in the regular session of the University. A candidate who expects to obtain the Master's degree in three Summer Quarters shall select his subject for a thesis not later than the beginning of his second summer of residence. This subject should be approved by October 15th following. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than July 20th of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and one or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Graduate Work in Education.âGraduate work in Education leading to the degree of Master of Arts and Master of Science may be pursued in the Summer Quarter. Residence.âAs stated above, the Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters of two terms each. In no case will a degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three Quarters, the equivalent in time of the regular session. Graduate students in the Summer Quarter are required to make their Master's degree in three out of five summers, after being accepted for graduate courses without conditions. Graduate students are advised to continue their residence, if possible, during one or more terms of the regular session. Courses, Session-hours, and Grade.âOnly those courses marked C in this catalogue may be counted toward the Master's degree. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee on Graduate Studies. At least 12 session-hours of resident work, constituting a definite program of study and distributed over three Quarters, or six Summer terms, are required for the Master's degree. Terms devoted entirely to undergraduate study will not be counted in residence for the Master's degree. A graduate student's standing in a course is indicated not by a numerical grade, but by one of the following terms: Distinguished, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory. PRE-LAW COURSES For admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued in a standard college courses leading to a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least 30 session-hours. All the required pre-Law courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Notice is given that two important changes in the requirements for admission are in contemplation, of which changes pre-law students should be forewarned. First: The exclusion, as subjects acceptable for admission to the Law School, of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education, Physical Education, Military Training, and Public Speaking. Second: The definite requirement, for admission to the Law School, of most of the following subjects, which are now recommended as desirable pre-law courses: English, Latin, French or Spanish, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Government, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Logic and Ethics. PRE-MEDICAL COURSES The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than 30 session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking 33 or 36 session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least 30 session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the 30 session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Ethics, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course: Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in general physics is a 6 session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and 6 hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is 4 session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he has registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. All the pre-medical courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. VIRGINIA CERTIFICATES During the Summer Quarter courses are offered which will meet the requirements for the following certificates. 1. The Elementary Certificate for either primary or grammar grades. 2. The Normal Professional Certificate for primary grades and for grades 6, 7, 8. 3. The Collegiate Certificate for high school teachers. 4. The Collegiate Professional Certificate for high school teachers. 5. The renewal of certificates. 6. Requirements of the West Law. THE ELEMENTARY CERTIFICATE The Elementary Certificate is issued on completion of one year or three quarters of residence work in a standard teachers training institution which requires for admission graduation from a standard public or private high school, or successfully passing standard-college entrance examinations, or presentation of a First Grade Certificate (by examination). Credit for correspondence courses is not accepted for the Elementary Certificate. Extension or study-center course credit, not to exceed 5 session-hours, may be accepted. This certificate permits the holder to teach in the elementary schools. Elementary Certificates issued as of July 1, 1930, shall be granted as two-year non-renewable certificates; those issued as of July 1, 1931, as one-year non-renewable certificates. After 1931 the Elementary certificate shall not be issued to incoming teachers. Elementary Certificates issued on or prior to July 1, 1929, are subject to renewal for six years. Certificates issued on or after July 1, 1930, to applicants who have never taught will be good for the term fixed for the certificate, but shall not be renewable except on presentation of credits required for a higher grade of certificate. Holders of First Grade Certificates or Provisional Elementary Certificates will be allowed until July 1, 1931, to complete the requirements for the Elementary Certificate, and will on completion of requirements be granted six-year certificates. Requirements for an Elementary Certificate I. Entrance Requirements to the Course. 1. Graduation from an accredited high school, or 2. An accredited private secondary school. 3. Graduates admitted upon less than the above requirements cannot apply for a certificate of any type until satisfactory high school credits have been placed before the State Department. 4.
