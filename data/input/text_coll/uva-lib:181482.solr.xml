      <field name="fulltext">Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1937-38 SOMEWHERE between the librarian and the historian (or the social scientist, it may be argued) stands the archivist. Just what his status is among the professionals or how it is to be arrived at in this country has not yet been determined. That he is already here complicates the situation but at least keeps practical considerations to the fore. By many people of recognized intelligence he is classified with genus antiquarium because some of his kind are known only as guardians and preservers of ancient records from use. Like the physician emerging from the barber's trade in colonial days, the archivist aspires to professional dignity in his own name. In some states where he has the title, he is virtually an artisan doing odd jobs of reference and serving as scrivener for the legislators, or his quasi professionalism may be that of a politician among politicians. Among county and city clerks the title of archivist is unknown as applied to their position. In Virginia, for example, where the county clerks of colonial and ante bellum times were generally men of prestige and considerable culture, and where respect for this office has been preserved in some measure, training for the duties of office, if any, may be acquired occasionally as deputy, but the job is chiefly one of daily routine in recording current entries. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century social scientists and librarians were striving for recognition among scholars and laymen. The former, being in the teaching profession, could concentrate upon the establishment and acceptance of their separate disciplines. History was the first to succeed; economics and government soon followed, with sociology bringing up the rear not without opposition and challenge from the other three of its right to a separate existence. Librarians, however, were mere keepers of books. Anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence was regarded as qualified for the position and, in any case, training and experience were then synonymous. A few librarians were private collectors or bibliographers or historians or even book dealers who brought in useful information from the outside. By means of their initiative and scholarship they breathed an air of professionalism into their own libraries. The American Library Association was organized in 1876 and its growth paralleled the steady increase of libraries in size and number.1 1. The American Social Science Association was founded in 1865, from which sprang the American Historical Association in 1884. The economists organized nationally in 1885, the political scientists in 1903, the sociologists in 1905. By correspondence, through publications and conventions, common problems and new ideas were discussed, and, if it became popular to be a "joiner," yet the advantages of solidarity could not be denied. Custodians of public libraries (most influential in sheer numbers), of college, university, and special research libraries girded their loins for concerted action. As professional status was gradually won, special training was stressed, library schools were established, and degrees conferred. The field for expansion was apparently unlimited. More librarians were needed. With so many credits accumulated the certificate or degree was assurance (and became prerequisite) for the job. But such education in terms of quantity, figured in mathematical credits, is easy prey to intellectual dishonesty (often called by a harsher name), when the art of thinking and living in the world of books is subordinated to the tricks of the trade. That "politics make strange bed-fellows" is an aphorism not reserved exclusively for the politicians. Allowance must be made for individual differences, but the question may justifiably be asked: Who is a Librarian?—in the finest sense of the word. Is he a cataloguer or an indexer or a dispenser of a variety of references to the gentle public? Both craftsmen and scholars are needed in every library and some men may be both, but the library profession stands or falls by the well rounded scholar whose formal training in the arts, humanities, and sciences is merely the beginning of self education through years of experience. To the librarian, moreover, the challenge of scholarship needs to be especially strong because, in this age of specialization, he must have an intelligent grasp of many fields of knowledge. Now the query may be raised: Who is to be an Archivist? Can the snares and pitfalls of our higher educational system, from which some teachers and librarians are trying to extricate themselves, be avoided in the development of this new profession? Most trained persons in charge of archives or manuscripts to-day have entered the field by way of library service or research in the social sciences, especially history. The membership in the new Society of American Archivists is composed mainly from these two professions. In their lap lies the fate of the future archivist, his qualifications and training. It is significant, too, that the American Library Association has a Committee on Archives and Libraries which is studying this question.2 2. Cf. American Library Association, Bulletin, XXXI, no. 9 (Sept. 1937), pages 550-51. Since many archives and manuscript collections are intimately associated with libraries, there is a distinct danger as well as advantage in applying the practices of the latter to the former. The preservation, care, and administration of archival material involve a technique not to be minimized in its detail, yet not so complicated as some persons would have us believe. The craftsmanship can be learned in a short time and in many institutions can be executed more economically by assistants. More important is the scholarship necessary, particularly in the social sciences and the humanities, to interpret the background and content of the manuscripts and relate them to documents elsewhere and to printed works; to discriminate in the acquisition and rejection of new material; and to decide questions of policy in making manuscripts accessible directly, by photographic copies for use elsewhere, or by publication. In view of these considerations, archival training should be carried on in universities with a well established manuscript division in their libraries, in direct connection with graduate work in the social sciences and the humanities, rather than in library schools. For, in contrast to the librarian, the archivist will be essentially a specialist. The graduate work should be on the Ph.D. level, if one must speak in terms of degrees, for the prospective archivist will need intensive training in original research and writing. Courses in historiography, the history of archives, and bibliography will be helpful, primarily to enliven the student's approach to and appreciation of these subjects, not to addle his brain with the memorizing of titles that mean nothing more. Archival practice can be gained by part-time experience in the university's manuscript room, and its relations to other departments of the library can be understood by contacts with those departments as problems arise from time to time. In some institutions there may be opportunity for work with visiting professors and archivists from other universities and from the National Archives, such as Dr. Solon J. Buck is to offer at Columbia University during the coming year. It is to be hoped that the archives profession will escape the doldrums of trivial courses in text-book learning and will strive to produce well read scholars who can interpret the significance of a manuscript as well as read the text and file it properly. Working along these lines, the Society of American Archivists might set up some kind of agency to develop uniformity of procedure, to appoint boards of examiners, and to serve as a clearing-house for placing promising scholars in archival positions. The expansion of archival activity which has accompanied the steady growth of genuine interest in things historical in America gives promise of new positions and the succession of trained scholars to old posts in this field. There is an opportunity and a need for co-operation in charting the path of professional archivists whose credentials will be not the courses they have endured or the degrees they hold, be they ever so worthy, but the high scholarship and genuine appreciation of archives they have demonstrated.3 3. The foregoing discussion of archival training was written before the presentation of the report of the Committee on Archival Training was made on October 24, 1938, at the second annual meeting of the Society of American Archivists in Springfield, Illinois. The problem of archival training, discussed at length because it is so crucial, is only one of many that concern administrators of manuscripts and archives throughout the country. The Society of American Archivists now has committees at work on all phases of their work from technique to public relations. Their quarterly, The American Archivist, first issued in January 1938, under the editorship of Professor Theodore C. Pease of the University of Illinois, provides a medium of expression and discussion. The Society's Proceedings for 1936-37 have been issued in mimeographed form from Urbana, Illinois. A joint meeting with the American Historical Association was held in Philadelphia, December 29, 1937. The historians have a Committee on Historical Source Materials whose interest in manuscripts and original documents coincides with that of the archivists'. Mention has already been made of the ALA Committee on Archives and Libraries which likewise offers its co-operation. Its sessions during the convention of the ALA in Kansas City, Missouri, June 13-16, 1938, were devoted to the organization and preservation of manuscript collections and archives, principles for the selection of materials for preservation, developments in microphotography, and the progress of the Historical Records Survey and the American Imprints Project.4 4. American Library Association, Bulletin, XXXII, no. 7 (July, 1938). See below, page 15, on American imprints. From intellectual movements in the United States, such as these, the South may no longer be rightly regarded as detached or isolated. Although one southerner who set out quite recently to "discover" the South found no libraries worthy of comment, or overlooked them among his notes,5 5. Jonathan Daniels, A Southerner Discovers the South (New York, Macmillan, 1938). another southern writer has beheld the new University of Virginia Library as a symbol of a "Renaissance below the Potomac".6 6. Virginius Dabney, "Renaissance below the Potomac", New York Times, Magazine section, July 24, 1938, pages 8, 18. Undoubtedly the progress of this section in education and literature during the past decade or more has resulted in part from the growth of libraries. The new building at the University of Virginia was occupied and opened for use in May 1938. Meanwhile the Virginia Legislature had granted an appropriation and the State secured the necessary lot for a new State Library in Richmond which will also house the state Archives, long seriously congested and not entirely safe from fire and decay. In North Carolina a new building has been erected, in part to provide for the State Historical Commission which has custody of the state archives. The ever-broadening interest in southern archives and manuscripts is reflected in the meetings of the Southern Historical Association. Following the practice of the preceding year, a luncheon conference on this subject was held at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, November 19, 1937. In planning the Alderman Memorial Library of the University of Virginia adequate provision was made for the acquisition, care, and use of original research materials. The entire east wing, second floor, is given over to manuscripts and rare books, including the McGregor Collection to be described below. In this room the manuscript collections are filed vertically in all-steel drawers. In the adjoining locked stack are shelved most of the letter-books, bound business records,7 7. See the Appendix to the present report, pages 17-45. Virginia documents, and rare newspapers, periodicals, and books. The first floor of the east wing contains the map and microphotographic reading room, the photographic laboratory, and the newspaper sorting room; in the stacks on this level and deck above are the newspaper files. The offices of the staff are conveniently located on both floors between the stacks and the reading rooms. With an addition of fulltime staff members beginning July 1, 1938, it is now possible to launch a program of preparing a guide to all the manuscript collections, of calendaring certain collections, and of making subject-author indexes to others as time permits. It has always been the aim of the University of Virginia Library to make its manuscripts accessible as soon as possible after their acquisition. Although no detailed inventory has been made of them, it is safe to approximate their number at a million pieces. It is indeed fortunate that the outlook is promising for keeping pace with the growth of the collection and for providing maximum service to scholarship. During the past year the Library has been greatly enriched by the gift of the Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter (1809-1887) Papers from "Fonthill," Essex County, Virginia. This large accumulation of letters and accounts, as yet unsorted, will illuminate the political history of Virginia, since Hunter, first a Whig, and after 1840 a Democrat, was a prominent and influential personage as a member of the House of Representatives and of the Senate of the United States, as secretary of state in the Confederacy, and as treasurer of his own State, 1874-80. These manuscripts make possible, as never before, a full length biography of him.8 8. Cf. H. H. Simms, Life of Robert M. T. Hunter; a Study in Sectionalism and Secession (Richmond, Va., [1935]); C. H. Ambler, ed., "Correspondence of Robert M. T. Hunter, 1826-1876", in American Historical Association, Annual Report for 1916 (2 vols., Washington, 1918), II. Nor do the papers cover only the period of his lifetime. They include business letters of his kinsmen, James Hunter, merchant of Fredericksburg, and William Hunter, during the last third of the eighteenth century, with data on supplies for the American revolutionary army, and some letters dealing with farm life in Essex County at the turn of the twentieth century. In connection with the R. M. T. Hunter Papers should be mentioned the few extant records (mostly economic) of James M. Garnett, Jr., planter and lawyer, and his son Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett (1821-1864), Hunter's nephew. They lived at "Elmwood," in Essex County, not far distant from "Fonthill." At one time James M. Garnett, Jr., conducted a school for young ladies at his home from which has survived an account book of music tuition charged, 1825-28. The accounts of his law practice during 1820-24 are also extant. Most significant of the "Elmwood" records are the lists of Negroes, the charges against them year by year, and their valuation, 1830-61. The "Ledger of Accounts and Balances [of Muscoe R. H. Garnett] on and after the first day of September, 1842" extends to 1864, the period during which he was successively a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the United States Congress, and the Confederate Congress. In 1860 he married Mary Picton Stevens of Castle Point, New Jersey, daughter of the engineer and inventor, Edwin A. Stevens. Two of her personal account books, 1840, are in the collection. The libraries of Hunter and the Garnetts, now in the University of Virginia, will be described below. The Maury Family Manuscripts consist chiefly of letters written to Reuben Maury at "Piedmont" near Charlottesville during the first half of the nineteenth century on business and personal matters. They include a few letters on the War of 1812, with an account of the British pillage of Tappahannock, Va.; letters from Ann Maury in New York revealing sectional feeling on the eve of the Civil War, and from M. F. Maury, an Episcopal clergyman in Kentucky; communications from the British legation in Washington, D. C., regarding Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873); and the British passport of Maury, 1862, who went to England that year as special agent of the Confederate government. The William Cabell Rives (1793-1868) Collection, 1861-62, is composed of fifty-odd letters of Rives to his family regarding war conditions and of General A. P. Hill and a few others to Rives of a similar nature. To the Grinnan Papers9 9. Cf. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1936-37 (University, Virginia, 1937), page 5. have been added some letters and contracts of A. G. Grinnan on the sale, hire, and insuring of slaves; a printed circular of Franklin Slaughter, underwriter and general insurance agent of Fredericksburg, Virginia, on slave insurance rates for one or three years; and two letters of 1865 regarding Grinnan's petition for removal of civil disabilities under the Confiscation Act. His cousin, Mildred Glassell Covell, who married a northern man and lived in New York State, owned slaves and other property in Virginia which Grinnan had administered before the war. A score of her letters to him during 1866-68 reveal their attempts to secure a settlement of claims against the United States for wood cut on her farm in Fairfax County by the army. Most letters and reports of Federal soldiers during the Civil War are to be found in northern libraries. The University of Virginia, however, has acquired six official orders and letters of the Thirty-Eighth Regiment, New Jersey Volunteers, at Fort Pocahontas and Fort Powhatan, Virginia, 1864-65; seven letters of New Jersey soldiers written to their families from Camp Cadwallader, 1862, from Fredericksburg, 1862-63, and from Fort Powhatan, 1864-65; and six of Maine soldiers from Fort Jackson, 1861-62, and near Yorktown, 1862. The reaction of the man in the ranks to the turmoil around him is strikingly revealed in the letter-book of John Leavitt of Maine. Into a discarded account book he copied the letters of his sons George W. Leavitt of Brooklyn, New York, who served in the Fifth New York Volunteers and lost his life in the Second Battle of Manassas, and Joseph of the Fifth Maine Volunteers who was wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania, May 10, 1864. The letters are followed by the father's touching narrative of his visit to Mansion House Hospital, Alexandria, Virginia, where he attended his son and witnessed his death in July. The fleeting, but realistic, glimpses of hospital conditions and war tragedy are especially revealing. The John A. Quitman (1789-1858) Manuscripts confirm through official documents the various stages in his distinguished career—certificates of his commissions in the Mississippi militia and the United States army (e. g., his major-generalship during the Mexican War), as chancellor of Mississippi, judge of the High Court of Errors and Appeals, presidential elector in 1848, Worshipful Grand Master Mason of Mississippi, member of the Aztec Club of the City of Mexico, etc. There are also a few other Masonic manuscripts, a pew-title from the vestry of Trinity Church, Natchez, and a copy of military orders of volunteers in the Army of Texas, May to July, 1836. His interest in American expansion to the south is suggested in letters to him during the 'fifties on "a plan for aiding the revolutionists in Mexico," "for the protection of slave property in [Texas]," and in asking for his support and leadership in fitting out "an expedition [in Mexico] to assist the inhabitants of Cuba in throwing off the yoke of Spanish oppression". One curious document is entitled "Craniological Indications of the head of Gen. Quitman according to the principles of Neurology— By Jos. R. Buchanan". In view of the biographical value of this collection, it is pertinent to remark that no detailed life of Quitman has been published since 1860.10 10. J. F. H. Claiborne, Life and Correspondence of John A. Quitman, Major-General, U. S. A., and Governor of the State of Mississippi (2 vols., New York, 1860). Among recently acquired manuscripts pertaining to the University of Virginia the Harrison-Tutwiler Collection, 1831-62, warrants some emphasis. These are letters of Gessner Harrison (1807-1862), professor of ancient languages in the University, to his intimate friend Henry Tutwiler (1807-1884), who held the same chair in the University of Alabama, 1831-37. Since they had been fellow students at Virginia, Harrison wrote at length about the institution and its problems and about his family as well. His piety and deep religious conviction are also clearly portrayed. Miscellaneous University items include two letters by William G. Pendleton, proctor, 1835 and 1836; twenty-one volumes of lecture notes on various courses taken by William R. Aylett,11 11. The University Library also has his nephew's, Philip Aylett's, Notes on Surveying at Virginia Military Institute, 1886, and his accounts with V. M. I., 1884-88 (2 vols.). 1850-54; Dr. Daniel S. Morgan's (1810-1863) student notes on the lectures of Professor Robley Dunglison on physiology, 1829-30; Muscoe R. H. Garnett's notes on Professor Charles Bonnycastle's lectures in mathematics, 1838; records of the Student Police, 1935-38; and copies of the bills of the Little Congress, student organization begun last year for debates on vital public questions. The Papers of John Graeme, Jr., 1870-78 and 1885, who was editor of the Richmond Evening News in 1868-69,12 12. He was publisher of the Richmond Republican in 1852—cf. L. J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1936: A Bibliography . . . (New York, 1936), pages 179, 183. tell of his attempts to get his dictionary of synonyms ("Word Finder," he called it) published by Lippincott, Henry Holt, and others. There is also a letter from General J. D. Imboden,13 13. The Imboden Papers are in the University Library—Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1934-35 (University, Virginia, 1935), page 5. 1878, in reply to a request for financial aid. From Abingdon, Virginia, come the manuscript recollections of the Reverend Mr. Lewis F. Cosby of the town and its residents before and soon after the Civil War. Although not written until ca. 1900 or later, his description and location of houses have proved to be accurate by comparison with contemporary official records. To the John Warwick Daniel Collection14 14. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, pages 3-4. has been added some original poetry written by the senator. An autograph letter of General R. E. Lee recommending a leave of absence for Leigh Robinson, December 19, 1864, has been received. The genealogical collection has been augmented by two typewritten volumes on "Davis Families of the Southern States," by C. B. Heinemann. Three scrapbooks of Rowland Greene Tyler, brother of the scholar Moses Coit Tyler, contain clippings on events of the 1880's, 1890's, and early 1990's. The economic and social historian will be interested in some of the business records presented to the University Library. The Robert Latham (d. 1852) Collection of letters and vouchers, 1841-47 and 1852, shed some light upon the problem of the printing trade in the small town of that period. Latham was editor and printer of the Abingdon (Virginia) Banner15 15. Cappon, op. cit., page 39. and died insolvent. Comments on politics as well as on printing equipment will be found in the letters, and a list of accounts in Washington County, Virginia, with The Banner, 1847. The Dickinson Manuscripts from Franklin County, Virginia, 1822-58, are thirty miscellaneous items salvaged from a large accumulation long neglected and decayed—bills, receipts, letters concerning the mercantile business, tobacco marketing, the Kanawha salt works, politics, and life at the University of Virginia in 1848. A variety of business affairs are discussed in letters (mounted in a letter-book) to R. L. T. Beale, lawyer in Westmoreland County, Virginia, from his clients and others, 1854-56. A glimpse of war needs is afforded in the volume of accounts paid by Joseph M. Seay, agent for the Confederate States of America, for saw-mill operations in Shenandoah County, Virginia, for the government, 1861-62. From Caroline County, Virginia, come twelve volumes of general merchandise accounts running intermittently during 1821-27, 1855-70, 1885-1906, and one volume of fertilizer accounts, 1901-04; from near Riceville, Pittsylvania County, a mercantile ledger of 1770; from Essex County a similar one dated 1804-08; and from Ayletts, King William County, the country store records of Walker, Lamb &amp; Company, 1882-90 (14 vols.). Three other occupations are represented in the account book of George Keister, tanner, of Blacksburg, Virginia, 1837-40; in a physician's business record for 1840-42, 1846-53 (2 vols.), in Caroline County; and in the Montgomery Hotel Register of Guests, Christiansburg, Virginia, 1859-60, including accounts of individuals during 1860-66. Not infrequently official records of towns and counties come to light in collections of private papers. In this manner the University Library has acquired the tax records, 1857-59 (3 vols.), and fee book, 1857-60, of Joseph M. Seay, sheriff of Caroline County; likewise similar records from Pittsylvania County, 180—(?), 1818, and totals of tax returns, 1834-36. A Federal archive thus obtained is the "Account of the Mails Received at the Post Office at Peytonsburg, County of Pittsylvania, State of Virginia . . .," 1851-64.16 16. See also Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 6. This temporary disappearance and chance re-appearance of archives in other hands constitute one of the vexatious problems of archivists and one of the unpredictable variables in the so-called science of archives. Most noteworthy among the materials deposited in the University Library this year are the iron works records of William Weaver (d. ca. 1863) of Rockbridge County, Virginia, 1825-78 (80 vols.). These consist of journals, ledgers, provision books, slave labor accounts, a letter-book, and an ore book of the Bath Iron Works, Buffalo Forge, Union Forge, and Etna Furnace in Rockbridge and Botetourt counties. Weaver was one of the most prominent and successful iron-masters in the Valley of Virginia and a pioneer in scientific agriculture. This collection also contains a farm journal and some grist mill records of Spring Mills, operated in conjunction with the iron industry.17 17. Cf. Kathleen Bruce, Virginia Iron Manufacture in the Slave E a (New York &amp; London, 1930), pages 119, 134-45. Another collection of William Weaver MSS. is in the McCormick Historical Association Library, Chicago. Another important deposit is the original Journal of the Commission which located the Virginia-Tennessee boundary line in 1858-59; the daily entries were made by Leonidas Baugh of Abingdon, one of the Virginia commissioners.18 18. Cf. L. P. Summers History of Southwestern Virginia, 1746-1786, Washington County, 1777-1870 (Richmond, 1903), pages 714-20. The manuscript folio volume was originally used as the Regimental Order Book of G. R. McClellan during the Mexican War. From southwestern Virginia also comes a narrative of pioneer days and experiences in that region of William Ingles, Sr., written ca. 1830 (?).19 19. F. B. Kegley, Kegley's Virginia Frontier, the Beginning of the Southwest . . . 1740-1783 (Roanoke, Virginia, 1938), contains data on Ingles, page 195 and index. As indicated above, the Alderman Memorial Library is well equipped to carry on the work in microphotography begun several years ago. In keeping abreast of the rapid changes and new devices in this field, all institutions will be greatly aided by the new Journal of Documentary Reproduction, "a quarterly review of the applications of photography and allied techniques to library, museum and archival science," first published in the winter of 1938.20 20. Published by the American Library Association and edited under supervision of its Committee on Photographic Reproduction of Library Materials; Vernon D. Tate of the National Archives, managing editor. The University of Virginia has added to its equipment a Recordak projector and an Argus Microfilm Reader for reading film in the same manner as with other projectors or for projecting the image on the wall. Sessions on microphotography are scheduled now at almost all national and regional library meetings, where the latest models of all equipment can be examined and expert advice can be obtained. That the subject is of international interest is evidenced by the demonstrations given this year at the Paris Exposition. A considerable number of manuscript records have been microfilmed in the University of Virginia Library during the past year. The Civil War pocket diary (7 vols.) of Lieutenant L. T. Nunnelee, C. S. A., begins in August 1862 and touches upon many of the major campaigns —Antietam, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, the Valley, etc.—throughout the conflict and upon his furloughs in Pittsylvania County and Lynchburg. In the first volume the diary is preceded by recollections of his experiences during the first year of the war, including his witnessing from shore the battle between the C. S. S. Virginia and the U. S. S. Monitor and other ships in Hampton Roads.21 21. Vol. I of the Diary contains a list of members of the Lynchburg Beauregards or Moorman's Battery, afterwards Stuart's Horse Artillery. See article and excerpts from the Diary in Virginian-Pilot and Norfolk Landmark, Aug. 5, 1934, part 1, page 8. Several volumes of official town records of Virginia have been photographed: of Waynesboro, the oldest extant Minutes of the Council, 1888-1912, the charter and general ordinances of 1898, real estate owners of 1896-97, registers of voters for 1902-11; of Basic City (incorporated in 1890 and consolidated into Waynesboro in 1924), Minutes of the Council, 18901908, and Police Docket, 1906-12; of Abingdon, Minutes of the Trustees, 1789-1861, including an early plat of the town. Among the volumes of Waynesboro archives was found a semi-official record also copied—Minutes of the Trustees of Waynesboro Academy and Town Hall, 1832-1915, with several unrecorded decades. The Minute Book of McCabe Lodge, No. 56, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Abingdon, Virginia, 1853-57, was photographed mainly because it reveals the origin of Martha Washington Female College in that town. Other film copies include the Record Book of the Thalian (Debating) Society, Dane Law School, Harvard University, 1845-46, which accompanied the secretary when he returned to Virginia; correspondence between Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Beverly Tucker, and others, 1813-45; the Minutes of the Virginia Democratic State Central Committee, September 1925-37, and original list of delegates to the state convention of 1936;22 22. The original list of delegates for 1932 is in the University Library. "Trigg and Allied Families," a typewritten genealogy compiled by Sue Pelham Trigg, 1938; and several articles written by W. E. MacClenny, local historian, on Nansemond County, Virginia, and vicinity—"The Part Taken by Nansemond County, Virginia, in the American Revolution" (35 pages typewritten); a few historical sketches of churches;23 23. Several other typewritten copies of sketches by W. E. MacClenny in the University Library are: (1) "Historical Sketches of the Churches That Have Composed the Eastern Virginia Christian Conference for the Past 103 Years" [192-(?)]; "A Ramble around Suffolk, Virginia, November 1937"; "The Part Taken by Nansemond County and Suffolk, Virginia, in the World War, 19171918", including a list of the "Men from Nansemond County who served in the war against Germany, 1917-1919" (name, branch of service, age, place and date mustered in). and an account by Mrs. Emma McGuire Ferguson of "The Occupation of Suffolk by the Yankees" (16 pages typewritten). The Library has also acquired photostatic copies of the Charles W. Dabney transcripts of William H. Ruffner's (1824-1908) correspondence, diary, and papers dealing with many aspects of public education during and after his service as Virginia superintendent of public instruction, 1871-82. There are notes on Ruffner's projected history of education in Virginia, letters from John B. Minor,24 24. The Minor Papers are in the University of Virginia Library—see Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 7. speeches on various occasions, and sketches of William H. Ruffner and his father, Henry Ruffner (1790-1861), written in 1900. Among accessions in the field of cartography seven Civil War battlefield maps have been received, issued by the United States War Department—three of Gettysburg on July first, second, and third, respectively (1876, new edition 1883); one of Gregg's and Stuart's cavalry operations at Gettysburg the third day of the battle (1880); and three of the Peninsular Campaign from Yorktown to Harrison's Landing (1862). A map of the Virginia Central Railroad, 1852, and one of Florida, 1887, may be mentioned in passing and three copies of old maps: (1) Jacob Stauber's (Stover) map of the proposed colony of Georgia, 1731,25 25. Referred to in Newcastle to Board of Trade, Aug. 3, 1731, British Public Record Office, C. O. Papers, ser. 5, 1322; map bound in "B k of Draughts". (photostat); (2) a map of Louisa County, Virginia, signed "D. Yancey, Jan. 28th 1804"26 26. "This map of Louisa County is made principally from one drawn by John Hawkins the 8th December 1764", aided by boundary lines run by Nicholas Lewis and Robert Harris. "Most of the public roads in the county [were drawn] by the assistance of Capt. John Edwards . . . . [Signed] D. Yancey". (microfilm); (3) "Map of Suffolk [Virginia] and Vicinity . . . just previous to the siege of Gen. Longstreet, in Spring of 1863. Compiled and drawn by Capt. E. A. Curtis, 112th N. Y. S. Vols., Co. D"27 27. This map shows the location of regiments, batteries, etc., while Suffolk was occupied as a military post just previous to the siege. (photostat). New filing cases have been installed in the map room and classification and arrangement are proceeding apace. The newspaper collection, most of which was in temporary quarters for several years, is now distributed throughout two decks of the stacks, with considerable room for expansion. A card index arranged by state, city, and title is well advanced, showing the date of every issue in the collection. A recent count of the bound volumes of newspapers totaled nearly two thousand, but they represent scarcely one-fourth of the grand total. The following acquisitions may be of interest: the Portsmouth Old Dominion, November 1838-October 1839; the Staunton Spectator, 1837-39, 1848-50, 1865-1907 (almost complete), and Vindicator, 1866-68, 1870-87, 1889-95; the Harrisonburg News, 1904-10; the Luray Courier, 1884-1909 (scattered); the Bridgewater Enterprise, 1879, and Herald, 1884-85, 1894-1906. In the case of the Luray and Bridgewater papers, it is quite likely that these es are the only ones extant. Scattered numbers of the English newspaper of Yokohama, the Japan Weekly Mail, 1891-99, span a critical period in Far Eastern foreign relations. The Library has subscribed to the Yale University project for making microfilm (positive) copies of the Maryland Gazette, Annapolis, 1745-1820, from the file in the Maryland State Library. The first of these film copies arrived recently. Broadsides and pamphlets in large number have swelled the Library's ephemeral material, some of recent date from printers' offices in the State, others in manuscript collections, especially in the Hunter Papers. The private library of Muscoe R. H. Garnett, begun by his grandfather James M. Garnett (1770-1843) at "Elmwood" and continued by the son and grandson, was generously given to the University of Virginia by Mrs. J. Clayton Mitchell, daughter of Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett. In the same manner the University became the recipient of the library and papers of R. M. T. Hunter.28 28. University of Virginia Alumni News, XXVI, no. 7 (April 1938), pages 138-39. Both these libraries contain valuable collections of United States government documents especially from the second and third quarters of the nineteenth century, and some Virginia documents and pamphlets—many of which have filled serious gaps in the University's files. Both libraries are rich in ante bellum material covering a wide range of subjects rather than in rare imprints, but the Garnett library has special significance as an entity. It ceased to be a "live" collection when, not long after Garnett's death in 1864, "Elmwood" was closed, never to be used again as a permanent residence. The library thus "embalmed" for over seventy years and now maintained as a special collection in the Virginia Browsing Room of the new building, preserves in a unique way something of the spirit and culture of the old Virginia planter class. The gift of the library of the late Tracy W. McGregor to the University of Virginia by the trustees of the McGregor Fund is an event of far-reaching significance to research in Virginia and the South. Of the 12,500 items mostly in the fields of American history and English literature, more than 5,500 are rare books and pamphlets, including a special collection of works by and about the Mathers of colonial New England. Among the rare imprints are John Eliot's Indian Bible (1663), an almost complete collection of the original issues of the Jesuit Relations, 1634-73, the works of Captain John Smith (1608) and his A Map of Virginia (1612), a second folio of Shakespeare, and writings of Americus Vespucius, Richard Hakluyt, Samuel de Champlain, and others. The McGregor Fund and the University will provide funds for the expansion of the collection; the rare books and manuscript room will be altered to house it more fittingly. With this library and the growing collection of manuscript and printed material on Virginia and the South, it has been asserted, "the Alderman Library has become in the field of American history, a center of research of national scope".29 29. Ibid., XXVI, no. 9 (June-July 1938), pages 194-95. Apropos of the subject of rare imprints, the University of Virginia is co-operating in the national compilation of early American imprints in institutions and private hands under the directorship of Dr. Douglas C. McMurtrie of Chicago. During the process of recataloguing the University Library a card record of all such imprints is being made by student assistants under the National Youth Administration. The McGregor Collection has, of course, greatly augmented the number of items to be listed. This project is a part of the program undertaken by the Historical Records Survey of the Works Progress Administration. It is hoped that the imprint work can be begun in other Virginia libraries soon. The collection of old music, mentioned in the archivist's preceding report,30 30. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1936-37, page 9. has grown rapidly; some of it has been sorted and temporary author and composer cards made. The group of Confederate music imprints bids fair to become worthy of recognition outside Virginia and the South. How the music collection as a whole is to be catalogued is as yet undetermined. In 1936 the Historical Records Survey began its arduous task of listing all state and local archives of Virginia which the archivist of the University had undertaken previously to a limited extent.31 31. See First-Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-31 to 193536, passim. The University as sponsor of this WPA project has now published the first volume in this series—Inventory of the County Archives of Virginia, No. 21. Chesterfield County (viii, 229 pages). The text of the inventory is preceded by an historical sketch of the county, articles on uniformity, housing, care, and accessibility of the records, and an essay on "The Evolution of County Government in Virginia,' by the archivist. Detailed chronological and subject indexes facilitate the use of the volume. The state director of the HRS, Miss Elizabeth B. Parker, and her staff in the Richmond office are to be congratulated on their careful and thorough work of checking the detailed data and of editing the volume. That the series of which it is a part will contribute immeasurably to the better appreciation of Virginia's priceless archives and to the advancement of research, cannot be gainsaid. The Virginia State Library and the University Library have been designated as two of the ninety-odd depositories throughout the country for similar printed and mimeographed inventories from all states. As the University Library is only one of many agencies in Virginia fostering research and the interest of the general public in historical matters, so it continues to stress the value of co-operation toward a common goal. The preservation of historical materials and the intelligent administration of them in one library represent a gain for all which is multiplied when the cause of scholarship is the prime consideration.32 32. See J. C. Wyllie, An Appeal to the Women of Virginia to Assist in the Preservation of Historical Manuscripts [Charlottesville, Virginia, 1938] (leaflet). There will always be competition too, as long as librarians and their ilk are human, but institutions of learning depend upon one another so much to-day that they must ban rivalry of the cut-throat kind. Historical activity of a high calibre in Virginia, like that of the United States Park Service in the peninsula and elsewhere, the McCormick Historical Association in restoring part of the McCormick homestead, and the recent portrait exhibit in Abingdon by the Washington County Historical Society, is in evidence and warrants encouragement elsewhere by research libraries. In conclusion, grateful acknowledgments for material assistance in the year's work are extended with pleasure to Professor and Mrs. Carroll Mason Sparrow of the University, Mr. Ralph M. Brown of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Miss Ethel B. Baugh of Abingdon, Mr. W. E. MacClenny of Suffolk, and Mr. James M. Lewis of Tappahannock, Virginia. The countless favors of the University Library staff are always appreciated, and especially the daily counsel and encouragement of Librarian Harry Clemons. It is also a pleasure to announce the appointment of Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill as acting archivist for the year 1938-39 while the archivist is on leave. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist. 1 September 1938.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Senior Library Assistant Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts A CHECKLIST OF BOUND BUSINESS RECORDS IN THE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS OF THE ALDERMAN LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Business records are significant to the student of economics and sociology as well as to the historian. They tell the story of a large part of man's activity, and their preservation is therefore necessary to a complete understanding of his progress in the past. The records of past business enterprises are, moreover, essential to a proper knowledge of the place of business in contemporary society; and the lack of such knowledge may be unfortunate in an economic and sociological sense. The self-evident value of these records is sufficient reason for their preservation and for their availability for study in private and public institutions. The purpose of this inventory is to make more easily accessible the bound volumes of business records now in the University collections. In accordance with the original purpose of the archivist to survey the state's manuscript resources, and to encourage the preservation of manuscript materials in Virginia "representing every phase of economic and social life,"* * First Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-1931 (University, Va., 1931), page 2. considerable emphasis has been placed, in collecting materials for this library, upon economic records, which had been largely neglected among collections acquired before 1930. These consist in many cases of unbound manuscripts. As the work of calendaring progresses, their economic data will become increasingly available. The present inventory is concerned with the ledgers. Beginning in 1930, with the commencement of the archivist's inventory of manuscript materials in Virginia, the University's collection of business ledgers has expanded with the extension of that survey. As the archivist's work has extended among the counties, popular interest in the project has developed. Among the fruitful results of this has been an increasing number of deposits and gifts of manuscript material to this library, including the ledger records of business enterprises. Fifty Virginia counties are now represented in the ledger collections, which include a wide diversity of industries. Predominant in number, and quite possibly the most valuable of all,† † "There is also much to be learned about economic activity generally from small businesses, perhaps more than from the richer corporations, because, having smaller margins on which to make mistakes, they are more sensitive indicators of business conditions".—Oliver W. Holmes, "The Evaluation and Preservation of Business Archives", in The American Archivist, vol. I, no. 4 (Oct., 1938), page 181. Another interesting essay on business archives is Ralph M. Hower's "The Preservation of Business Records", Business Historical Society Bulletin, vol. XI, nos. 3-4 (Oct., 1937), pages 37-83. are the records of small rural firms. Chief among them are the account books of the "general store", dealing in everything from hog yokes to pulpits. Contrasting with these are the records of a modern "produce jobber", distributing Virginia's farm products to all the cities of the South. A substantial proportion of the collections record the history of the Virginia iron industry. The old water-powered grist mill and its modern counterpart are alike represented. There is much information also on such subjects as rural banking, varying farm practices, tobacco production and sale, the breeding of cattle and horses, and the uses and condition of slave labor. Through the whole may be perceived the gradual evolution from the agrarian economy of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to the industrial system prevailing today. Certain obvious limitations in the checklist may be noted. The omission of material in the form of loose manuscripts has already been indicated. In addition, however, to the actual ledgers included in this inventory, the University has obtained microfilm copies of many ledgers which still remain in private hands, the farm ledgers of the Burwells of Clarke County being a notable example. The microfilm work has been greatly facilitated by the improved equipment of the new library building; but as this report goes to press, the process of placing the business ledgers, which are now on negative film, on positives which may be used by readers is just being started. Somewhat arbitrary lines have been drawn as to what constitute business ledgers. All farm journals, and account books kept by physicians and lawyers have been included; but similar accounts kept by churches, religious organizations, clubs, etc., have been excluded, as have such records as books kept by sheriffs and other county officers exclusively in their official capacity. Records of land assessments have, however, been included, since they frequently provide material supplementary to that in the other ledgers. The form of the summary which follows is probably self-explanatory, but several definitions are perhaps in order. Ledger may be generally defined as a "book that lies permanently in some place".‡ ‡ Oxford Dictionary, James A. H. Murray, editor (New York, 1888). Among the now obsolescent meanings which emphasize the general nature of the word ledger, and its quality of permanency, are: scaffolding, breviary, angling, millstone, ambassador, tombstone, etc. In double-entry bookkeeping, it is the principal one of the books for recording mercantile transactions. It consists of a debit column on the left-hand page and a credit column on the right, and may contain several types of accounts, covering different branches of the dealer's business. The Journal, as its derivation shows, is a day book, in which entries are made chronologically. As here used it is a systematic chronological record in which entries are "journalized" from the simpler day book (i. e., "waste book" or "blotter") with a statement of the accounts to be debited or credited. Entries are made periodically, though not always daily. The Day Book is more important than the Journal in small business organizations, which frequently do not employ the intermediary Journal between the Day Book and the Ledger. Business transactions of every description are entered in the Day Book as they occur, without consideration of the accounts involved. In primitive business concerns where only one record is kept, there may be a somewhat elaborated form of day book, or a ledger which is itemized, rather than the usual ledger record with only totals. Other names used in the checklist are generally self-explanatory. "Negro Book", for example, is merely a day book kept for Negroes or Negro labor. The peculiar arrangement of the ledgers in groups is made necessary by the fact that many of the sets are privately owned, having been deposited here subject to withdrawal. This fact makes it impossible to number the individual volumes or to arrange the entire collection according to subject, even if this were wholly desirable. The privately owned groups are referred to by the name of the depositor, rather than by that of the original creator of the record. The hyphenated names given to the sets arise when the creator is multiple or from the addition of the name of the place of origin, to avoid occasional duplication, or the name of the person or family who originally created the record. Inclusive dates are substituted for numbers in referring to specific volumes. The descriptions cover "additional" records of a different date, or otherwise unlike the main entries in a volume. The obvious necessity of condensation, and the character of these mixed sets of account books have, of course, greatly restricted both precision and completeness. Brackets [ ], which enclose information supplied with reasonable certainty by the editor, disappear of necessity when a score or more of volumes are lumped together in a group, with only the earliest and latest dates given. Volumes are indexed only when it is specifically so stated. Virginia place names are generally enclosed in parentheses; all others are followed by the name of the state. It is worthy of note that a vast amount of local archival material is buried in the account books. The ledgers, many of which are indexed, contain thousands of names, which have a value quite apart from their business accounts (for a study of population, for example, in a local area).
