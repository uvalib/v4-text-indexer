      <field name="fulltext">TO I. E. ROSENBERG. You are anxious to obtain some knowledge of the history of Constantia Dudley. I am well acquainted with your motives, and allow that they justify your curiosity. I am willing, to the utmost of my power, to comply with your request, and will now dedicate what leisure I have to the composition of her story. My narrative will have little of that merit which flows from unity of design. You are desirous of hearing an authentic, and not a fictitious tale. It will, therefore, be my duty to relate events is no artificial or elaborate order, and without that harmonious congruity and luminous amplification, which might justly be displayed in a tale flowing merely from invention. It will be little more than a biographical sketch, in which the facts are distributed and amplified, not as a poetical taste would prescribe, but as the materials afforded me, sometimes abundant and sometimes scanty, would permit. Constantia, like all the beings made known to us, not by fancy, but experience, has numerous defects. You will readily perceive, that her tale is told by her friend, but I hope you will not discover many or glaring proofs of a disposition to extenuate her errors or falsify her character. Ormond will, perhaps, appear to you a contradictory or unintelligible being. I pretend not to the infallibility of inspiration. He is not a creature of fancy. It was not prudent to unfold all the means by which I gained a knowledge of his actions; but these means, though singularly fortunate and accurate, could not be unerring and complete. I have shown him to you as he appeared, on different occasions and at successive periods, to me. This is all that you will demand from a faithful biographer. If you were not deeply interested in the fate of my friend, yet my undertaking will not be useless, inasmuch as it will introduce you to scenes to which you have been hitherto a stranger. The modes of life, the influence of public events upon the character and happiness of individuals in America, are new to you. The distinctions of birth, the artificial degrees of esteem or contempt which connect themselves with different professions and ranks in your native country,* * Germany. are but little known among us. Society and manners constitute your favorite study, and I am willing to believe, that my relation will supply you with knowledge, on these heads, not to be otherwise obtained. If these details be, in that respect, unsatisfactory, all that I can add, is my counsel to go and examine for yourself. S. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1* ORMOND; OR THE SECRET WITNESS. CHAPTER I. Stephen Dudley was a native of New York. He was educated to the profession of a painter. His father's trade was that of an apothecary. But this son, manifesting an attachment to the pencil, he was resolved that it should be gratified. For this end Stephen was sent at an early age to Europe, and not only enjoyed the instructions of Fuzeli and Bartolozzi, but spent a considerable period in Italy, in studying the Augustan and Medicean monuments. It was intended that he should practice his art in his native city, but the young man, though reconciled to this scheme by deference to paternal authority, and by a sense of its propriety, was willing, as long as possible to postpone it. The liberality of his father relieved him from all pecuniary cares. His whole time was devoted to the improvement of his skill in his favorite art, and the enriching of his mind with every valuable accomplishment. He was endowed with a comprehensive genius and indefatigable industry. His progress was proportionably rapid, and he passed his time without much regard to futurity, being too well satisfied with the present to anticipate a change. A change however was unavoidable, and he was obliged at length to pay a reluctant obedience to his father's repeated summons. The death of his wife had rendered his society still more necessary to the old gentleman. He married before his return. The woman whom he had selected was an unportioned orphan, and was recommended merely by her moral qualities. These, however, were eminent, and secured to her, till the end of her life, the affection of her husband. Though painting was capable of fully gratifying his taste as matter of amusement, he quickly found that, in his new situation it would not answer the ends of a profession. His father supported himself by the profits of his shop, but with all his industry he could do no more than procure a subsistence for himself and his son. Till his father's death young Dudley attached himself to painting. His gains were slender but he loved the art, and his father's profession rendered his own exertions in a great degree superfluous. The death of the elder Dudley introduced an important change in his situation. It thenceforth became necessary to strike into some new path, to deny himself the indulgence of his inclinations, and regulate his future exertions by a view to nothing but gain. There was little room for choice. His habits had disqualified him for mechanical employments. He could not stoop to the imaginary indignity which attended them, nor spare the time necessary to obtain the requisite degree of skill. His father died in possession of some stock, and a sufficient portion of credit to supply its annual decays. He lived at what they call a good stand, and enjoyed a certain quantity of permanent custom. The knowledge that was required was as easily obtained as the elements of any other profession, and was not wholly unallied to the pursuits in which he had sometimes engaged. Hence he could not hesitate long in forming his resolution, but assumed the management of his father's concerns with a cheerful and determined spirit. The knowledge of his business was acquired in no long time. He was stimulated to the acquisition by a sense of duty, he was inured to habits of industry, and there were few things capable to resist a strenuous exertion of his faculties. Knowledge of whatever kind afforded a compensation to labor, but the task being finished, that which remained, which, in ordinary apprehensions would have been esteemed an easy and smooth path, was to him insupportably disgustful. The drudgery of a shop, where all the faculties were at a stand, and one day was an unvaried repetition of the foregoing, was too incongenial to his disposition not to be a source of discontent. This was an evil which it was the tendency of time to increase rather than diminish. The longer he endured it the less tolerable it became. He could not forbear comparing his present situation with his former, and deriving from the contrast perpetual food for melancholy. The indulgence of his father had contributed to instil into him prejudices, in consequence of which a certain species of disgrace was annexed to every employment of which the only purpose was gain. His present situation not only precluded all those pursuits which exalt and harmonize the feelings, but was detested by him as something humiliating and ignominious. His wife was of a pliant temper, and her condition less influenced by this change than that of her husband. She was qualified to be his comforter, but instead of dispelling his gloom by judicious arguments, or a seasonable example of vivacity, she caught the infection that preyed upon his mind and augmented his anxieties by partaking in them. By enlarging in some degree, the foundation on which his father had built, he had provided the means of a future secession, and might console himself with the prospect of enjoying his darling ease at some period of his life. This period was necessarily too remote for his wishes, and had not certain occurrences taken place, by which he was flattered with the immediate possession of ease, it is far from being certain that he would not have fallen a victim to his growing disquietudes. He was one morning engaged behind his counter as usual, when a youth came into his shop, and, in terms that bespoke the union of fearlessness and frankness, inquired whether he could be engaged as an apprentice. A proposal of this kind could not be suddenly rejected or adopted. He stood in need of assistance, the youth was manly and blooming, and exhibited a modest and ingenuous aspect. It was possible that he was, in every respect, qualified for the post for which he applied, but it was previously necessary to ascertain these qualifications. For this end he requested the youth to call at his house in the evening, when he should be at leisure to converse with him and furnished him with suitable directions. The youth came according to appointment. On being questioned as to his birth-place and origin, he stated that he was a native of Wakefield, in Yorkshire; that his family were honest, and his education not mean; that he was the eldest of many children, and having attained an age at which he conceived it his duty to provide for himself, he had, with the concurrence of his friends, come to America, in search of the means of independent subsistence; that he had just arrived in a ship which he named, and, his scanty stock of money being likely to be speedily consumed, this had been the first effort he had made to procure employment. His tale was circumstantial and consistent, and his veracity appeared liable to no doubt. He was master of his book and his pen, and had acquired more than the rudiments of Latin. Mr. Dudley did not require much time to deliberate. In a few days the youth was established as a member of his family, and as a coadjutor in his shop, nothing but food, clothing, and lodging being stipulated as the reward of his services. The young man improved daily in the good opinion of his master. His apprehension was quick, his sobriety invariable, and his application incessant. Though by no means presumptuous or arrogant, he was not wanting in a suitable degree of self-confidence. All his propensities appeared to concentre in his occupation and the promotion of his master's interest, from which he was drawn aside by no allurements of sensual or intellectual pleasure. In a short time he was able to relieve his master of most of the toils of his profession, and Mr. Dudley a thousand times congratulated himself on possessing a servant equally qualified by his talents and his probity. He gradually remitted his attention to his own concerns, and placed more absolute reliance on the fidelity of his dependant. Young Craig, that was the name of the youth, maintained a punctual correspondence with his family, and confided to his patron, not only copies of all the letters which he himself wrote, but those which, from time to time, he received. He had several correspondents, but the chief of those were his mother and his eldest sister. The sentiments contained in their letters breathed the most appropriate simplicity and tenderness, and flowed, with the nicest propriety, from the different relationships of mother and sister. The style and even the penmanship were distinct and characteristical. One of the first of these epistles was written by the mother to Mr. Dudley, on being informed by her son of his present engagement. It was dictated by that concern for the welfare of her child befitting the maternal character. Gratitude, for the ready acceptance of the youth's services, and for the benignity of his deportment towards him, a just representation of which had been received by her from the boy himself, was expressed with no inconsiderable elegance; as well as her earnest wishes that Mr. Dudley should extend to him not only the indulgence, but the moral superintendence of a parent. To this Mr. Dudley conceived it incumbent upon him to return a consenting answer, and letters were in this manner occasionally interchanged between them. Things remained in this situation for three years, during which period every day enhanced the reputation of Craig, for stability and integrity. A sort of provisional engagement had been made between the parents, unattended however by any legal or formal act, that things should remain on their present footing for three years. When this period terminated, it seemed as if a new engagement had become necessary. Craig expressed the utmost willingness to renew the former contract, but his master began to think that the services of his pupil merited a higher recompense. He ascribed the prosperity that had hitherto attended him, to the disinterested exertions of his apprentice. His social and literary gratifications had been increased by the increase of his leisure. These were capable of being still more enlarged. He had not yet acquired what he deemed a sufficiency, and could not therefore wholly relieve himself from the turmoils and humiliation of a professional life. He concluded that he should at once consult his own interest and perform no more than an act of justice to a faithful servant, by making Craig his partner, and allowing him a share of the profits, on condition of his discharging all the duties of the trade. When this scheme was proposed to Craig, he professed unbounded gratitude, considered all that he had done as amply rewarded by the pleasure of performance, and as being nothing more than was prescribed by his duty. He promised that this change in his situation should have no other effect, than to furnish new incitements to diligence and fidelity, in the promotion of an interest, which would then become, in a still higher degree than formerly, a common one. Mr. Dudley communicated his intention to Craig's mother, who, in addition to many grateful acknowledgments, stated that a kinsman of her son, had enabled him, in case of entering into partnership, to add a small sum to the common stock, and that, for this sum, Craig was authorized to draw upon a London banker. The proposed arrangement was speedily effected. Craig was charged with the management of all affairs, and Mr. Dudley retired to the enjoyment of still greater leisure. Two years elapsed, and nothing occurred to interrupt the harmony that subsisted between the partners. Mr. Dudley's condition might be esteemed prosperous. His wealth was constantly accumulating. He had nearly attained all that he wished, and his wishes still aimed at nothing less than splendid opulence. He had annually increased the permanent sources of his revenue. His daughter was the only survivor of many children, who perished in their infancy, before habit and maturity had rendered the parental tie difficult to break. This daughter had already exhibited proofs of a mind susceptible of high improvement, and the loveliness of her person promised to keep pace with her mental acquisitions. He charged himself with the care of her education, and found no weariness or satiety in this task that might not be amply relieved by the recreations of science and literature. He flattered himself that his career, which had hitherto been exempt from any considerable impediment, would terminate in tranquillity. Few men might, with more propriety, have discarded all apprehensions respecting futurity. Craig had several sisters and one brother, younger than himself. Mr. Dudley, desirous of promoting the happiness of this family, proposed to send for this brother, and have him educated to his own profession, insinuating to his partner that, at the time when the boy should have gained sufficient stability and knowledge, he himself might be disposed to relinquish the profession altogether, on terms particularly advantageous to the two brothers, who might thenceforth conduct their business jointly. Craig had been eloquent in praise of this lad, and his testimony had, from time to time, been confirmed by that of his mother and sister. He had often expressed his wishes for the prosperity of the lad, and when his mother had expressed her doubts as to the best method of disposing of him, modestly requested Mr. Dudley's advice on this head. The proposal, therefore, might be supposed to be particularly acceptable, and yet Craig expressed reluctance to concur with it. This reluctance was accompanied with certain tokens which sufficiently showed whence it arose. Craig appeared unwilling to increase those obligations under which he already labored. His sense of gratitude was too acute to allow him to heighten it by the reception of new benefits. It might be imagined that this objection would be easily removed; but the obstinacy of Craig's opposition was invincible. Mr. Dudley could not relinquish a scheme to which no stronger objection could be made. And, since his partner could not be prevailed upon to make this proposal to the friends of the lad, he was determined to do it himself. He maintained an intercourse by letters with several of those friends which he formed in his youth. One of them usually resided in London. From him he received about this time, a letter, in which, among other information, the writer mentioned his intention of setting out on a tour through Yorkshire and the Scottish highlands. Mr. Dudley thought this a suitable opportunity for executing his design in favor of young Craig. He entertained no doubts about the worth and condition of this family, but was still desirous of obtaining some information on this head from one who would pass through this town where they resided, who would examine with his own eyes, and on whose discernment and integrity he could place an implicit reliance. He concealed this intention from his partner, and entrusted his letter to a friend who was just embarking for Europe. In due season he received an answer, confirming, in all respects, Craig's representations, but informing him that the lad had been lately disposed of in a way not equally advantageous with that which Mr. Dudley had proposed, but such as would not admit of change. If doubts could possibly be entertained respecting the character and views of Craig, this evidence would have dispelled them. But plans however skilfully contrived, if founded on imposture, cannot fail of being sometimes detected. Craig had occasion to be absent from the city for some weeks. Meanwhile a letter had been left at his lodgings by one who merely inquired if that were the dwelling of Mr. Dudley, and being answered by the servant in the affirmative, left the letter without farther parley. It was superscribed with a name unknown to any of the family, and in a hand which its badness rendered almost illegible. The servant placed it in a situation to be seen by his master. Mr. Dudley allowed it to remain unopened for a considerable time. At length, deeming it excusable to discover, by any means, the person to whom it was addressed, he ventured to unseal it. It was dated at Portsmouth in New-Hampshire. The signature was Mary Mansfield. It was addressed to her son, and was a curious specimen of illiterateness. Mary herself was unable to write, as she reminds her son, and had therefore procured the assistance of Mrs. Dewitt, for whose family she washed. The amanuensis was but little superior in the arts of penmanship to her principal. The contents of the epistle were made out with some difficulty. This was the substance of it. Mary reproaches her son for deserting her, and letting five years pass away without allowing her to hear from him. She informed him of her distresses as they flowed from sickness and poverty, and were aggravated by the loss of her son who was so handsome and promising a lad. She related her marriage with Zekel Hackney, who first brought her tidings of her boy. He was master, it seems, of a fishing smack, and voyaged sometimes to New-York. In one of his visits to this city, he met a mighty spry young man, in whom he thought he recognized his wife's son. He had traced him to the house of Mr. Dudley, and on inquiry, discovered that the lad resided here. On his return he communicated the tidings to his spouse, who had now written to reproach him for his neglect of his poor old mother, and to intreat his assistance to relieve her from the necessity of drudging for her livelihood. This letter was capable of an obvious construction. It was, no doubt, founded in mistake, though, it was to be acknowledged, that the mistake was singular. Such was the conclusion immediately formed by Mr. Dudley. He quietly replaced the letter on the mantelpiece, where it had before stood, and dismissed the affair from his thoughts. 2 Next day Craig returned from his journey. Mr. Dudley was employed in examining some papers in a desk that stood behind the door, in the apartment in which the letter was placed. There was no other person in the room when Craig entered it. He did not perceive Mr. Dudley, who was screened from observation, by his silence and by an open door. As soon as he entered, Mr. Dudley looked at him, and made no haste to speak. The letter whose superscription was turned towards him, immediately attracted Craig's attention. He seized it with some degree of eagerness, and observing the broken seal, thrust it hastily into his pocket, muttering, at the same time, in a tone, betokening a mixture of consternation and anger, "Damn it."—He immediately left the room, still uninformed of the presence of Mr. Dudley, who began to muse, with some earnestness, on what he had seen. Soon after he left this room and went into another, in which the family usually sat. In about twenty minutes, Craig made his appearance with his usual freedom and plausibility. Complimentary and customary topics were discussed. Mrs. Dudley and her daughter were likewise present. The uneasiness which the incident just mentioned had occasioned in the mind of Mr. Dudley, was at first dispelled by the disembarrassed behavior of his partner, but new matter of suspicion was speedily afforded him. He observed that his partner spoke of his present entrance as of the first since his arrival, and that when the lady mentioned that he had been the subject of a curious mistake, a letter being directed to him by a strange name, and left there during his absence, he pretended total ignorance of the circumstance. The young lady was immediately directed by her mother to bring the letter which lay, she said, on the mantel-tree in the next room. During this scene Mr. Dudley was silent. He anticipated the disappointment of the messenger, believing the letter to have been removed. What then was his surprise when the messenger returned bearing the letter in her hand! Craig examined and read it, and commented, with great mirth, on the contents, acting, all the while, as if he had never seen it before. These appearances were not qualified to quiet suspicion. The more Dudley brooded over them, the more dissatisfied he became. He, however, concealed his thoughts as well from Craig himself as his family, impatiently waiting for some new occurrence to arise by which he might square his future proceedings. During Craig's absence, Mrs. Dudley had thought this a proper occasion for cleaning his apartment. The furniture, and among the rest, a large chest strongly fastened, was removed into an adjoining room which was otherwise unoccupied, and which was usually kept locked. When the cleansing was finished, the furniture was replaced, except this trunk, which its bulk, the indolence of the servant, and her opinion of its uselessness, occasioned her to leave in the closet. About a week after this, on a Saturday evening, Craig invited to sup with him a friend, who was to embark, on the ensuing Monday, for Jamaica. During supper, at which the family were present, the discourse turned on the voyage on which the guest was about to enter. In the course of talk, the stranger expressed how much he stood in need of a strong and commodious chest, in which he might safely deposit his clothes and papers. Not being apprized of the early departure of the vessel, he had deferred till it was too late, applying to an artisan. Craig desired him to set himself at rest on that head, for that he had, in his possession, just such a trunk as he described. It was of no use to him, being long filled with nothing better than refuse and lumber, and that, if he would, be might send for it the next morning. He turned to Mrs. Dudley and observed, that the trunk to which he alluded was in her possession, and he would thank her to direct its removal into his own apartment, that he might empty it of its present contents, and prepare it for the service of his friend. To this she readily assented. There was nothing mysterious in this affair, but the mind of Mr. Dudley was pained with doubts. He was now as prone to suspect, as he was formerly disposed to confidence. This evening he put the key of the closet in his own pocket. When inquired for the next day, it was, of course, missing. It could not be found on the most diligent search. The occasion was not of such moment as to justify breaking the door. Mr. Dudley imagined that he saw, in Craig, more uneasiness at this disappointment, than he was willing to express. There was no remedy. The chest remained where it was, and, next morning, the ship departed on her voyage. Craig accompanied his friend on board, was prevailed upon to go to sea with him, designing to return with the pilotboat, but when the pilot was preparing to leave the vessel, such was this man's complaisance to the wishes of his friend, that he concluded to perform the remainder of the voyage in his company. The consequences are easily seen. Craig had gone with a resolution of never returning. The unhappy Dudley was left to deplore the total ruin of his fortune which had fallen a prey to the arts of a subtle imposter. The chest was opened, and the part which Craig had been playing for some years, with so much success, was perfectly explained. It appeared that the sum which Craig had contributed to the common stock, when first admitted into partnership, had been previously purloined from the daily receipts of his shop, of which an exact register was kept. Craig had been so indiscreet as to preserve this accusing record, and it was discovered in this depository. He was the son of Mary Mansfield, and a native of Portsmouth. The history of the Wakefield family, specious and complicated as it was, was entirely fictitious. The letters had been forged, and the correspondence supported by his own dexterity. Here was found the letter which Mr. Dudley had written to his friend requesting him to make certain inquiries at Wakefield, and which he imagined that he had delivered with his own hands to a trusty bearer. Here was the original draught of the answer he received. The manner in which this stratagem had been accomplished came gradually to light. The letter which was written to the Yorkshire traveller had been purloined, and another, with a similar superscription, in which the hand of Dudley was exactly imitated, and containing only brief and general remarks, had been placed in its stead. Craig must have suspected its contents, and by this suspicion have been incited to the theft. The answer which the Englishman had really written, and which sufficiently corresponded with the forged letter, had been intercepted by Craig, and furnished him a model from which he might construct an answer adapted to his own purposes. This imposture had not been sustained for a trivial purpose. He had embezzled a large share of the stock, and had employed the credit of the house to procure extensive remittances to be made to an agent at a distance, by whom the property was effectually secured. Craig had gone to participate these spoils, while the whole estate of Mr. Dudley was insufficient to pay the demands that were consequently made upon him. It was his lot to fall into the grasp of men, who squared their actions by no other standard than law, and who esteemed every claim to be incontestibly just, that could plead that sanction. They did not indeed throw him into prison. When they had despoiled him of every remnant of his property, they deemed themselves entitled to his gratitude for leaving his person unmolested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Thus in a moment was this man thrown from the summit of affluence to the lowest indigence. He had been habituated to independence and ease. This reverse, therefore, was the harder to bear. His present situation was much worse than at his father's death. Then he was sanguine with youth and glowing with health. He possessed a fund on which he could commence his operations. Materials were at hand, and nothing was wanted but skill to use them. Now he had advanced in life. His frame was not exempt from infirmity. He had so long reposed on the bosom of opulence and enjoyed the respect attendant on wealth, that he felt himself totally incapacitated for a new station. His misfortune had not been foreseen. It was embittered by the consciousness of his own imprudence, and by recollecting that the serpent which had stung him, was nurtured in his own bosom. It was not merely frugal fare and an humble dwelling to which he was condemned. The evils to be dreaded were beggary and contempt. Luxury and leisure were not merely denied him. He must bend all his efforts to procure clothing and food, to preserve his family from nakedness and famine. His spirit would not brook dependence. To live upon charity, or to take advantage of the compassion of 2* his friends, was a destiny far worse than any other. To this therefore he would not consent. However irksome and painful it might prove, he determined to procure his bread by the labor of his hands. But to what scene or kind of employment should he betake himself? He could not endure to exhibit this reverse of fortune on the same theatre which had witnessed his prosperity. One of his first measures was to remove from New York to Philadelphia. How should he employ himself in his new abode? Painting, the art in which he was expert, would not afford him the means of subsistence. Though no despicable musician, he did not esteem himself qualified to be a teacher of this art. This profession, besides, was treated by his new neighbors, with general, though unmerited contempt. There were few things on which he prided himself more than on the facilities and elegancies of his penmanship. He was besides well acquainted with arithmetic and accompting. He concluded therefore, to offer his services as a writer in a public office. This employment demanded little bodily exertion. He had spent much of his time at the book and the desk; his new occupation, therefore, was further recommended by its resemblance to his ancient modes of life. The first situation of this kind, for which he applied, he obtained. The duties were constant, but not otherwise toilsome or arduous. The emoluments were slender, but by contracting, within limits as narrow as possible, his expenses, they could be made subservient to the mere purposes of subsistence. He hired a small house in the suburbs of the city. It consisted of a room above and below, and a kitchen. His wife, daughter, and one girl, composed its inhabitants. As long as his mind was occupied in projecting and executing these arrangements, it was diverted from uneasy contemplations. When his life became uniform, and day followed day in monotonous succession, and the novelty of his employment had disappeared, his cheerfulness began likewise to fade, and was succeeded by unconquerable melancholy. His present condition was in every respect the contrast of his former. His servitude was intolerable. He was associated with sorded hirelings, gross and uneducated, who treated his age with rude familiarity, and insulted his ears with ribaldry and scurril jests. He was subject to command, and had his portion of daily drudgery allotted to him, to be performed for a pittance no more than would buy the bread which he daily consumed. The task assigned him was technical and formal. He was perpetually encumbered with the rubbish of law, and waded with laborious steps through its endless tautologies, its impertinent circuities, its lying assertions, and hateful artifices. Nothing occurred to relieve or diversify the scene. It was one tedious round of scrawling and jargon; a tissue made up of the shreds and remnants of barbarous antiquity, polluted with the rust of ages, and patched by the stupidity of modern workmen, into new deformity. When the day's task was finished, jaded spirits, and a body enfeebled by reluctant application, were but little adapted to domestic enjoyments. These indeed were incompatible with a temper like his, to whom the privation of the comforts that attended his former condition, was equivalent to the loss of life. These privations were still more painful to his wife, and her death added one more calamity to those under which he already groaned. He had always loved her with the tenderest affection, and he justly regarded this evil as surpassing all his former woes. But his destiny seemed never weary of persecuting him. It was not enough that he should fall a victim to the most atrocious arts, that he should wear out his days in solitude and drudgery, that he should feel not only the personal restraints and hardships attendant upon indigence, but the keener pangs that result from negligence and contumely. He was imperfectly recovered from the shock occasioned by the death of his wife, when his sight was invaded by a cataract. Its progress was rapid, and terminated in total blindness. He was now disabled from pursuing his usual occupation. He was shut out from the light of heaven, and debarred of every human comfort. Condemned to eternal dark, and worse than the helplessness of infancy, he was dependent for the meanest offices on the kindness of others, and he who had formerly abounded in the gifts of fortune, thought only of ending his days in a gaol or an almshouse. His situation however was alleviated by one circumstance. He had a daughter, whom I have formerly mentioned, as the only survivor of many children. She was sixteen years of age when the storm of adversity fell upon her father's house. It may be thought that one educated as she had been, in the gratification of all her wishes, and at an age of timidity and inexperience, would have been less fitted than her father for encountering misfortune; and yet, when the task of comforter fell upon her, her strength was not found wanting. Her fortitude was immediately put to the test. This reverse did not only affect her obliquely, and through the medium of her family, but directly, and in one way usually very distressful to female feelings. Her fortune and character had attracted many admirers. One of them had some reason to flatter himself with success. Miss Dudley's notions had little in common with those around her. She had learned to square her conduct, in a considerable degree, not by the hasty impulses of inclination, but by the dictates of truth. She yielded nothing to caprice or passion. Not that she was perfectly exempt from intervals of weakness, or from the necessity of painful struggles, but these intervals were transient, and these struggles always successful. She was no stranger to the pleadings of love, from the lips of others, and in her own bosom, but its tumults were brief, and speedily gave place to quiet thoughts and steadfast purposes. She had listened to the solicitations of one, not unworthy in himself, and amply recommended by the circumstances of family and fortune. He was young, and therefore impetuous. Of the good that he sought, he was not willing to delay the acquisition for a moment. She had been taught a very different lesson. Marriage included vows of irrevocable affection and obedience. It was a contract to endure for life. To form this connexion in extreme youth, before time had unfolded and modelled the characters of the parties, was, in her opinion, a proof of pernicious and opprobrious temerity. Not to perceive the propriety of delay in this case, or to be regardless of the motives that would enjoin upon us a deliberate procedure, furnished an unanswerable objection to any man's pretensions. She was sensible, however, that this, like other mistakes, was curable. If her arguments failed to remove it, time, it was likely, would effect this purpose. If she rejected a matrimonial proposal for the present, it was for reasons that might not preclude her future acceptance of it. Her scruples, in the present case, did not relate to the temper, or person, or understanding of her lover, but to his age, to the imperfectness of their acquaintance, and to the want of that permanence of character which can flow only from the progress of time and knowledge. These objections, which so rarely exist, were conclusive with her. There was no danger of her relinquishing them in compliance with the remonstrances of parents and the solicitations of her lover, though the one and the other were urged with all the force of authority and insinuation. The prescriptions of duty were too clear to allow her to hesitate and waver, but the consciousness of rectitude could not secure her from temporary vexations. Her parents were blemished with some of the frailties of that character. They held themselves entitled to prescribe in this article, but they forbore to exert their power. They condescended to persuade, but it was manifest, that they regarded their own conduct as a relaxation of right; and, had not the lover's importunities suddenly ceased, it is not possible to tell how far the happiness of Miss Dudley might have been endangered. The misfortunes of her father were no sooner publicly known, than the youth forbore his visits, and embarked on a voyage which he had long projected, but which had been hitherto delayed by a superior regard to the interests of his passion. It must be allowed that the lady had not foreseen this event. She had exercised her judgment upon his character, and had not been deceived. Before this desertion, had it been clearly stated to her apprehension, she would have readily admitted it to be probable. She knew the fascination of wealth, and the delusiveness of self-confidence. She was superior to the folly of supposing him exempt from sinister influences, and deaf to the whispers of ambition, and yet the manner in which she was affected by this event, convinced her that her heart had a larger share than her reason in dictating her expectations. Yet it must not be supposed that she suffered any very acute distress on this account. She was grieved less for her own sake than his. She had no design of entering into marriage, in less than seven years from this period. Not a single hope, relative to her own condition, had been frustrated. She had only been mistaken in her favorable conceptions of another. He had exhibited less constancy and virtue than her heart had taught her to expect. With those opinions, she could devote herself, with a single heart, to the alleviation of her parents' sorrows. This change in her condition she treated lightly, and retained her cheerfulness unimpaired. This happened because, in a rational estimate, and so far as it affected herself, the misfortune was slight, and because her dejection would only tend to augment the disconsolateness of her parents, while, on the other hand, her serenity was calculated to infuse the same confidence into them. She indulged herself in no fits of exclamation or moodiness. She listened in silence to their invectives and laments, and seized every opportunity that offered to inspire them with courage, to set before them the good, as well as ill, to which they were reserved, to suggest expedients for improving their condition, and to soften the asperities of his new mode of life, to her father, by every species of blandishment and tenderness. She refused no personal exertion to the common benefit. She incited her father to diligence, as well by her example, as by her exhortations; suggested plans, and superintended or assisted in the execution of them. The infirmities of sex and age vanished before the motives to courage and activity flowing from her new situation. When settled in his new abode, and profession, she began to deliberate what conduct was incumbent on herself, how she might participate, with her father, the burthen of the common maintenance, and blunt the edge of this calamity by the resources of a powerful and cultivated mind. In the first place, she disposed of every superfluous garb and trinket. She reduced her wardrobe to the plainest and cheapest establishment. By this means alone, she supplied her father's necessities with a considerable sum. Her music and even her books were not spared, not from the slight esteem in which these were held by her, but because she was thenceforth to become an economist of time as well as of money, because musical instruments are not necessary to the practice of this art in its highest perfection, and because, books, when she should procure leisure to read, or money to purchase them, might be obtained in a cheaper and more commodious form, than those costly and splendid volumes, with which her father's munificence had formerly supplied her. To make her expenses as limited as possible, was her next care. For this end she assumed the province of cook, the washing of house and clothes, and the cleansing of furniture. Their house was small, the family consisted of no more than four persons, and all formality and expensiveness were studiously discarded, but her strength was unequal to unavoidable tasks. A vigorous constitution could not supply the place of laborious habits, and this part of her plan must have been changed for one less frugal. The aid of a servant must have been hired, if it had not been furnished by gratitude. Some years before this misfortune, her mother had taken under her protection a girl, the daughter of a poor woman, who subsisted by labour, and who dying, left this child without friend or protector. This girl possessed no very improvable capacity, and therefore, could not benefit by the benevolent exertions of her young mistress as much as the latter desired, but her temper was artless and affectionate, and she attached herself to Constantia with the most entire devotion. In this change of fortune she would not consent to be separated, and Miss Dudley, influenced by her affection to her Lucy, and reflecting that on the whole it was most to her advantage to share with her, at once, her kindness and her poverty, retained her as her companion. With this girl she shared the domestic duties, scrupling not to divide with her the meanest and most rugged, as well as the lightest offices. This was not all. She, in the next place, considered whether her ability extended no farther than to save. Could she not by the employment of her hands increase the income as well as diminish the expense? Why should she be precluded from all lucrative occupation? She soon came to a resolution. She was mistress of her needle, and this skill she conceived herself bound to employ for her own subsistence. Clothing is one of the necessaries of human existence. The art of the tailor is scarcely of less use than that of the tiller of the ground. There are few the gains of which are better merited, and less injurious to the principles of human society. She resolved therefore to become a workwoman, and to employ in this way, the leisure she possessed from household avocations. To this scheme she was obliged to reconcile not only herself but her parents. The conquest of their prejudices was no easy task, but her patience and skill finally succeeded, and she procured needle work in sufficient quantity to enable her to enhance in no trivial degree, the common fund. It is one thing barely to comply with the urgencies of the case, and to do that which, in necessitous circumstances is best. But to conform with grace and cheerfulness, to yield no place to fruitless recriminations and repinings, to contract the evils into as small a compass as possible, and extract from our condition all possible good, is a task of a different kind. Mr. Dudley's situation required from him frugality and diligence. He was regular and unintermitted in his application to his pen. He was frugal. His slender income was administered agreeably to the maxims of his daughter; but he was unhappy. He experienced in its full extent the bitterness of disappointment. He gave himself up for the most part to a listless melancholy. Sometimes his impatience would produce effects less excusable; and conjure up an accusing and irascible spirit. His wife and even his daughter he would make the objects of peevish and absurd reproaches. These were moments when her heart drooped indeed, and her tears could not be restrained from flowing. These fits were transitory and rare, and when they had passed, the father seldom failed to mingle tokens of contrition and repentance with the tears of his daughter. Her arguments and soothings were seldom disappointed of success. Her mother's disposition was soft and pliant, but she could not accommodate herself to the necessity of her husband's affairs. She was obliged to endure the want of some indulgences, but she reserved to herself the liberty of complaining, and to subdue this spirit in her was found utterly impracticable. She died a victim to discontent. This event deepened the gloom that shrouded the soul of her father, and rendered the task of consolation still more difficult. She did not despair. Her sweetness and patience was invincible by any thing that had already happened, but her fortitude did not exceed the standard of human nature. Evils now began to menace her, to which it is likely she would have yielded, had not their approach been intercepted by an evil of a different kind. The pressure of grief is sometimes such as to prompt us to seek a refuge in voluntary death. We must lay aside the burthen which we cannot sustain. If thought degenerate into a vehicle of pain, what remains but to destroy that vehicle? For this end, death is the obvious, but not the only, or morally speaking, the worst means. There is one method of obtaining the bliss of forgetfulness, in comparison with which suicide is innocent. The strongest mind is swayed by circumstances. There is no firmness of integrity, perhaps, able to repel every species of temptation, which is produced by the present constitution of human affairs, and yet temptation is successful, chiefly by virtue of its gradual and invisible approaches. We rush into danger, because we are not aware of its existence, and have not therefore provided the means of safety, and the dæmon that seizes us is hourly reinforced by habit. Our opposition grows fainter in proportion as our adversary acquires new strength, and the man becomes enslaved by the most sordid vices, whose fall would, at a former period, have been deemed impossible, or who would have been imagined liable to any species of depravity, more than to this. Mr. Dudley's education had entailed upon him many errors, yet who would have supposed it possible for him to be enslaved by a depraved appetite; to be enamoured of low debauchery, and to grasp at the happiness that intoxication had to bestow? This was a mournful period in Constantia's history. My feelings will not suffer me to dwell upon it. I cannot describe the manner in which she was affected by the first symptoms of this depravity, the struggles which she made to counteract this dreadful infatuation, and the grief which she experienced from the repeated miscarriage of her efforts. I will not detail her various expedients for this end, the appeals which she made to his understanding, to his sense of honor and dread of infamy, to the gratitude to which she was entitled, and to the injunctions of parental duty. I will not detail his fits of remorse, 3 his fruitless penitence, and continual relapses, nor depict the heart-breaking scenes of uproar and violence, and foul disgrace that accompained his paroxysms of drunkenness. The only intellectual amusement which this lady allowed herself was writing. She enjoyed one distant friend, with whom she maintained an uninterrupted correspondence, and to whom she confided a circumstantial and copious relation of all these particulars. That friend is the writer of these memoirs. It is not impossible but that these letters may be communicated to the world, at some future period. The picture which they exhibit is hourly exemplified and realized, though, in the many colored scenes of human life, none surpasses it in disastrousness and horror. My eyes almost wept themselves dry over this part of her tale. In this state of things Mr. Dudley's blindness might justly be accounted, even in its immediate effects, a fortunate event. It dissolved the spell, by which he was bound, and which, it is probable, would never have been otherwise broken. It restored him to himself and showed him, with a distinctness which made him shudder, the gulf to which he was hastening. But nothing can compensate to the sufferer the evils of blindness. It was the business of Constantia's life to alleviate those sufferings, to cherish and console her father, and to rescue him, by the labor of her hands from dependence on public charity. For this end, her industry and solicitude were never at rest. She was able, by that industry, to provide him and herself with necessaries. Their portion was scanty, and, if it sometimes exceeded the standard of their wants, not less frequently fell short of it. For all her toils and disquietudes she esteemed herself fully compensated by the smiles of her father. He indeed could seldom be prompted to smile, or to suppress the dictates of that despair which flowed from his sense of this new calamity, and the aggravations of hardship, which his recent insobrieties had occasioned to his daughter. She purchased what books her scanty stock would allow, and borrowed others. These she read to him when her engagements would permit. At other times she was accustomed to solace herself with her own music. The lute which her father had purchased in Italy, and which had been disposed of among the rest of his effects, at public sale, had been gratuitously restored to him by the purchaser, on condition of his retaining it in his possession. His blindness and inoccupation now broke the long silence to which this instrument had been condemned, and afforded an accompaniment to the young lady's voice. Her chief employment was conversation. She resorted to this as the best means of breaking the monotony of the scene; but this purpose was not only accomplished, but other benefits of the highest value accrued from it. The habits of a painter eminently tended to vivify and make exact her father's conceptions and delineations of visible objects. The sphere of his youthful observation comprised more ingredients of the picturesque, than any other sphere. The most precious materials of the moral history of mankind, are derived from the revolutions of Italy. Italian features and landscape constitute the chosen field of the artist. No one had more carefully explored this field than Mr. Dudley. His time, when abroad, had been divided between residence at Rome, and excursions to Calabria and Tuscany. Few impressions were effaced from his capacious register, and these were now rendered by his eloquence, nearly as conspicuous to his companion as to himself. She was imbued with an ardent thirst of knowledge, and by the acuteness of her remarks, and the judiciousness of her inquiries, reflected back upon his understanding as much improvement as she received. These efforts to render his calamity tolerable, and inure him to the profiting by his own resources, were aided by time, and, when reconciled by habit to unrespited gloom, he was, sometimes, visited by gleams of cheerfulness, and drew advantageous comparisons between his present and former situation. A stillness not unakin to happiness, frequently diffused itself over their winter evenings. Constantia enjoyed, in their full extent, the felicities of health and self-approbation. The genius and eloquence of her father, nourished by perpetual exercise, and undiverted from its purpose by the intrusion of visible objects, frequently afforded her a delight in comparison with which all other pleasures were mean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. This period of tranquillity was short. Poverty hovered at their threshold, and in a state precarious as their's, could not be long excluded. The lady was more accustomed to anticipate good than evil, but she was not unconscious that the winter, which was hastening, would bring with it numerous inconveniences. Wants during that season are multiplied, while the means of supplying them either fail or are diminished. Fuel is alone, a cause of expense equal to all other articles of subsistence. Her dwelling was old, crazy, and full of avenues to air. It was evident that neither fire nor clothing would, in an habitation like that, attemper the chilling blasts. Her scanty gains were equal to their needs, during summer, but would probably fall short during the prevalence of cold. These reflections could not fail sometimes to intrude. She indulged them as long as they served merely to suggest expedients and provisions for the future, but labored to call away her attention when they merely produced anxiety. This she more easily effected, as some months of summer were still to come, and her knowledge of the vicissitudes to which human life is subject, taught her to rely upon the occurrence of some fortunate, though unforeseen event. Accident suggested an expedient of this kind. Passing through an alley, in the upper part of the town, her eye was caught by a label on the door of a small house, signifying that it was to be let. It was smaller than that she at present occupied, but it had an aspect of much greater comfort and neatness. Its situation, near the centre of the city, in a quiet, cleanly, and well paved alley, was far preferable to that of her present habitation, in the suburbs, scarcely accessible in winter, for pools and gulleys, and in a neighborhood abounding with indigence and profligacy. She likewise considered that the rent of this might be less, and that the proprietor of this might have more forbearance and benignity than she had hitherto met with. Unconversant as she was with the world, imbued with the timidity of her sex and her youth, many enterprises were arduous to her, which would, to age and experience, have been easy. Her reluctances, however, when required by necessity, were overcome, and all the measures which her situation prescribed, executed with address and despatch. One, marking her deportment, would have perceived nothing but dignity and courage. He would have regarded these as the fruits of habitual independence and exertion, whereas they were merely the results of clear perceptions and inflexible resolves. The proprietor of this mansion was immediately sought out, and a bargain, favorable as she could reasonably desire, concluded. Possession was to be taken in a week. For this end carters and draymen were to be engaged, household implements to be prepared for removal, and negligence and knavery prevented by scrupulous attention. The duties of superintendence and execution devolved upon her. Her father's blindness rendered him powerless. His personal ease required no small portion of care. Household and professional functions were not to be omitted. She stood alone in the world. There was none whose services or counsel she could claim. Tortured by multiplicity of cares, shrinking from exposure to rude eyes, and from contention with refractory and insolent spirits, and overpowered with fatigue and disgust, she was yet compelled to retain a cheerful tone in her father's presence, and to struggle with his regrets and his peevishness. O my friend! Methinks I now see thee, encountering the sneers and obstinacy of the meanest of mankind, subjecting that frame of thine, so exquisitely delicate, and therefore so feeble, to the vilest drudgery. I see thee, leading thy unhappy father to his new dwelling, and stifling the sighs produced by his fruitless repinings and unseasonable scruples— Why was I not partaker of thy cares and labors? Why was I severed from thee by the ocean, and kept in ignorance of thy state? I was not without motives to anxiety, for I was friendless as thou, but how unlike to thine was my condition! I reposed upon down and tissue, never moved but with obsequious attendance and pompous equipage, painting and music were consolations ever at hand, and my cabinet was stored with poetry and science. These, indeed, were insufficient to exclude care, and with regard to the past, I have no wish but that I had shared with my friend her toilsome 3* and humiliating lot. However an erroneous world might judge, thy life was full of dignity, and thy moments of happiness not few, since happiness is only attendant on the performance of our duty. A toilsome and sultry week was terminated by a sabbath of repose. Her new dwelling possessed indisputable advantages over her old. Not the least of these benefits consisted in the vicinity of people, peaceable and honest, though poor. She was no longer shocked by the clamors of debauchery, and exposed, by her situation, to the danger of being mistaken by the profligate of either sex, for one of their own class. It was reasonable to consider this change of abode, as fortunate, and yet, circumstances quickly occurred which suggested a very different conclusion. She had no intercourse, which necessity did not prescribe, with the rest of the world. She screened herself as much as possible from intercourse with prying and loquacious neighbors. Her father's inclination in this respect coincided with her own, though their love of seclusion was prompted by different motives. Visitants were hated by the father, because his dignity was hurt by communication with the vulgar. The daughter set too much value upon time willingly to waste it upon trifles and triflers. She had no pride to subdue, and therefore never escaped from well meant importunity at the expense of politeness and good humor. In her moments of leisure, she betook herself to the poet and the moralist for relief. She could not at all times, suppress the consciousness of the evils which surrounded and threatened her. She could not but rightly estimate the absorbing and brutifying nature of that toil to which she was condemned. Literature had hitherto been regarded as her solace. She knew that meditation and converse as well as books and the pen, are instruments of knowledge, but her musing thoughts were too often fixed upon her own condition. Her father's soaring moods and luminous intervals grew less frequent. Conversation was too rarely abstracted from personal considerations, and strayed less often than before into the wilds of fancy or the mazes of analysis. These circumstances led her to reflect whether subsistence might not be obtained by occupations purely intellectual. Instruction was needed by the young of both sexes. Females frequently performed the office of teachers. Was there no branch of her present knowledge which she might claim wages for imparting to others? Was there no art within her reach to acquire, convertible into means of gain? Women are generally limited to what is sensual and ornamental. Music and painting, and the Italian and French languages, are bounds which they seldom pass. In these pursuits it is not possible, nor is it expected, that they should arrive at the skill of adepts. The education of Constantia had been regulated by the peculiar views of her father, who sought to make her, not alluring and voluptuous, but eloquent and wise. He therefore limited her studies to Latin and English. Instead of familiarizing her with the amorous effusions of Petrarcha and Racine, he made her thoroughly conversant with Tacitus and Milton. Instead of making her a practical musician or pencilist, he conducted her to the school of Newton and Hartley, unveiled to her the mathematical properties of light and sound, taught her as a metaphysician and anatomist, the structure and power of the senses, and discussed with her the principles and progress of human society. These accomplishments tended to render her superior to the rest of women, but in no degree qualified her for the post of a female instructer. She saw and lamented her deficiencies, and gradually formed the resolution of supplying them. Her knowledge of the Latin tongue and of grammatical principles, rendered easy the acquisition of Italian and French, these being merely scions from the Roman stock. Having had occasion, previous to her change of dwelling, to purchase paper at a bookseller's, the man had offered her at a very low price, a second-hand copy of Veneroni's grammar. The offer had been declined, her views at that time being otherwise directed. Now, however, this incident was remembered, and a resolution instantly formed to purchase the book. As soon as the light declined, and her daily task at the needle had drawn to a close, she set out to execute this purpose. Arriving at the house of the bookseller, she perceived that the doors and windows were closed. Night having not yet arrived, the conjecture easily occurred, that some one had died in the house. She had always dealt with this man for books and paper, and had always been treated with civility. Her heart readily admitted some sympathy with his distress, and to remove her doubts, she turned to a person who stood at the entrance of the next house, and who held a cloth steeped in vinegar to his nostrils. In reply to her question, the stranger said in a tone of the deepest consternation—Mr. Watson do you mean? He is dead; he died last night of the yellow fever. The name of this disease was not absolutely new to her ears. She had been apprised of its rapid and destructive progress in one quarter of the city, but, hitherto, it had existed, with regard to her, chiefly in the form of rumor. She had not realized the nature or probable extent of the evil. She lived at no great distance from the seat of the malady, but her neighborhood had been hitherto exempt. So wholly unused was she to contemplate pestilence, except at a distance, that its actual existence in the bosom of this city was incredible. Contagious diseases, she well knew, periodically visited and laid waste the Greek and Egyptian cities. It constituted no small part of that mass of evil, political and physical, by which that portion of the world has been so long afflicted. That a pest equally malignant had assailed the metropolis of her own country, a town famous for the salubrity of its airs and the perfection of its police, had something in it so wild and uncouth, that she could not reconcile herself to the possibility of such an event. The death of Watson, however, filled her mind with awful reflections. The purpose of her walk was forgotten amidst more momentous considerations. She bent her steps pensively homeward. She had now leisure to remark the symptoms of terror with which all ranks appeared to have been seized. The streets were as much frequented as ever, but there were few passengers whose countenances did not betray alarm, and who did not employ the imaginary antidote to infection, vinegar. Having reached home, she quickly discovered in her father, an unusual solemnity and thoughtfulness. He had no power to conceal his emotions from his daughter, when her efforts to discover them were earnestly exerted. She learned that, during her absence he had been visited by his next neighbor, a thrifty, sober and well meaning, but ignorant and meddling person, by name Whiston. This person, being equally inquisitive into other men's affairs, and communicative of his own, was always an unwelcome visitant. On this occasion, he had come to disburthen on Mr. Dudley his fears of disease and death. His tale of the origin and progress of the epidemic, of the number and suddenness of recent deaths, was delivered with endless prolixity. With this account be mingled prognostics of the future, counselled Mr. Dudley to fly from the scene of danger, and stated his own schemes and resolutions. After having thoroughly affrighted and wearied his companion, he took his leave. Constantia endeavored to remove the impression which had been thus needlessly made. She urged her doubts as to the truth of Whiston's representations, and endeavored, in various ways, to extenuate the danger. Nay, my child, said her father, thou needest not reason on the subject. I am not afraid. At least, on my own account, I fear nothing. What is life to me that I should dread to lose it? If on any account I should tremble, it is on thine, my angelic girl. Thou dost not deserve thus early to perish; and yet if my love for thee were rational, perhaps I ought to wish it. An evil destiny will pursue thee to the close of thy life, be it never so long. I know that ignorance and folly breed the phantoms by which themselves are perplexed and terrified, and that Whiston is a fool; but here the truth is too plain to be disguised. This malady is pestilential. Havoc and despair will accompany its progress, and its progress will be rapid. The tragedies of Marseilles and Messina will be reacted on this stage. For a time, we in this quarter will be exempt, but it will surely reach us at last, and then, whither shall we fly? For the rich, the whole world is a safe asylum, but for us, indigent and wretched, what fate is reserved but to stay and perish? If the disease spare us, we must perish by neglect and famine. Alarm will be far and wide diffused. Fear will hinder those who supply the market, from entering the city. The price of food will become exorbitant. Our present source of subsistence, ignominious and scanty as it is, will be cut off. Traffic and labor of every kind will be at an end. We shall die, but not until we have witnessed and endured horrors that surpass thy powers of conception. I know full well the enormity of this evil. I have been at Messina, and talked with many who witnessed the state of that city in 1743. I will not freeze thy blood with the recital. Anticipation has a tendency to lessen or prevent some evils, but pestilence is not of that number. Strange untowardness of destiny! That thou and I should be cast upon a scene like this! Mr. Dudley joined with uncommon powers of discernment, a species of perverseness not easily accounted for. He acted as if the inevitable evils of her lot was not sufficient for the trial of his daughter's patience. Instead of comforter and counsellor, he fostered impatience in himself, and endeavored, with the utmost diligence, to undermine her fortitude and disconcert her schemes. The task was assigned to her, not only of subduing her own fears, but of maintaining the contest with his disastrous eloquence. In most cases she had not failed of success. Hitherto their causes of anxiety, her own observation had, in some degree, enabled her to estimate at their just value. The rueful pictures which his imagination was wont to portray, affected her for a moment; but deliberate scrutiny commonly enabled her to detect and demonstrate their fallacy. Now, however, the theme was new. Panic and foreboding found their way to her heart in defiance of her struggles. She had no experience by which to counteract this impulse. All that remained was to beguile her own and her father's cares by counterfeiting cheerfulness and introducing new topics. This panic, stifled for a time, renewed its sway when she retired to her chamber. Never did futurity wear, to her fancy, so dark a hue. Never did her condition appear to her in a light so dreary and forlorn. To fly from the danger was impossible. How should accommodation at a distance be procured? The means of subsistence were indissolubly connected with her present residence, but the progress of this disease would cut off these means, and leave her to be beset not only with pestilence but famine. What provision could she make against an evil like this?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The terms on which she had been admitted into this house, included the advance of one quarter's rent and the monthly payment of subsequent dues. The requisite sum had been with difficulty collected, the landlord had twice called to remind her of her stipulation, and this day had been fixed for the discharge of this debt. He had omitted, contrary to her expectations and her wishes, to come. It was probible, however, that they should meet on the ensuing day. I he should fail in this respect, it appeared to be her duty to carry the money to his house, and this it had been her resolution to perform. Now, however, new views were suggested to her thoughts. By the payment of this debt she should leave herself nearly destitute. The flight and terror of the citizens would deprive her of employment. Want of food was an immediate and inevitable evil which the payment of this sum would produce. Was it just to incur this evil? To retain the means of luxurious gratification would be wrong, but to bereave herself and her father of bare subsistence was surely no dictate of duty. It is true the penalty of nonpayment was always in the landlord's hands. He was empowered by the law to sell their moveables and expel them from his house. It was now to time for a penalty like this to be incurred. But from this treatment it was reasonable to hope that his lenity would save them. Was it not right to wait till the alternative of expulsion or payment was imposed? Meanwhile, however, she was subject to the torments of suspense and to the guilt of a broken promise. These consequences were to be eluded only in one way. By visiting her landlord and stating her true condition, it was possible that his compassion would remit claims which were, in themselves, unreasonable and uncommon. The tender of the money accompanied by representations sufficiently earnest and pathetic, might possibly be declined. These reflections were, next morning, submitted to her father. Her decision in this case was of less importance in his eyes, than in those of his daughter. Should the money be retained, it was, in his opinion, a pittance too small to afford them effectual support. Supposing provisions to be had at any price, which was, itself improbable, that price would be exorbitant. The general confusion would probably last for months, and thirty dollars would be devoured in a few weeks even in a time of safety. To give or to keep was indifferent for another reason. It was absurd for those to consult about means of subsistence for the next month, when it was fixed that they should die tomorrow.—The true proceeding was obvious. The landlord's character was well known to him by means of the plaints and invectives of their neighbors, most of whom were tenants of the same man. If the money were offered, his avarice would receive it, in spite of all the pleas that she should urge. If it were detained without lieve, an officer of justice would quickly be despatched to claim it. This statement was sufficient to take away from Constantia the hope that she had fostered. What then, said she, after a pause, is my father's advice? Shall I go forthwith and deliver the money? No, said he, stay till he sends for it. Have you forgotten that Mathews resides in the very midst of this disease. There is no need to thrust yourself within its fangs. They will reach us time enough. It is likely his messenger will be an agent of the law. No matter. The debt will be merely increased by a few charges. In a state like ours, the miserable remnant is not worth caring for. This reasoning, did not impart conviction to the lady. The danger, flowing from a tainted atmosphere was not small, but to incur that danger was wiser than to exasperate their landlord, to augment the debt and to encounter the disgrace, accruing from a constable's visits. The conversation was dropped, and, presently after, she set out on a visit to Mathews. She fully estimated the importance to her happiness of the sum which she was going to pay. The general panic had already, in some degree, produced the effect she chiefly dreaded; the failure of employment for her needle. Her father had, with his usual diligence at self-torment, supplied her with sufficient proofs of the covetous and obdurate temper of her creditor. Insupportable, however, as the evil of payment was, it was better to incur it spontaneously, than by means of legal process. The desperateness of this proceeding therefore, did not prevent her from adopting it, but it filled her heart with the bitterest sensations. Absorbed as she past along, by these, she was nearly insensible to the vacancy which now prevailed in a quarter which formerly resounded with the din of voices and carriages. As she approached the house to which she was going, her reluctance to proceed increased. Frequently she paused to recollect the motives that had prescribed this task, and to reinforce her purposes. At length she arrived at the house. Now, for the first time, her attention was excited by the silence and desolution that surrounded her. This evidence of fear and of danger struck upon her heart. All appeared to have fled from the presence of this unseen and terrible foe. The temerity of adventuring thus into the jaws of the pest, now appeared to her in glaring colors. Appearances suggested a reflection which had not previously occurred, and which tended to console her. Was it not probable that Mathews had likewise flown? His habits were calculated to endear to him his life; he would scarcely be among the last to shun perils like these; the omission of his promised visit on the preceding day, might be owing to his absence from the city, and thus, without subjection to any painful alternative, she might be suffered to retain the money. To give certainty to this hope, she cast her eye towards the house opposite to which she now stood. Her heart drooped on perceiving proofs that the dwelling was still inhabited. The door was open and the windows in the second and third story were raised. Near the entrance, in the street, stood a cart. The horse attached to it, in his form and furniture and attitude, was an emblem of torper and decay. His gaunt sides, motionless limbs, his gummy and dead eyes, and his head hanging to the ground, were in unisco with the craziness of the vehicle to which he belonged, and 4 the paltry and bedusted harness which covered him. No attendant nor any human face was visible. The stillness, though at an hour customarily busy, was uninterrupted except by the sound of wheels moving at an almost indistinguishable distance. She paused for a moment to contemplate this unwonted spectacle. Her trepidations were mingled with emotions not unakin to sublimity, but the consciousness of danger speedily prevailed, and she hastened to acquit herself of her engagement. She approached the door for this purpose, but before she could draw the bell her motions were arrested by sounds from within. The staircase was opposite the door. Two persons were now discovered descending the stair. They lifted between them a heavy mass, which was presently discerned to be a coffin. Shocked by this discovery and trembling she withdrew from the entrance. At this moment a door on the opposite side of the street opened and a female came out. Constantia approached her involuntarily and her appearance not being unattractive, adventured, more by gestures than by words, to inquire whose obsequies were thus unceremoniously conducted. The woman informed her that the dead was Mathews, who, two days before, was walking about, indifferent to, and braving danger. She cut short the narrative which her companion seemed willing to prolong, and to embellish with all its circumstances, and hastened home with her utmost expedition. The mind of Constantia was a stranger to pusillanimity. Death, as the common lot of all, was regarded by her without perturbation. The value of life, though not annihilated, was certainly diminished by adversity. With whatever solemnity contemplated, it excited on her own account, no aversion or inquietude. For her father's sake only, death was an evil to be ardently deprecated. The nature of the prevalent disease, the limits and modes of its influence, the risk that is incurred by approaching the sick or the dead, or by breathing the surrounding element, were subjects foreign to her education. She judged like the mass of mankind from the most obvious appearances, and was subject like them to impulses, which disdained the control of her reason. With all her complacency for death and speculative resignation to the fate that governs the world, disquiet and alarm pervaded her bosom on this occasion. The deplorable state to which her father would be reduced by her death, was seen and lamented, but her tremulous sensations flowed not from this source. They were, in some sort, inexplicable and mechanical. In spite of recollection and reflection, they bewildered and harassed her, and subsided only of their own accord. The death of Mathews was productive of one desirable consequence. Till the present tumult were passed, and his representatives had leisure to inspect his affairs, his debtors would probably remain unmolested. He, likewise, who should succeed to the inheritance, might possess very different qualities, and be as much distinguished for equity as Mathews had been for extortion. These reflections lightened her footsteps as she hied homeward. The knowledge she had gained, she hoped would counterpoise, in her father's apprehension, the perils, which accompanied the acquisition of it. She had scarcely passed her own threshold, when she was followed by Whiston. This man pursued the occupation of a cooper. He performed journeywork in a shop, which, unfortunately for him, was situated near the water, and at a small distance from the scene of original infection. This day his employer had dismissed his workmen, and Whiston was at liberty to retire from the city; a scheme, which had been the theme of deliberation and discussion during the preceding fortnight. Hitherto his apprehensions seemed to have molested others more than himself. The rumors and conjectures industriously collected during the day, were, in the evening, copiously detailed to his neighbors, and his own mind appeared to he disburthened of its cares, in proportion as he filled others with terror and inquietude. The predictions of physicians, the measures of precaution prescribed by the government, the progress of the malady, and the history of the victims who were hourly destroyed by it, were communicated with tormenting prolixity and terrifying minuteness. On these accounts as well as on others, no one's visits were more unwelcome than his. As his deportment was sober and honest, and his intentions harmless, he was always treated, by Constantia, with politeness, though his entrance always produced a momentary depression of her spirits. On this evening she was less fitted than ever to repel those anxieties which his conversation was qualified to produce. His entrance, therefore, was observed with sincere regret. Contrary, however, to her expectation, Whiston brought with him new manners and a new expression of countenance. He was silent, abstracted, his eye was full of inquietude, and wandered with perpetual restlessness. On these tokens being remarked, he expressed, in faultering accents his belief, that he had contracted this disease, and that now it was too late for him to leave the city. Mr. Dudley's education was somewhat medical. He was so far interested in his guest as to inquire into his sensations. They were such as were commonly the preludes to fever. Mr. Dudley, while he endeavored by cheerful tones, to banish his dejection, exhorted him to go home, and to take some hot and wholesome draught, in consequence of which, he might rise tomorrow with his usual health. This advice was gratefully received, and Whiston put a period to his visit much sooner than was customary. Mr. Dudley entertained no doubts that Whiston was seized with the reigning disease, and extinguished the faint hope which his daughter had cherished, that their district would escape. Whiston's habitation was nearly opposite their own, but as they made no use of their front room, they had seldom an opportunity of observing the transactions of their neighbors. This distance and seclusion were congenial with her feelings, and she derived pleasure from her father's confession, that they contributed to personal security. Constantia was accustomed to rise with the dawn, and traverse, for an hour, the State house Mall. As she took her walk the next morning, she pondered with astonishment on the present situation of the city. The air was bright and pure, and apparently salubrious. Security and silence seemed to hover over the scene. She was only reminded of the true state of things by the occasional appearance of carriages loaded with household utensils tending towards the country, and by the odour of vinegar by which every passenger was accompanied. The public walk was cool and fragrant as formerly, skirted by verdure as bright, and shaded by foliage as luxuriant, but it was no longer frequented by lively steps and cheerful countenances. Its solitude was uninterrupted by any but herself. This day passed without furnishing any occasion to leave the house. She was less sedulously employed than usual, as the clothes, on which she was engaged, belonged to a family who had precipitately left the city. She had leisure therefore to ruminate. She could not but feel some concern in the fate of Whiston. He was a young man who subsisted on the fruits of his labor, and divided his gains with an only sister who lived with him, and who performed every household office. This girl was humble and innocent, and of a temper affectionate and mild. Casual intercourse only had taken place between her and Constantia. They were too dissimilar for any pleasure to arise from communication, but the latter was sufficiently disposed to extend to her harmless neighbor, the sympathy and succor which she needed. Whiston had come from a distant part of the country, and his sister was the only person in the city with whom he was connected by ties of kindred. In case of his sickness, therefore, their condition would be helpless and deplorable. Evening arrived, and Whiston failed to pay his customary visit. She mentioned this omission to her father, and expressed her apprehension as to the cause of it. He did not discountenance the inference which she drew from this circumstance, and assented to the justice of the picture which she drew of the calamitous state to which Whiston and his sister would be reduced by the indisposition of either. She then ventured to suggest the propriety of visiting the house, and of thus ascertaining the truth. To this proposal Mr. Dudley urged the most vehement objections. What purpose could be served by entering their dwelling? What benefit would flow but the gratification of a dangerous curiosity? Constantia was disabled from furnishing pecuniary aid. She could not act the part of physician or nurse. Her father stood in need of a thousand personal services, and the drudgery of cleansing and cooking, already exceeded the bounds of her strength. The hazard of contracting the disease by conversing with the 4* sick, was imminent. What services was she able to render equivalent to the consequences of her own sickness and death? These representations had temporary influence. They recalled her for a moment, from her purpose, but this purpose was speedily re-embraced. She reflected that the evil to herself, formidable as it was, was barely problematical. That converse with the sick would impart this disease, was by no means certain. Whiston might at least be visited. Perhaps she should find him well. If sick, his disease might be unepidemical, or curable by seasonable assistance. He might stand in need of a physician, and she was more able than his sister, to summon this aid. Her father listened calmly to her reasonings. After a pause, he gave his consent. In doing this he was influenced not by the conviction that his daughter's safety would be exposed to no hazard, but from a belief that though she might shun infection for the present, it would inevitably seize her during some period of the progress of this pest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. It was now dusk and she hastened to perform this duty. Whiston's dwelling was wooden and of small dimensions. She lifted the latch softly and entered. The lower room was unoccupied. She advanced to the foot of a narrow staircase, and knocked and listened, but no answer was returned to the summons. Hence there was reason to infer that no one was within, but this, from other considerations, was extremely improbable. The truth could be ascertained only by ascending the stair. Some feminine scruples were to be subdued before this proceeding could be adopted. After some hesitation, she determined to ascend. The staircase was terminated by a door at which she again knocked for admission, but in vain. She listened, and presently heard the motion as of some one in bed. This was succeeded by tokens of vehement exertions to vomit. These signs convincing her that the house was not without a tenant, she could not hesitate to enter the room. Lying in a tattered bed, she now discovered Mary Whiston. Her face was flushed and swelled, her eyes closed, and some power appeared to have laid a leaden hand upon her faculties. The floor was moistened and stained by the effusion from her stomach. Constantia touched her hand, and endeavored to rouse her. It was with difficulty that her attention was excited. Her languid eyes were scarcely opened before they again closed and she sunk into forgetfulness. Repeated efforts, however, at length recalled her to herself, and extorted from her some account of her condition. On the day before, at noon, her stomach became diseased, her head dizzy, and her limbs unable to support her. Her brother was absent, and her drowsiness, interrupted only by paroxysms of vomiting, continued till his return late in the evening. He had then shewn himself, for a few minutes, at her bedside, had made some inquiries and precipitately retired, since when he had not reappeared. It was natural to imagine that Whiston had gone to procure medical assistance. That he had not returned, during a day and a half, was matter of surprise. His own indisposition was recollected, and his absence could only be accounted for by supposing that sickness had disabled him from regaining his own house. What was his real destiny, it was impossible to conjecture. It was not till some months after this period that satisfactory intelligence was gained upon this head. It appeared that Whiston had allowed his terrors to overpower the sense of what was due to his sister and to humanity. On discovering the condition of the unhappy girl, he left the house, and, instead of seeking a physician, he turned his steps towards the country. After travelling some hours, being exhausted by want of food, by fatigue, and by mental as well as bodily anguish, he laid himself down under the shelter of a hayrick, in a vacant field. Here he was discovered in the morning by the inhabitants of a neighboring farm house. These people had too much regard for their own safety to accommodate him under their roof, or even to approach within fifty paces of his person. A passenger, whose attention and compassion had been excited by this incident, was endowed with more courage. He lifted the stranger in his arms, and carried him from this unwholesome spot to a barn. This was the only service which the passenger was able to perform. Whiston, deserted by every human creature, burning with fever, tormented into madness by thirst, spent three miserable days in agony. When dead, no one would cover his body with earth, but he was suffered to decay by piecemeal. The dwelling, being at no great distance from the barn, could not be wholly screened from the malignant vapor which a corpse, thus neglected, could not fail to produce. The inhabitants were preparing on this account, to change their abode, but, on the eve of their departure, the master of the family became sick. He was, in a short time, followed to the grave by his mother, his wife and four children. They probably imbibed their disease from the tainted atmosphere around them. The life of Whiston and their own lives, might have been saved by affording the wanderer an asylum and suitable treatment, or at least, their own deaths might have been avoided by interring his remains. Meanwhile Constantia was occupied with reflecting on the scene before her. Not only a physician but a nurse was wanting. The last province it was more easy for her to supply than the former. She was acquainted with the abode of but one physician. He lived at no small distance from this spot. To him she immediately hastened, but he was absent, and his numerous engagements left it wholly uncertain when he would return and whether he would consent to increase the number of his patients. Direction was obtained to the residence of another, who was happily disengaged, and who promised to attend immediately. Satisfied with this assurance, she neglected to request directions, by which she might regulate herself on his failing to come. During her return her thoughts were painfully employed in considering the mode proper for her to pursue, in her present perplexing situation. She was for the most part unacquainted with the character of those who composed her neighborhood. That any would be willing to undertake the tendance of this girl was by no means probable. As wives and mothers, it would perhaps be unjust to require or permit it. As to herself there were labors and duties of her own sufficient to engross her faculties, yet, by whatever foreign cares or tasks she was oppressed, she felt that, to desert this being, was impossible. In the absence of her friend, Mary's state exhibited no change. Constantia, on regaining the house, lighted the remnant of a candle, and resumed her place by the bedside of the sick girl. She impatiently waited for the arrival of the physician, but hour succeeded hour and he came not. All hope of his coming being extinguished, she bethought herself that her father might be able to inform her of the best manner of proceeding. It was likewise her duty to relieve him from the suspense in which her absence would unavoidably plunge him. On entering her own apartment she found a stranger in company with Mr. Dudley. The latter perceiving that she had returned, speedily acquainted her with the views of their guest. His name was M'Crea; he was the nephew of their landlord and was now become, by reversion, the proprietor of the house which they occupied. Mathews had been buried the preceding day, and M'Crea, being well acquainted with the engagements which subsisted between the deceased and Mr. Dudley, had come, thus unseasonably, to demand the rent. He was not unconscious of the inhumanity and sordidness of this proceeding, and therefore, endeavored to disguise it by the usual pretences. All his funds were exhausted. He came not only in his own name, but in that of Mrs. Mathews his aunt, who was destitute of money to procure daily and indispensable provision, and who was striving to collect a sufficient sum to enable her and the remains of her family, to fly from a spot where their lives were in perpetual danger. These excuses were abundantly fallacious, but Mr. Dudley was too proud to solicit the forbearance of a man like this. He recollected that the engagement on his part was voluntary and explicit, and he disdained to urge his present exigencies as reasons for retracting it. He expressed the utmost readiness to comply with the demand, and merely desired him to wait till Miss Dudley returned. From the inquietudes with which the unusual duration of her absence had filled him, he was now relieved by her entrance. With an indignant and desponding heart, she complied with her father's directions, and the money being reluctantly delivered, M'Crea took a hasty leave. She was too deeply interested in the fate of Mary Whiston, to allow her thoughts to be diverted for the present into a new channel. She described the desolate condition of the girl to her father, and besought him to think of something suitable to her relief. Mr. Dudley's humanity would not suffer him to disapprove of his daughter's proceeding. He imagined that the symptoms of the patient portended a fatal issue. There were certain complicated remedies which might possibly be beneficial, but these were too costly, and the application would demand more strength than his daughter could bestow. He was unwilling, however, to leave any thing within his power, untried. Pharmacy had been his trade, and he had reserved, for domestic use, some of the most powerful evacuants. Constantia was supplied with some of these, and he consented that she should spend the night with her patient, and watch their operation. The unhappy Mary received whatever was offered, but her stomach refused to retain it. The night was passed by Constantia without closing her eyes. As soon as the day dawned, she prepared once more to summon the physician, who had failed to comply with his promise. She had scarcely left the house, however, before she met him. He pleaded his numerous engagements in excuse for his last night's negligence, and desired her to make haste to conduct him to the patient. Having scrutinized her symptoms, he expressed his hopelessness of her recovery. Being informed of the mode in which she had been treated, he declared his approbation of it, but intimated, that these being unsuccessful, all that remained was to furnish her with any liquid she might choose to demand, and wait patiently for the event. During this interview, the physician surveyed the person and dress of Constantia with an inquisitive eye. His countenance betrayed marks of curiosity and compassion, and had he made any approaches to confidence and friendliness, Constantia would not have repelled them. His air was benevolent and candid, and she estimated highly the usefulness of a counselandlor friend in her present circumstances. Some motive, however, hindered him from tendering his service, and, in a few moments, he withdrew. Mary's condition hourly grew worse. A corroded and gangrenous stomach was quickly testified by the dark hue and poisonous malignity of the matter which was frequently ejected from it. Her stupor gave place to some degree of peevishness and restlessness. She drank the water that was held to her lips with unspeakable avidity, and derived from this source a momentary alleviation of her pangs. Fortunately for her attendant, her agonies were not of long duration. Constantia was absent from her bedside as rarely, and for periods as short as possible. On the succeeding night, the sufferings of the patient terminated in death. This event took place at two o'clock in the morning. An hour whose customary stillness was, if possible, increased tenfold by the desolation of the city. The poverty of Mary and of her nurse had deprived the former of the benefits resulting from the change of bed and clothes. Every thing about her was in a condition noisome and detestable. Her yellowish and haggard visage, conspicuous by a feeble light, an atmosphere freighted with malignant vapors, and reminding Constantia at every instant, of the perils which encompassed her, the consciousness of solitude and sensations of deadly sickness in her own frame, were sufficient to intimidate a soul of firmer texture than hers. She was sinking fast into helplessness, when a new train of reflections showed her the necessity of perseverance. All that remained was to consign the corpse to the grave. She knew that vehicles for this end were provided at the public expense, that notice being given of the occasion there was for their attendance, a receptacle and carriage for the dead would be instantly provided. Application, at this hour, she imagined would be unseasonable. It must be deferred till the morning which was yet at some distance. Meanwhile to remain at her present post, was equally useless and dangerous. She endeavored to stifle the conviction, that some mortal sickness had seized upon her own frame. Her anxieties of head and stomach she was willing to impute to extraordinary fatigue and watchfulness; and hoped that they would be dissipated by an hour's unmolested repose. She formed the resolution of seeking her own chamber. At this moment, however, the universal silence underwent a slight interruption. The sound was familiar to her ears. It was a signal frequently repeated at the midnight hour during this season of calamity. It was the slow movement of a hearse, apparently passing along the street, in which the alley, where Mr. Dudley resided, terminated. At first, this sound had no other effect than to aggravate the dreariness of all around her. Presently it occurred to her that this vehicle might be disengaged. She conceived herself bound to see the last offices performed for the deceased Mary. The sooner so irksome a duty was discharged the better. Every hour might augment her incapacity for exertion. Should she be unable when the morning arrived, to go as far as the city hall, and give the necessary information, the most shocking consequences would ensue. Whiston's house and her own were opposite each other, and not connected with any on the same side. A narrow space divided them, and her own chamber was within the sphere of the contagion which would flow, in consequence of such neglect, from that of her neighbor. Influenced by these considerations she passed into the street, and gained the corner of the alley, just as the carriage, whose movements she had heard, arrived at the same spot. It was accompanied by two men, negroes, who listened to her tale with respect. Having already a burthen of this kind, they could not immediately comply with this request. They promised that, having disposed of their present charge, they would return forthwith and be ready to execute her orders. Happily one of these persons was known to her. At other seasons his occupation was that of woodcarter, and as such he had performed some services for Mr. Dudley. His temper was gentle and obliging. The character of Constantia had been viewed by him with reverence, and his kindness had relieved her from many painful offices. His old occupation being laid aside for a time, he had betaken himself, like many others of his color and rank, to the conveyance and burial of the dead. At Constantia's request, he accompanied her to Whiston's house, and promised to bring with him such assistance, as would render her farther exertions and attendance unnecessary. Glad to be absolved from any new task, she now retired to her own chamber. In spite of her distempered frame, she presently sunk into sweet sleep. She awoke not till the day had made considerable progress, and found herself invigorated and refreshed. On re-entering Whiston's house, she discovered that her humble friend had faithfully performed his promise, the dead body having disappeared. She deemed it unsafe, as well as unnecessary, to examine the clothes and other property remaining, but leaving every thing in the condition in which it had been found, she fastened the windows and doors, and thenceforth kept as distant from the house as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Constantia had now leisure to ruminate upon her own condition. Every day added to the devastation and confusion of the city. The most populous streets were deserted and silent. The greater number of inhabitants had fled, and those who remained were occupied with no cares but those which related to their own safety. The labors of the artisan and the speculations of the merchant were suspended. All shops, but those of the apothecaries were shut. No carriage but the hearse was seen, and this was employed, night and day, in the removal of the dead. The customary sources of subsistence were cut off. Those, whose fortunes enabled them to leave the city, but who had deferred till now their retreat, were denied an asylum by the terror which pervaded the adjacent country, and by the cruel prohibitions which the neighboring towns and cities thought it necessary to adopt. Those who lived by the fruits of their daily labor were subjected, in this total inactivity, to the alternative of starving, or of subsisting upon public charity. The meditations of Constantia, suggested no alternative but this. The exactions of M'Crea had reduced her whole fortune to five dollars. This would rapidly decay, and her utmost ingenuity could discover no means of procuring a 5 new supply. All the habits of their life had combined to fill both her father and herself with aversion to the acceptance of charity. Yet this avenue, opprobrious and disgustful as it was, afforded the only means of escaping from the worst extremes of famine. In this state of mind it was obvious to consider in what way the sum remaining might be most usefully expended. Every species of provision was not equally nutritious or equally cheap. Her mind, active in the pursuit of knowledge and fertile of resources, had lately been engaged, in discussing with her father, the best means of retaining health, in a time of pestilence. On occasions, when the malignity of contagious diseases has been most signal, some individuals have escaped. For their safety, they were doubtless indebted to some peculiarities in their constitution or habits. Their diet, their dress, their kind and degree of exercise, must somewhat have contributed to their exemption from the common destiny. These, perhaps, could be ascertained, and when known it was surely proper to conform to them. In discussing these ideas, Mr. Dudley introduced the mention of a Benedictine of Messina, who, during the prevalence of the plague in that city, was incessantly engaged in administering assistance to those who needed. Notwithstanding his perpetual hazards, he retained perfect health, and was living thirty years after this event. During this period, he fostered a tranquil, fearless, and benevolent spirit, and restricted his diet to water and pollenta. Spices, and meats, and liquors, and all complexities of cookery were utterly discarded. These facts now occurred to Constantia's reflections with new vividness, and led to interesting consequences. Pollenta and hasty-pudding or samp, are preparations of the same substance; a substance which she needed not the experience of others to convince her was no less grateful than nutritive. Indian meal was procurable at ninety cents per bushel. By recollecting former experiments, she knew that this quantity, with no accompaniment but salt, would supply wholesome and plentiful food for four months to one person.* * See this useful fact explained and demonstrated in Count Rumford's Essays. The inference was palpable. Three persons were now to be supplied with food, and this supply could be furnished, during four months, at the trivial expense of three dollars. This expedient was at once so uncommon and so desirable, as to be regarded with temporary disbelief. She was inclined to suspect some latent error in her calculation. That a sum thus applied, should suffice for the subsistence of a year, which, in ordinary cases, is expended in a few days, was scarcely credible. The more closely, however, the subject was examined, the more incontestably did this inference flow. The mode of preparation was simple and easy, and productive of the fewest toils and inconveniences. The attention of her Lucy was sufficient to this end, and the drudgery of marketing was wholly precluded. She easily obtained the concurrence of her father and the scheme was found as practicable and beneficial as her fondes expectations had predicted. Infallible security was thus provided against hunger. This was the only care that was urgent and immediate. While they had food and were exempt from disease, they could live, and were not without their portion of comfort. Her hands were unemployed but her mind was kept in continual activity. To seclude herself as much as possible from others, was the best means of avoiding infection. Spectacles of misery which she was unable to relieve, would merely tend to harass her with useless disquietudes and make her frame more accessible in disease. Her father's instructions were sufficient to give her a competent acquaintance with the Italian and French languages. His dreary hours were beguiled by this employment, and her mind was furnished with a species of knowledge, which she hoped, in future, to make subservient to a more respectable and plentiful subsistence than she had hitherto enjoyed. Meanwhile the season advanced, and the havoc which this fatal malady produced, increased with portentous rapidity. In alleys and narrow streets, in which the house were smaller, the inhabitants more numerous and indigent and the air pent up within unwholesome limits, it raged with greatest violence. Few of Constantia's neighbors possessed the means of removing from the danger. The inhabitants of this alley consisted of three hundred persons. Of these eight or ten experienced no interruption of their health. Of the rest two hundred were destroyed in the course of three weeks. Among so many victims, it may be supposed that this disease assumed every terrific and agonizing shape. It was impossible for Constantia to shut out every token of a calamity thus enormous and thus near. Night was the season usually selected for the removal of the dead. The sound of wheels thus employed was incessant. This, and the images with which it was sure to be accompanied, bereaved her of repose. The shrieks and laments of survivors, who could not be prevented from attending the remains of a husband or child to the place of interment, frequently struck her senses. Sometimes urged by a furious delirium, the sick would break from their attendants, rush into the streets, and expire on the pavement, amidst frantic outcries and gestures. By these she was often roused from imperfect sleep, and called to reflect upon the fate which impended over her father and herself. To preserve health in an atmosphere thus infected, and to ward off terror and dismay in a scene of horrors thus hourly accumulating, was impossible. Constantia found it vain to contend against the inroads of sadness. Amidst so dreadful a mortality, it was irrational to cherish the hope that she or her father would escape. Her sensations, in no long time, seemed to justify her apprehensions. Her appetite forsook her, her strength failed, the thirst and lassitude of fever invaded her, and the grave seemed to open for her reception. Lucy was assailed by the same symptoms at the same time. Household offices were unavoidably neglected. Mr. Dudley retained his health, but he was able only to prepare his scanty food, and supply the cravings of his child, with water from the well. His imagination marked him out for the next victim. He could not be blind to the consequences of his own indisposition, at a period so critical. Disabled from contributing to each other's assistance, destitute of medicine and food, and even of water to quench their tormenting thirst, unvisited, unknown, and perishing in frightful solitude!—These images had a tendency to prostrate the mind, and generate or ripen the seeds of this fatal malady, which, no doubt, at this period of its progress, every one had imbibed. Contrary to all his fears, he awoke each morning free from pain, though not without an increase of debility. Abstinence from food, and the liberal use of cold water seemed to have a medicinal operation on the sick. Their pulse gradually resumed its healthful tenor, their strength and their appetite slowly returned, and in ten days they were able to congratulate each other on their restoration. I will not recount that series of disastrous thoughts which occupied the mind of Constantia during this period. Her lingering and sleepless hours were regarded by her as preludes to death. Though at so immature an age, she had gained large experience of the evils which are allotted to man. Death, which, in her prosperous state, was peculiarly abhorrent to her feelings, was now disrobed of terror. As an entrance into scenes of lightsome and imperishable being, it was the goal of all her wishes. As a passage to oblivion it was still desirable, since forgetfulness was better than the life which she had hitherto led, and which, should her existence be prolonged, it was likely that she could continue to lead. These gloomy meditations were derived from the langour of her frame. When these disappeared, her cheerfulness and fortitude revived. She regarded with astonishment and delight, the continuance of her father's health and her own restoration. That trial seemed to have been safely undergone, to which the life of every one was subject. The air which till now had been arid and sultry, was changed into cool and moist. The pestilence had reached its utmost height, and now symptoms of remission and decline begin to appear. Its declension was more rapid than its progress, and every day added vigor to hope. When her strength was somewhat retrieved, Constantia called to mind a good woman who lived in her former neighborhood, and from whom she had received many proofs of artless affection. This woman's name was Sarah Baxter. She lived within a small distance of Constantia's former dwelling. The trade of her husband was that of porter, and she pursued, in addition to the care of a numerous family, the business of a laundress. The superior knowledge 5* and address of Constantia, had enabled her to be serviceable to this woman in certain painful and perplexing circumstances. This service was repaid with the utmost gratitude. Sarah regarded her benefactress with a species of devotion. She could not endure to behold one, whom every accent and gesture proved to have once enjoyed affluence and dignity, performing any servile office. In spite of her own multiplied engagements, she compelled Constantia to accept her assistance on many occasions, and could scarcely be prevailed upon to receive any compensation for her labor. Washing clothes was her trade, and from this task she insisted on relieving her lovely patroness. Constantia's change of dwelling produced much regret in the kind Sarah. She did not allow it to make any change in their previous arrangements, but punctually visited the Dudleys once a week, and carried home with her whatever stood in need of ablution. When the prevalence of disease disabled Constantia from paying her the usual wages, she would, by no means, consent to be absolved from this task. Her earnestness on this head was not to be eluded, and Constantia, in consenting that her work should, for the present, be performed gratuitously, solaced herself with the prospect of being able, by some future change of fortune, amply to reward her. Sarah's abode was distant from danger, and her fears were turbulent. She was, nevertheless, punctual in her visits to the Dudleys, and anxious for their safety. In case of their sickness, she had declared her resolution to be their attendant and nurse. Suddenly, however, her visits ceased. The day on which her usual visit was paid, was the same with that on which Constantia sickened, but her coming was expected in vain. Her absence was, on some accounts, regarded with pleasure, as it probably secured her from the danger connected with the office of a nurse, but it added to Constantia's cares, inasmuch as her own sickness, or that of some of her family, was the only cause of her detention. To remove her doubts, the first use which Constantia made of her recovered strength, was to visit her laundress. Sarah's house was a theatre of suffering. Her husband was the first of his family assailed by the reigning disease. Two daughters, nearly grown to womanhood, well disposed and modest girls, the pride and support of their mother, and who lived at service, returned home, sick, at the same time, and died in a few days. Her husband had struggled for eleven days with his disease, and was seized, just before Constantia's arrival, with the pangs of death. Baxter was endowed with great robustness and activity. This disease did not vanquish him but with tedious and painful struggles. His muscular force now exhausted itself in ghastly contortions, and the house resounded with his ravings. Sarah's courage had yielded to so rapid a succession of evils. Constantia found her shut up in a chamber, distant from that of her dying husband, in a paroxysm of grief, and surrounded by her younger children. Constantia's entrance was like that of an angelic comforter. Sarah was unqualified for any office but that of complaint. With great difficulty she was made to communicate the knowledge of her situation. Her visitant then passed into Baxter's apartment. She forced herself to endure this tremendous scene long enough to discover that it was hastening to a close. She left the house, and hastening to the proper office, engaged the immediate attendance of a hearse. Before the lapse of an hour, Baxter's lifeless remains were thrust into a coffin and conveyed away. Constantia now exerted herself to comfort and encourage the survivors. Her remonstrances incited Sarah to perform with alacrity the measures which prudence dictates on these occasions. The house was purified by the admission of air and the sprinkling of vinegar. Constantia applied her own hand to these tasks, and set her humble friend an example of forethought and activity. Sarah would not consent to part with her till a late hour in the evening. These exertions had like to have been fatally injurious to Constantia. Her health was not sufficiently confirmed to sustain offices so arduous. In the course of the night her fatigue terminated in fever. In the present more salubrious state of the atmosphere, it assumed no malignant symptoms, and shortly disappeared. During her indisposition, she was attended by Sarah, in whose honest bosom no sentiment was more lively than gratitude. Constantia having promised to renew her visit the next day, had been impatiently expected, and Sarah had come to her dwelling in the evening, full of foreboding and anxiety, to ascertain the cause of her delay. Having gained the bedside of her patroness, no consideration could induce her to retire from it. Constantia's curiosity was naturally excited as to the causes of Baxter's disease. The simple hearted Sarah was prolix and minute in the history of her own affairs. No theme was more congenial to her temper than that which was now proposed. In spite of redundance and obscurity in the style of the narrative, Constantia found in it powerful excitements of her sympathy. The tale, on its own account, as well as from the connexion of some of its incidents with a subsequent part of these memoirs, is worthy to be here inserted. However foreign the destiny of Monrose may at present appear to the story of the Dudleys, there will hereafter be discovered an intimate connexion between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Adjacent to the house occupied by Baxter was an antique brick tenement. It was one of the first erections made by the followers of William Penn. It had the honor to be used as the temporary residence of that venerable person. Its moss-grown penthouse, crumbling walls, and ruinous porch, made it an interesting and picturesque object. Notwithstanding its age, it was still tenable. This house was occupied, during the preceding months, by a Frenchman. His dress and demeanor were respectable. His mode of life was frugal almost to penuriousness, and his only companion was a daughter. The lady seemed not much less than thirty years of age, but was of a small and delicate frame. It was she that performed every household office. She brought water from the pump and provisions from the market. Their house had no visitants, and was almost always closed. Duly, as the morning returned, a venerable figure was seen issuing from his door, dressed in the same style of tarnished splendor and old fashioned preciseness. At the dinner hour he as regularly returned. For the rest of the day he was invisible. The habitations in this quarter are few and scattered. The pestilence soon showed itself here, and the flight of most of the inhabitants, augmented its desolateness and dreariness. For some time, Monrose, that was his name, made his usual appearance in the morning. At length the neighbors remarked that he no longer came forth as usual. Baxter had a notion that Frenchmen were exempt from this disease. He was, besides, deeply and rancorously prejudiced against that nation. There will be no difficulty in accounting for this, when it is known that he had been an English grenadier at Dettingen and Minden. It must likewise be added, that he was considerably timid, and had sickness in his own family. Hence it was that the disappearance of Monrose excited in him no inquisitiveness as to the cause. He did not even mention this circumstance to others. The lady was occasionally seen as usual in the street. There were always remarkable peculiarities in her behaviour. In the midst of grave and disconsolate looks, she never laid aside an air of solemn dignity. She seemed to shrink from the observation of others, and her eyes were always fixed upon the ground. One evening Baxter was passing the pump while she was drawing water. The sadness which her looks betokened, and a suspicion that her father might be sick, had a momentary effect upon his feelings. He stopped and asked how her father was. She paid a polite attention to his question, and said something in French. This and the embarrassment of her air, convinced him that his words were not understood. He said no more (what indeed could he say?) but passed on. Two or three days after this, on returning in the evening to his family, his wife expressed her surprise in not having seen Miss Monrose in the street that day. She had not been at the pump, nor had gone, as usual, to market. This information gave him some disquiet; yet he could form no resolution. As to entering the house and offering his aid, if aid were needed, he had too much regard for his own safety, and too little for that of a frog-eating Frenchman, to think seriously of that expedient. His attention was speedily diverted by other objects, and Monrose was, for the present, forgotten. Baxter's profession was that of a porter. He was thrown out of employment by the present state of things. The solicitude of the guardians of the city was exerted on this occasion, not only in opposing the progress of disease, and furnishing provisions to the destitute, but in the preservation of property. For this end the number of nightly watchmen was increased. Baxter entered himself in this service. From nine till twelve o'clock at night it was his province to occupy a certain post. On this night he attended his post as usual. Twelve o'clock arrived, and he bent his steps homeward. It was necessary to pass by Monrose's door. On approaching this house, the circumstance mentioned by his wife recurred to him. Something like compassion was conjured up in his heart by the figure of the lady, as he recollected to have lately seen it. It was obvious to conclude that sickness was the cause of her seclusion. The same, it might be, had confined her father. If this were true, how deplorable might be their present condition! Without food, without physician or friends, ignorant of the language of the country, and thence unable to communicate their wants or solicit succor; fugitives from their native land, neglected, solitary, and poor. His heart was softened by these images. He stopped involuntarily when opposite their door. He looked up at the house. The shutters were closed, so that light, if it were within, was invisible. He stepped into the porch, and put his eye to the key hole. All was darksome and waste. He listened and imagined that he heard the aspirations of grief. The sound was scarcely articulate, but had an electrical effect upon his feelings. He retired to his home full of mournful reflections. He was willing to do something for the relief of the sufferers, but nothing could be done that night. Yet succor, if delayed till the morning, might be ineffectual. But how, when the morning came, should he proceed to effectuate his kind intentions? The guardians of the public welfare, at this crisis, were distributed into those who counselled and those who executed. A set of men, self appointed to the generous office, employed themselves in seeking out the destitute or sick, and imparting relief. With this arrangement, Baxter was acquainted. He was resolved to carry tidings of what he had heard and seen to one of those persons early the next day. Baxter, after taking some refreshment, retired to rest. In no long time, however, he was awakened by his wife, who desired him to notice a certain glimmering on the ceiling. It seemed the feeble and flitting ray of a distant and moving light, coming through the window. It did not proceed from the street, for the chamber was lighted from the side, and not from the front of the house. A lamp borne by a passenger, or the attendants of a hearse, could not be discovered in this situation. Besides, in the latter case, it would be accompanied by the sound of the vehicle, and probably, by weeping and exclamations of despair. His employment, as the guardian of property, naturally suggested to him the idea of robbery. He started from his bed, and went to the window. His house stood at the distance of about fifty paces from that of Monrose. There was annexed to the latter, a small garden or yard, bounded by a high wooden fence. Baxter's window overlooked this space. Before he reached the window, the relative situation of the two habitations occurred to him. A conjecture was instantly formed that the glimmering proceeded from this quarter. His eye, therefore, was immediately fixed upon Monrose's back door. It caught a glimpse of a human figure, passing into the house, through this door. The person had a candle in his hand. This appeared by the light which streamed after him, and which was perceived, though faintly, through a small window of the dwelling, after the back door was closed. The person disappeared too quickly to allow him to say whether it was male or female. This scrutiny confirmed, rather than weakened the apprehensions that first occurred. He reflected on the desolate and helpless condition of this family. The father might be sick; and what opposition could be made by the daughter to the stratagems or violence of midnight plunderers. This was an evil which it was his duty, in an extraordinary sense, to obviate. It is true, the hour of watching was passed, and this was not the district assigned to him; but Baxter was, on the whole, of a generous and intrepid spirit. In the present case, therefore, he did not hesitate long in forming his resolution. He seized a hanger that hung at his bedside, and which had hewn many a Hungarian and French hussar to pieces. With this he descended to the street. He cautiously approached Monrose's house. He listened at the door, but heard nothing. The lower apartment, as he discovered through the key hole, was deserted and dark. These appearances could not be accounted for. He was, as yet, unwilling to call or to knock. He was solicitous to obtain some information by silent means, and without alarming the persons within, who, if they were robbers, might thus be put upon their guard, and enabled to escape. If none but the family were there, they would not understand his signals, and might impute the disturbance to the cause which he was desirous to obviate. What could he do? Must he patiently wait till some incident should happen to regulate his motions? In this uncertainty, he bethought himself of going round to the back part of the dwelling, and watching the door which had been closed. An open space, filled with rubbish and weeds, adjoined the house and garden on one side. Hither he repaired, and raising his head above the fence, at a point directly opposite the door, waited with considerable impatience for some token or signal, by which he might be directed in his choice of measures. Human life abounds with mysterious appearances. A man, perched on a fence, at midnight, mute and motionless, and gazing at a dark and dreary dwelling, was an object calculated to rouse curiosity. When the muscular form, and rugged visage, scarred and furrowed into something like ferocity, were added; when the nature of the calamity, by which the city was dispeopled, was considered, the motives to plunder, and the insecurity of property, arising from the pressure of new wants on the poor, and the flight or disease of the rich, were attended to, an observer would be apt to admit fearful conjectures. We know not how long Baxter continued at this post. He remained here, because he could not, as he conceived, change it for a better. Before his patience was exhausted, his attention was called by a noise within the house. It proceeded from the lower room. The sound was that of steps, but this was accompanied with other inexplicable tokens. The kitchen door at length opened. The figure of Miss Monrose, pale, emaciated, and haggard, presented itself. Within the door stood a candle. It was placed on a chair within sight, and its rays streamed directly against the face of Baxter, as it was reared above the top of the fence. This illumination, faint as it was, bestowed a certain air of wildness on features which nature, and the sanguinary habits of a soldier, had previously rendered, in an eminent degree, harsh and stern. He was not aware of the danger of discovery, in consequence of this position of the candle. His attention was, for a few seconds, engrossed by the object before him. At length he chanced to notice another object. At a few yards distance from the fence, and within it, some one appeared to have been digging. An opening was made in the ground, but it was shallow and irregular. The implement which seemed to have been used, was nothing more than a fire shovel, for one of these he observed lying near the spot. The lady had withdrawn from the door, though without closing it. He had leisure, therefore, to attend to this new circumstance, and to reflect upon the purpose for which this opening might have been designed. Death is familiar to the apprehensions of a soldier. Baxter had assisted at the hasty interment of thousands, the victims of the sword or of pestilence. Whether it was because this theatre of human calamity was new to him, and death, in order to be viewed with his ancient unconcern, must be accompanied in the ancient manner, with halberts and tents, certain it is, that Baxter was irresolute and timid in every thing that respected the yellow fever. The circumstances of the time suggested that this was a grave, to which some victim of this disease was to be consigned. His teeth chattered when he reflected how near he might now be to the source of infection; yet his curiosity retained him at his post. He fixed his eyes once more upon the door. In a short time the lady again appeared at it. She was in a stooping posture, and appeared to be dragging something along the floor. His blood ran cold at this spectacle. His fear instantly figured to itself a corpse, livid and contagious. Still he had no power to move. The lady's strength, enfeebled 6 as it was by grief, and perhaps by the absence of nourishment, seemed scarcely adequate to the task which she had assigned herself. Her burthen, whatever it was, was closely wrapt in a sheet. She drew it forward a few paces, then desisted, and seated herself on the ground, apparently to recruit her strength, and give vent to the agony of her thoughts in sighs. Her tears were either exhausted or refused to flow, for none were shed by her. Presently she resumed her undertaking. Baxter's horror increased in proportion as she drew nearer to the spot where he stood, and yet it seemed as if some fascination had forbidden him to recede. At length the burthen was drawn to the side of the opening in the earth. Here it seemed as if the mournful task was finished. She threw herself once more upon the earth. Her senses seemed for a time to have forsaken her. She sat buried in reverie, her eyes scarcely open and fixed upon the ground, and every feature set to the genuine expression of sorrow. Some disorder, occasioned by the circumstance of dragging, now took place in the vestment of what he had rightly predicted to be a dead body. The veil by accident was drawn aside, and exhibited, to the startled eye of Baxter, the pale and ghastly visage of the unhappy Monrose. This incident determined him. Every joint in his frame trembled, and he hastily withdrew from the fence. His first motion in doing this produced a noise by which the lady was alarmed; she suddenly threw her eyes upward, and gained a full view of Baxter's extraordinary countenance, just before it disappeared. She manifested her terror by a piercing shriek. Baxter did not stay to mark her subsequent conduct, to confirm or to dissipate her fears, but retired, in confusion, to his own house. Hitherto his caution had availed him. He had carefully avoided all employments and places from which he imagined imminent danger was to be dreaded. Now, through his own inadvertency, he had rushed, as he believed, into the jaws of the pest. His senses had not been assailed by any noisome effluvia. This was no unplausible ground for imagining that his death had some other cause than the yellow fever. This circumstance did not occur to Baxter. He had been told that Frenchmen were not susceptible of this contagion. He had hitherto believed this assertion, but now regarded it as having been fully confuted. He forgot that Frenchmen were undoubtedly mortal, and that there was no impossibility in Monrose's dying, even at this time, of a malady different from that which prevailed. Before morning he began to feel very unpleasant symptoms. He related his late adventure to his wife. She endeavored, by what arguments her slender ingenuity suggested, to quiet his apprehensions, but in vain. He hourly grew worse, and as soon as it was light, despatched his wife for a physician. On interrogating this messenger, the physician obtained information of last night's occurrences, and this being communicated to one of the dispensers of the public charity, they proceeded, early in the morning, to Monrose's house. It was closed as usual. They knocked and called, but no one answered. They examined every avenue to the dwelling, but none of them were accessible. They passed into the garden, and observed, on the spot marked out by Baxter, a heap of earth. A very slight exertion was sufficient to remove it and discover the body of the unfortunate exile beneath. After unsuccessfully trying various expedients for entering the house, they deemed themselves authorized to break the door. They entered, ascended the staircase, and searched every apartment in the house, but no human being was discoverable. The furniture was wretched and scanty, but there was no proof that Monrose had fallen a victim to the reigning disease. It was certain that the lady had disappeared. It was inconceivable whither she had gone. Baxter suffered a long period of sickness. The prevailing malady appeared upon him in its severest form. His strength of constitution, and the careful attendance of his wife, were insufficient to rescue him from the grave. His case may be quoted as an example of the force of imagination. He had probably already received, through the medium of the air, or by contact of which he was not conscious, the seeds of this disease. They might perhaps have lain dormant, had not this panic occurred to endow them with activity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. Such were the facts circumstantially communicated by Sarah. They afforded to Constantia a theme of ardent meditation. The similitude between her own destiny and that of this unhappy exile, could not fail to be observed. Immersed in poverty, friendless, burthened with the maintenance and nurture of her father, their circumstances were nearly parallel. The catastrophe of her tale, was the subject of endless but unsatisfactory conjecture. She had disappeared between the flight of Baxter and the dawn of day. What path had she taken? Was she now alive? Was she still an inhabitant of this city? Perhaps there was a coincidence of taste as well as fortunes between them. The only friend that Constantia ever enjoyed, congenial with her in principles, sex and age, was at a distance that forbade communication. She imagined that Ursula Monrose would prove worthy of her love, and felt unspeakable regret at the improbability of their ever meeting. Meanwhile the dominion of cold began to be felt, and the contagious fever entirely disappeared. The return of health was hailed with rapture, by all ranks of people. The streets were once more busy and frequented. The sensation of present security seemed to shut out from all hearts the memory of recent disasters. Public entertainments were thronged with auditors. A new theatre had lately been constructed, and a company of English Comedians had arrived during the prevalence of the malady. They now began their exhibitions, and their audiences were overflowing. Such is the motly and ambiguous condition of human society, such is the complexity of all effects from what cause soever they spring, that none can tell whether this destructive pestilence was, on the whole, productive of most pain or most pleasure. Those who had been sick and had recovered, found, in this circumstance, a source of exultation. Others made haste, by new marriages, to supply the place of wives, husbands and children, whom the scarcely extinguished pestilence had swept away. Constantia, however, was permitted to take no share in the general festivity. Such was the color of her fate, that the yellow fever, by affording her a respite from toil, supplying leisure for the acquisition of a useful branch of knowledge, and leading her to the discovery of a cheaper, more simple, and more wholesome method of subsistence, had been friendly, instead of adverse, to her happiness. Its disappearance, instead of relieving her from suffering, was the signal for the approach of new cares. Of her ancient customers, some were dead, and others were slow in resuming their ancient habitations, and their ordinary habits. Meanwhile two wants were now created and were urgent. The season demanded a supply of fuel, and her rent had accumulated beyond her power to discharge. M'Crea no sooner returned from the country, than he applied to her for payment. Some proprietors, guided by humanity, had remitted their dues, but M'Crea was not one of these. According to his own representation, no man was poorer than himself, and the punctual payment of all that was owing to him, was no more than sufficient to afford him a scanty subsistence. He was aware of the indigence of the Dudleys, and was therefore extremely importunate for payment, and could scarcely be prevailed upon to allow them the interval of a day, for the discovery of expedients. This day was passed by Constantia in fruitless anxieties. The ensuing evening had been fixed for a repetition of his visit. The hour arrived, but her invention was exhausted in vain. M'Crea was punctual to the minute. Constantia was allowed no option. She merely declared that the money demanded she had not to give, nor could she foresee any period at which her inability would be less than it then was. These declarations were heard by her visitant, with marks of unspeakable vexation. He did not fail to expatiate on the equity of his demands, the moderation and forbearance he had hitherto shewn, notwithstanding the extreme urgency of his own wants, and the inflexible rigor with which he had been treated by his creditors. This rhetoric was merely the prelude to an intimation that he must avail himself of any lawful means, by which he might gain possession of his own. This insinuation was fully comprehended by Constantia, but it was heard without any new emotions. Her knowledge 6* of her landlord's character taught her to expect but one consequence. He paused to observe what effect would be produced by this indirect menace. She answered, without any change of tone, that the loss of habitation and furniture, however inconvenient at this season, must be patiently endured. If it were to be prevented only by the payment of money, its prevention was impossible. M'Crea renewed his regrets, that there should be no other alternative. The law sanctioned his claims, and justice to his family, which was already large, and likely to increase, required that they should not be relinquished, yet such was the mildness of his temper and his aversion to proceed to this extremity, that he was willing to dispense with immediate payment on two conditions. First, that they should leave his house within a week, and secondly, that they should put into his hands some trinket or moveable, equal in value to the sum demanded, which should be kept by him as a pledge. This last hint suggested an expedient for obviating the present distress. The lute with which Mr. Dudley was accustomed to solace his solitude, was, if possible, more essential to his happiness than shelter or food. To his daughter it possessed little direct power to please. It was inestimable merely for her father's sake. Its intrinsic value was at least equal to the sum due, but to part with it was to bereave him of a good, which nothing else could supply. Besides, not being a popular and saleable instrument, it would probably be contemptuously rejected by the ignorance and avarice of M'Crea. There was another article in her possession, of some value in traffic, and of a kind which M'Crea was far more likely to accept. It was the miniature portrait of her friend, executed by a German artist, and set in gold. This image was a precious though imperfect substitute for sympathy and intercourse with the original. Habit had made this picture a source of a species of idolatry. Its power over her sensations was similar to that possessed by a beautiful Madonna over the heart of a juvenile enthusiast. It was the mother of the only devotion which her education had taught her to consider as beneficial or true. She perceived the necessity of parting with it on this occasion, with the utmost clearness, but this necessity was thought upon with indescribable repugnance. It seemed as if she had not thoroughly conceived the extent of her calamity till now. It seemed as if she could have endured the loss of eyes with less reluctance than the loss of this inestimable relic. Bitter were the tears which she shed over it as she took it from her bosom, and consigned it to those rapacious hands, that were stretched out to receive it. She derived some little consolation from the promises of this man, that he would keep it safely till she was able to redeem it. The other condition, that of immediate removal from the house, seemed at first sight impracticable. Some reflection, however, shewed her, that the change might not only be possible but useful. Among other expedients for diminishing expense, that of limiting her furniture and dwelling to the cheapest standard, had often occurred. She now remembered, that the house occupied by Monrose, was tenantless; that its antiquity, its remote and unpleasant situation, and its small dimensions, might induce M'Crea, to whom it belonged, to let it at a much lower price than that which he now exacted. M'Crea would have been better pleased if her choice had fallen on a different house, but he had powerful though sordid reasons for desiring the possession of this tenement. He assented therefore to her proposal, provided her removal took place without delay. In the present state of her funds this removal was impossible. Mere shelter, would not suffice during this inclement season. Without fuel, neither cold could be excluded, nor hunger relieved. There was nothing, convertible into money, but her lute. No sacrifice was more painful, but an irresistible necessity demanded it. Her interview with M'Crea took place while her father was absent from the room. On his return she related what had happened, and urged the necessity of parting with his favorite instrument. He listened to her tale with a sigh. Yes, said he, do what thou wilt, my child. It is unlikely that any one will purchase it. It is certain that no one will give for it what I gave; but thou may'st try. It has been to me a faithful friend. I know not how I should have lived without it. Its notes have cheered me with the sweet remembrances of old times. It was, in some degree, a substitute for the eyes which I have lost, but now let it go, and perform for me perhaps the dearest of its services. It may help us to sustain the severities of this season. There was no room for delay. She immediately set out in search of a purchaser. Such a one was most likely to be found in the keeper of a musical repository, who had lately arrived from Europe. She entertained but slight hopes that an instrument, scarcely known among her neighbors, would be bought at any price, however inconsiderable. She found the keeper of the shop engaged in conversation with a lady, whose person and face instantly arrested the attention of Constantia. A less sagacious observer would have eyed the stranger with indifference. But Constantia was ever busy in interpreting the language of features and looks. Her sphere of observation had been narrow, but her habits of examining, comparing and deducing, had thoroughly exhausted that sphere. These habits were eminently strong, with relation to this class of objects. She delighted to investigate the human countenance, and treasured up numberless conclusions as to the coincidence between mental and external qualities. She had often been forcibly struck by forms that were accidentally seen, and which abounded with this species of mute expression. They conveyed at a single glance, what could not be imparted by volumes. The features and shape sunk, as it were, into perfect harmony with sentiments and passions. Every atom of the frame was pregnant with significance. In some, nothing was remarkable but this power of the outward figure to exhibit the internal sentiments. In others, the intelligence thus unveiled, was remarkable for its heterogeneous or energetic qualities; for its tendency to fill her heart with veneration or abhorrence, or to involve her in endless perplexities. The accuracy and vividness with which pictures of this kind presented themselves to her imagination, resembled the operations of a sixth sense. It cannot be doubted, however, that much was owing to the enthusiastic tenor of her own conceptions, and that her conviction of the truth of the picture, principally flowed from the distinctness and strength of its hues. The figure which she now examined, was small but of exquisite proportions. Her complexion testified the influence of a torrid sun, but the darkness veiled, without obscuring, the glowing tints of her cheek. The shade was remarkably deep, but a deeper still was required to become incompatible with beauty. Her features were irregular, but defects of symmetry were amply supplied by eyes that anticipated speech, and positions which conveyed that to which language was inadequate. It was not the chief tendency of her appearance to seduce or to melt. Her's were the polished cheek and the mutability of muscle, which belong to woman, but the genius conspicuous in her aspect, was heroic and contemplative. The female was absorbed, so to speak, in the rational creature, and the emotions most apt to be excited in the gazer, partook less of love than of reverence. Such is the portrait of this stranger, delineated by Constantia. I copy it with greater willingness, because if we substitute a nobler stature, and a complexion less uniform and delicate, it is suited, with the utmost accuracy, to herself. She was probably unconscious of this resemblance, but this circumstance may be supposed to influence her in discovering such attractive properties in a form thus vaguely seen. These impressions, permanent and cogent as they were, were gained at a single glance. The purpose which led her thither was too momentous to be long excluded. Why, said the master of the shop, this is lucky. Here is a lady who has just been inquiring for an instrument of this kind. Perhaps the one you have will suit her. If you will bring it to me, I will examine it, and if it is complete, will make a bargain with you.—He then turned to the lady who had first entered, and a short dialogue in French ensued between them. The man repeated his assurances to Constantia, who, promising to hasten back with the instrument, took her leave. The lute, in its structure and ornaments, has rarely been surpassed. When scrutinized by this artist, it proved to be complete, and the price demanded for it was readily given. By this means the Dudleys were enabled to change their habitation, and to supply themselves with fuel. To obviate future exigencies, Constantia betook herself, once more, to the needle. They persisted in the use of their simple fare, and endeavored to contract their wants and methodize their occupations, by a standard as rigid as possible. She had not relinquished her design of adopting a new and more liberal profession, but though, when indistinctly and generally considered, it seemed easily effected, yet the first steps which it would be proper to take, did not clearly or readily suggest themselves. For the present she was contented to pursue the beaten tract, but was prepared to benefit by any occasion that time might furnish, suitable to the execution of her plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. It may be asked, if a woman of this character did not attract the notice of the world. Her station, no less than her modes of thinking, excluded her from the concourse of the opulent and the gay. She kept herself in privacy, her engagements confined her to her own fireside, and her neighbors enjoyed no means of penetrating through that obscurity in which she wrapt herself. There were, no doubt, persons of her own sex, capable of estimating her worth, and who could have hastened to raise so much merit from the indigence to which it was condemned. She might, at least, have found associates and friends, justly entitled to her affection. But whether she were peculiarly unfortunate in this respect, or whether it arose from a jealous and unbending spirit that would remit none of its claims to respect, and was backward in its overtures to kindness and intimacy, it so happened that her hours were, for a long period, enlivened by no companion but her father and her faithful Lucy. The humbleness of her dwelling, her plain garb, and the meanness of her occupation, were no passports to the favor of the rich and vain. These, added to her youth and beauty, frequently exposed her to insults, from which, though productive for a time of mortification and distress, she, for the most part, extricated herself by her spirited carriage, and presence of mind. One incident of this kind it will be necessary to mention. One evening her engagements carried her abroad. She had proposed to return immediately, finding by experience the danger that was to be dreaded by a woman young and unprotected. Somewhat occurred that unavoidably lengthened her stay, and she set out on her return at a late hour. One of the other sex offered her his guardianship, but this she declined, and poceeded homeward alone. Her way lay through streets but little inhabited, and whose few inhabitants were of the profligate class. She was conscious of the inconveniences to which she was exposed, and therefore tripped along with all possible haste. She had not gone far before she perceived, through the dusk, two men standing near a porch before her. She had gone too far to recede or change her course without exciting observation, and she flattered herself that the persons would behave with decency. Encouraged by these reflections, and somewhat hastening her pace, she went on. As soon as she came opposite the place where they stood, one of them threw himself round, and caught her arm, exclaiming, in a broad tone, "Whither so fast, my love, at this time of night?" The other, at the same time, threw his arms round her waist, crying out, "A pretty prize, by G—; just in the nick of time." They were huge and brawny fellows, in whose grasp her feeble strength was annihilated. Their motions were so sudden, that she had not time to escape by flight. Her struggles merely furnished them with a subject of laughter. He that held her waist, proceeded to pollute her cheeks with his kisses, and drew her into the porch. He tore her from the grasp of him who first seized her, who seemed to think his property invaded, and said, in a surly tone; "What now, Jemmy? Damn your heart, d'ye think I'll be fobbed? Have done with your slabbering, Jemmy. First come, first served;" and seemed disposed to assert his claims by force. To this brutality, Constantia had nothing to oppose but fruitless struggles and shrieks for help. Succor was, fortunately, at hand. Her exclamations were heard by a person across the street, who instantly ran, and with some difficulty disengaged her from the grasp of the ruffians. He accompanied her the rest of the way, bestowed on her every polite attention, and, though pressed to enter the house, declined the invitation. She had no opportunity of examining the appearance of her new friend. This, the darkness of the night and her own panic, prevented. Next day a person called upon her whom she instantly recognized to be her late protector. He came with some message from his sister. His manners were simple and unostentatious, and breathed the genuine spirit of civility. Having performed his commission, and once more received the thanks which she poured forth with peculiar warmth, for his last night's interposition, he took his leave. The name of this man was Balfour. He was middle-aged, of a figure neither elegant nor ungainly, and an aspect that was mild and placid, but betrayed few marks of intelligence. He was an adventurer from Scotland, whom a strict adherence to the maxims of trade had rendered opulent. He was governed by the principles of mercantile integrity in all his dealings, and was affable and kind, without being generous, in his treatment of inferiors. He was a stranger to violent emotions of any kind, and his intellectual acquisitions were limited to his own profession. His demeanor was tranquil and uniform. He was sparing of words, and these were uttered in the softest manner. In all his transactions, he was sedate and considerate. In his dress and mode of living, there were no appearances of parsimony, but there were, likewise, as few traces of profusion. His sister had shared in his prosperity. As soon as his affairs would permit, he sent for her to Scotland, where she had lived in a state little removed from penury, and had for some years, been vested with the superintendence of his household. There was a considerable resemblance between them in person and character. Her profession, or those arts in which her situation had compelled her to acquire skill, had not an equal tendency to enlarge the mind, as those of her brother, but the views of each were limited to one set of objects. His superiority was owing, not to any inherent difference, but to accident. Balfour's life had been a model of chasteness and regularity: though this was owing more to constitutional coldness and a frugal spirit, than to virtuous forbearance; but, in his schemes for the future, he did not exclude the circumstance of marriage. Having attained a situation secure, as the nature of human affairs will admit, from the chances of poverty, the way was sufficiently prepared for matrimony. His thoughts had been for some time employed in the selection of a suitable companion, when this rencounter happened with Miss Dudley. Balfour was not destitute of those feelings which are called into play by the sight of youth and beauty in distress. This incident was not speedily forgotten. The emotions produced by it were new to him. He reviewed them oftener, and with more complacency, than any which he had before experienced. They afforded him so much satisfaction, that, in order to preserve them undiminished, he resolved to repeat his visit. Constantia treated him as one from whom she had received a considerable benefit. Her sweetness and gentleness were uniform, and Balfour found that her humble roof promised him more happiness than his own fireside, or the society of his professional brethren. He could not overlook, in the course of such reflections as these, the question relative to marriage, and speedily determined to solicit the honor of her hand. He had not decided without his usual foresight and deliberation; nor had he been wanting in the accuracy of his observations and inquiries. Those qualifications, indeed, which were of chief value in his eyes, lay upon the surface. He was no judge of her intellectual character, or of the loftiness of her morality. Not even the graces of person, or features, or manners, attracted much of his attention. He remarked her admirable economy of time, and money, and labor, the simplicity of her dress, her evenness of temper, and her love of seclusion. These were essential requisites of a wife in his apprehension. The insignificance of his own birth, the lowness of his original fortune, and the efficacy of industry and temperance to confer and maintain wealth, had taught him indifference as to birth or fortune in his spouse. His moderate desires in this respect were gratified, and he was anxious only for a partner that would aid him in preserving, rather than in enlarging his property. He esteemed himself 7 eminently fortunate in meeting with one in whom every matrimonial qualification concentred. He was not deficient in modesty, but he fancied that, on this occasion, there was no possibility of miscarriage. He held her capacity in deep veneration, but this circumstance rendered him more secure of success. He conceived this union to be even more eligible with regard to her than to himself; and confided in the rectitude of her understanding, for a decision favorable to his wishes. Before any express declaration was made, Constantia easily predicted the event from the frequency of his visits, and the attentiveness of his manners. It was no difficult task to ascertain this man's character. Her modes of thinking were, in few respects, similar to those of her lover. She was eager to investigate, in the first place, the attributes of his mind. His professional and household maxims were not of inconsiderable importance, but they were subordinate considerations. In the poverty of his discourse and ideas, she quickly found reasons for determining her conduct. Marriage she had but little considered, as it is in itself. What are the genuine principles of that relation, and what conduct with respect to it, is prescribed to rational beings, by their duty, she had not hitherto investigated. But she was not backward to inquire what are the precepts of duty, in her own particular case. She knew herself to be young; she was sensible of the daily enlargement of her knowledge; every day contributed to rectify some error or confirm some truth. These benefits she owed to her situation, which, whatever were its evils, gave her as much freedom from restraint as is consistent with the state of human affairs. Her poverty fettered her exertions, and circumscribed her pleasures. Poverty, therefore, was an evil, and the reverse of poverty to be desired. But riches were not barren of constraint, and its advantages might be purchased at too dear a rate. Allowing that the wife is enriched by marriage, how humiliating were the conditions annexed to it in the present case? The company of one with whom we have no sympathy, nor sentiments in common, is, of all species of solitude, the most loathsome and dreary. The nuptial life is attended with peculiar aggravations, since the tie is infrangible, and the choice of a more suitable companion, if such a one should offer, is forever precluded. The hardships of wealth are not incompensated by some benefits, but these benefits, false and hollow as they are, cannot be obtained by marriage. Her acceptance of Balfour would merely aggravate her indigence. Now she was at least mistress of the product of her own labor. Her tasks were toilsome, but the profits, though slender, were sure, and she administered her little property in what manner she pleased. Marriage would annihilate this power. Henceforth she would be bereft even of personal freedom. So far from possessing property, she herself would become the property of another. She was not unaware of the consequences flowing from differences of capacity; and, that power, to whomsoever legally granted, will be exercised by the most addressful; but she derived no encouragement from these considerations. She would not stoop to gain her end by the hateful arts of the sycophant; and was too wise to place an unbounded reliance on the influence of truth. The character, likewise, of this man sufficiently exempted him from either of those influences. She did not forget the nature of the altar vows. To abdicate the use of her own understanding, was scarcely justifiable in any case, but to vow an affection that was not felt, and could not be compelled, and to promise obedience to one, whose judgment was glaringly defective, were acts atrociously criminal. Education, besides, had created in her an insurmountable abhorrence of admitting to conjugal privileges, the man who had no claim upon her love. It could not be denied that a state of abundant accommodation was better than the contrary, but this consideration, though in the most rational estimate, of some weight, she was not so depraved and effeminate as to allow to overweigh the opposite evils. Homely liberty was better than splendid servitude. Her resolution was easily formed, but there were certain impediments in the way of its execution. These chiefly arose from deference to the opinion, and compassion for the infirmities of her father. He assumed no control over her actions. His reflections in the present case, were rather understood than expressed. When uttered it was with the mildness of equality, and the modesty of persuasion. It was this circumstance that conferred upon them all their force. His decision, on so delicate a topic, was not wanting in sagacity and moderation; but, as a man, he had his portion of defects, and his frame was enfeebled by disease and care; yet he set no higher value on the ease and independence of his former condition, than any man of like experience. He could not endure to exist on the fruits of his daughter's labor. He ascribed her decision to a spirit of excessive refinement, and was, of course, disposed to give little quarter to maiden scruples. They were phantoms, he believed, which experience would dispel. His morality, besides, was of a much more flexible kind; and the marriage vows were, in his opinion, formal and unmeaning, and neither in themselves, nor in the apprehension of the world, accompanied with any rigorous obligation. He drew more favorable omens from the known capacity of his daughter, and the flexibility of her lover. She demanded his opinion and advice. She listened to his reasonings, and revolved them with candor and impartiality. She stated her objections with simplicity, but the difference of age and sex was sufficient to preclude agreement. Arguments were of no use but to prolong the debate; but, happily, the magnanimity of Mr. Dudley would admit of no sacrifice. Her opinions, it is true, were erroneous; but he was willing that she should regulate her conduct by her own conceptions of right, and not by those of another. To refuse Balfour's offers was an evil, but an evil inexpressibly exceeded by that of accepting them contrary to her own sense of propriety. Difficulties, likewise, arose from the consideration of what was due to the man who had already benefited her, and who, in this act, intended to confer upon her further benefit. These, though the source of some embarrassments, were not sufficient to shake her resolution. Balfour could not understand her principal objections. They were of a size altogether disproportioned to his capacity. Her moral speculations were quite beyond the sphere of his reflections. She could not expatiate, without a breach of civility, on the disparity of their minds, and yet this was the only or principal ground on which she had erected her scruples. Her father loved her too well not to be desirous of relieving her from a painful task, though undertaken without necessity, and contrary to his opinion. Refer him to me, said he; I will make the best of the matter, and render your refusal as palatable as possible, but do you authorize me to make it absolute, and without appeal?— My dear father! how good you are! but that shall be my province. If I err, let the consequences of my mistake be confined to myself. It would be cruel indeed, to make you the instrument in a transaction which your judgment disapproves. My reluctance was a weak and foolish thing. Strange, indeed, if the purity of my motives will not bear me out on this, as it has done on many more arduous occasions. Well, be it so; that is best I believe. Ten to one but I, with my want of eyes, would blunder, while yours will be of no small use, in a contest with a lover. They will serve you to watch the transitions in his placid physiognomy, and overpower his discontents. She was aware of the inconveniences to which this resolution would subject her, but since they were unavoidable, she armed herself with the requisite patience. Her apprehensions were not without reason. More than one conference was necessary to convince him of her meaning, and in order to effect her purpose, she was obliged to behave with so much explicitness, as to hazard giving him offence. This affair was productive of no small vexation. He had put too much faith in the validity of his pretensions, and the benefits of perseverance, to be easily shaken off. This decision was not borne by him with as much patience as she wished. He deemed himself unjustly treated, and his resentment exceeded those bounds of moderation which he prescribed to himself on all other occasions. From his anger, however, there was not much to be dreaded, but, unfortunately, his sister partook of his indignation and indulged her petulance, which was enforced by every gossiping and tatling propensity, to the irreparable disadvantage of Constantia. She owed her support to her needle. She was dependent therefore on the caprice of customers. This caprice 7* was swayable by every breath, and paid a merely subordinate regard, in the choice of workwomen, to the circumstances of skill, cheapness and diligence. In consequence of this, her usual sources of subsistence began to fail. Indigence, as well as wealth, is comparative. He, indeed, must be wretched, whose food, clothing and shelter are limited, both in kind and quantity, by the standard of mere necessity; who, in the choice of food, for example, is governed by no consideration but its cheapness, and its capacity to sustain nature. Yet to this degree of wretchedness was Miss Dudley reduced. As her means of subsistence began to decay, she reflected on the change of employment that might become necessary. She was mistress of no lucrative art, but that which now threatened to be useless. There was but one avenue through which she could hope to escape from the pressure of absolute want. This, she regarded with an aversion, that nothing but extreme necessity, and the failure of every other expedient, would be able to subdue. This was the hiring herself as a servant. Even that could not answer all her purposes. If a subsistence were provided by it for herself, whither should her father, and her Lucy betake themselves for support. Hitherto her labor had been sufficient to shut out famine and the cold. It is true she had been cut off from all the direct means of personal or mental gratification; but her constitution had exempted her from the insalutary effects of sedentary application. She could not tell how long she could enjoy this exemption, but it was absurd to anticipate those evils which might never arrive. Meanwhile, her situation was not destitute of comfort. The indirect means of intellectual improvement, in conversation and reflection, the inexpensive amusement of singing, and, above all, the consciousness of performing her duty, and maintaining her independence inviolate, were still in her possession. Her lodging was humble, and her fare frugal, but these, temperance and a due regard to the use of money, would require from the most opulent. Now, retrenchments must be made even from this penurious provision. Her exertions might somewhat defer, but could not prevent the ruin of her unhappy family. Their landlord was a severe exacter of his dues. The day of quarterly payment was past, and he had not failed in his usual punctuality. She was unable to satisfy his demands, and Mr. Dudley was officially informed, that unless payment was made before a day fixed, resort would be had to the law, in that case made and provided. This seemed to be the completion of their misfortunes. It was not enough to soften the implacability of their landlord. A respite might possibly be obtained from this harsh sentence. Intreaties might prevail upon him to allow of their remaining under this roof for some time longer; but shelter at this inclement season was not enough. Without fire they must perish with the cold; and fuel could be procured only for money, of which the last shilling was expended. Food was no less indispensable, and, their credit being gone, not a loaf could be extorted from the avarice of the bakers in the neighborhood. The sensations produced by this accumulation of distress may be more easily conceived than described. Mr. Dudley sunk into despair, when Lucy informed him that the billet of wood she was putting on the fire was the last. Well, said he, the game is up. Where is my daughter?— The answer was that she was up stairs. Why, there she has been this hour. Tell her to come down and warm herself. She must needs be cold and here is a cheerful blaze. I feel it myself. Like the lightning that precedes death, it beams thus brightly, though, in a few moments, it will be extinguished forever. Let my darling come, and partake of its comforts before they expire. Constantia had retired in order to review her situation, and devise some expedients that might alleviate it. It was a sore extremity to which she was reduced. Things had come to a desperate pass, and the remedy required must be no less desperate. It was impossible to see her father perish. She herself would have died before she would have condescended to beg. It was not worth prolonging a life which must subsist upon alms. She would have wandered into the fields at dusk, have seated herself upon an unfrequented bank, and serenely waited the approach of that death, which the rigors of the season would have rendered sure. But, as it was, it became her to act in a very different manner. During her father's prosperity, some mercantile intercourse had taken place between him and a merchant of this city. The latter, on some occasion, had spent a few nights at her father's house. She was greatly charmed with the humanity that shone forth in his conversation and behavior. From that time to this, all intercourse had ceased. She was acquainted with the place of his abode, and knew him to be affluent. To him she determined to apply as a suppliant in behalf of her father. She did not inform Mr. Dudley of this intention, conceiving it best to wait till the event had been ascertained, for fear of exciting fallacious expectations. She was further deterred by the apprehension of awakening his pride, and bringing on herself an absolute prohibition. She arrived at the door of Mr. Melbourne's house, and inquiring for the master of it, was informed that he had gone out of town, and was not expected to return within a week. Her scheme, which was by no means unplausible, was thus completely frustrated. There was but one other resource, on which she had already deliberated, and to which she had determined to apply, if that should fail. That was to claim assistance from the superintendents of the poor. She was employed in considering to which of them, and in what manner she should make her application, when she turned the corner of Lombard and Second streets. That had scarcely been done, when, casting her eyes mournfully round her, she caught a glimpse of a person whom she instantly recognised, passing into the market place. She followed him with quick steps, and, on a second examination, found that she had not been mistaken. This was no other than Thomas Craig, to whose malignity and cunning, all her misfortunes were imputable. She was at first uncertain what use to make of this discovery. She followed him almost instinctively, and saw him at length enter the Indian Queen Tavern. Here she stopped. She entertained a confused conception, that some beneficial consequences might be extracted from this event. In the present hurry of her thoughts she could form no satisfactory conclusion; but it instantly occurred to her that it would, at least be proper to ascertain the place of his abode. She stept into the inn, and made the suitable inquiries. She was informed that the gentleman had come from Baltimore, a month before, and had since resided at that house. How soon he meant to leave the city, her informant was unable to tell. Having gained this intelligence, she returned home, and once more shut herself in her chamber to meditate on this new posture of affairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Craig was indebted to her father. He had defrauded him by the most atrocious and illicit arts. On either account he was liable to prosecution, but her heart rejected the thought of being the author of injury to any man. The dread of punishment, however, might induce him to refund, uncoercively, the whole or some part of the stolen property. Money was at this moment necessary to existence, and she conceived herself justly entitled to that, of which her father had been perfidiously despoiled. But the law was formal and circuitous. Money itself was necessary to purchase its assistance. Besides, it could not act with unseen virtue and instantaneous celerity. The co-operation of advocates and officers was required. They must be visited, and harangued, and importuned. Was she adequate to the task? Would the energy of her mind supply the place of experience, and, with a sort of miraculous efficacy, afford her the knowledge of official processes and dues? As little, on this occasion, could be expected from her father, as from her. He was infirm and blind. The spirit that animated his former days was flown. His heart's blood was chilled by the rigors of his fortune. He had discarded his indignation and his enmities, and, together with them, hope itself had perished in his bosom. He waited in tranquil despair, for that stroke which would deliver him from life, and all the woes that it inherits. But these considerations were superfluous. It was enough that justice must be bought, and that she had not the equivalent. Legal proceedings are encumbered with delay, and her necessities were urgent. Succor, if withheld till the morrow, would be useless. Hunger and cold would not be trifled with. What resource was there left in this her uttermost distress? Must she yield, in imitation of her father, to the cowardly suggestions of despair? Craig might be rich. His coffers might be stuffed with thousands. All that he had, according to the principles of social equity, was hers; yet he, to whom nothing belonged, rioted in superfluity, while she, the rightful claimant, was driven to the point of utmost need. The proper instrument of her restoration was law, but its arm was powerless, for she had not the means of bribing it into activity. But was law the only instrument? Craig, perhaps, was accessible. Might she not, with propriety, demand an interview, and lay before him the consequences of his baseness? He was not divested of the last remains of humanity. It was impossible that he should not relent at the picture of those distresses of which he was the author. Menaces of legal prosecution she meant not to use, because she was unalterably resolved against that remedy. She confided in the efficacy of her pleadings to awaken his justice. This interview she was determined immediately to seek. She was aware that by some accident her purpose might be frustrated. Access to his person, might, for the present, be impossible, or might be denied. It was proper therefore to write him a letter, which might be substituted in place of an interview. It behoved her to be expeditious, for the light was failing, and her strength was nearly exhausted by the hurry of her spirits. Her fingers, likewise, were benumbed with the cold. She performed her task, under these disadvantages, with much difficulty. This was the purport of her letter. Thomas Craig, An hour ago I was in Second street, and saw you. I followed you till you entered the Indian Queen Tavern. Knowing where you are, I am now preparing to demand an interview. I may be disappointed in this hope, and therefore write you this. I do not come to upbraid you, to call you to a legal, or any other account for your actions. I presume not to weigh your merits. The God of equity he your judge. May he be as merciful, in the hour of retribution, as I am disposed to be. It is only to inform you that my father is on the point of perishing with want. You know who it was that reduced him to this condition. I persuade myself I shall not appeal to your justice in vain. Learn of this justice to afford him instant succor. You know who it was that took you in, a houseless wanderer; protected and fostered your youth, and shared with you his confidence and his fortune. It is he who now, blind and indigent, is threatened, by an inexorable landlord, to be thrust into the street; and who is, at this moment, without fire and without bread. He once did you some little service; now he looks to be compensated. All the retribution he asks, is to be saved from perishing. Surely you will not spurn at his claims. Thomas Craig has done nothing that shews him deaf to the cries of distress. He would relieve a dog from such suffering. Forget that you have known my father in any character but that of a supplicant for bread. I promise you that, on this condition, I, also, will forget it. If you are so far just, you have nothing to fear. Your property and reputation shall both be safe. My father knows not of your being in this city. His enmities are extinct, and if you comply with this request, he shall know you only as a benefactor. C. Dudley. Having finished and folded this epistle, she once more returned to the tavern. A waiter informed her that Craig had lately been in, and was now gone out to spend the evening. Whither had he gone? she asked. How was he to know where gentlemen eat their suppers? Did she take him for a witch? What, in God's name, did she want with him at that hour? Could she not wait, at least, till he had done his supper? He warranted her pretty face would bring him home time enough. Constantia was not disconcerted at this address. She knew that females are subjected, through their own ignorance and cowardice, to a thousand mortifications. She set its true value on base and low minded treatment. She disdained to notice this ribaldry, but turned away from the servant to meditate on this disappointment. A few moments after, a young fellow smartly dressed, entered the apartment. He was immediately addressed by the other, who said to him, Well, Tom, where's your master. There's a lady wants him, pointing to Constantia, and laying a grinning emphasis on the word lady. She turned to the new comer: Friend, are you Mr. Craig's servant? The fellow seemed somewhat irritated at the bluntness of her interrogatory. The appellation of servant sat uneasily, perhaps, on his pride, especially as coming from a person of her appearance. He put on an air of familiar ridicule, and surveyed her in silence. She resumed, in an authoritative tone, where does Mr. Craig spend this evening? I have business with him of the highest importance, and that will not bear delay. I must see him this night.—He seemed preparing to make some impertinent answer, but she anticipated it. You had better answer me with decency. If you do not, your master shall hear of it. This menace was not ineffectual. He began to perceive himself in the wrong, and surlily muttered, Why, if you must know, he is gone to Mr. Ormond's. And where lived Mr. Ormond? In Arch Street; he mentioned the number on her questioning him to that effect. Being furnished with this information, she left them. Her project was not to be thwarted by slight impediments, and she forthwith proceeded to Ormond's dwelling. Who was this Ormond? she inquired of herself as she went along; whence originated, and of what nature is the connexion between him and Craig? Are they united by union of designs and sympathy of character, or is this stranger a new subject on whom Craig is practising his arts? The last supposition is not impossible. Is it not my duty to disconcert his machinations, and save a new victim from his treachery? But I ought to be sure before I act. He may now be honest, or tending to honesty, and my inteference may cast him backward, or impede his progress. The house to which she had been directed was spacious and magnificent. She was answered by a servant, whose uniform was extremely singular and fanciful, and whose features and accents bespoke him to be English, with a politeness to which she knew that the simplicity of her garb gave her no title. Craig, he told her, was in the drawing room above stairs. He offered to carry him any message, and ushured her, meanwhile, into a parlor. She was surprised at the splendor of the room. The ceiling was painted with a gay design, the walls stuccoed in relief, and the floor covered with a Persian carpet, with suitable accompaniments of mirrors, tables and sofas. Craig had been seated at the window above. His suspicions were ever on the watch. He suddenly espied a figure and face on the opposite side of the street, which an alteration of garb and the improvements of time, could not conceal from his knowledge. He was startled at this incident, without knowing the extent of its consequences. He saw her cross the way opposite this house, and immediately after heard the bell ring. Still he was not aware that he himself was the object of this visit, and waited, with some degree of impatience, for the issue of this adventure. Presently he was summoned to a person below, who wished to see him. The servant shut the door, as soon as he had delivered the message, and retired. Craig was thrown into considerable perplexity. It was seldom that he was wanting in presence of mind and dexterity, but the unexpectedness of this incident, made him pause. He had not forgotten the awful charms of his summoner. He shrunk at the imagination of her rebukes. What purpose could be answered by admitting her? It was, undoubtedly, safest to keep at a distance, but what excuse should be given for refusing this interview? He was roused from his reverie by a second and more urgent summons. The person could not conveniently wait; her business was of the utmost moment, and would detain him but a few minutes. The anxiety which was thus expressed to see him, only augmented his solicitude to remain invisible. He had papers before him which he had been employed in examining. This suggested an excuse. Tell her that I am engaged just now, and cannot possibly attend to her. Let her leave her business. If she has any message you may bring it to me. 8 It was plain to Constantia that Craig suspected the purpose of her visit. This might have come to his knowledge by means impossible for her to divine. She now perceived the wisdom of the precaution she had taken. She gave her letter to the servant with this message; Tell him I shall wait here for an answer, and continue to wait till I receive one. Her mind was powerfully affected by the criticalness of her situation. She had gone thus far, and saw the necessity of persisting to the end. The goal was within view, and she formed a sort of desperate determination not to relinquish the pursuit. She could not overlook the possibility that he might return no answer, or return an unsatisfactory one. In either case, she was resolved to remain in the house till driven from it by violence. What other resolution could she form? To return to her desolate home, penniless, was an idea not to be endured. The letter was received, and perused. His conscience was touched, but compunction was a guest, whose importunities he had acquired a peculiar facility of eluding. Here was a liberal offer. A price was set upon his impunity. A small sum, perhaps, would secure him from all future molestation.—She spoke, to be sure, in a damned high tone. 'Twas a pity that the old man should be hungry before supper time. Blind too! Harder still, when he cannot find his way to his mouth. Rent unpaid, and a flinty-hearted landlord. A pretty pickle to be sure. Instant payment she says. Won't part without it. Must come down with the stuff. I know this girl. When her heart is once set upon a thing, all the devils will not turn her out of her way. She promises silence. I can't pretend to bargain with her. I 'd as lief be ducked, as meet her face to face. I know she 'll do what she promises. That was always her grand failing. How the little witch talks! Just the dreamer she ever was! Justice! Compassion! Stupid fool! One would think she 'd learned something of the world by this time. He took out his pocket book. Among the notes it contained the lowest was fifty dollars. This was too much, yet there was no alternative, something must be given. She had detected his abode, and he knew it was in the power of the Dudleys to ruin his reputation, and obstruct his present schemes. It was probable, that if they should exert themselves, their cause would find advocates and patrons. Still the gratuitous gift of fifty dollars, sat uneasily upon his avarice. One idea occurred to reconcile him to the gift. There was a method he conceived of procuring the repayment of it with interest. He inclosed the note in a blank piece of paper and sent it to her. She received the paper, and opened it with trembling fingers. When she saw what were its contents, her feelings amounted to rapture. A sum like this was affluence to her in her present condition. At least it would purchase present comfort and security. Her heart glowed with exultation, and she seemed to tread with the lightness of air, as she hied homeward. The langour of a long fast, the numbness of the cold, were forgotten. It is worthy of remark how much of human accommodation was comprised within this small compass; and how sudden was this transition from the verge of destruction to the summit of security. Her first business was to call upon her landlord and pay him his demand. On her return she discharged the little debts she had been obliged to contract, and purchased what was immediately necessary. Wood she could borrow from her next neighbor, and this she was willing to do, now that she had the prospect of repaying it.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. On leaving Mr. Ormond's house, Constantia was met by that gentleman. He saw her as she came out, and was charmed with the simplicity of her appearance. On entering he interrogated the servant as to the business that brought her thither. So, said he, as he entered the drawing-room, where Craig was seated, you have had a visitant. She came, it seems, on a pressing occasion, and would be put off with nothing but a letter. Craig had not expected this address, but it only precipitated the execution of a design that he had formed. Being aware of this or similar accidents, he had constructed and related on a previous occasion to Ormond, a story suitable to his purpose. Aye, said he, in a tone of affected compassion, it is a sad affair enough. I am sorry 'tis not in my power to help the poor girl. She is wrong in imputing her father's misfortunes to me, but I know the source of her mistake. Would to heaven it was in my power to repair the wrongs they have suffered, not from me, but from one whose relationship is a disgrace to me. Perhaps, replied the other, you are willing to explain this affair. Yes, I wish to explain it. I was afraid of some such accident as this. An explanation is due to my character. I have already told you my story. I mentioned to you a brother of mine. There is scarcely thirteen months difference in our ages. There is a strong resemblance between him and me, in our exterior, though I hope there is none at all in our minds. This brother was a partner of a gentleman, the father of this girl, at New York. He was, a long time, nothing better than an apprentice to Mr. Dudley, but he advanced so much in the good graces of his master, that he finally took him into partnership. I did not know till I arrived on the continent, the whole of his misconduct. It appears that he embezzled the property of the house, and fled away with it, and the consequence was, that his quondam master was ruined. I am often mistaken for my brother, to my no small inconvenience; but all this I told you formerly. See what a letter I just now received from this girl. Craig was one of the most plausible of men. His character was a standing proof of the vanity of physiognomy. There were few men who could refuse their confidence to his open and ingenuous aspect. To this circumstance, perhaps, he owed his ruin. His temptations to deceive were stronger than what are incident to most other men. Deception was so easy a task, that the difficulty lay, not in infusing false opinions respecting him, but in preventing them from being spontaneously imbibed. He contracted habits of imposture imperceptibly. In proportion as he deviated from the practice of truth, he discerned the necessity of extending and systematizing his efforts, and of augmenting the original henignity and attractiveness of his looks, by studied additions. The further he proceeded, the more difficult it was to return. Experience and habit added daily to his speciousness, till at length, the world perhaps might have been searched in vain for his competitor. He had been introduced to Ormond under the most favorable auspices. He had provided against a danger which he knew to be imminent, by relating his own story as if it were his brother's. He had, however, made various additions to it, serving to aggravate the heinousness of his guilt. This arose partly from policy, and partly from the habit of lying, which was prompted by a fertile invention, and rendered inveterate by incessant exercise. He interwove in his tale, an intrigue between Miss Dudley and his brother. The former was seduced, and this man had employed his skill in chirographical imitation, in composing letters from Miss Dudley to his brother, which sufficiently attested her dishonor. He and his brother, he related, to have met in Jamaica, where the latter died, by which means his personal property and papers came into his possession. Ormond read the letter which his companion presented to him on this occasion. The papers which Craig had formerly permitted him to inspect, had made him familiar with her handwriting. The penmanship was, indeed, similar, yet this was written in a spirit not quite congenial with that which had dictated her letters to her lover. But he reflected that the emergency was extraordinary, and that the new scenes through which she had passed, had, perhaps, enabled her to retrieve her virtue and enforce it. The picture which she drew of her father's distresses, affected him and his companion very differently. He pondered on it for some time, in silence; he then looked up, and with his usual abruptness said, I suppose you gave her something? No. I was extremely sorry that it was not in my power. I have nothing but a little trifling silver about me. I have no more at home than will barely suffice to pay my board here, and my expenses to Baltimore. Till I reach there I cannot expect a supply. I was less uneasy, I confess, on this account, because I knew you to be equally willing and much more able to afford the relief she asks. This, Mr. Ormond had predetermined to do. He paused only to deliberate in what manner it could, with most propriety, 8* be done. He was always willing, when he conferred benefits, to conceal the author. He was not displeased when gratitude was misplaced, and readily allowed his instruments to act as if they were principals. He questioned not the veracity of Craig, and was, therefore, desirous to free him from the molestation that was threatened in the way which had been prescribed. He put a note of one hundred dollars into his hand, and enjoined him to send it to the Dudleys that evening, or early the next morning. I am pleased, he added, with the style of this letter; it can be of no service to you; leave it in my possession. Craig would much rather have thrown it into the fire; but he knew the character of his companion, and was afraid to make any objection to his request. He promised to send, or carry the note, the next morning, before he set out on his intended journey. This journey was to Baltimore, and was undertaken so soon merely to oblige his friend, who was desirous of remitting to Baltimore a considerable sum in English guineas, and who had been for some time in search of one who might execute this commission with fidelity. The offer of Craig had been joyfully accepted, and next morning had been the time fixed for his departure, a period the most opportune for Craig's designs, that could be imagined.—To return to Miss Dudley. The sum that remained to her after the discharge of her debts, would quickly be expended. It was no argument of wisdom to lose sight of the future in the oblivion of present care. The time would inevitably come when new resources would be necessary. Every hour brought nearer the period without facilitating the discovery of new expedients. She related the recent adventure to her father. He acquiesced in the propriety of her measures, but the succor that she had thus obtained consoled him but little. He saw how speedily it would again be required, and was hopeless of a like fortunate occurrence. Some days had elapsed, and Constantia had been so fortunate as to procure some employment. She was thus engaged in the evening when they were surprised by a visit from their landlord. This was an occurrence that foreboded them no good. He entered with abruptness and scarcely noticed the salutations that he received. His bosom swelled with discontent, which seemed ready to be poured out upon his two companions. To the inquiry as to the condition of his health and that of his family, he surlily answered; never mind how I am. None the better for my tenants, I think. Never was a man so much plagued as I have been; what with one putting me off from time to time. What with another quarrelling about terms, and denying his agreement, and another running away in my debt, I expect nothing but to come to poverty, God help me, at last. But this was the worst of all. I was never before treated so in all my life. I don't know what or when I shall get to the end of my troubles. To be fobbed out of my rent and twenty five dollars into the bargain! It is very strange treatment, I assure you, Mr. Dudley. What is it you mean? replied that gentleman. You have received your dues, and— Received my dues, indeed! High enough too! I have received none of my dues. I have been imposed upon. I have been put to very great trouble and expect some compensation. There is no knowing the character of one's tenants. There is nothing but knavery in the world, one would think. I'm sure no man has suffered more by bad tenants than I have. But this is the strangest treatment I ever met with. Very strange, indeed, and Dudley, I must be paid without delay. To lose my rent and twenty five dollars into the bargain, is too hard. I never met with the equal of it, not I. Besides, I wou'dn't be put to all this trouble for twice the sum. What does all this mean, Mr. M'Crea? You seem inclined to scold, but I cannot conceive why you came here for that purpose. This behavior is improper— No, it's very proper, and I want payment of my money. Fifty dollars you owe me. Miss comes to me to pay me my rent, as I thought. She brings me a fifty dollar note; I changes it for her, for I thought to be sure, I was quite safe; but, behold, when I sends it to the bank to get the money, they sends me back word that it's forged, and calls on me, before a magistrate to tell them where I got it from. I'm sure I never was so flustered in my life. I would not have such a thing for ten times the sum. He proceeded to descant on his loss without any interruption from his auditors, whom this intelligence had struck dumb. Mr. Dudley instantly saw the origin, and full extent of this misfortune. He was, nevertheless, calm, and indulged in no invectives against Craig. It is all of a piece, said he; our ruin is inevitable. Well, then let it come. After M'Crea had railed himself weary, he flung out of the house, warning them that, next morning he should destrain for his rent, and, at the same time, sue them for the money that Constantia had received in exchange for her note. Miss Dudley was unable to pursue her task. She laid down her needle, and fixed her eyes upon her father. They had been engaged in earnest discourse when their landlord entered. Now there was a pause of profound silence, till the affectionate Lucy, who sufficiently comprehended this scene, gave vent to her affliction in sobs. Her mistress turned to her. Cheer up, my Lucy. We shall do well enough my girl. Our state is bad enough, without doubt, but despair will make it worse. The anxiety that occupied her mind related less to herself, than to her father. He, indeed, in the present instance, was exposed to prosecution. It was he who was answerable for the debt, and whose person would be thrown into durance by the suit that was menaced. The horrors of a prison had not hitherto been experienced, or anticipated. The worst evil that she had imagined was inexpressibly inferior to this. The idea had in it something terrific and loathsome. The mere supposition of its being possible was not to be endured. If all other expedients should fail, she thought of nothing less than desperate resistance. No. It was better to die than to go to prison. For a time, she was deserted of her admirable equanimity. This no doubt, was the result of surprise. She had not yet obtained the calmness necessary to deliberation. During this gloomy interval, she would, perhaps, have adopted any scheme, however dismal and atrocious, which her father's despair might suggest. She would not refuse to terminate her own and her father's unfortunate existence, by poison or the chord. This confusion of mind could not exist long. It gradually gave place to cheerful prospects. The evil perhaps was not without its timely remedy. The person whom she had set out to visit, when her course was diverted by Craig, she once more resolved to apply to; to lay before him, without reserve, her father's situation, to entreat pecuniary succor, and to offer herself as a servant in his family, or in that of any of his friends who stood in need of one. This resolution, in a slight degree, consoled her; but her mind had been too thoroughly disturbed to allow her any sleep during that night. She equipped herself betimes, and proceeded with a doubting heart to the house of Mr. Melbourne. She was informed that he had risen, but was never to be seen at so early an hour. At nine o'clock he would be disengaged, and she would be admitted. In the present state of her affairs, this delay was peculiarly unwelcome. At breakfast, her suspense and anxieties would not allow her to eat a morsel, and when the hour approached, she prepared herself for a new attempt. As she went out, she met at the door a person whom she recognized, and whose office she knew to be that of a constable. Constantia had exercised, in her present narrow sphere, that beneficence which she had formerly exerted in a larger. There was nothing, consistent with her slender means, that she did not willingly perform for the service of others. She had not been sparing of consolation and personal aid in many cases of personal distress that had occurred in her neighborhood. Hence, as far as she was known, she was reverenced. The wife of their present visitant had experienced her succor and sympathy, on occasion of the death of a favorite child. The man, notwithstanding his office, was not of a rugged or ungrateful temper. The task that was now imposed upon him, he undertook with extreme reluctance. He was somewhat reconciled to it by the reflection that another might not perform it with that gentleness and lenity, which he found in himself a disposition to exercise on all occasions, but particularly on the present. She easily guessed at his business, and having greeted him with the utmost friendliness, returned with him into the house. She endeavored to remove the embarrassment that hung about him, but in vain. Having levied what the law very properly calls a distress, he proceeded, after much hesitation, to inform Dudley that he was charged with a message from a Magistrate, summoning him to come forthwith, and account for having a forged bank note in his possession. M'Crea had given no intimation of this. The painful surprise that it produced, soon yielded to a just view of this affair. Temporary inconvenience and vexation was all that could be dreaded from it. Mr. Dudley hated to be seen or known. He usually walked out in the dusk of the evening, but limited his perambulations to a short space. At all other times, he was obstinately recluse. He was easily persuaded by his daughter to allow her to perform this unwelcome office in his stead. He had not received, nor even seen the note. He would have willingly spared her the mortification of a judicial examination, but he knew that this was unavoidable. Should he comply with this summons himself, his daughter's presence would be equally necessary. Influenced by these considerations, he was willing that his daughter should accompany the messenger, who was content that they should consult their mutual convenience in this respect. This interview was to her, not without its terrors, but she cherished the hope that it might ultimately conduce to good. She did not foresee the means by which this would be effected, but her heart was lightened by a secret and inexplicable faith in the propitiousness of some event that was yet to occur. This faith was powerfully enforced when she reached the magistrate's door, and found that he was no other than Melbourne, whose succor she intended to solicit. She was speedily ushered, not into his office, but into a private apartment, where he received her alone. He had been favorably prepossessed with regard to her character by the report of the officer, who, on being charged with the message, had accounted for the regret which he manifested, by dwelling on the merits of Miss Dudley. He behaved with grave civility, requested her to be seated, and accurately scrutinized her appearance. She found herself not deceived in her preconceptions of this gentleman's character, and drew a favorable omen as to the event of this interview, by what had already taken place. He viewed her in silence for some time, and then, in a conciliating tone, said. It seems to me, madam, as if I had seen you before. Your face, indeed, is of that kind which, when once seen, is not easily forgotten. I know it is a long time since, but I cannot tell when or where. If you will not deem me impertinent, I will venture to ask you to assist my conjectures. Your name as I am informed, is Acworth.—I ought to have mentioned that Mr. Dudley on his removal from New York, among other expedients to obliterate the memory of his former condition, and conceal his poverty from the world, had made this change in his name. That, indeed, said the lady, is the name, which my father, at present, bears. His real name is Dudley. His abode was formerly in Queen Street, New York. Your conjecture, Sir, is not erroneous. This is not the first time we have seen each other. I well recollect your having been at my father's house in the days of his prosperity. Is it possible? exclaimed Mr. Melbourne, starting from his seat in the first impulse of his astonishment. Are you the daughter of my friend Dudley, by whom I have so often been hospitably entertained. I have heard of his misfortunes, but knew not that he was alive, or in what part of the world he resided. You are summoned on a very disagreeable affair, but I doubt not, you will easily exculpate your father. I am told that he is blind, and that his situation is by no means as comfortable as might be wished. I am grieved that he did not confide in the friendship of those that knew him. What could prompt him to conceal himself? My father has a proud spirit. It is not yet broken by adversity. He disdains to beg, but I must now assume that office for his sake. I came hither this morning to lay before you his situation, and to intreat your assistance to save him from a prison. He cannot pay for the poor tenement he occupies, and our few goods are already under distress. He has, likewise, contracted a debt. He is, I suppose, already sued on this account, and must go to gaol unless saved by the interposition of some friend. It is true, said Melbourne, I yesterday granted a warrant against him at the suit of Malcolm M'Crea. Little did I think that the defendant was Stephen Dudley; but you may dismiss all apprehensions on that score. That affair shall be settled to your father's satisfaction. Meanwhile, we will, if you please, despatch this unpleasant business respecting a counterfeit note, received in payment from you by this M'Crea. Miss Dudley satisfactorily explained that affair. She stated the relation in which Craig had formerly stood to her father, and the acts of which he had been guilty. She slightly touched on the distresses which the family had undergone during their abode in this city, and the means by which she had been able to preserve her father from want. She mentioned the circumstances which compelled her to seek his charity as the last resource, and the casual encounter with Craig, by which she was for the present diverted from that design. She laid before him a copy of the letter she had written, and explained the result in the gift of the note which now appeared to be a counterfeit. She concluded with stating her present views, and soliciting him to receive her into his family, in quality of servant, or use his interest with some of his friends to procure a provision of this kind. This tale was calculated deeply to affect a man of Mr. Melbourne's humanity. No, said he, I cannot listen to such a request. My inclination is bounded by my means. These will not allow me to place you in an independent situation; but I will do what I can. With your leave, I will introduce you to my wife, in your true character. Her good sense will teach her to set a just value on your friendship. There is no disgrace in earning your subsistence by your own industry. She and her friends will furnish you with plenty of materials, but if there ever be a deficiency, look to me for a supply. Constantia's heart overflowed at this declaration. Her silence was more eloquent than any words could have been. She declined an immediate introduction to his wife, and withdrew, but not till her new friend had forced her to accept some money. Place it to account, said he. It is merely paying you before hand, and discharging a debt at the time when it happens to be most useful to the creditor. To what entire and incredible reverses is the tenor of human life subject. A short minute shall effect a transition from a state utterly destitute of hope, to a condition where all is serene and abundant. The path, which we employ all our exertions to shun, is often found, upon trial, to be the true road to prosperity. Constantia retired from this interview with a heart bounding with exultation. She related to her father all that had happened. He was pleased on her account, but the detection of his poverty by Melbourne was the parent of new mortification. His only remaining hope relative to himself, was that he should die in his obscurity, whereas, it was probable that his old acquaintance would trace him to his covert. This prognostic filled him with the deepest inquietude, and all the reasonings of his daughter were insufficient to appease him. Melbourne made his appearance in the afternoon. He was introduced, by Constantia, to her father. Mr. Dudley's figure was emaciated, and his features corroded by his ceaseless melancholy. His blindness produced in them a woeful and wildering expression. His dress betokened his penury, and was in unison with the meanness of his habitation and furniture. The visitant was struck with the melancholy contrast, which these appearances exhibited, to the joyousness and splendor that he had formerly witnessed. Mr. Dudley received the salutations of his guest with an air of embarrassment and dejection. He resigned to his daughter the task of sustaining the conversation, and excused himself from complying with the urgent invitations of Melbourne, while at the same time, he studiously forbore all expressions tending to encourage any kind of intercourse between them. The guest came with a message from his wife, who intreated Miss Dudley's company to tea with her that evening, adding that she should be entirely alone. It was impossible to refuse compliance with this request. She cheerfully assented, and, in the evening, was introduced to Mrs. Melbourne, by her husband. 9 Constantia found in this lady nothing that called for reverence or admiration, though she could not deny her some portion of esteem. The impression which her own appearance and conversation made upon her entertainer, was much more powerful and favorable. A consciousness of her own worth, and disdain of the malevolence of fortune, perpetually shone forth in her behavior. It was modelled by a sort of mean between presumption on the one hand, and humility on the other. She claimed no more than what was justly due to her, but she claimed no less. She did not soothe our vanity nor fascinate our pity by diffident reserves and flutterings. Neither did she disgust by arrogant negligence, and uncircumspect loquacity. At parting, she received commissions in the way of her profession, which supplied her with abundant and profitable employment. She abridged her visit on her father's account, and parted from her new friend just early enough to avoid meeting with Ormond, who entered the house a few minutes after she had left it. What pity, said Melbourne to him, you did not come a little sooner. You pretend to be a judge of beauty. I should like to have heard your opinion of a face that has just left us. Describe it, said the other. That is beyond my capacity. Complexion, and hair, and eyebrows may be painted, but these are of no great value in the present case. It is in the putting them together, that nature has here shewn her skill, and not in the structure of each of the parts, individually considered. Perhaps you may at some time meet each other here. If a lofty fellow like you, now, would mix a little common sense with his science, this girl might hope for a husband, and her father for a natural protector. Are they in search of one or the other? I cannot say they are. Nay, I imagine they would bear any imputation with more patience than that, but certain I am, they stand in need of them. How much would it be to the honor of a man like you rioting in wealth, to divide it with one, lovely and accomplished as this girl is, and struggling with indigence. Melbourne then related the adventure of the morning. It was easy for Ormond to perceive that this was the same person of whom he already had some knowledge—but there were some particulars in the narrative that excited surprise. A note had been received from Craig, at the first visit in the evening, and this note was for no more than fifty dollars. This did not exactly tally with the information received from Craig. But this note was forged. Might not this girl mix a little imposture with her truth? Who knows her temptations to hypocrisy? It might have been a present from another quarter, and accompanied with no very honorable conditions. Exquisite wretch! Those whom honesty will not let live, must be knaves. Such is the alternative offered by the wisdom of society. He listened to the tale with apparent indifference. He speedily shifted the conversation to new topics, and put an end to his visit sooner than ordinary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. I know no task more arduous than a just delineation of the character of Ormond. To scrutinize and ascertain our own principles are abundantly difficult. To exhibit these principles to the world with absolute sincerity, can scarcely be expected. We are prompted to conceal and to feign by a thousand motives; but truly to portray the motives, and relate the actions of another, appears utterly impossible. The attempt, however, if made with fidelity and diligence, is not without its use. To comprehend the whole truth, with regard to the character and conduct of another, may be denied to any human being, but different observers will have, in their pictures, a greater or less portion of this truth. No representation will be wholly false, and some though not perfectly, may yet be considerably exempt from error. Ormond was, of all mankind, the being most difficult and most deserving to be studied. A fortunate concurrence of incidents has unveiled his actions to me with more distinctness than to any other. My knowledge is far from being absolute, but I am conscious of a kind of duty, first to my friend, and secondly to mankind, to impart the knowledge I possess. I shall omit to mention the means by which I became acquainted with his character, nor shall I enter, at this time, into every part of it. His political projects are likely to possess an extensive influence on the future condition of this western world. I do not conceive myself authorized to communicate a knowledge of his schemes, which I gained, in some sort, surreptitiously, or at least, by means of which he was not apprized. I shall merely explain the maxims by which he was accustomed to regulate his private deportment. No one could entertain loftier conceptions of human capacity than Ormond, but he carefully distinguished between men, in the abstract, and men as they are. The former were beings to be impelled, by the breath of accident, in a right or a wrong road, but whatever direction they should receive, it was the property of their nature to persist in it. Now this impulse had been given. No single being could rectify the error. It was the business of the wise man to form a just estimate of things, but not to attempt, by individual efforts, so chimerical an enterprise as that of promoting the happiness of mankind. Their condition was out of the reach of a member of a corrupt society to control. A mortal poison pervaded the whole system, by means of which every thing received was converted into bane and purulence. Efforts designed to ameliorate the condition of an individual, were sure of answering a contrary purpose. The principles of the social machine must be rectified, before men can be beneficially active. Our motives may be neutral or beneficent, but our actions tend merely to the production of evil. The idea of total forbearance was not less delusive. Man could not be otherwise than a cause of perpetual operation and efficacy. He was part of a machine, and as such had not power to withhold his agency. Contiguousness to other parts, that is, to other men, was all that was necessary to render him a powerful concurrent. What then was the conduct incumbent on him? Whether he went forward, or stood still, whether his motives were malignant, or kind, or indifferent, the mass of evil was equally and necessarily augmented. It did not follow from these preliminaries that virtue and duty were terms without a meaning, but they require us to promote our own happiness and not the happiness of others. Not because the former end is intrinsically preferable, not because the happiness of others is unworthy of primary consideration, but because it is not to be attained. Our power in the present state of things is subjected to certain limits. A man may reasonably hope to accomplish his end, when he proposes nothing but his own good. Any other point is inaccessible. He must not part with benevolent desire; this is a constituent of happiness. He sees the value of general and particular felicity; he sometimes paints it to his fancy, but if this be rarely done, it is in consequence of virtuous sensibility, which is afflicted on observing that his pictures are reversed in the real state of mankind. A wise man will relinquish the pursuit of general benefit, but not the desire of that benefit, or the preception of that in which this benefit consists, because these are among the ingredients of virtue and the sources of his happiness. Principles, in the looser sense of that term, have little influence on practice. Ormond was, for the most part, governed, like others, by the influences of education and present circumstances. It required a vigilant discernment to distinguish whether the stream of his actions flowed from one or the other. His income was large, and he managed it nearly on the same principles as other men. He thought himself entitled to all the splendor and ease which it would purchase, but his taste was elaborate and correct. He gratified his love of the beautiful, because the sensations it afforded were pleasing, but made no sacrifices to the love of distinction. He gave no expensive entertainments for the sake of exciting the admiration of stupid gazers, or the flattery or envy of those who shared them. Pompous equipage and retinue were modes of appropriating the esteem of mankind which he held in profound contempt. The garb of his attendants was fashioned after the model suggested by his imagination, and not in compliance with the dictates of custom. He treated with systematic negligence, the etiquette that 9* regulates the intercourse of persons of a certain class. He, every where, acted, in this respect, as if he were alone, or among familiar associates. The very appellations of Sir, and Madam, and Mister, were, in his apprehension, servile and ridiculous, and as custom or law had annexed no penalty to the neglect of these, he conformed to his own opinions. It was easier for him to reduce his notions of equality to practice than for most others. To level himself with others was an act of condescension and not of arrogance. It was requisite to descend rather than to rise; a task the most easy, if we regard the obstacles flowing from the prejudice of mankind, but far most difficult, if the motives of the agent be considered. That in which he chiefly placed his boast, was his sincerity. To this he refused no sacrifice. In consequence of this, his deportment was disgusting to weak minds, by a certain air of ferocity and haughty negligence. He was without the attractions of candor, because he regarded not the happiness of others, but in subservience to his sincerity. Hence it was natural to suppose that the character of this man was easily understood. He affected to conceal nothing. No one appeared more exempt from the instigations of vanity. He set light by the good opinions of others, had no compassion for their prejudices, and hazarded assertions in their presence which he knew would be, in the highest degree, shocking to their previous notions. They might take it, he would say, as they list. Such were his conceptions, and the last thing he would give up was the use of his tongue. It was his way to give utterance to the suggestions of his understanding. If they were disadvantageous to him in the opinions of others, it was well. He did not wish to be regarded in any light, but the true one. He was contented to be rated by the world, at his just value. If they esteemed him for qualities he did not possess, was he wrong in rectifying their mistake; but in reality, if they valued him for that to which he had no claim, and which he himself considered as contemptible, he must naturally desire to shew them their error, and forfeit that praise which, in his own opinion, was a badge of infamy. In listening to his discourse, no one's claim to sincerity appeared less questionable. A somewhat different conclusion would be suggested by a survey of his actions. In early youth he discovered in himself a remarkable facility in imitating the voice and gestures of others. His memory was eminently retentive, and these qualities would have rendered his career, in the theatrical profession, illustrious, had not his condition raised him above it. His talents were occasionally exerted for the entertainment of convivial parties, and private circles, but he gradually withdrew from such scenes, as he advanced in age, and devoted his abilities to higher purposes. His aversion to duplicity had flowed from experience of its evils. He had frequently been made its victim; in consequence of this his temper had become suspicious, and he was apt to impute deceit on occasions when others, of no inconsiderable sagacity, were abundantly disposed to confidence. One transaction had occurred in his life, in which the consequences of being misled by false appearances were of the utmost moment to his honor and safety. The usual mode of solving his doubts, he deemed insufficient, and the eagerness of his curiosity tempted him, for the first time, to employ, for this end, his talents at imitation. He therefore assumed a borrowed character and guise, and performed his part with so much skill as fully to accomplish his design. He whose mask would have secured him from all other attempts, was thus taken through an avenue which his caution had overlooked, and the hypocrisy of his pretensions unquestionably ascertained. Perhaps, in a comprehensive view, the success of this expedient was unfortunate. It served to recommend this method of encountering deceit, and informed him of the extent of those powers which are so liable to be abused. A subtlety much inferior to Ormond's would suffice to recommend this mode of action. It was defensible on no other principle than necessity. The treachery of mankind compelled him to resort to it. If they should deal in a manner as upright and explicit as himself, it would be superfluous. But since they were in the perpetual use of stratagems and artifices, it was allowable, he thought, to wield the same arms. It was easy to perceive, however, that this practice was recommended to him by other considerations. He was delighted with the power it conferred. It enabled him to gain access, as if by supernatural means, to the privacy of others, and baffle their profoundest contrivances to hide themselves from his view. It flattered him with the possession of something like omniscience. It was besides an art, in which, as in others, every accession of skill, was a source of new gratification. Compared with this the performance of the actor is the sport of children. This profession he was accustomed to treat with merciless ridicule, and no doubt, some of his contempt arose from a secret comparison, between the theatrical species of imitation and his own. He blended in his own person the functions of poet and actor, and his dramas were not fictitious but real. The end that he proposed was not the amusement of a playhouse mob. His were scenes in which hope and fear exercised a genuine influence, and in which was maintained that resemblance to truth, so audaciously and grossly violated on the stage. It is obvious how many singular conjunctures must have grown out of this propensity. A mind of uncommon energy like Ormond's, which had occupied a wide sphere of action, and which could not fail of confederating its efforts with those of minds like itself, must have given birth to innumerable incidents, not unworthy to be exhibited by the most eloquent historian. It is not my business to relate any of these. The fate of Miss Dudley is intimately connected with his. What influence he obtained over her destiny, in consequence of this dexterity, will appear in the sequel. It arose from these circumstances, that no one was more impenetrable than Ormond, though no one's real character seemed more easily discerned. The projects that occupied his attention were diffused over an ample space; and his instruments and coadjutors were culled from a field, whose bounds were those of the civilized world. To the vulgar eye, therefore, he appeared a man of speculation and seclusion, and was equally inscrutible in his real and assumed characters. In his real, his intents were too lofty and comprehensive, as well as too assiduously shrouded from profane inspection, for them to scan. In the latter, appearances were merely calculated to mislead and not to enlighten. In his youth he had been guilty of the usual excesses incident to his age and character. These had disappeared and yielded place to a more regular and circumspect system of action. In the choice of his pleasures he still exposed himself to the censure of the world. Yet there was more of grossness and licentiousness in the expression of his tenets, than in the tenets themselves. So far as temperance regards the maintenance of health, no man adhered to its precepts with more fidelity, but he esteemed some species of connexion with the other sex as venial, which mankind in general are vehement in condemning. In his intercourse with women, he deemed himself superior to the allurements of what is called love. His inferences were drawn from a consideration of the physical propensities of a human being. In his scale of enjoyments the gratifications which belonged to these, were placed at the bottom. Yet he did not entirely disdain them, and when they could be purchased without the sacrifice of superior advantages, they were sufficiently acceptable. His mistake on this head was the result of his ignorance. He had not hitherto met with a female worthy of his confidence. Their views were limited and superficial, or their understandings were betrayed by the tenderness of their hearts. He found in them no intellectual energy, no superiority to what he accounted vulgar prejudice, and no affinity with the sentiments which he cherished with most devotion. Their presence had been capable of exciting no emotion which he did not quickly discover to be vague and sensual; and the uniformity of his experience at length instilled into him a belief, that the intellectual constitution of females was essentially defective. He denied the reality of that passion which claimed a similitude or sympathy of minds as one of its ingredients.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. He resided in New York some time before he took up his abode in Philadelphia. He had some pecuniary concerns with a merchant of that place. He occasionally frequented his house, finding, in the society which it afforded him, scope for amusing speculation, and opportunities of gaining a species of knowledge of which at that time he stood in need. There was one daughter of the family who of course constituted a member of the domestic circle. Helena Cleves was endowed with every feminine and fascinating quality. Her features were modified by the most transient sentiments and were the seat of a softness at all times blushful and bewitching. All those graces of symmetry, smoothness and lustre, which assemble in the imagination of the painter when he calls from the bosom of her natal deep, the Paphian divinity, blended their perfections in the shade, complexion, and hair of this lady. Her voice was naturally thrilling and melodious, and her utterance clear and distinct. A musical education had added to all these advantages the improvements of art, and no one could swim in the dance with such airy and transporting elegance. It is obvious to inquire whether her mental, were, in any degree, on a level with her exterior accomplishments. Should you listen to her talk, you would be liable to be deceived in this respect. Her utterance was so just, her phrases so happy, and her language so copious and correct, that the hearer was apt to be impressed with an ardent veneration of her abilities, but the truth is, she was calculated to excite emotions more voluptuous than dignified. Her presence produced a trance of the senses rather than an illumination of the soul. It was a topic of wonder how she should have so carefully separated the husk from the kernel, and be so absolute a mistress of the vehicle of knowledge, with so slender means of supplying it; yet it is difficult to judge but from comparison. To say that Helena Cleves was silly or ignorant would be hatefully unjust. Her understanding bore no disadvantageous comparison with that of the majority of her sex, but when placed in competition with that of some eminent females or of Ormond, it was exposed to the risk of contempt. This lady and Ormond were exposed to mutual examination. The latter was not unaffected by the radiance that environed this girl, but her true character was easily discovered, and he was accustomed to regard her merely as an object charming to the senses. His attention to her was dictated by this principle. When she sung or talked, it was not unworthy of the strongest mind to be captivated with her music and her elocution; but these were the limits which he set to his gratifications. That sensations of a different kind, never ruffled his tranquillity must not be supposed, but he too accurately estimated their consequences to permit himself to indulge them. Unhappily the lady did not exercise equal fortitude. During a certain interval Ormond's visits were frequent, and she insensibly contracted for him somewhat more than reverence. The tenor of his discourse was little adapted to cherish her hopes. In the declaration of his opinions he was never withheld by scruples of decorum, or a selfish regard to his own interest. His matrimonial tenets were harsh and repulsive. A woman of keener penetration would have predicted from them, the disappointment of her wishes, but Helena's mind was uninured to the discussion of logical points and the tracing of remote consequences. His presence inspired feelings which would not permit her to bestow an impartial attention on his arguments. It is not enough to say that his reasonings failed to convince her; the combined influence of passion and an unenlightened understanding hindered her from fully comprehending them. All she gathered was a vague conception of something magnificent and vast in his character. Helena was destined to experience the vicissitudes of fortune. Her father died suddenly and left her without provision. She was compelled to accept the invitations of a kinswoman, and live, in some sort, a life of dependence. She was not qualified to sustain this reverse of fortune, in a graceful manner. She could not bear the diminution of her customary indulgences, and to these privations were added the inquietudes of a passion, which now began to look with an aspect of hopelessness. These events happened in the absence of Ormond. On his return he made himself acquainted with them. He saw the extent of this misfortune to a woman of Helena's character, but knew not in what manner it might be effectually obviated. He esteemed it incumbent on him to pay her a visit in her new abode. This token at least of respect or remembrance his duty appeared to prescribe. This visit was unexpected by the lady. Surprise is the enemy of concealment. She was oppressed with a sense of her desolate situation. She was sitting in her own apartment in a museful posture. Her fancy was occupied with the image of Ormond, and her tears were flowing at the thought of their eternal separation, when he entered softly and unperceived by her. A tap upon the shoulder was the first signal of his presence. So critical an interview could not fail of unveiling the true state of the lady's heart. Ormond's suspicions were excited, and these suspicions speedily led to an explanation. Ormond retired to ruminate on this discovery. I have already mentioned his sentiments respecting love. His feelings relative to Helena did not contradict his principles, yet the image which had formerly been exquisite in loveliness, had now suddenly gained unspeakable attractions. This discovery had set the question in a new light. It was of sufficient importance to make him deliberate. He reasoned somewhat in the following manner. Marriage is absurd. This flows from the general and incurable imperfection of the female character. No woman can possess that worth which would induce me to enter into this contract, and bind myself, without power of revoking the decree, to her society. This opinion may possibly be erroneous, but it is undoubtedly true with respect to Helena, and the uncertainty of the position in general, will increase the necessity of caution in the present case. That woman may exist whom I should not fear to espouse. This is not her. Some accident may cause our meeting. Shall I then disable myself, by an irrevocable obligation, from profiting by so auspicious an occurrence? This girl's society was to be enjoyed in one of two ways. Should he consult his inclination there was little room for doubt. He had never met with one more highly qualified for that species of intercourse which he esteemed rational. No man more abhorred the votaries of licentiousness. Nothing was more detestable to him than a mercenary alliance. Personal fidelity and the existence of that passion, of which he had, in the present case, the good fortune to be the object, were indispensable in his scheme. The union was indebted for its value on the voluntariness with which it was formed, and the entire acquiescence of the judgment of both parties in its rectitude. Dissimulation and artifice were wholly foreign to the success of his project. If the lady thought proper to assent to his proposal, it was well. She did so because assent was more eligible than refusal. She would, no doubt, prefer marriage. She would deem it more conducive to happiness. This was an error. This was an opinion, his reasons for which he was at liberty to state to her; at least it was justifiable in refusing to subject himself to loathsome and impracticable obligations. Certain inconveniences attended women who set aside, on these occasions, the sanction of law, but these were imaginary. They owed their force to the errors of the sufferer. To annihilate them, it was only necessary to reason justly, but allowing these inconveniences their full weight and an indestructable existence, it was but a choice of evils. Were they worse in this lady's apprehension, than an eternal and hopeless separation? Perhaps they were. If so, she would make her election accordingly. He did nothing but lay the conditions before her. If his scheme should obtain the concurrence of her unbiassed judgment he should rejoice. If not, her conduct should be uninfluenced by him. Whatever way she should decide, he would assist her in adhering to her decision, but would, meanwhile, furnish her with the materials of a right decision. This determination was singular. Many will regard it as incredible. No man, it will be thought, can put this deception on himself, and imagine that there was genuine beneficence in a scheme like this. Would the lady more consult her happiness by adopting than by rejecting it? There can be but one answer. It cannot be supposed that Ormond, in stating this proposal, acted with all the impartiality that he pretended; that he did not employ fallacious exaggerations and ambiguous expedients; that he did not seize every opportunity of triumphing over her weakness, and building his success rather on the illusions of her heart than the convictions of her understanding. His conclusions were specious but delusive, and were not uninfluenced by improper biasses; but of this he himself was scarcely conscious, and it must be, at least, admitted that he acted with scrupulous sincerity. An uncommon degree of skill was required to introduce this topic so as to avoid the imputation of an insult. This scheme was little in unison with all her preconceived notions. 10 No doubt, the irksomeness of her present situation, the allurements of luxury and ease, which Ormond had to bestow, and the revival of her ancient independence and security, had some share in dictating her assent. Her concurrence was by no means cordial and unhesitating. Remorse and the sense of dishonor pursued her to her retreat, though chosen with a view of shunning their intrusions, and it was only when the reasonings and blandishments of her lover were exhibited, that she was lulled into temporary tranquillity. She removed to Philadelphia. Here she enjoyed all the consolations of opulence. She was mistress of a small but elegant mansion. She possessed all the means of solitary amusement, and frequently enjoyed the company of Ormond. These however were insufficient to render her happy. Certain reflections might, for a time, be repressed or divested of their sting, but they insinuated themselves at every interval, and imparted to her mind, a hue of dejection from which she could not entirely relieve herself. She endeavored to acquire a relish for the pursuits of literature, by which her lonely hours might be cheered; but of this, even in the blithesomeness and serenity of her former days, she was incapable. Much more so now when she was the prey of perpetual inquietude. Ormond perceived this change, not without uneasiness. All his efforts to reconcile her to her present situation were fruitless. They produced a momentary effect upon her. The softness of her temper and her attachment to him, would, at his bidding, restore her to vivacity and ease, but the illumination seldom endured longer than his presence, and the novelty of some amusement which he had furnished her. At his next visit, perhaps, he would find that a new task awaited him. She indulged herself in no recriminations or invectives. She could not complain that her lover had deceived her. She had voluntarily and deliberately accepted the conditions prescribed. She regarded her own disposition to repine as a species of injustice. She laid no claim to an increase of tenderness. She hinted not a wish for a change of situation; yet she was unhappy. Tears stole into her eyes, and her thoughts wandered into gloomy reverie, at moments when least aware of their reproach, and least willing to indulge them. Was a change to be desired? Yes; provided that change was equally agreeable to Ormond, and should be seriously proposed by him, of this she had no hope. As long as his accents rung in her ears, she even doubted whether it were to be wished. At any rate, it was impossible to gain his approbation to it. Her destiny was fixed. It was better than the cessation of all intercourse, yet her heart was a stranger to all permanent tranquillity. Her manners were artless and ingenuous. In company with Ormond her heart was perfectly unveiled. He was her divinity to whom every sentiment was visible, and to whom she spontaneously uttered what she thought, because the employment was pleasing; because he listened with apparent satisfaction; and because, in fine, it was the same thing to speak and to think in his presence. There was no inducement to conceal from him the most evanescent and fugitive ideas. Ormond was not an inattentive or indifferent spectator of those appearances. His friend was unhappy. She shrunk aghast from her own reproaches and the contumelies of the world. This morbid sensibility he had endeavored to cure, but hitherto in vain. What was the amount of her unhappiness? Her spirits had formerly been gay, but her gaiety was capable of yielding place to soul-ravishing and solemn tenderness. Her sedateness was, at those times, the offspring not of reflection but of passion. There still remained much of her former self. He was seldom permitted to witness more than the traces of sorrow. In answer to his inquiries, she, for the most part, described sensations that were gone, and which she flattered herself and him would never return; but this hope was always doomed to disappointment. Solitude infallibly conjured up the ghost which had been laid, and it was plain that argument was no adequate remedy for this disease. How far would time alleviate its evils? When the novelty of her condition should disappear, would she not regard it with other eyes? By being familiar with contempt, it will lose its sting; but is that to be wished? Must not the character be thoroughly depraved before the scorn of our neighbors shall become indifferent? Indifference, flowing from a sense of justice, and a persuasion that our treatment is unmerited, is characteristic of the noblest minds, but indifference to obloquy, because we are habituated to it, is a token of peculiar baseness. This therefore was a remedy to be ardently deprecated. He had egregiously overrated the influence of truth and his own influence. He had hoped that his victory was permanent. In order to the success of truth, he was apt to imagine, that nothing was needful but opportunities for a complete exhibition of it. They that inquire and reason with sufficient deliberateness and caution, must inevitably accomplish their end. These maxims were confuted in the present case. He had formed no advantageous conceptions of Helena's capacity. His aversion to matrimony arose from those conceptions, but experience had shown him that his conclusions, unfavorable as they were, had fallen short of the truth. Convictions, which he had conceived her mind to be sufficiently strong to receive and retain, were proved to have made no other, than a momentary impression. Hence his objections to ally himself to a mind inferior to his own were strengthened rather than diminished. But he could not endure the thought of being instrumental to her misery. Marriage was an efficacious remedy, but he could not as yet bring himself to regard the aptitude of this cure as a subject of doubt. The idea of separation sometimes occurred to him. He was not unapprehensive of the influence of time and absence, in curing the most vehement passion, but to this expedient the lady could not be reconciled. He knew her too well to believe that she would willingly adopt it. But the only obstacle to this scheme did not flow from the lady's opposition. He would probably have found upon experiment as strong an aversion to adopt it in himself as in her. It was easy to see the motives by which he would be likely to be swayed into a change of principles. If marriage were the only remedy, the frequent repetition of this truth must bring him insensibly to doubt the rectitude of his determinations against it. He deeply reflected on the consequences which marriage involves. He scrutinized with the utmost accuracy, the character of his friend, and surveyed it in all its parts. Inclination could not fail of having some influence on his opinions. The charms of this favorite object tended to impair the clearness of his view, and extenuate or conceal her defects. He entered on the enumeration of her errors with reluctance. Her happiness had it been wholly disconnected with his own, might have had less weight in the balance, but now, every time the scales were suspended, this consideration acquired new weight. Most men are influenced, in the formation of this contract, by regards purely physical. They are incapable of higher views. They regard with indifference every tie that binds them to their contemporaries, or to posterity. Mind has no part in the motives that guide them. They choose a wife as they choose any household moveable, and when the irritation of the senses has subsided, the attachment that remains is the offspring of habit. Such were not Ormond's modes of thinking. His creed was of too extraordinary a kind not to merit explication. The terms of this contract were, in his eyes, iniquitous and absurd. He could not think with patience of a promise which no time could annul, which pretended to ascertain contingences and regulate the future. To forego the liberty of choosing his companion, and bind himself to associate with one whom he despised, to raise to his own level one whom nature had irretrievably degraded; to avow, and persist in his adherence to a falsehood, palpable and loathsome to his understanding; to affirm that he was blind, when in full possession of his senses; to shut his eyes and grope in the dark, and call upon the compassion of mankind on his infirmity, when his organs were, in no degree, impaired, and the scene around him was luminous and beautiful, was an height of infatuation that he could never attain. And why should he be thus self-degraded? Why should he take a laborious circuit to reach a point which, when attained, was trivial, and to which reason had pointed out a road short and direct? A wife is generally nothing more than a household superintendent. This function could not be more wisely vested than it was at present. Every thing, in his domestic system, was fashioned on strict and inflexible principles. He wanted 10* instruments and not partakers of his authority. One whose mind was equal and not superior to the cogent apprehension and punctual performance of his will. One whose character was squared, with mathematical exactness, to his situation. Helena, with all her faults, did not merit to be regarded in this light. Her introduction would destroy the harmony of his scheme, and be, with respect to herself, a genuine debasement. A genuine evil would thus be substituted for one that was purely imaginary. Helena's intellectual deficiencies could not be concealed. She was a proficient in the elements of no science. The doctrine of lines and surfaces was as disproportionate with her intellects as with those of the mock-bird. She had not reasoned on the principles of human action, nor examined the structure of society. She was ignorant of the past or present condition of mankind. History had not informed her of the one, nor the narratives of voyages, nor the deductions of geography of the other. The heights of eloquence and poetry were shut out from her view. She could not commune in their native dialect, with the sages of Rome and Athens. To her those perennial fountains of wisdom and refinement were sealed. The constitution of nature, the attributes of its author, the arrangement of the parts of the external universe, and the substance, modes of operation, and ultimate destiny of human intelligence, were enigmas unsolved and insoluble by her. But this was not all. The superstructure could for the present be spared. Nay, it was desirable that the province of rearing it, should be reserved for him. All he wanted was a suitable foundation; but this Helena did not possess. He had not hitherto been able to create in her the inclination or the power. She had listened to his precepts with docility. She had diligently conned the lessons which he had prescribed, but the impressions were as fleeting as if they had been made on water. Nature seemed to have set impassible limits to her attainments. This indeed was an unwelcome belief. He struggled to invalidate it. He reflected on the immaturity of her age. What but crude and hasty views was it reasonable to expect at so early a period. If her mind had not been awakened, it had proceeded, perhaps, from the injudiciousness of his plans, or merely from their not having been persisted in. What was wanting but the ornaments of mind to render this being all that poets have feigned of angelic nature. When he indulged himself in imaging the union of capacious understanding with her personal loveliness, his conceptions swelled to a pitch of enthusiasm, and it seemed as if no labor was too great to be employed in the production of such a creature. And yet, in the midst of his glowings, he would sink into sudden dejection at the recollection of that which passion had, for a time, excluded. To make her wise it would be requisite to change her sex. He had forgotten that his pupil was a female, and her capacity therefore limited by nature. This mortifying thought was outbalanced by another. Her attainments, indeed, were suitable to the imbecility of her sex; but did she not surpass, in those attainments, the ordinary rate of women? They must not be condemned, because they are outshone by qualities that are necessarily male births. Her accomplishments formed a much more attractive theme. He overlooked no article in the catalogue. He was confounded at one time, and encouraged at another, on remarking the contradictions that seemed to be included in her character. It was difficult to conceive the impossibility of passing that barrier which yet she was able to touch. She was no poet. She listened to the rehearsal, without emotion, or was moved, not by the substance of the passage, by the dazzling image or the magic sympathy, but by something adscititious; yet usher her upon the stage, and no poet would wish for a more powerful organ of his conceptions. In assuming this office, she appeared to have drank in the very soul of the dramatist. What was wanting in judgment, was supplied by memory, in the tenaciousness of which, she has seldom been rivalled. Her sentiments were trite and undigested, but were decorated with all the fluences and melodies of elocution. Her musical instructer had been a Sicilian, who had formed her style after the Italian model. This man had likewise taught her his own language. He had supplied her chiefly with Sicilian compositions, both in poetry and melody, and was content to be unclassical, for the sake of the feminine and voluptuous graces of his native dialect. Ormond was an accurate judge of the proficiency of Helena, and of the felicity with which these accomplishments were suited to her character. When his pupil personated the victims of anger and grief, and poured forth the fiery indignation of Calista, or the maternal despair of Constance, or the self-contentions of Ipsipile, he could not deny the homage which her talents might claim. Her Sicilian tutor had found her no less tractable as a votary of painting. She needed only the education of Angelica, to exercise as potent and prolific a pencil. This was incompatible with her condition, which limited her attainments to the elements of this art. It was otherwise with music. Here there was no obstacle to skill, and here the assiduities of many years, in addition to a prompt and ardent genius, set her beyond the hopes of rivalship. Ormond had often amused his fancy with calling up images of excellence in this art. He saw no bounds to the influence of habit, in augmenting the speed and multiplying the divisions of muscular motion. The fingers, by their form and size, were qualified to outrun and elude the most vigilant eye. The sensibility of keys and wires had limits, but these limits depended on the structure of the instrument, and the perfection of its structure was proportioned to the skill of the artist. On well constructed keys and strings, was it possible to carry diversities of movement and pressure too far. How far they could be carried was mere theme of conjecture, until it was his fate to listen to the magical performances of Helena, whose volant finger seemed to be self-impelled. Her touches were creative of a thousand forms of piano, and of numberless transitions from grave to quick, perceptible only to ears like her own. In the selection and arrangement of notes, there are no limits to luxuriance and celerity. Helena had long relinquished the drudgery of imitation. She never played but when there were motives to fervor, and when she was likely to ascend without impediment, and to maintain for a suitable period her elevation, to the element of new ideas. The lyrics of Milton and of Metastasio, she sung with accompaniments that never tired, because they were never repeated. Her harp and clavichord supplied her with endless combinations, and these in the opinion of Ormond were not inferior to the happiest exertions of Handel and Arne. Chess was his favorite amusement. This was the only game which he allowed himself to play. He had studied it with so much zeal and success, that there were few with whom he deigned to contend. He was prone to consider it as a sort of criterion of human capacity. He who had acquired skill in this science, could not be infirm in mind; and yet he found in Helena, a competitor not unworthy of all his energies. Many hours were consumed in this employment, and here the lady was sedate, considerate, extensive in foresight, and fertile in expedients. Her deportment was graceful, in as much as it flowed from a consciousness of her defects. She was devoid of arrogance and vanity, neither imagining herself better than she was, and setting light by those qualifications which she unquestionably possessed. Such was the mixed character of this woman. Ormond was occupied with schemes of a rugged and arduous nature. His intimate associates and the partakers of his confidence, were imbued with the same zeal, and ardent in the same pursuits. Helena could lay no claim to be exalted to this rank. That one destitute of this claim should enjoy the privileges of his wife, was still a supposition truly monstrous. Yet the image of Helena, fondly loving him, and a model as he conceived of tenderness and constancy, devoured by secret remorse, and pursued by the scorn of mankind; a mark for slander to shoot at, and an outcast of society, did not visit his meditations in vain. The rigor of his principles began now to relent. He considered that various occupations are incident to every man. He cannot be invariably employed in the promotion of one purpose. He must occasionally unbend, if he desires that the springs of his mind should retain their due vigor. Suppose his life were divided between business and amusement. This was a necessary distribution, and sufficiently congenial with his temper. It became him to select with skill his sources of amusement. It is true that Helena was unable to participate in his graver occupations; what then? In whom were blended so many pleasurable attributes? In her were assembled an exquisite and delicious variety. As it was, he was daily in her company. He should scarcely be more so, if marriage should take place. In that case, no change in their mode of life would be necessary. There was no need of dwelling under the same roof. His revenue was equal to the support of many household establishments. His personal independence would remain equally inviolable. No time, he thought, would diminish his influence over the mind of Helena, and it was not to be forgotten that the transition would to her be happy. It would reinstate her in the esteem of the world, and dispel those phantoms of remorse and shame by which she was at present persecuted. These were plausible considerations. They tended at least to shake his resolutions. Time would probably have completed the conquest of his pride, had not a new incident set the question in a new light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. The narrative of Melbourne made a deeper impression on the mind of his guest than was at first apparent. This man's conduct was directed by the present impulse, and however elaborate his abstract notions, he seldom stopped to settle the agreement between his principles and actions. The use of money was a science like every other branch of benevolence, not reducible to any fixed principles. No man, in the disbursement of money, could say whether he was conferring a benefit or injury. The visible and immediate effects might be good, but evil was its ultimate and general tendency. To be governed by a view to the present rather than the future, was a human infirmity from which he did not pretend to be exempt. This, though an insufficient apology for the conduct of a rational being, was suitable to his indolence, and he was content in all cases to employ it. It was thus that he reconciled himself to beneficent acts, and humorously held himself up as an object of censure, on occasions when most entitled to applause. He easily procured information as to the character and situation of the Dudleys. Neighbors are always inquisitive, and happily, in this case, were enabled to make no unfavorable report. He resolved, without hesitation, to supply their wants. This he performed in a manner truly characteristic. There was a method of gaining access to families, and marking them in their unguarded attitudes more easy and effectual than any other; it required least preparation and cost least pains; the disguise, also, was of the most impenetrable kind. He had served a sort of occasional apprenticeship to the art, and executed its functions with perfect ease. It was the most entire and grotesque metamorphosis imaginable. It was stepping from the highest to the lowest rank in society, and shifting himself into a form, as remote from his own, as those recorded by Ovid. In a word, it was sometimes his practice to exchange his complexion and habiliments for those of a negro and a chimney-sweep, and to call at certain doors for employment. This he generally secured by importunities, and the cheapness of his services. When the loftiness of his port, and the punctiliousness of his nicety were considered, we should never have believed, what yet could be truly asserted, that he had frequently swept his own chimneys, without the knowledge of his own servants.* * Similar exploits are related of Count de La Lippe and Wortley Montague. It was likewise true, though equally incredible, that he had played at romps with his scullion, and listened with patience to a thousand slanders on his own character. In this disguise he visited the house of Mr. Dudley. It was nine o'clock in the morning. He remarked, with critical eyes, the minutest circumstance in the appearance and demeanor of his customers, and glanced curiously at the house and furniture. Every thing was new and every thing pleased. The walls, though broken into roughness, by carelessness or time, were adorned with glistening white. The floor, though loose and uneven, and with gaping seams, had received all the improvements which cloth and brush could give. The pine tables, rush chairs, and uncurtained bed, had been purchased at half price, at vendue, and exhibited various tokens of decay, but care, and neatness, and order were displayed in their condition and arrangement. The lower appartment was the eating and sitting room. It was likewise Mr. Dudley's bed-chamber. The upper room was occupied by Constantia and her Lucy. Ormond viewed every thing with the accuracy of an artist, and carried away with him a catalogue of every thing visible. The faded form of Mr. Dudley that still retained its dignity, the sedateness, graceful condescension and personal elegance of Constantia, were new to the apprehension of Ormond. The contrast between the house and its inhabitants, rendered the appearance more striking. When he had finished his task, he retired, but returning in a quarter of an hour, he presented a letter to the young lady. He behaved as if by no means desirous of eluding her interrogatories, and when she desired him to stay, readily complied. The letter, unsigned and unsuperscribed, was to this effect. "The writer of this is acquainted with the transaction between Thomas Craig and Mr. Dudley. The former is debtor to Mr. Dudley in a large sum. I have undertaken to pay as much of this debt, and at such times as suits my convenience. I have had pecuniary engagements with Craig. I hold myself, in the sum inclosed, discharging so much of his debt. The future payments are uncertain, but I hope they will contribute to relieve the necessities of Mr. Dudley." Ormond had calculated the amount of what would be necessary for the annual subsistence of this family, on the present frugal plan. He had regulated his disbursements accordingly. It was natural to feel curiosity as to the writer of this epistle. The bearer displayed a prompt and talkative disposition. He had a staring eye and a grin of vivacity forever at command. When questioned by Constantia, he answered that the gentleman had forbidden him to mention his name or the place where he lived. Had he ever met with the same person before? O yes. He had lived with him from a child. His mother lived with him still and his brothers. His master had nothing for him to do at home, so he sent him out sweeping chimneys, taking from him only half the money that he earned, that way. He was a very good master. Then the gentleman had been a long time in the city? O yes. All his life he reckoned. He used to live in Walnut Street, but now he 's moved down town. Here he checked himself, and added, but I forgets. I must not tell where he lives. He told me I must'nt. He has a family and children, I suppose? O yes. Why don't you know Miss Hetty and Miss Betsey—there again. I was going to tell the name, that he said I must not tell. Constantia saw that the secret might be easily discovered, but she forbore. She disdained to take advantage of this messenger's imagined simplicity. She dismissed him with some small addition to his demand, and with a promise always to employ him in this way. By this mode, Ormond had effectually concealed himself. The lady's conjectures, founded on this delusive information, necessarily wandered widely from the truth. The observations that he had made during this visit afforded his mind considerable employment. The manner in which this lady had sustained so cruel a reverse of fortune, the cheerfulness with which she appeared to forego all the gratifications of affluence; the skill with which she selected her path of humble industry, and the steadiness with which she pursued it, were proofs of a moral constitution, from which he supposed the female sex to be debarred. The comparison was obvious between Constantia and Helena, and the result was by no means advantageous to the latter. Was it possible that such a one descended to the level of her father's apprentice? That she sacrificed her honor to a wretch like that? This reflection tended to repress the inclination he would otherwise have felt for cultivating her society, but it did not indispose him to benefit her in a certain way. On his next visit to his "bella Siciliana," as he called her, he questioned her as to the need in which she might stand of the services of a seamstress, and being informed that they were sometimes wanted, he recommended Miss Acworth to her patronage. He said that he had heard her spoken of in favorable terms, by the gossips at Melbourne's. They represented her as a good girl, slenderly provided for, and he wished that Helena would prefer her to all others. His recommendation was sufficient. The wishes of Ormond, as soon as they became known, became hers. Her temper made her always diligent in search of novelty. It 11 was easy to make work for the needle. In short she resolved to send for her the next day. The interview accordingly took place on the ensuing morning, not without mutual surprise, and, on the part of the fair Sicilian, not without considerable embarrassment. This circumstance arose from their having changed their respective names, though from motives of a very different kind. They were not strangers to each other, though no intimacy had ever subsisted between them. Each was merely acquainted with the name, person, and general character of the other. No circumstance in Constantia's situation tended to embarrass her. Her mind had attained a state of serene composure, incapable of being ruffled by an incident of this kind. She merely derived pleasure from the sight of her old acquaintance. The aspect of things around her was splendid and gay. She seemed the mistress of the mansion, and her name was changed. Hence it was unavoidable to conclude that she was married. Helena was conscious that appearances were calculated to suggest this conclusion. The idea was a painful one. She sorrowed to think that this conclusion was fallacious. The consciousness that her true condition was unknown to her visitant, and the ignominiousness of that truth, gave an air of constraint to her behavior, which Constantia ascribed to a principle of delicacy. In the midst of reflections relative to herself, she admitted some share of surprise at the discovery of Constantia, in a situation so inferior to that in which she had formerly known her. She had heard, in general terms, of the misfortunes of Mr. Dudley, but was unacquainted with particulars; but this surprise, and the difficulty of adapting her behavior to circumstances, was only in part the source of her embarrassment, though by her companion it was wholly attributed to this cause. Constantia thought it her duty to remove it by open and unaffected manners. She therefore said, in a sedate and cheerful tone, you see me, madam, in a situation somewhat unlike that in which I formerly was placed. You will probably regard the change as an unhappy one, but I assure you, I have found it far less so than I expected. I am thus reduced not by my own fault. It is this reflection that enables me to conform to it without a murmur. I shall rejoice to know that Mrs. Eden is as happy as I am. Helena was pleased with this address, and returned an answer full of sweetness. She had not, in her compassion for the fallen, a particle of pride. She thought of nothing but the contrast between the former situation of her visitant and the present. The fame of her great qualities had formerly excited veneration, and that reverence was by no means diminished by a nearer scrutiny. The consciousness of her own frailty, meanwhile, diffused over the behavior of Helena, a timidity and dubiousness uncommonly fascinating. She solicited Constantia's friendship in a manner that shewed she was afraid of nothing but denial. An assent was eagerly given, and thenceforth a cordial intercourse was established between them. The real situation of Helena was easily discovered. The officious person who communicated this information, at the same time cautioned Constantia against associating with one of tainted reputation. This information threw some light upon appearances. It accounted for that melancholy which Helena was unable to conceal. It explained that solitude in which she lived, and which Constantia had ascribed to the death or absence of her husband. It justified the solicitous silence she had hitherto maintained respecting her own affairs, and which her friend's good sense forbade her to employ any sinister means of eluding. No long time was necessary to make her mistress of Helena's character. She loved her with uncommon warmth, though by no means blind to her defects. She formed no expectations, from the knowledge of her character, to which this intelligence operated as a disappointment. It merely excited her pity, and made her thoughtful how she might assist her in repairing this deplorable error. This design was of no ordinary magnitude. She saw that it was previously necessary to obtain the confidence of Helena. This was a task of easy performance. She knew the purity of her own motives and the extent of her powers, and embarked in this undertaking with full confidence of success. She had only to profit by a private interview, to acquaint her friend with what she knew, to solicit a complete and satisfactory disclosure, to explain the impressions which her intelligence produced, and to offer her disinterested advice. No one knew better how to couch her ideas in words, suitable to the end proposed by her in imparting them. Helena was at first terrified, but the benevolence of her friend quickly entitled her to confidence and gratitude that knew no limits. She had been deterred from unveiling her heart by the fear of exciting contempt or abhorrence; but when she found that all due allowances were made, that her conduct was treated as erroneous in no atrocious or inexpiable degree, and as far from being insusceptible of remedy; that the obloquy with which she had been treated, found no vindicator or participator in her friend, her heart was considerably relieved. She had been long a stranger to the sympathy and intercourse of her own sex. Now, this good, in its most precious form, was conferred upon her, and she experienced an increase, rather than diminution of tenderness, in consequence of her true situation being known. She made no secret of any part of her history. She did full justice to the integrity of her lover, and explained the unforced conditions on which she had consented to live with him. This relation exhibited the character of Ormond in a very uncommon light. His asperities wounded, and his sternness chilled. What unauthorized conceptions of matrimonial and political equality did he entertain! He had fashioned his treatment of Helena on sullen and ferocious principles. Yet he was able, it seemed, to mould her, by means of them, nearly into the creature that he wished. She knew too little of the man justly to estimate his character. It remained to be ascertained whether his purposes were consistent and upright, or were those of a villain and betrayer. Meanwhile what was to be done by Helena? Marriage had been refused on plausible pretences. Her unenlightened understanding made her no match for her lover. She would never maintain her claim to nuptial privileges in his presence, or if she did, she would never convince him of their validity. Were they indeed valid? Was not the disparity between them incurable? A marriage of minds so dissimilar could only be productive of misery immediately to him, and by a reflex operation, to herself. She could not be happy in a union that was the source of regret to her husband. Marriage therefore was not possible, or if possible, was not, perhaps, to be wished. But what was the choice that remained? To continue in her present situation was not to be endured. Disgrace was a dæmon that would blast every hope of happiness. She was excluded from all society but that of the depraved. Her situation was eminently critical. It depended, perhaps, on the resolution she should now form whether she should be enrolled among the worst of mankind. Infamy is the worst of evils. It creates innumerable obstructions in the path of virtue. It manacles the hand, and entangles the feet that are active only to good. To the weak it is an evil of much greater magnitude. It determines their destiny, and they hasten to merit that reproach, which, at first it may be, they did not deserve. This connexion is intrinsically flagitious. Helena is subjected by it to the worst ills that are incident to humanity, the general contempt of mankind, and the reproaches of her own conscience. From these, there is but one method from which she can hope to be relieved. The intercourse must cease. It was easier to see the propriety of separation, than to project means for accomplishing it. It was true that Helena loved; but what quarter was due to this passion when divorced from integrity? Is it not in every bosom a perishable sentiment? Whatever be her warmth, absence will congeal it. Place her in new scenes, and supply her with new associates. Her accomplishments will not fail to attract votaries. From these she may select a conjugal companion suitable to her mediocrity of talents. But alas! What power on earth can prevail on her to renounce Ormond? Others may justly entertain this prospect, but it must be invisible to her. Besides, is it absolutely certain that either her peace of mind or her reputation will be restored by this means? In the opinion of the world her offences cannot, by any perseverance in penitence, be expiated. She will never believe that separation will exterminate her passion. Certain it is, that it will avail 11* nothing to the re-establishment of her fame. But if it were conducive to these ends, how chimerical to suppose that she will ever voluntarily adopt it? If Ormond refuse his concurrence, there is absolutely an end to hope. And what power on earth is able to sway his determinations? At least what influence was it possible for her to obtain over them? Should they separate, whither should she retire? What mode of subsistence should she adopt? She has never been accustomed to think beyond the day. She has eaten and drank, but another has provided the means. She scarcely comprehends the principle that governs the world, and in consequence of which, nothing can be gained but by giving something in exchange for it. She is ignorant and helpless as a child, on every topic that relates to the procuring of subsistence. Her education has disabled her from standing alone. But this was not all. She must not only be supplied by others, but sustained in the enjoyment of a luxurious existence. Would you bereave her of the gratifications of opulence? You had better take away her life. Nay, it would ultimately amount to this. She can live but in one way. At present she is lovely, and, to a certain degree, innocent, but expose her to the urgencies and temptations of want, let personal pollution be the price set upon the voluptuous affluences of her present condition, and it is to be feared there is nothing in the contexture of her mind to hinder her from making the purchase. In every respect therefore the prospect was a hopeless one. So hopeless that her mind insensibly returned to the question which she had at first dismissed with very slight examination, the question relative to the advantages and probabilities of marriage. A more accurate review convinced her that this was the most eligible alternative. It was, likewise, most easily effected. The lady, of course, would be its fervent advocate. There did not want reasons why Ormond should finally embrace it. In what manner appeals to his reason or his passion might most effectually be made, she knew not. Helena was illy qualified to be her own advocate. Her unhappiness could not but be visible to Ormond. He had shewn himself attentive and affectionate. Was it impossible that, in time, he should reason himself into a spontaneous adoption of this scheme? This, indeed, was a slender foundation for hope, but there was no other on which she could build. Such were the meditations of Constantia on this topic. She was deeply solicitous for the happiness of her friend. They spent much of their time together. The consolations of her society were earnestly sought by Helena, but to enjoy them, she was for the most part obliged to visit the former at her own dwelling. For this arrangement, Constantia apologized by saying, you will pardon my requesting you to favor me with your visits, rather than allowing you mine. Every thing is airy and brilliant within these walls. There is, besides, an air of seclusion and security about you that is delightful. In comparison, my dwelling is bleak, comfortless, and unretired, but my father is entitled to all my care. His infirmity prevents him from amusing himself, and his heart is cheered by the mere sound of my voice, though not addressed to him. The mere belief of my presence seems to operate as an antidote to the dreariness of solitude; and now you know my motives, I am sure you will not only forgive but approve of my request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. When once the subject had been introduced, Helena was prone to descant upon her own situation, and listened with deference to the remarks and admonitions of her companion. Constantia did not conceal from her any of her sentiments. She enabled her to view her own condition in its true light, and set before her the indispensable advantages of marriage, while she, at the same time, afforded her the best directions as to the conduct she ought to pursue in order to effect her purpose. The mind of Helena was thus kept in a state of perpetual and uneasy fluctuation. While absent from Ormond, or listening to her friend's remonstrances, the deplorableness of her condition, arose in its most disastrous hues, before her imagination. But the spectre seldom failed to vanish at the approach of Ormond. His voice dissipated every inquietude. She was not insensible of this inconstancy. She perceived and lamented her own weakness. She was destitute of all confidence in her own exertions. She could not be in the perpetual enjoyment of his company. Her intervals of tranquillity therefore were short, while those of anxiety and dejection were insupportably tedious. She revered, but believed herself incapable to emulate the magnanimity of her monitor. The consciousness of inferiority, especially in a case like this, in which her happiness so much depended on her own exertions, excited in her the most humiliating sensations. While indulging in fruitless melancholy, the thought one day occurred to her, why may not Constantia be prevailed upon to plead my cause? Her capacity and courage are equal to any undertaking. The reasonings that are so powerful in my eyes, would they be trivial and futile in those of Ormond? I cannot have a more pathetic and disinterested advocate. This idea was cherished with uncommon ardor. She seized the first opportunity that offered itself to impart it to her friend. It was a wild and singular proposal and was rejected at the first glance. This scheme, so romantic and impracticable as it at first seemed, appeared to Helena in the most plausible colors. She could not bear to relinquish her new born hopes. She saw no valid objection to it. Every thing was easy to her friend, provided her sense of duty and her zeal could be awakened. The subject was frequently suggested to Constantia's reflections. Perceiving the sanguineness of her friend's confidence, and fully impressed with the value of the end to be accomplished, she insensibly veered to the same opinion. At least, the scheme was worthy of a candid discussion before it was rejected. Ormond was a stranger to her. His manners were repulsive and austere. She was a mere girl. Her personal attachment to Helena was all that she could plead in excuse for taking part in her concerns. The subject was delicate. A blunt and irregular character like Ormond's, might throw an air of ridicule over the scene. She shrunk from the encounter of a boisterous and manlike spirit. But were not these scruples effeminate and puerile? Had she studied so long in the school of adversity, without conviction of the duty of a virtuous independence? Was she not a rational being, fully imbued with the justice of her cause? Was it not ignoble to refuse the province of a vindicator of the injured, before any tribunal, however tremendous or unjust? And who was Ormond, that his eye should inspire terror? The father or brother of Helena might assume the office without indecorum. Nay, a mother or sister might not be debarred from it. Why then should she who was actuated by equal zeal, and was engaged, by ties stronger than consanguinity, in the promotion of her friend's happiness. It is true she did not view the subject in the light in which it was commonly viewed by brothers and parents. It was not a gust of rage that should transport her into his presence. She did not go to awaken his slumbering conscience, and abash him in the pride of guilty triumph, but to rectify deliberate errors and change his course by the change of his principles. It was her business to point out to him the road of duty and happiness, from which he had strayed with no sinister intentions. This was to be done without raving and fury, but with amicable soberness, and in the way of calm and rational remonstrance. Yet there were scruples that would not be shut out, and continually whispered her, What an office is this for a girl and a stranger to assume? In what manner should it be performed? Should an interview be sought, and her ideas be explained without confusion or faultering, undismayed by ludicrous airs or insolent frowns? But this was a point to be examined. Was Ormond capable of such behaviour? If he were, it would be useless to attempt the reformation of his errors. Such a man is incurable and obdurate. Such a man is not to be sought as the husband of Helena; but this surely is a different being. The medium through which she had viewed his character was an ample one, but might not be very accurate. The treatment which Helena had received from him, exclusive of his fundamental error, betokened a mind to which she did not disdain to be allied. In spite of his defects she saw that their elements were more congenial, and the points of contact, between this person and herself, more numerous, than between her and Helena, whose voluptuous sweetness of temper and mediocrity of understanding, excited in her bosom no genuine sympathy. Every thing is progressive in the human mind. When there is leisure to reflect, ideas will succeed each other in a long train, before the ultimate point be gained. The attention must shift from one side to the other of a given question many times before it settles. Constantia did not form her resolutions in haste, but when once formed, they were exempt from fluctuation. She reflected before she acted, and therefore acted with consistency and vigor. She did not apprise her friend of her intention. She was willing that she should benefit by her interposition, before she knew it was employed. She sent her Lucy with a note to Ormond's house. It was couched in these terms: "Constantia Dudley requests an interview with Mr. Ormond. Her business being of some moment, she wishes him to name an hour when most disengaged." An answer was immediately returned, that at three o'clock, in the afternoon, he should be glad to see her. This message produced no small surprise in Ormond. He had not withdrawn his notice from Constantia, and had marked, with curiosity and approbation, the progress of the connexion between the two women. The impressions which he had received from the report of Helena, were not dissimilar to those which Constantia had imbibed, from the same quarter, respecting himself; but he gathered from them no suspicion of the purpose of a visit. He recollected his connexion with Craig. This lady had had an opportunity of knowing that some connexion subsisted between them. He concluded, that some information or inquiry respecting Craig, might occasion this event. As it was, it gave him considerable satisfaction. It would enable him more closely to examine one, with respect to whom he entertained great curiosity. Ormond's conjecture was partly right. Constantia did not forget her having traced Craig to this habitation. She designed to profit by the occasion, which this circumstance afforded her, of making some inquiry respecting Craig, in order to introduce, by suitable degrees, a more important subject. The appointed hour having arrived, he received her in his drawing-room. He knew what was due to his guest. He loved to mortify, by his negligence, the pride of his equals and superiors, but a lower class had nothing to fear from his insolence. Constantia took the seat that was offered to her, without speaking. She had made suitable preparations for this interview, and her composure was invincible. The manners of her host were by no means calculated to disconcert her. His air was conciliating and attentive. She began with naming Craig, as one known to Ormond, and desired to be informed of his place of abode. She was proceeding to apologize for this request, by explaining in general terms, that her father's infirmities prevented him from acting for himself, that Craig was his debtor to a large amount, that he stood in need of all that justly belonged to him, and was in pursuit of some means for tracing Craig to his retreat. Ormond interrupted her, examining, at the same time, with a vigilance, somewhat too unsparing, the effects which his words should produce upon her. You may spare yourself the trouble of explaining. I am acquainted with the whole affair between Craig and your family. He has concealed from me nothing. I know all that has passed between you. In saying this, Ormond intended that his looks and emphasis should convey his full meaning. In the style of her comments he saw none of those corroborating symptoms that he expected. Indeed! He has been very liberal of his confidence. Confession is a token of penitence, but, alas! I fear he has deceived you. To be sincere was doubtless his true interest, but he is too much in the habit of judging superficially. If he has told you all, there is, indeed, no need of explanation. This visit is, in that case, sufficiently accounted for. Is it in your power, Sir, to inform us whither he has gone? For what end should I tell you? I promise you you will not follow him. Take my word for it, he is totally unworthy of you. Let the past be no precedent for the future. If you have not made that discovery yourself, I have made it for you. I expect, at least, to be thanked for my trouble. This speech was unintelligible to Constantia. Her looks betokened a perplexity unmingled with fear or shame. It is my way, continued he, to say what I think. I care little for consequences. I have said that I know all. This will excuse me for being perfectly explicit. That I am mistaken is very possible; but I am inclined to place that matter beyond the reach of a doubt. Listen to me, and confirm me in the opinion I have already formed of your good sense, by viewing, in a just light, the unreservedness with which you are treated. I have something to tell, which, if you are wise, you will not be offended at my telling so roundly. On the contrary you will thank me, and perceive that my conduct is a proof of my respect for you. The person whom you met here is named Craig, but, as he tells me, is not the man you looked for. This man's brother, the partner of your father, and, as he assured me, your own accepted and illicitly gratified lover, is dead. These words were uttered without any extenuating hesitation or depression of tone. On the contrary, the most offensive terms were drawn out in the most deliberate and emphatic manner. Constantia's cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled with indignation, but she forbore to interrupt. The looks with which she listened to the remainder of the speech, shewed that she fully comprehended the scene, and enabled him to comprehend it. He proceeded. This man is a brother of that. Their resemblance in figure occasioned your mistake. Your father's debtor died, it seems, on his arrival at Jamaica. There he met with this brother, and bequeathed to him his property and papers. Some of these papers are in my possession. They are letters from Constantia Dudley, and are parts of an intrigue, which, considering the character of the man, was not much to her honor. Such was this man's narrative told to me some time before your meeting with him at this house. I have a right to judge in this affair, that is, I have a right to my opinion. If I mistake, and I half suspect myself, you are able, perhaps, to rectify my error, and in a case like this, doubtless you will not want the inclination. Perhaps if the countenance of this man had not been characterised by the keenest intelligence, and a sort of careless and overflowing good will, this speech might have produced different effects. She was prepared, though imperfectly, for entering into his character. He waited for an answer, which she gave without emotion. You are deceived. I am sorry for your own sake, that you are. He must have had some end in view, in imposing these falsehoods upon you, which, perhaps, they have enabled him to accomplish. As to myself, this man can do me no injury. I willingly make you my judge. The letters you speak of will alone suffice to my vindication. They never were received from me, and are forgeries. That man always persisted till he made himself the dupe of his own artifices. That incident in his plot, on the introduction of which he probably the most applauded himself, will most powerfully operate to defeat it. Those letters never were received from me, and are forgeries. His skill in imitation extended no farther in the present case, than my handwriting. My modes of thinking and expression were beyond the reach of his mimicry. When she had finished, Ormond spent a moment in ruminating. I perceive you are right, said he. I suppose he has purloined from me two hundred guineas, which I intrusted to his fidelity. And yet I received a letter;—but that may likewise be a forgery. By my soul, continued he, in a tone that had more of satisfaction than disappointment in it, this fellow was an adept at his trade. I do not repine. I have bought the exhibition at a cheap rate. The pains that he took did not merit a less recompense. I am glad that he was contented with so little. Had he persisted he might have raised the price far above its value. 'Twill be lamentable if he receive more than he stipulated for; if, in his last purchase, the gallows should be thrown into the bargain. May he have the wisdom to see that a halter, though not included in his terms, is only a new instance of his good fortune; but his cunning will hardly carry him thus far. His stupidity will, no doubt, prefer a lingering to a sudden exit. But this man and his destiny are trifles. Let us leave them to themselves. Your name is Constantia. 'Twas given you I suppose that you might be known by it. Pr'ythee, Constantia, was this the only purpose that brought you hither? If it were, it has received as ample a discussion as it merits. 12 You came for this end, but will remain, I hope, for a better one. Having dismissed Craig and his plots, let us now talk of each other. I confess, said the lady, with a hesitation she could not subdue, this was not my only purpose. One much more important has produced this visit. Indeed! pray let me know it. I am glad that so trivial an object as Craig, did not occupy the first place in your thoughts. Proceed, I beseech you. It is a subject on which I cannot enter without hesitation. A hesitation unworthy of me.— Stop, cried Ormond, rising and touching the bell, nothing like time to make a conquest of embarrassment. We will defer this conference six minutes, just while we eat our dinner. At the same moment a servant entered, with two plates and the usual apparatus for dinner. On seeing this she rose in some hurry, to depart. I thought, Sir, you were disengaged. I will call at some other hour. He seized her hand, and held her from going, but with an air by no means disrespectful. Nay, said he, what is it that scares you away? Are you terrified at the mention of victuals? You must have fasted long when it comes to that. I told you true. I am disengaged, but not from the obligation of eating and drinking. No doubt you have dined. No reason why I should go without my dinner. If you do not choose to partake with me, so much the better. Your temperance ought to dispense with two meals in an hour. Be a looker on, or, if that will not do, retire into my library, where, in six minutes, I will be with you; and lend you my aid in the arduous task of telling me what you came with an intention of telling. This singular address disconcerted and abashed her. She was contented to follow the servant silently into an adjoining apartment. Here she reflected with no small surprise on the behavior of this man. Though ruffled, she was not heartily displeased with it. She had scarcely time to recollect herself, when he entered. He immediately seated her, and himself opposite to her. He fixed his eyes without scruple on her face. His gaze was steadfast, but not insolent or oppressive. He surveyed her with the looks with which he would have eyed a charming portrait. His attention was occupied with what he saw, as that of an artist is occupied when viewing a Madonna of Rafaello. At length he broke silence. At dinner I was busy in thinking what it was you had to disclose. I will not fatigue you with my guesses. They would be impertinent, as long as the truth is going to be disclosed.—He paused, and then continued. But I see you cannot dispense with my aid. Perhaps your business relates to Helena. She has done wrong, and you wish me to rebuke the girl. Constantia profited by this opening, and said, yes, she has done wrong. It is true, my business relates to her. I came hither as a suppliant in her behalf. Will you not assist her in recovering the path from which she has deviated? She left it from confiding more in the judgment of her guide than her own. There is one method of repairing the evil. It lies with you to repair that evil. During this address, the gaiety of Ormond disappeared. He fixed his eyes on Constantia with new and even pathetic earnestness. I guessed as much, said he. I have often been deceived in my judgment of characters. Perhaps I do not comprehend your's. Yet it is not little that I have heard respecting you. Something I have seen. I begin to suspect a material error in my theory of human nature. Happy will it be for Helena if my suspicions be groundless. You are Helena's friend. Be mine also, and advise me. Shall I marry this girl or not? You know on what terms we live. Are they suitable to our respective characters? Shall I wed this girl, or shall things remain as they are? I have an irreconcilable aversion to a sad brow and a sick bed. Helena is grieved, because her neighbors sneer and point at her. So far she is a fool, but that is a folly of which she never will be cured. Marriage, it seems, will set all right. Answer me, Constantia, shall I marry? There was something in the tone, but more in the tenor of this address that startled her. There was nothing in this man but what came upon her unaware. This sudden effusion of confidence, was particularly unexpected and embarrassing. She scarcely knew whether to regard it as serious or a jest. On observing her indisposed to speak, he continued. Away with these impertinent circuities and scruples. I know your meaning. Why should I pretend ignorance, and put you to the trouble of explanation? You came hither with no other view than to exact this question, and furnish an answer. Why should not we come at once to the point? I have for some time been dubious on this head. There is something wanting to determine the balance. If you have that something, throw it into the proper scale. You err if you think this manner of addressing you is wild or improper. This girl is the subject of discourse. If she was not to be so, why did you favor me with this visit? You have sought me, and introduced yourself. I have, in like manner, overlooked ordinary forms: a negligence that has been systematic with me; but, in the present case, particularly justifiable by your example. Shame upon you, presumptuous girl, to suppose yourself the only rational being among mankind. And yet, if you thought so, why did you thus unceremoniously intrude upon my retirements? This act is of a piece with the rest. It shows you to be one whose existence I did not believe possible. Take care. You know not what you have done. You came hither as Helena's friend. Perhaps time may shew that in this visit, you have performed the behest of her bitterest enemy. But that is out of season. This girl is our mutual property. You are her friend; I am her lover. Her happiness is precious in my eyes and in your's. To the rest of mankind she is a noisome weed, that cannot be shunned too cautiously, nor trampled on too much. If we forsake her, infamy that is now kept at bay, will seize upon her, and while it mangles her form, will tear from her her innocence. She has no arms with which to contend against that foe. Marriage will place her at once in security. Shall it be? You have an exact knowledge of her strength and her weakness. Of me, you know little. Perhaps, before that question can be satisfactorily answered, it is requisite to know the qualities of her husband. Be my character henceforth the subject of your study. I will furnish you with all the light in my power. Be not hasty in deciding, but when your decision is formed, let me know it. He waited for an answer, which she, at length, summoned resolution enough to give. You have come to the chief point which I had in view in making this visit. To say truth, I came hither to remonstrate with you on withholding that which Helena may justly claim from you. Her happiness will be unquestionably restored, and increased by it. Your's will not be impaired. Matrimony will not produce any essential change in your situation. It will produce no greater or different intercourse than now exists. Helena is on the brink of a gulf which I shudder to look upon. I believe that you will not injure yourself by snatching her from it. I am sure that you will confer an inexpressible benefit upon her. Let me then persuade you to do her and yourself justice. No persuasion, said Ormond, after recovering from a fit of thoughtfulness, is needful for this end; I only want to be convinced. You have decided, but I fear hastily. By what inscrutable influences are our steps guided. Come, proceed in your exhortations. Argue with the utmost clearness and cogency. Arm yourself with all the irresistibles of eloquence. Yet you are building nothing. You are only demolishing. Your argument is one thing. Its tendency is another; and is the reverse of all you expect and desire. My assent will be refused with an obstinacy proportioned to the force that you exert to obtain it, and to the just application of that force. I see, replied the lady, smiling and leaving her seat, you can talk in riddles, as well as other people. This visit has been too long. I shall, indeed, be sorry, if my interference, instead of serving my friend, has injured her. I have acted an uncommon, and, as it may seem, an ambiguous part. I shall be contented with construing my motives in my own way. I wish you a good evening. 'Tis false, cried he, sternly, you do not wish it. How? Exclaimed the astonished Constantia. I will put your sincerity to the test. Allow me to spend this evening in your company; then it will be well spent, and I shall believe your wishes sincere. Else, continued he, changing his affected austerity into a smile, Constantia is a liar. You are a singular man. I hardly know how to understand you. 12* Well. Words are made to carry meanings. You shall have them in abundance. Your house is your citadel. I will not enter it without leave. Permit me to visit you when I please. But that is too much. It is more than I would allow you. When will you permit me to visit you? I cannot answer when I do not understand. You clothe your thoughts in a garb so uncouth, that I know not in what light they are to be viewed. Well, now, I thought you understood my language, and were an English woman, but I will use another. Shall I have the honor (bowing with a courtly air of supplication) of occasionally paying my respects to you at your own dwelling. It would be cruel to condemn those who have the happiness of knowing Miss Dudley, to fashionable restraints. At what hour will she be least incommoded by a visitant? I am as little pleased with formalities, replied the lady, as you are. My friends I cannot see too often. They need to consult merely their own convenience. Those who are not my friends I cannot see too seldom. You have only to establish your title to that name, and your welcome at all times, is sure. Till then you must not look for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. Here ended this conference. She had, by no means, suspected the manner in which it would be conducted. All punctilios were trampled under foot, by the impetuosity of Ormond. Things were, at once, and without delay, placed upon a certain footing. The point, which ordinary persons would have employed months in attaining, was reached in a moment. While these incidents were fresh in her memory, they were accompanied with a sort of trepidation, the offspring at once of pleasure and surprise. Ormond had not deceived her expectations, but hearsay and personal examination, however uniform their testimony may be, produce a very different impression. In her present reflections, Helena and her lover approached to the front of the stage, and were viewed with equal perspicuity. One consequence of this was, that their characters were more powerfully contrasted with each other, and the ilegibility of marriage, appeared not quite so incontestible as before. Was not equality implied in this compact? Marriage is an instrument of pleasure or pain in proportion as this equality is more or less. What, but the fascination of his senses is it, that ties Ormond to Helena. Is this a basis on which marriage may properly be built? If things had not gone thus far, the impropriety of marriage could not be doubted; but, at present, there is a choice of evils, and that may now be desirable, which at a former period, and in different circumstances, would have been clearly otherwise. The evils of the present connexion are know; those of marriage are future and contingent; Helena cannot be the object of a genuine and lasting passion; another may; this is not merely possible; nothing is more likely to happen. This event, therefore, ought to be included in our calculation. There would be a material deficiency without it. What was the amount of the misery that would, in this case, ensue. Constantia was qualified, beyond most others, to form an adequate conception of this misery. One of the ingredients in her character was a mild and steadfast enthusaism. Her sensibilities to social pleasure, and her conceptions of the benefits to flow from the conformity and concurrence of intentions and wishes, heightening and refining the sensual passion, were exquisite. There, indeed, were evils, the foresight of which tended to prevent them, but was there wisdom in creating obstacles in the way of a suitable alliance. Before we act, we must consider not only the misery produced, but the happiness precluded by our measures. In no case, perhaps, is the decision of a human being impartial, or totally uninfluenced by sinister and selfish motives. If Constantia surpassed others, it was not, because, her motives were pure, but, because they possessed more of purity than those of others. Sinister considerations flow in upon us through imperceptible channels, and modify our thoughts in numberless ways, without our being truly conscious of their presence. Constantia was young, and her heart was open at a thousand pores, to the love of excellence. The image of Ormond occupied the chief place in her fancy, and was endowed with attractive and venerable qualities. A bias was hence created that swayed her thoughts, though she knew not that they were swayed. To this might justly be imputed, some part of that reluctance which she now felt to give Ormond to Helena. But this was not sufficient to turn the scale. That which had previously mounted, was indeed heavier than before, but this addition did not enable it to outweigh its opposite. Marriage was still the best upon the whole, but her heart was tortured to think that, best as it was, it abounded with so many evils. On the evening of the next day, Ormond entered with careless abruptness, Constantia's sitting apartment. He was introduced to her father. A general and unrestrained conversation immediately took place. Ormond addressed Mr. Dudley with the familiarity of an old acquaintance. In three minutes all embarrassment was discarded. The lady and her visitant were accurate observers of each other. In the remarks of the latter, and his vein was an abundant one, there was a freedom and originality altogether new to his hearers. In his easiest and sprightliest sallies were tokens of a mind habituated to profound and extensive views. His associations were formed on a comprehensive scale. He pretended to nothing, and studied the concealments of ambiguity more in reality than in appearance. Constantia, however, discovered a sufficient resemblance between their theories of virtue and duty. The difference between them lay in the inferences arbitrarily deduced, and in which two persons may vary without end, and yet never be repugnant. Constantia delighted her companion by the facility with which she entered into his meaning, the sagacity she displayed in drawing out his hints, circumscribing his conjectures, and thwarting or qualifying his maxims. The scene was generally replete with ardor and contention, and yet the impression left on the mind of Ormond was full of harmony. Her discourse tended to rouse him from his lethargy, to furnish him with powerful excitements, and the time spent in her company, seemed like a doubling of existence. The comparison could not but suggest itself, between this scene and that exhibited by Helena. With the latter voluptuous blandishments, musical prattle, and silent but expressive homage, composed a banquet delicious for a while, but whose sweetness now began to pall upon his taste. It supplied him with no new ideas, and hindered him, by the lulling sensations it inspired, from profiting by his former acquisitions. Helena was beautiful. Apply the scale, and not a member was found inelegantly disposed, or negligently moulded. Not a curve that was blemished by an angle or ruffled by asperities. The irradiations of her eyes were able to dissolve the knottiest fibres, and their azure was serene beyond any that nature had elsewhere exhibited. Over the rest of her form the glistening and rosy hues were diffused with prodigal luxuriance, and mingled in endless and wanton variety. Yet this image had fewer attractions even to the senses than that of Constantia. So great is the difference between forms animated by different degrees of intelligence. The interviews of Ormond and Constantia grew more frequent. The progress which they made in the knowledge of each other was rapid. Two positions, that were favorite ones with him, were quickly subverted. He was suddenly changed, from being one of the calumniators of the female sex, to one of its warmest eulogists. This was a point on which Constantia had ever been a vigorous disputant, but her arguments, in their direct tendency, would never have made a convert of this man. Their force, intrinsically considered, was nothing. He drew his conclusions from incidental circumstances. Her reasonings might be fallacious or valid, but they were so composed, arranged and delivered, were drawn from such sources, and accompanied with such illustrations, as plainly testified a manlike energy in the reasoner. In this indirect and circuitous way, her point was unanswerably established. Your reasoning is bad, he would say; every one of your conclusions is false. Not a single allegation but may be easily confuted, and yet I allow that your position is incontrovertibly proved by them. How bewildered is that man who never thinks for himself! who rejects a principle merely because the arguments brought in support of it are insufficient. I must not reject the truth, because another has unjustifiably adopted it. I want to reach a certain hill-top. Another has reached it before me, but the ladder he used is too weak to bear me. What then? Am I to stay below on that account? No; I have only to construct one suitable to the purpose, and of strength sufficient. A second maxim had never been confuted till now. It inculcated the insignificance and hollowness of love. No pleasure he thought was to be despised for its own sake. Every thing was good in its place, but amorous gratifications were to be degraded to the bottom of the catalogue. The enjoyments of music and landscape, were of a much higher order. Epicurism itself was entitled to more respect. Love, in itself, was in his opinion, of little worth, and only of importance as the source of the most terrible of intellectual maladies. Sexual sensations associating themselves, in a certain way, with our ideas, beget a disease, which has, indeed, found no place in the catalogue, but is a case of more entire subversion and confusion of mind than any other. The victim is callous to the sentiments of honor and shame, insensible to the most palpable distinctions of right and wrong, a systematic opponent of testimony, and obstinate perverter of truth. Ormond was partly right. Madness like death can be averted by no foresight or previous contrivance. This probably is one of its characteristics. He that witnesses its influence on another, with most horror, and most fervently deprecates its ravages, is not therefore more safe. This circumstance was realized in the history of Ormond. This infatuation, if it may so be called, was gradual in its progress. The sensations which Helena was now able to excite, were of a new kind. Her power was not merely weakened, but her endeavors counteracted their own end. Her fondness was rejected with disdain, or borne with reluctance. The lady was not slow in perceiving this change. The stroke of death would have been more acceptable. His own reflections were too tormenting, to make him willing to discuss them in words. He was not aware of the effects produced by this change in his demeanor, till informed of it by herself. One evening he displayed symptoms of uncommon dissatisfaction. Her tenderness was unable to dispel it. He complained of want of sleep. This afforded a hint, which she drew forth into one of her enchanting ditties. Habit had almost conferred upon her the power of spontaneous poesy, and while she pressed his forehead to her bosom, she warbled forth a strain airy and exuberant in numbers, tender and extatic in its imagery. Sleep, extend thy downy pinion, Hasten from thy Cell with speed; Spread around thy soft dominion; Much those brows thy balmy presence need. Wave thy hand of slumberous power, Moistened in Lethean dews, To charm the busy spirits of the hour, And brighten memory's malignant hues. Thy mantle, dark and starless, cast Over my selected youth; Bury, in thy womb, the mournful past, And soften, with thy dreams, th' asperities of truth. The changeful hues of his impassioned sleep, My office it shall be to watch the while; With thee, my love, when fancy prompts, to weep, And when thou smile'st, to smile. But sleep! I charge thee, visit not these eyes, Nor raise thy dark pavilion here, 'Till morrow from the cave of ocean rise, And whisper tuneful joy in nature's ear. But mutely let me lie, and sateless gaze At all the soul that in his visage sits, While spirits of harmonious air,— Here her voice sunk, and the line terminated in a sigh. Her museful ardors were chilled by the looks of Ormond. Absorbed in his own thoughts, he appeared scarcely to attend to this strain. His sternness was proof against her accustomed fascinations. At length she pathetically complained of his coldness, and insinuated her suspicions, that his affection was transferred to another object. He started from her embrace, and after two or three turns across the room, he stood before her. His large eyes were steadfastly fixed upon her face. Aye, said he, thou hast guessed right. The love, poor as it was, that I had for thee, is gone. Henceforth thou art desolate indeed. Would to God thou wert wise. Thy woes are but beginning; I fear they will terminate fatally; if so, the catastrophe cannot come too quickly. I disdain to appeal to thy justice, Helena, to remind thee of conditions solemnly and explicitly assumed. Shall thy blood he upon thy own head? No. I will hear it myself. Though the load would crush a mountain, I will hear it. I cannot help it; I make not myself; I am moulded by circumstances; whether I shall love thee or not, is no longer in my own choice. Marriage is, indeed, still in my power. I may give thee my name, and share with thee my fortune. Will these content thee? Thou canst not partake of my love. Thou canst have no part in my tenderness. These are reserved for another more worthy than thou. But no. Thy state is, to the last degree, forlorn; even marriage is denied thee. Thou wast contented to take me without it; to dispense with the name of wife, but the being who has displaced thy image in my heart, is of a different class. She will be to me a wife, or nothing, and I must be her husband, or perish. Do not deceive thyself, Helena. I know what it is in which thou hast placed thy felicity. Life is worth retaining by thee, but on one condition. I know the incurableness of thy infirmity; but be not deceived. Thy happiness is ravished from thee. The condition on which thou consentedst to live, is annulled. I love thee no longer. No truth was ever more delicious; none was ever more detestable. I fight against conviction, and I cling to it. That I love thee no longer, is at once a subject of joy and of mourning. I struggle to believe thee superior to this shock; that thou wilt be happy though deserted by me. Whatever be thy destiny, my reason will not allow me to be miserable on that account. Yet I would give the world; I would forfeit every claim but that which I hope upon the heart of Constantia, to be sure that thy tranquillity will survive this stroke. But let come what will, look no longer to me for offices of love. Henceforth, all intercouse of tenderness ceases. Perhaps all personal intercourse whatever. But though this good be refused, thou art sure of independence. I will guard thy ease and thy honor with a father's scrupulousness. Would to heaven a sister could be created by adoption. I am willing, for thy sake, to be an impostor. I will own thee to the world for my sister, and carry thee whither the cheat shall never be detected. I would devote my whole life to prevarication and falsehood, for thy sake, if that would suffice to make thee happy. To this speech Helena had nothing to answer. Her sobs and tears choked all utterance. She hid her face with her handkerchief, and sat powerless and overwhelmed with despair. Ormond traversed the room uneasily. Sometimes moving to and fro with quick steps, sometimes standing and eyeing her with looks of compassion. At length he spoke. It is time to leave you. This is the first night that you will spend in dreary solitude. I know it will be sleepless and full of agony; but the sentence cannot be recalled. Henceforth regard me as a brother. I will prove myself one. All other claims are swallowed up in a superior affection.—In saying this, he left the house, and almost without intending it, found himself in a few minutes at Mr. Dudley's door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. The politeness of Melbourne had somewhat abated Mr. Dudley's aversion to society. He allowed himself sometimes to comply with urgent invitations. On this evening he happened to be at the house of that gentleman. Ormond entered, and found Constantia alone. An interview of this kind was seldom enjoyed, though earnestly wished for by Constantia, who was eager to renew the subject of her first conversation with Ormond. I have already explained the situation of her mind. All her wishes were concentred in the marriage of Helena. The eligibility of this scheme, in every view which she took of it, appeared in a stronger light. She was not aware that any new obstacle had arisen. She was free from the consciousness of any secret bias. Much less did her modesty suspect, that she herself would prove an insuperable impediment to this plan. There was more than usual solemnity in Ormond's demeanor. After he was seated, he continued, contrary to his custom, to be silent. These singularities were not unobserved by Constantia. They did not, however, divert her from her purpose. 13 I am glad to see you, said she. We so seldom enjoy the advantage of a private interview. I have much to say to you. You authorize me to deliberate on your actions, and, in some measure, to prescribe to you. This is a province which I hope to discharge with integrity and diligence. I am convinced that Helena's happiness and your own, can be secured in one way only. I will emulate your candor, and come at once to the point. Why have you delayed so long the justice that is due to this helpless and lovely girl? There are a thousand reasons why you should think of no other alternative. You have been pleased to repose some degree of confidence in my judgment. Hear my full and deliberate opinion. Make Helena your wife. This is the unequivocal prescription of your duty. This address was heard by Ormond without surprise; but his countenance betrayed the acuteness of his feelings. The bitterness that overflowed his heart, was perceptible in his tone when he spoke. Most egregiously are you deceived. Such is the line with which human capacity presumes to fathom futurity. With all your discernment, you do not see that marriage would effectually destroy me. You do not see that, whether beneficial, or otherwise, in its effects, marriage is impossible. You are merely prompting me to suicide; but how shall I inflict the wound? Where is the weapon? See you not that I am powerless? Leap, say you, into the flames. See you not that I am fettered? Will a mountain move at your bidding, sooner than I in the path, which you prescribe to me? This speech was inexplicable. She pressed him to speak less enigmatically. Had he formed his resolution? If so, arguments and remonstrances were superfluous. Without noticing her interrogatories, he continued. I am too hasty in condemning you. You judge, not against, but without knowledge. When sufficiently informed, your decision will be right. Yet how can you be ignorant! Can you, for a moment, contemplate yourself and me, and not perceive an insuperable bar to this union? You place me, said Constantia, in a very disagreeable predicament. I have not deserved this treatment from you. This is an unjustifiable deviation from plain dealing. Of what impediment do you speak. I can safely say that I know of none. Well, resumed he, with augmented eagerness, I must supply you with knowledge. I repeat, that I perfectly rely on the rectitude of your judgment. Summon all your sagacity and disinterestedness, and choose for me. You know in what light Helena has been viewed by me. I have ceased to view her in this light. She has become an object of indifference. Nay, I am not certain that I do not hate her. Not indeed for her own sake, but because I love another. Shall I marry her whom I hate, when there exists one whom I love with unconquerable ardor? Constantia was thunderstruck with this intelligence. She looked at him with some expression of doubt. How is this? said she. Why did you not tell me this before? When I last talked with you on this subject, I knew it not myself. It has occurred since. I have seized the first occasion that has offered, to inform you of it. Say now, since such is my condition, ought Helena to be my wife? Constantia was silent. Her heart bled for what she foresaw would be the sufferings and forlorn destiny of Helena. She had not courage to inquire further into this new engagement. I wait for your answer, Constantia. Shall I defraud myself of all the happiness which would accrue, from a match of inclination? Shall I put fetters on my usefulness? This is the style in which you speak. Shall I preclude all the good to others, that would flow from a suitable alliance? Shall I abjure the woman I love, and marry her whom I hate? Hatred, replied the lady, is a harsh word. Helena has not deserved that you should hate her. I own this is a perplexing circumstance. It would be wrong to determine hastily. Suppose you give yourself to Helena, will more than yourself be injured by it? Who is this lady? Will she be rendered unhappy by a determination in favor of another? This is a point of the utmost importance. At these words, Ormond forsook his seat, and advanced close up to Constantia. You say true. This is a point of inexpressible importance. It would be presumption in me to decide. That is the lady's own province. And now, say truly, are you willing to accept Ormond with all his faults. Who but yourself could be mistress of all the springs of my soul? I know the sternness of your probity. This discovery will only make you more strenuously the friend of Helena. Yet why should you not shun either extreme. Lay yourself out of view. And yet, perhaps, the happiness of Constantia is not unconcerned in this question. Is there no part of me in which you discover your own likeness? Am I deceived, or is it an incontrolable destiny that unites us? This declaration was truly unexpected by Constantia. She gathered from it nothing but excitements of grief. After some pause, she said. This appeal to me has made no change in my opinion. I still think that justice requires you to become the husband of Helena. As to me, do you think my happiness rests upon so slight a foundation? I cannot love, but when my understanding points out to me the propriety of love. Ever since I have known you, I have looked upon you as rightfully belonging to another. Love could not take place in my circumstances. Yet I will not conceal from you my sentiments. I am not sure that in different circumstances, I should not have loved. I am acquainted with your worth. I do not look for a faultless man. I have met with none whose blemishes were fewer. It matters not, however, what I should have been. I cannot interfere, in this case, with the claims of my friend. I have no passion to struggle with. I hope, in every vicissitude, to enjoy your esteem, and nothing more. There is but one way in which mine can be secured, and that is by espousing this unhappy girl. No, exclaimed Ormond. Require not impossibilities. Helena can never be any thing to me. I should, with unspeakably more willingness, assail my own life. What, said the lady, will Helena think of this sudden and dreadful change. I cannot bear to think upon the feelings that this information will excite. She knows it already. I have this moment left her. I explained to her, in few words, my motives, and assured her of my unalterable resolution. I have vowed never to see her more, but as a brother, and this vow she has just heard. Constantia could not suppress her astonishment and compassion at this intelligence. No, surely, you could not be so cruel! And this was done with your usual abruptness, I suppose. Precipitate and implacable man! Cannot you foresee the effects of this madness? You have planted a dagger in her heart. You have disappointed me. I did not think you could act so inhumanly. Nay, beloved Constantia, he not so liberal of your reproaches. Would you have me deceive her? She must shortly have known it. Could the truth be told too soon? Much too soon, replied the lady, fervently. I have always condemned the maxims by which you act. Your scheme is headlong and barbarous. Could you not regard, with some little compassion, that love which sacrificed for your unworthy sake, honest fame and the peace of virtue? Is she not a poor outcast, goaded by compunction, and hooted at by a malignant and misjudging world, and who was it that reduced her to this deplorable condition? For whose sake, did she willingly consent to brave evils, by which the stoutest heart is appalled? Did this argue no greatness of mind? Who ever surpassed her in fidelity and tenderness? But thus has she been rewarded. I shudder to think what may be the event. Her courage cannot possibly support her, against treatment so harsh; so perversely and wantonly cruel. Heaven grant, that you are not shortly made, bitterly to lament this rashness. Ormond was penetrated with these reproaches. They persuaded him for a moment that his deed was wrong; that he had not unfolded his intentions to Helena, with a suitable degree of gentleness and caution. Little more was said on this occasion. Constantia exhorted him, in the most earnest and pathetic manner, to return and recant, or extenuate his former declarations. He could not be brought to promise compliance. When he parted from her, however, he was half resolved to act as she advised. Solitary reflection made him change this resolution, and he returned to his own house. During the night, he did little else, than ruminate on the events of the preceding evening. He entertained little doubt of his ultimate success with Constantia. She gratified him in nothing, but left him every thing to hope. She had hitherto, it seems, regarded him with indifference, but this had been sufficiently explained. That conduct would be 13* pursued, and that passion be entertained, which her judgment should previously approve. What then was the obstacle? It originated in the claims of Helena, but what were these claims? It was fully ascertained that he should never be united to this girl. If so, the end contemplated by Constantia, and for the sake of which only, his application was rejected, could never be obtained. Unless her rejection of him, could procure a husband for her friend, it would, on her own principles, be improper and superfluous. What was to be done with Helena? It was a terrible alternative to which he was reduced; to marry her or see her perish. But was this alternative quite sure? Could not she, by time or by judicious treatment, be reconciled to her lot? It was to be feared that he had not made a suitable beginning; and yet, perhaps, it was most expedient, that a hasty and abrupt sentence should be succeeded by forbearance and lenity. He regretted his precipitation, and though unused to the melting mood, tears were wrung from him, by the idea of the misery which he had probably occasioned. He was determined to repair his misconduct as speedily as possible, and to pay her a conciliating visit the next morning. He went early to her house. He was informed by the servant that her mistress had not yet risen. Was it usual, he asked, for her to lie so late? No, he was answered; she never knew it happen before, but she supposed her mistress was not well. She was just going into her chamber to see what was the matter. Why, said Ormond, do you suppose that she is sick? She was poorly last night. About nine o'clock she sent out for some physic to make her sleep. To make her sleep? exclaimed Ormond, in a faltering and affrighted accent. Yes, she said she wanted it for that. So I went to the pothecary's. When I come back, she was very poorly indeed. I asked her if I mightn't set up with her. No she says; I do not want any body. You may go to bed as soon as you please, and tell Fabian to do the same. I shall not want you again. What did you buy? Some kind of water, laud'num I think they call it. She wrote it down and I carried the paper to Mr. Eckhart's and he gave it to me in a bottle, and I gave it to my mistress. 'Tis well. Retire. I will see how she is myself. Ormond had conceived himself fortified against every disaster. He looked for nothing but evil, and, therefore, in ordinary cases, regarded its approach without fear or surprise. Now, however, he found that his tremors would not be stilled. His perturbations increased with every step that brought him nearer to her chamber. He knocked, but no answer was returned. He opened, advanced to the bedside, and drew back the curtains. He shrunk from the spectacle that presented itself—Was this the Helena, that a few hours before, was blithsome with health and radiant with beauty! Her visage was serene, but sunken and pale. Death was in every line of it. To his tremulous and hurried scrutiny every limb was rigid and cold. The habits of Ormond tended to obscure the appearances, if not to deaden the emotions of sorrow. He was so much accustomed to the frustration of well intended efforts, and confided so much in his own integrity, that he was not easily disconcerted. He had merely to advert, on this occasion, to the tumultuous state of his feelings, in order to banish their confusion and restore himself to calm. Well, said he, as he dropped the curtain and turned towards another part of the room, this, without doubt, is a rueful spectacle. Can it be helped? Is there in man the power of recalling her? There is none such in me. She is gone. Well then, she is gone. If she were fool enough to die, I am not fool enough to follow her. I am determined to live, and be happy notwithstanding. Why not? Yet, this is a piteous sight. What is impossible to undo, might be easily prevented. A piteous spectacle! But what else, on an ampler scale, is the universe? Nature is a theatre of suffering. What corner is unvisited by calamity and pain? I have chosen as became me. I would rather precede thee to the grave, than live to be thy husband. Thou hast done my work for me. Thou hast saved thyself and me from a thousand evils. Thou hast acted as seemed to thee best, and I am satisfied. Hast thou decided erroneously? They that know thee, need not marvel at that. Endless have been the proofs of thy frailty. In favor of this last act, something may be said. It is the last thou wilt ever commit. Others only will experience its effects; thou hast, at least, provided for thy own safety. But what is here? A letter for me? Had thy understanding been as prompt as thy fingers, I could have borne with thee. I can easily divine the contents of this epistle. He opened it, and found the tenor to be as follows: "You did not use, my dear friend, to part with me in this manner. You never before treated me so roughly. I am sorry, indeed I am, that I ever offended you. Could you suppose that I intended it? And if you knew that I meant not offence, why did you take offence? "I am very unhappy, for I have lost you, my friend. You will never see me more, you say. That is very hard. I have deserved it to be sure, but I do not know how it has happened. Nobody more desired to please than I have done. Morning, noon and night, it was my only study; but you will love me no more; you will see me no more. Forgive me, my friend, but I must say it is very hard. "You said rightly; I do not wish to live without my friend. I have spent my life happily, heretofore. 'Tis true, there have been transient uneasinesses, but your love was a reward and a cure for every thing. I desired nothing better in this world. Did you ever hear me murmur? No; I was not so unjust. My lot was happy, infinitely beyond my deserving. I merited not to be loved by you. O that I had suitable words to express my gratitude, for your kindness! but this last meeting—how different from that which went before? Yet even then, there was something on your brow like discontent, which I could not warble nor whisper away, as I used to do. But, sad as this was, it was nothing like the last. "Could Ormond be so stern and so terrible? You knew that I would die, but you need not have talked as if I were in the way, and as if you had rather I should die than live. But one thing I rejoice at; I am a poor silly girl, but Constantia is a noble and accomplished one. Most joyfully do I resign you to her, my dear friend. You say you love her. She need not be afraid of accepting you. There will be no danger of your preferring another to her. It was very natural and very right for you to prefer her to me. She and you will be happy in each other. It is this that sweetens the cup I am going to drink. Never did I go to sleep, with more good will, than I now go to death. Fare you well, my dear friend." This letter was calculated to make a deeper impression on Ormond, than even the sight of Helena's corpse. It was in vain, for some time, that he endeavored to reconcile himself to this event. It was seldom that he was able to forget it. He was obliged to exert all his energies, to enable him to support the remembrance. The task was, of course, rendered easier by time. It was immediately requisite to attend to the disposal of the corpse. He felt himself unfit for this mournful office. He was willing to relieve himself from it, by any expedient. Helena's next neighbor, was an old lady, whose scruples made her shun all direct intercourse with this unhappy girl; yet she had performed many acts of neighborly kindness. She readily obeyed the summons of Ormond, on this occasion, to take charge of affairs, till another should assume it. Ormond returned home, and sent the following note to Constantia. "You have predicted aright. Helena is dead. In a mind like yours every grief will be suspended, and every regard absorbed in the attention due to the remains of this unfortunate girl. I cannot attend to them." Constantia was extremely shocked by this intelligence, but she was not unmindful of her duty. She prepared herself with mournful alacrity, for the performance of it. Every thing that the occasion demanded, was done with diligence and care. Till this was accomplished, Ormond could not prevail upon himself to appear upon the stage. He was informed of this by a note from Constantia, who requested him to take possession of the unoccupied dwelling and its furniture. Among the terms of his contract with Helena, Ormond had voluntarily inserted the exclusive property of a house and its furniture in this city, with funds adequate to her plentiful maintenance. These he had purchased and transferred to her. To this he had afterwards added a rural retreat, in the midst of spacious and well cultivated fields, three miles from Perth-Amboy, and seated on the right bank of the sound. It is proper to mention that this farm was formerly the property of Mr. Dudley; had been fitted up by him, and used as his summer abode during his prosperity. In the division of his property it had fallen to one of his creditors, from whom it had been purchased by Ormond. This circumstance, in conjunction with the love, which she bore to Constantia, had suggested to Helena a scheme, which her want of foresight would, in different circumstances, have occasioned her to overlook. It was that of making her testament, by which she bequeathed all that she possessed to her friend. This was not done without the knowledge and cheerful concurrence of Ormond, who, together with Melbourne and another respectable citizen, were named executors. Melbourne and his friend were induced by their respect for Constantia, to consent to this nomination. This had taken place before Ormond and Constantia had been introduced to each other. After this event, Ormond had sometimes been employed in contriving means for securing to his new friend and her father, a subsistence, more certain than the will of Helena could afford. Her death he considered as an event equally remote and undesirable. This event, however unexpectedly, had now happened, and precluded the necessity of further consideration on this head. Constantia could not but accept this bequest. Had it been her wish to decline, it was not in her power, but she justly regarded the leisure and independence thus conferred upon her, as inestimable benefits. It was a source of unbounded satisfaction on her father's account, who was once more seated in the bosom of affluence. Perhaps in a rational estimate, one of the most fortunate events that could have befallen those persons, was that period of adversity through which they had been doomed to pass. Most of the defects that adhered to the character of Mr. Dudley, had, by this means, been exterminated. He was now cured of those prejudices which his early prosperity had instilled, and which had flowed from luxurious indulgences. He had learned to estimate himself at his true value, and to sympathize with sufferings which he himself had partaken. It was easy to perceive in what light Constantia was regarded by her father. He never reflected on his relation to her without rapture. Her qualities were the objects of his adoration. He resigned himself with pleasure to her guidance. The chain of subordination and duties was reversed. By the ascendancy of her genius and wisdom, the province of protection and the tribute of homage, had devolved upon her. This had resulted from incessant experience of the wisdom of her measures, and the spectacle of her fortitude and skill in every emergency. It seemed as if but one evil adhered to the condition of this man. His blindness was an impediment to knowledge and enjoyment, of which, the utmost to be hoped was, that he should regard it without pungent regret, and that he should sometimes forget it. That his mind should occasionally stray into foreign paths, and lose itself in sprightly conversations, or benign reveries. This evil, however was, by no means remediless. A surgeon of uncommon skill had lately arrived from Europe. He was one of the numerous agents and dependents of Ormond, and had been engaged to abdicate his native country for purposes widely remote from his profession. The first use that was made of him, was to introduce him to Mr. Dudley. The diseased organs were critically examined, and the patient was, with considerable difficulty, prevailed upon to undergo the necessary operation. His success corresponded with Constantia's wishes, and her father was once more restored to the enjoyment of light. These were auspicious events—Constantia held herself amply repaid by them, for all that she had suffered. These sufferings had indeed been light, when compared with the effects usually experienced by others in a similar condition. Her wisdom had extracted its sting from adversity, and without allowing herself to feel much of the evils of its reign, had employed it as an instrument by which the sum of her present happiness was increased. Few suffered less, in the midst of poverty, than she. No one ever extracted more felicity from the prosperous reverse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. When time had somewhat mitigated the memory of the late disaster, the intercourse between Ormond and Constantia was renewed. The lady did not overlook her obligations to her friend. It was to him that she was indebted for her father's restoration to sight, and to whom both owed, essentially, though indirectly, their present affluence. In her mind, gratitude was no perverse or ignoble principle. She viewed this man as the author of extensive benefits, of which her situation enabled her to judge with more accuracy than others. It created no bias on her judgment or, at least, none of which she was sensible. Her equity was perfectly unfettered, and she decided in a way contrary to his inclination, with as little scruple as if the benefits had been received, not by herself, but by him. She, indeed, intended his benefit, though she thwarted his inclinations. She had few visitants besides himself. Their interviews were daily and unformal. The fate of Helena never produced any reproaches on her part. She saw the uselessness of recrimination, not only because she desired to produce emotions different from those which invective is adapted to excite, but because it was more just to soothe than to exasperate, the inquietudes which haunted him. She now enjoyed leisure. She had always been solicitous for mental improvement. Any means subservient to this end were valuable. The conversation of Ormond was an inexhaustible fund. By the variety of topics and the excitements to reflection it supplied, a more plenteous influx of knowledge was produced, than could have flowed from any other source. There was no end to the detailing of facts, and the canvassing of theories. I have already said, that Ormond was engaged in schemes of an arduous and elevated nature. These were the topics of epistolary discussion between him and a certain number of coadjutors, in different parts of the world. In general discourse, it was proper to maintain a uniform silence respecting these, not only because they involved principles and views, remote from vulgar apprehension, but because their success, in some measure, depended on their secrecy. He could not give a stronger proof of his confidence in the sagacity and steadiness of Constantia than he now gave, by imparting to her his schemes, and requesting her advice and assistance in the progress of them. His disclosures, however, were imperfect. What knowledge was imparted, instead of appeasing, only tended to inflame her curiosity. His answers to her inquiries were prompt, and at first sight, sufficiently explicit, but upon reconsideration, an obscurity seemed to gather round them, to be dispelled by new interrogatories. These, in like manner, effected a momentary purpose, but were sure speedily to lead into new conjectures, and re-immerse her in doubts. The task was always new, was always on the point of being finished, and always to be re-commenced. Ormond aspired to nothing more ardently than to hold the reins of opinion. To exercise absolute power over the conduct of others, not by constraining their limbs, or by exacting obedience to his authority, but in a way of which his subjects should be scarcely conscious. He desired that his guidance should control their steps, but that his agency, when most effectual, should be least suspected. If he were solicitous to govern the thoughts of Constantia, or to regulate her condition, the mode which he pursued had hitherto been admirably conducive to that end. To have found her friendless and indigent, accorded, with the most fortunate exactness, with his views. That she should have descended to this depth, from a prosperous height, and therefore be a stranger to the torpor which attends hereditary poverty, and be qualified rightly to estimate, and use the competence to which, by his means, she was now restored, was all that his providence would have prescribed. Her thoughts were equally obsequious to his direction. The novelty and grandeur of his schemes could not fail to transport a mind, ardent and capacious as that of Constantia. Here his fortune had been no less propitious. He did not fail to discover, and was not slow to seize the advantages flowing thence. By explaining his plans, opportunity was furnished to lead and to confine her meditations to the desirable tract. By adding fictitious embellishments, he adapted it with more exactness to his purpose. By 14 piece-meal and imperfect disclosures, her curiosity was kept alive. I have described Ormond as having contracted a passion for Constantia. This passion certainly existed in his heart, but it must not be conceived to be immutable, or to operate independently of all those impulses and habits, which time had interwoven in his character. The person and affections of this woman, were the objects sought by him, and which it was the dearest purpose of his existence to gain. This was his supreme good, though the motives to which it was indebted for its pre-eminence in his imagination, were numerous and complex. I have enumerated his opinions on the subject of wedlock. The question will obviously occur, whether Constantia was sought by him, with upright or flagitious views. His sentiments and resolutions, on this head, had for a time fluctuated, but were now steadfast. Marriage was, in his eyes, hateful and absurd as ever. Constantia was to be obtained by any means. If other terms were rejected, he was willing, for the sake of this good, to accept her as a wife; but this was a choice to be made, only when every expedient was exhausted, for reconciling her to a compact of a different kind. For this end, he prescribed to himself a path suited to the character of this lady. He made no secret of his sentiments and views. He avowed his love, and described, without scruple, the scope of his wishes. He challenged her to confute his principles, and promised a candid audience and profound consideration to her arguments. Her present opinions he knew to be adverse to his own, but he hoped to change them, by subtilty and perseverance. His further hopes and designs, he concealed from her. She was unaware, that if he were unable to effect a change in her creed, he was determined to adopt a system of imposture. To assume the guise of a convert to her doctrines, and appear as devout as herself in his notions of the sanctity of marriage. Perhaps it was not difficult, to have foreseen the consequence of these projects. Constantia's peril was imminent. This arose not only from the talents and address of Ormond, but from the community of sentiment, which already existed between them. She was unguarded in a point, where, if not her whole, yet, doubtless, her principal security and strongest bulwark would have existed. She was unacquainted with religion. She was unhabituated to conform herself to any standard, but that connected with the present life. Matrimonial, as well as every other human duty, was disconnected in her mind, with any awful or divine sanction. She formed her estimate of good and evil, on nothing but terrestrial and visible consequences. This defect in her character, she owed to her father's system of education. Mr. Dudley was an adherent to what he conceived to be true religion. No man was more passionate in his eulogy of his own form of devotion and belief, or in his invectives against atheistical dogmas; but he reflected that religion assumed many forms, one only of which is salutary or true, and that truth in this respect, is incompatible with infantile and premature instruction. To this subject, it was requisite to apply the force of a mature and unfettered understanding. For this end he labored to lead away the juvenile reflections of Constantia, from religious topics, to detain them in the paths of history and eloquence. To accustom her to the accuracy of geometrical deduction, and to the view of those evils, that have flowed in all ages, from mistaken piety. In consequence of this scheme, her habits rather than her opinions, were undevout. Religion was regarded by her, not with disbelief, but with absolute indifference. Her good sense forbade her to decide before inquiry, but her modes of study and reflection were foreign to, and unfitted her for, this species of discussion. Her mind was seldom called to meditate on this subject, and when it occurred, her perceptions were vague and obscure. No objects, in the sphere which she occupied, were calculated to suggest to her the importance of investigation and certainty. It becomes me to confess, however reluctantly, thus much concerning my friend. However abundantly endowed in other respects, she was a stranger to the felicity and excellence flowing from religion. In her struggles with misfortune, she was supported and cheered by the sense of no approbation, but her own. A defect of this nature will perhaps be regarded as of less moment, when her extreme youth is remembered. All opinions in her mind were mutable, inasmuch as the progress of her understanding was incessant. It was otherwise with Ormond. His disbelief was at once unchangeable and strenuous. The universe was to him a series of events, connected by an undesigning and inscrutable necessity, and an assemblage of forms, to which no beginning or end can be conceived. Instead of transient views and vague ideas, his meditations, on religious points, had been intense. Enthusiasm was added to disbelief, and he not only dissented but abhorred. He deemed it prudent, however, to disguise sentiments, which, if unfolded in their full force, would wear to her the appearance of insanity. But he saw and was eager to improve the advantage, which his anti-nuptial creed derived from the unsettled state of her opinions. He was not unaware, likewise, of the auspicious and indispensable co-operation of love. If this advocate were wanting in her bosom, all his efforts would be in vain. If this pleader were engaged in his behalf, he entertained no doubts of his ultimate success. He conceived that her present situation, all whose comforts were the fruits of his beneficence, and which afforded her no other subject of contemplation than himself, was as favorable as possible to the growth of this passion. Constantia was acquainted with his wishes. She could not fail to see, that she might speedily be called upon to determine a momentous question. Her own sensations and the character of Ormond, were, therefore, scrutinized with suspicious attention. Marriage could be justified in her eyes, only by community of affections and opinions. She might love without the sanction of her judgment, but while destitute of that sanction, she would never suffer it to sway her conduct. Ormond was imperfectly known. What knowledge she had gained, flowed chiefly from his own lips, and was therefore unattended with certainty. What portion of deceit or disguise was mixed with his conversation, could be known, only by witnessing his actions with her own eyes, and comparing his testimony with that of others. He had embraced a multitude of opinions, which appeared to her erroneous. Till these were rectified, and their conclusions were made to correspond, wedlock was improper. Some of these obscurities might be dispelled, and some of these discords be resolved into harmony by time. Meanwhile, it was proper to guard the avenues to her heart, and screen herself from self-delusion. There was no motive to conceal her reflections, on this topic, from her father. Mr. Dudley discovered, without her assistance, the views of Ormond. His daughter's happiness was blended with his own. He lived, but in the consciousness of her tranquillity. Her image was seldom absent from his eyes, and never from his thoughts. The emotions which it excited, sprung but in part from the relationship of father. It was gratitude and veneration, which she claimed from him, and which filled him with rapture. He ruminated deeply on the character of Ormond. The political and anti-theological tenets of this man were regarded, not merely with disapprobation, but antipathy. He was not ungrateful for the benefits which had been conferred upon him. Ormond's peculiarities of sentiment, excited no impatience, as long as he was regarded merely as a visitant. It was only as one claiming to possess his daughter, that his presence excited in Mr. Dudley, trepidation and loathing. Ormond was unacquainted with what was passing in the mind of Mr. Dudley. The latter conceived his own benefactor and his daughter's friend, to be entitled to the most scrupulous and affable urbanity. His objections to a nearer alliance were urged with frequent and pathetic vehemence, only in his private interviews with Constantia. Ormond and he seldom met; Mr. Dudley, as soon as his sight was perfectly retrieved, betook himself with eagerness to painting, an amusement, which his late privations had only contributed to endear to him. Things remained nearly on their present footing for some months. At the end of this period, some engagement obliged Ormond to leave the city. He promised to return with as much speed as circumstances would admit. Meanwhile his letters supplied her with topics of reflection. These were frequently received, and were models of that energy of style, which results from simplicity of structure, from picturesque epithets, and from the compression of much meaning into few words. His arguments seldom imparted conviction, 14* but delight never failed to flow from their lucid order and cogent brevity. His narratives were unequalled for rapidity and comprehensiveness. Every sentence was a treasury to moralists and painters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. Domestic and studious occupations did not wholly engross the attention of Constantia. Social pleasures were precious to her heart, and she was not backward to form fellowships and friendships, with those around her. Hitherto she had met with no one entitled to an uncommon portion of regard, or worthy to supply the place of the friend of her infancy. Her visits were rare, and as yet, chiefly confined to the family of Mr. Melbourne. Here she was treated with flattering distinctions, and enjoyed opportunities of extending as far as she pleased, her connexions with the gay and opulent. To this she felt herself by no means inclined, and her life was still eminently distinguished by love of privacy, and habits of seclusion. One morning, feeling an indisposition to abstraction, she determined to drop in, for an hour, on Mrs. Melbourne. Finding Mrs. Melbourne's parlor unoccupied, she proceeded unceremoniously, to an apartment on the second floor, where that lady was accustomed to sit. She entered, but this room was likewise empty. Here she cast her eyes on a collection of prints, copied from the Farnese collection, and employed herself, for some minutes, in comparing the forms of Titiano and the Caracchi. Suddenly, notes of peculiar sweetness were wafted to her ear from without. She listened with surprise, for the tones of her father's lute were distinctly recognized. She hied to the window, which chanced to look into a back court. The music was perceived to come from the window of the next house. She recollected her interview with the purchaser of her instrument, at the musical shop, and the powerful impression which the stranger's countenance had made upon her. The first use she had made of her recent change of fortune, was to endeavor the recovery of this instrument. The musical dealer, when reminded of the purchase, and interrogated as to the practicability of regaining the lute, for which she was willing to give treble the price, answered that he had no knowledge of the foreign lady, beyond what was gained at the interview which took place in Constantia's presence. Of her name, residence, and condition, he knew nothing, and had endeavored in vain to acquire knowledge. Now this incident seemed to have furnished her with the information she so earnestly sought. This performer was probably the stranger herself. Her residence so near the Melbournes, and in a house which was the property of the magistrate, might be means of information as to her condition, and perhaps of introduction to a personal acquaintance. While engaged in these reflections, Mrs. Melbourne entered the appartment. Constantia related this incident to her friend, and stated the motives of her present curiosity. Her friend willingly imparted what knowledge she possessed relative to this subject. This was the sum. This house had been hired, previously to the appearance of yellow fever, by an English family, who left their native soil, with a view to a permanent abode in the new world. They had scarcely taken possession of the dwelling, when they were terrified by the progress of the epidemic. They had fled from the danger, but this circumstance, in addition to some others, induced them to change their scheme. An evil so unwonted as pestilence, impressed them with a belief of perpetual danger, as long as they remained on this side of the ocean. They prepared for an immediate return to England. For this end their house was relinquished, and their splendid furniture destined to be sold by auction. Before this event could take place, application was made to Mr. Melbourne, by a lady, whom his wife's description shewed to be the same with her of whom Constantia was in search. She not only rented the house, but negotiated by means of her landlord, the purchase of the furniture. Her servants were blacks, and all but one, who officiated as steward, unacquainted with the English language. Some accident had proved her name to be Beauvais. She had no visitants, very rarely walked abroad, and then only in the evening with a female servant in attendance. Her hours appeared to be divided between the lute and the pen. As to her previous history or her present sources of subsistence, Mrs. Melbourne's curiosity had not been idle, but no consistent information was obtainable. Some incident had given birth to the conjecture, that she was wife, or daughter, or sister of Beauvais, the partizan of Brissot, whom the faction of Marat had lately consigned to the scaffold, but this conjecture was unsupported by suitable evidence. This tale by no means diminished Constantia's desire of personal intercourse. She saw no means of effecting her purpose. Mrs. Melbourne was unqualified to introduce her, having been discouraged in all the advances she had made towards a more friendly intercourse. Constantia reflected that her motives to seclusion, would probably induce this lady to treat others as her friend had been treated. It was possible, however, to gain access to her, if not as a friend, yet as the original proprietor of the lute. She determined to employ the agency of Roseveldt, the musical shopman, for the purpose of re-buying this instrument. To enforce her application, she commissioned this person, whose obliging temper entitled him to confidence, to state her inducements for originally offering it for sale, and her motives for desiring the repossession on any terms which the lady thought proper to dictate. Roseveldt fixed an hour in which it was convenient for him to execute her commission. This hour having passed, Constantia, who was anxious respecting his success, hastened to his house. Roseveldt delivered the instrument, which the lady, having listened to his pleas and offers, directed to be gratuitously restored to Constantia. At first, she had expressed her resolution to part with it on no account, and at no price. Its music was her only recreation, and this instrument surpassed any she had ever before seen, in the costliness and delicacy of its workmanship. But Roseveldt's representations produced an instant change of resolution, and she not only eagerly consented to restore it, but refused to receive any thing in payment. Constantia was deeply affected by this unexpected generosity. It was not her custom to be outstripped in this career. She now condemned herself for her eagerness to regain this instrument. During her father's blindness, it was a powerful, because the only solace of his melancholy. Now he had no longer the same anxieties to encounter, and books and the pencil were means of gratification always at hand. The lute, therefore, she imagined, could be easily dispensed with by Mr. Dudley, whereas its power of consoling might be as useful to the unknown lady, as it had formerly been to her father. She readily perceived in what manner it became her to act. Roseveldt was commissioned to re-deliver the lute, and to intreat the lady's acceptance of it. The tender was received without hesitation, and Roseveldt dismissed without any inquiry relative to Constantia. These transactions were reflected on by Constantia with considerable earnestness. The conduct of the stranger, her affluent and lonely state, her conjectural relationship to the actors in the great theatre of Europe, were mingled together in the fancy of Constantia, and embellished with the conceptions of her beauty, derived from their casual meeting at Roseveldt's. She forgot not their similitude in age and sex, and delighted to prolong the dream of future confidence and friendship to take place between them. Her heart sighed for a companion, fitted to partake in all her sympathies. This strain, by being connected with the image of a being like herself, who had grown up with her from childhood, who had been entwined with her earliest affections, but from whom she had been severed from the period at which her father's misfortunes commenced, and of whose present condition she was wholly ignorant, was productive of the deepest melancholy. It filled her with excruciating, and for a time irremediable sadness. It formed a kind of paroxysm, which like some febrile affections, approach and retire without warning, and against the most vehement struggles. In this mood, her fancy was thronged with recollections of scenes, in which her friend had sustained a part. Their last interview was commonly revived in her remembrance so forcibly, as almost to produce a lunatic conception of its reality. A ditty which they sung together on that occasion, flowed to her lips. If ever human tones were qualified to convey the whole soul, they were those of Constantia when she sung;— The breeze awakes, the bark prepares, To waft me to a distant shore; But far beyond this world of cares, We meet again to part no more. These fits were accustomed to approach and to vanish by degrees. They were transitory but not infrequent, and were pregnant with such agonizing tenderness, such heartbreaking sighs, and a flow of such bitter yet delicious tears, that it were not easily decided whether the pleasure or the pain surmounted. When symptoms of their coming were felt, she hastened into solitude, that the progress of her feelings might endure no restraint. On the evening of the day, on which the lute had been sent to the foreign lady, Constantia was alone in her chamber, immersed in desponding thoughts. From these she was recalled by Fabian, her black servant, who announced a guest. She was loth to break off the thread of her present meditations, and inquired with a tone of some impatience, who was the guest? The servant was unable to tell; it was a young lady whom he had never before seen; she had opened for herself, and entered the parlor without previous notice. Constantia paused at this relation. Her thoughts had recently been fixed upon Sophia Westwyn. Since their parting four years before, she had heard no tidings of this woman. Her fears imagined no more probable cause of her friend's silence than her death. This, however, was uncertain. The question now occurred, and brought with it sensations that left her no power to move; was this the guest? Her doubts were quickly dispelled, for the stranger, taking a light from the table, and not brooking the servant's delay, followed Fabian to the chamber of his mistress. She entered with careless freedom, and presented, to the astonished eyes of Constantia, the figure she had met at Roseveldt's, and the purchaser of her lute. The stranger advanced towards her with quick steps, and mingling tones of benignity and sprightliness, said;— I have come to perform a duty. I have received from you to-day a lute, that I valued almost as my best friend. To find another in America, would not, perhaps, be possible; but, certainly, none equally superb and exquisite as this can be found. To shew how highly I esteem the gift, I have come in person to thank you for it.—There she stopped. Constantia could not suddenly recover from the extreme surprise into which the unexpectedness of this meeting, had thrown her. She could scarcely sufficiently suppress this confusion, to enable her to reply to these rapid effusions of her visitant, who resumed, with augmented freedom;— I came, as I said, to thank you, but, to say the truth, that was not all. I came likewise to see you. Having done my errand, I suppose I must go. I would fain stay longer and talk to you a little; will you give me lieve? Constantia, scarcely retrieving her composure, stammered out a polite assent. They seated themselves, and the visitant, pressing the hand which she had taken, proceeded in a strain so smooth, so flowing, sliding from grave to gay, blending vivacity with tenderness, interpreting Constantia's silence with so keen sagacity, and accounting for the singularities of her own deportment, in a way so respectful to her companion, and so worthy of a steadfast and pure mind in herself, that every embarrassment and scruple, were quickly banished from their interview. In an hour the guest took her leave. No promise of repeating her visit, and no request that Constantia would repay it, was made. Their parting seemed to be the last; whatever purpose having been contemplated, appeared to be accomplished by this transient meeting. It was of a nature deeply to interest the mind of Constantia. This was the lady who talked with Roseveldt, and bargained with Melbourne, and they had been induced by appearances, to suppose her ignorant of any language but French; but her discourse, on the present occasion, was in English, and was distinguished by unrivalled fluency. Her phrases and habits of pronouncing, were untinctured with any foreign mixture, and bespoke the perfect knowledge of a native of America. On the next evening, while Constantia was reviewing this transaction, calling up and weighing the sentiments which the stranger had uttered, and indulging some regret at the unlikelihood of their again meeting, Martinette, (for I will henceforth call her by her true name,) entered the apartment as abruptly as before. She accounted for the visit, merely by the pleasure it afforded her, and proceeded in a strain even more versatile and brilliant, than before. This interview ended like the first, without any tokens, on the part of the guest, of resolution or desire to renew it, but a third interview took place on the ensuing day. Henceforth Martinette became a frequent but hasty visitant, and Constantia became daily more enamored of her new acquaintance. She did not overlook peculiarities in the conversation and deportment of this woman. These exhibited no tendencies to confidence, or traces of sympathy. They merely denoted large experience, vigorous faculties and masculine attaimnents. Herself was never introduced, except as an observer, but her observations, on government and manners, were profound and critical. Her education seemed not widely different, from that which Constantia had received. It was classical and mathematical, but to this was added a knowledge of political and military transactions in Europe, during the present age, which implied the possession of better means of information, than books. She depicted scenes and characters, with the accuracy of one who had partaken and witnessed them herself. Constantia's attention had been chiefly occupied by personal concerns. Her youth had passed in contention with misfortune, or in the quietudes of study. She could not be unapprised of contemporary revolutions and wars, but her ideas respecting them were indefinite and vague. Her views and her inferences on this head, were general and speculative. Her acquaintance with history was exact and circumstantial, in proportion as she retired backward from her own age. She knew more of the siege of Mutina than of that of Lisle; more of the machinations of Cataline and the tumults of Clodius, than of the prostration of the Bastile, and the proscriptions of Marat. She listened, therefore, with unspeakable eagerness to this reciter, who detailed to her, as the occasion suggested, the progress of action and opinion, on the theatre of France and Poland. Conceived and rehearsed as this was, with the energy and copiousness of one who sustained a part in the scene, the mind of Constantia was always kept at the pitch of curiosity and wonder. But while this historian described the features, personal deportment, and domestic character of Antoinette, Mirabeau and Robespierre, an impenetrable veil was drawn over her own condition. There was a warmth and freedom in her details, which bespoke her own co-agency in these events, but was unattended by transports of indignation or sorrow, or by pauses of abstraction, such as were likely to occur in one whose hopes and fears had been intimately blended with public events. Constantia could not but derive humiliation from comparing her own slender acquirements with those of her companion. She was sensible that all the differences between them, arose from diversities of situation. She was eager to discover in what particulars this diversity consisted. She was for a time withheld by scruples, not easily explained, from disclosing her wishes. An accident however occurred, to remove these impediments. One evening, this unceremonious visitant discovered Constantia busily surveying a chart of the Mediterranean sea. This circumstance led the discourse to the present state of Syria and Cyprus. Martinette was copious in her details. Constantia listened for a time, and when a pause ensued, questioned her companion as to the means she possessed of acquiring so much knowledge. This question was proposed with diffidence, and prefaced by apologies. Instead of being offended by your question, replied the guest, I only wonder that it never before occurred to you. Travellers tell us much. Volney and Mariti would have told you nearly all that I have told. With these I have conversed personally, as well as read their books, but my knowledge is, in truth, a species of patrimony. I inherit it. Will you be good enough, said Constantia, to explain yourself? My mother was a Greek of Cyprus. My father was a Sclavonian of Ragusa, and I was born in a garden at Aleppo. That was a singular concurrence. How singular? That a nautical vagrant like my father, should sometimes anchor in the bay of Naples. That a Cyprian merchant should carry his property and daughter beyond the reach of a Turkish Sangiack, and seek an asylum 15 so commodious as Napoli; that my father should have dealings with this merchant, see, love, and marry his daughter, and afterwards procure, from the French government, a consular commission to Aleppo; that the union should, in due time, be productive of a son and daughter, are events far from being singular. They happen daily. And may I venture to ask if this be your history? The history of my parents. I hope you do not consider the place of my birth as the sole or the most important circumstance of my life. Nothing would please me more than to be enabled to compare it with other incidents. I am apt to think that your life is a tissue of surprising events. That the daughter of a Ragusan and Greek, should have seen and known so much; that she should talk English with equal fluency and more correctness than a native; that I should now be conversing with her in a corner so remote from Cyprus and Sicily, are events more wonderful than any which I have known. Wonderful! Pish! Thy ignorance, thy miscalculation of probabilities is far more so. My father talked to me in Sclavonic. My mother and her maids talked to me in Greek. My neighbors talked to me in a medley of Arabic, Syriac and Turkish. My father's secretary was a scholar. He was as well versed in Lysias and Xenophon, as any of their contemporaries. He labored for ten years to enable me to read a language, essentially the same with that I used daily to my nurse and mother. Is it wonderful then that I should be skilful in Sclavonic, Greek, and the jargon of Aleppo? To have refrained from learning was impossible. Suppose a girl, prompt, diligent, inquisitive, to spend ten years of her life partly in Spain; partly in Tuscany; partly in France, and partly in England. With her versatile curiosity and flexible organs, would it be possible for her to remain ignorant of each of these languages? Latin is the mother of them all, and presents itself, of course, to her studious attention. I cannot easily conceive motives which should lead you, before the age of twenty, through so many scenes. Can you not? You grew and flourished, like a frail Mimosa, in the spot where destiny had planted you. Thank my stars, I am somewhat better than a vegetable. Necessity, it is true, and not choice, set me in motion, but I am not sorry for the consequences. Is it too much, said Constantia, with some hesitation, to request a detail of your youthful adventures? Too much to give, perhaps, at a short notice. To such as you, my tale might abound with novelty, while to others, more acquainted with vicissitudes, it would be tedious and flat. I must be gone in a few minutes. For that and for better reasons, I must not be minute. A summary, at present, will enable you to judge how far a more copious narrative is suited to instruct or to please you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. My father, in proportion as he grew old and rich, became weary of Aleppo. His natal soil, had it been the haunt of Calmucks or Bedwins, his fancy would have transformed into Paradise. No wonder that the equitable aristocracy, and the peaceful husbandmen of Ragusa, should be endeared to his heart by comparison with Egyptian plagues and Turkish tyranny. Besides, he lived for his children as well as himself. Their education and future lot required him to seek a permanent home. He embarked with his wife and offspring, at Scanderoon. No immediate conveyance to Ragusa offering, the appearance of the plague in Syria, induced him to hasten his departure. He entered a French vessel for Marseilles. After being three days at sea, one of the crew was seized by the fatal disease, which had depopulated all the towns upon the coast. The voyage was made with more than usual despatch, but before we reached our port, my mother and half the crew perished. My father died in the Lazzaretto, more through grief than disease. My brother and I were children and helpless. My father's fortune was on board this vessel, and was left by his death to the mercy of the captain. This man was honest, and consigned us and our property to the merchant with whom he dealt. Happily for us, our protector was childless and of scrupulous integrity. We henceforth became his adopted children. My brother's education and my own, were conducted on the justest principles. At the end of four years, our protector found it expedient to make a voyage to Cayenne. His brother was an extensive proprietor in that colony, but his sudden death made way for the succession of our friend. To establish his claims, his presence was necessary on the spot. He was little qualified for arduous enterprises, and his age demanded repose, but his own acquisitions, having been small, and being desirous of leaving us in possession of competence, he cheerfully embarked. Meanwhile, my brother was placed at a celebrated seminary in the Pais de Vaud, and I was sent to a sister who resided at Verona. I was at this time fourteen years old, one year younger than my brother, whom, since that period, I have neither heard of nor seen. I was now a woman, and qualified to judge and act for myself. The character of my new friend was austere and devout, and there were so many incongenial points between us, that but little tranquillity was enjoyed under her control. The priest who discharged the office of her confessor, thought proper to entertain views with regard to me, grossly inconsistent with the sanctity of his profession. He was a man of profound dissimulation and masterly address. His efforts, however, were repelled with disdain. My security against his attempts lay in the uncouthness and deformity which nature had bestowed upon his person and visage, rather than in the firmness of my own principles. The courtship of Father Bartoli, the austerities of Madame Roselli, the disgustful or insipid occupations to which I was condemned, made me impatiently wish for a change, but my father, so I will call him, had decreed that I should remain under his sister's guardianship till his return from Guiana. When this would happen was uncertain. Events unforeseer might protract it for years, but it could not arrive in less than a twelvemonth. I was incessantly preyed upon by discontent. My solitude was loathsome. I panted after liberty and friendship, and the want of these were not recompensed by luxury and quiet, and by the instructions in useful science, which I received from Bartoli, who, though detested as a hypocrite and lover, was venerable as a scholar. He would fain have been an Ahelard, but it was not his fate to meet with an Heloise. Two years passed away in this durance. My miseries were exquisite. I am almost at a loss to account for the unhappiness of that time, for looking back upon it, I perceive that an equal period could not have been spent with more benefit. For the sake of being near me, Bartoli importunately offered his instructions. He had nothing to communicate but metaphysics and geometry. These were little to my taste, but I could not keep him at distance. I had no other alternative than to endure him as a lover or a teacher. His passion for science was at least equal to that which he entertained for me, and both these passions combined to make him a sedulous instructer. He was a disciple of the newest doctrines respecting matter and mind. He denied the impenetrability of the first, and the immateriality of the second. These he endeavored to inculcate upon me, as well as to subvert my religious tenets, because he delighted, like all men, in transfusing his opinions, and because he regarded my piety as the only obstacle to his designs. He succeeded in dissolving the spell of ignorance, but not in producing that kind of acquiescence he wished. He had, in this respect, to struggle not only with my principles, but my weakness. He might have overcome every obstacle, but my abhorrence of deformity and age. To cure me of this aversion was beyond his power. My servitude grew daily more painful. I grew tired of chasing a comet to its aphelion, and of untying the knot of an infinite series. A change in my condition became indispensable to my very existence. Languor and sadness, and unwillingness to eat or to move, were at last my perpetual attendants. Madame Roselli was alarmed at my condition. The sources of my inquietude were incomprehensible to her. The truth was, that I scarcely understood them myself, and my endeavors to explain them to my friend, merely instilled into her an opinion, that I was either lunatic or deceitful. She complained and admonished, but my disinclination to my usual employments would not be conquered, and my health 15* rapidly declined. A physician, who was called, confessed that my case was beyond his power to understand, but recommended, as a sort of desperate expedient, a change of scene. A succession and variety of objects might possibly contribute to my cure. At this time there arrived at Verona, Lady D'Arcy, an English woman of fortune and rank, and a strenuous Catholic. Her husband had lately died, and in order to divert her grief, as well as to gratify her curiosity in viewing the great seat of her religion, she had come to Italy. Intercourse took place between her and Madame Roselli. By this means she gained a knowledge of my person and condition, and kindly offered to take me under her protection. She meant to traverse every part of Italy, and was willing that I should accompany her in all her wanderings. This offer was gratefully accepted, in spite of the artifices and remonstrances of Bartoli. My companion speedily contracted for me the affection of a mother. She was without kindred of her own religion, having acquired her faith, not by inheritance, but conversion. She desired to abjure her native country, and to bind herself by every social tie, to a people who adhered to the same faith. Me, she promised to adopt as her daughter, provided her first impressions in my favor, were not belied by my future deportment. My principles were opposite to her's, but habit, an aversion to displease my friend, my passion for knowledge, which my new condition enabled me to gratify, all combined to make me a deceiver, but my imposture was merely of a negative kind; I deceived her rather by forbearance to contradict, and by acting as she acted, than by open assent and zealous concurrence. My new state was, on this account, not devoid of inconvenience. The general deportment and sentiments of Lady D'Arcy, testified a vigorous and pure mind. New avenues to knowledge, by converse with mankind and with books, and by the survey of new scenes, were open for my use. Gratitude and veneration attached me to my friend, and made the task of pleasing her, by a seeming conformity of sentiments, less irksome. During this interval, no tidings were received by his sister, at Verona, respecting the fate of Sebastian Roselli. The supposition of his death, was too plausible, not to be adopted. What influence this disaster possessed over my brother's destiny, I know not. The generosity of Lady D' Arcy, hindered me from experiencing any disadvantage from this circumstance. Fortune seemed to have decreed, that I should not be reduced to the condition of an orphan. At an age and in a situation like mine, I could not remain long unacquainted with love. My abode at Rome, introduced me to the knowledge of a youth from England, who had every property which I regarded as worthy of esteem. He was a kinsman of Lady D'Arcy, and as such admitted at her house on the most familiar footing. His patrimony was extremely slender, but was in his own possession. He had no intention of increasing it by any professional pursuit, but was contented with the frugal provision it afforded. He proposed no other end of his existence, than the acquisition of virtue and knowledge. The property of Lady D' Arcy was subject to her own disposal, but, on the failure of a testamant, this youth was, in legal succession, the next heir. He was well acquainted with her temper and views, but in the midst of urbanity and gentleness, studied none of those concealments of opinion, which would have secured him her favor. That he was not of her own faith, was an insuperable, but the only obstacle, to the admission of his claims. If conformity of age and opinions, and the mutual fascination of love, be a suitable basis for marriage, Wentworth and I were destined for each other. Mutual disclosure added sanctity to our affection, but the happiness of Lady D' Arcy, being made to depend upon the dissolution of our compact, the heroism of Wentworth made him hasten to dissolve it. As soon as she discovered our attachment, she displayed symptoms of the deepest anguish. In addition to religious motives, her fondness for me forbade her to exist but in my society, and in the belief of the purity of my faith. The contention, on my part, was vehement, between the regards due to her felicity and to my own. Had Wentworth left me the power to decide, my decision would doubtless have evinced the frailty of my fortitude, and the strength of my passion, but having informed me fully of the reasons of his conduct, he precipitately retired from Rome. He left me no means of tracing his footsteps and of assailing his weakness, by expostulation and entreaty. Lady D'Arcy was no less eager to abandon a spot, where her happiness had been so imminently endangered. Our next residence was Palermo. I will not dwell upon the sensations, produced by this disappointment, in me. I review them with astonishment and self-compassion. If I thought it possible for me to sink again into imbecility so ignominious, I should be disposed to kill myself. There was no end to vows of fondness and tokens of gratitude in Lady D'Arcy. Her future life should be devoted to compensate me for this sacrifice. Nothing could console her in that single state in which she intended to live, but the consolations of my fellowship. Her conduct coincided for some time with these professions, and my anguish was allayed by the contemplation of the happiness conferred upon one whom I revered. My friend could not be charged with dissimulation and artifice. Her character had been mistaken by herself as well as by me. Devout affections seemed to have filled her heart, to the exclusion of any object besides myself. She cherished with romantic tenderness, the memory of her husband, and imagined that a single state was indispensably enjoined upon her, by religious duty. This persuasion, however, was subverted by the arts of a Spanish Cavalier, young, opulent, and romantic as herself in devotion. An event like this might, indeed, have been easily predicted, by those who reflected that the lady was still in the bloom of life, ardent in her temper and bewitching in her manners. The fondness she had lavished upon me, was now, in some degree, transferred to a new object, but I still received the treatment due to a beloved daughter. She was solicitous as ever to promote my gratification, and a diminution of kindness would not have been suspected, by those who had not witnessed the excesses of her former passion. Her marriage with the Spaniard removed the obstacle to union with Wentworth. This man, however, had set himself beyond the reach of my inquiries. Had there been the shadow of a clue afforded, me I should certainly have sought him to the ends of the world. I continued to reside with my friend, and accompanied her and her husband to Spain. Antonio de Leyva was a man of probity. His mind was enlightened by knowledge and his actions dictated by humanity. Though but little older than myself, and young enough to be the son of his spouse, his deportment to me was a model of rectitude and delicacy. I spent a year in Spain, partly in the mountains of Castile and partly at Segovia. New manners and a new language occupied my attention for a time, but these, losing their novelty, lost their power to please. I betook myself to books, to beguile the tediousness and diversify the tenor of my life. This would not have long availed, but I was relieved from new repinings, by the appointment of Antonio de Leyva to a diplomatic office at Vienna. Thither we accordingly repaired. A coincidence of circumstances had led me wide from the path of ambition and study, usually allotted to my sex and age. From the computation of eclipses, I now betook myself to the study of man. My proficiency, when I allowed it to be seen, attracted great attention. Instead of adulation and gallantry, I was engaged in watching the conduct of states, and revolving the theories of politicians. Superficial observers were either incredulous with regard to my character, or connected a stupid wonder with their belief. My attainments and habits, they did not see to be perfectly consonant with the principles of human nature. They unavoidably flowed from the illicit attachment of Bartoli, and the erring magnanimity of Wentworth. Aversion to the priest was the grand inciter of my former studies; the love of Wentworth, whom I hoped once more to meet, made me labor to exclude the importunities of others, and to qualify myself for securing his affections. Since our parting in Italy, Wentworth had traversed Syria and Egypt, and arrived some months after me at Vienna. He was on the point of leaving the city, when accident informed me of his being there. An interview was effected, and our former sentiments respecting each other, having undergone no change, we were united. Madame de Leyva reluctantly concurred with our wishes, and, at parting, forced upon me a considerable sum of money. Wentworth's was a character not frequently met with in the world. He was a political enthusiast, who esteemed nothing more graceful or glorious than to die for the liberties of mankind. He had traversed Greece with an imagination full of the exploits of ancient times, and derived, from contemplating Thermopylæ and Marathon, an enthusiasm that bordered upon phrenzy. It was now the third year of the revolutionary war in America, and previous to our meeting at Vienna, he had formed the resolution of repairing thither, and tendering his service to the Congress as a volunteer. Our marriage made no change in his plans. My soul was engrossed by two passions, a wild spirit of adventure, and a boundless devotion to him. I vowed to accompany him in every danger, to vie with him in military ardor; to combat and to die by his side. I delighted to assume the male dress, to acquire skill at the sword, and dexterity in every boisterous exercise. The timidity that commonly attends women, gradually vanished. I felt as if imbued by a soul that was a stranger to the sexual distinction. We embarked at Brest, in a frigate destined for St. Domingo. A desperate conflict with an English ship in the bay of Biscay, was my first introduction to a scene of tumult and danger, of whose true nature, I had formed no previous conception. At first I was spiritless and full of dismay. Experience, however, gradually reconciled me to the life that I had chosen. A fortunate shot, by dismasting the enemy, allowed us to prosecute our voyage unmolested. At Cape Francois we found a ship which transported us, after various perils, to Richmond in Virginia. I will not carry you through the adventures of four years. You, sitting all your life in peaceful corners, can scarcely imagine that variety of hardship and turmoil, which attends the female who lives in a camp. Few would sustain these hardships with better grace than I did. I could seldom be prevailed on to remain at a distance and inactive, when my husband was in battle, and more than once rescued him from death, by the seasonable destruction of his adversary. At the repulse of the Americans at Germantown, Wentworth was wounded and taken prisoner. I obtained permission to attend his sick bed and supply that care, without which he would assuredly have died. Being imperfectly recovered, he was sent to England, and subjected to a rigorous imprisonment. Milder treatment might have permitted his complete restoration to health, but, as it was, he died. His kindred were noble, and rich, and powerful, but it was difficult to make them acquainted with Wentworth's situation. Their assistance when demanded, was readily afforded, but it came too late to prevent his death. Me they snatched from my voluntary prison, and employed every friendly art to efface from my mind the images of recent calamity. Wentworth's singularities of conduct and opinion, had estranged him at an early age from his family. They felt little regret at his fate, but every motive concurred to secure their affection and succor to me. My character was known to many officers, returned from America, whose report, joined with the influence of my conversation, rendered me an object to be gazed at by thousands. Strange vicissitude! Now immersed in the infection of a military hospital, the sport of a wayward fortune, struggling with cold and hunger, with negligence and contumely. A month after passing into scenes of gaiety and luxury, exhibited at operas and masquerades, made the theme of inquiry and encomium at every place of resort, and caressed by the most illustrious among the votaries of science, and the advocates of the American cause. Here I again met Madame de Leyva. This woman was perpetually assuming new forms. She was a sincere convert to the Catholic religion, but she was open to every new impression. She was the dupe of every powerful reasoner, and assumed with equal facility the most opposite shapes. She had again reverted to the Protestant religion, and governed by a headlong zeal in whatever cause she engaged, she had sacrificed her husband and child to a new conviction. The instrument of this change, was a man who passed, at that time, for a Frenchman. He was young, accomplished and addressful, but was not suspected of having been prompted by illicit views, or of having seduced the lady from allegiance to her husband as well as to her God. De Leyva, however, who was sincere in his religion as well as his love, was hasty to avenge this injury, and in a contest with the Frenchman, was killed. His wife adopted at once, her ancient religion and country, and was once more an English woman. At our meeting her affection for me seemed to be revived, and the most passionate entreaties were used to detain me in England. My previous arrangements would not suffer it. I foresaw restraints and inconveniences from the violence and caprice of her passions, and intended henceforth to keep my liberty inviolate by any species of engagement, either of friendship or marriage. My habits were French, and I proposed henceforward to take up my abode at Paris. Since his voyage to Guiana, I had heard no tidings of Sebastian Roselli. This man's image was cherished with filial emotions, and I conceived that the sight of him would amply reward a longer journey than from London to Marseilles. Beyond my hopes, I found him in his ancient abode. The voyage and a residence of three years at Cayenne, had been beneficial to his appearance and health. He greeted me with paternal tenderness, and admitted me to a full participation of his fortune, which the sale of his American property had greatly enhanced. He was a stranger to the fate of my brother. On his return home, he had gone to Switzerland with a view of ascertaining his destiny. The youth, a few months after his arrival at Lausanne, had eloped with a companion, and had hitherto eluded all Roselli's searches and inquiries. My father was easily prevailed upon to transfer his residence from Provence to Paris. Here Martinette paused, and marking the clock, it is time, resumed she, to be gone. Are you not weary of my tale? On the day I entered France, I entered the twenty-third year of my age, so that my promise of detailing my youthful adventures, is fulfilled. I must away. Till we meet again, farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. Such was the wild series of Martinett's adventures. Each incident fastened on the memory of Constantia, and gave birth to numberless reflections. Her prospect of mankind seemed to be enlarged, on a sudden, to double its ancient dimensions. Ormond's narratives had carried her beyond the Mississippi, and into the deserts of Siberia. He had recounted the perils of a Russian war, and painted the manners of Mongals and Naudowessies. Her new friend had led her back to the civilized world, and portrayed the other half of the species. Men, in their two forms, of savage and refined, had been scrutinized by these observers, and what was wanting in the delineations of the one, was liberally supplied by the other. Eleven years, in the life of Martinette, was unrelated. Her conversation suggested the opinion that this interval had been spent in France. It was obvious to suppose, that a woman, thus fearless and sagacious, had not been inactive at a period like the present, which called forth talents and courage, without distinction of sex, and had been particularly distinguished by female enterprise and heroism. Her name easily led to the suspicion of concurrence with the subverters of monarchy, and of participation in their fall. Her flight from the merciless tribunals of the faction that now reigned, would explain present appearances. Martinette brought to their next interview, an air of uncommon exultation. On this being remarked, she communicated the tidings of the fall of the sanguinary tyranny of Robespierre. Her eyes sparkled, and every feature was pregnant with delight, while she unfolded, with her accustomed energy, the particulars of this tremendous revolution. The blood, which it occasioned to flow, was mentioned without any symptoms of disgust or horror. Constantia ventured to ask, if this incident was likely to influence her own condition. Yes. It will open the way for my return. Then you think of returning to a scene of so much danger? 16 Danger, my girl? It is my element. I am an adorer of liberty, and liberty without peril can never exist. But so much bloodshed, and injustice! Does not your heart shrink from the view of a scene of massacre and tumult, such as Paris has lately exhibited and will probably continue to exhibit? Thou talkest, Constantia, in a way scarcely worthy of thy good sense. Have I not been three years in a camp? What are bleeding wounds and mangled corpses, when accustomed to the daily sight of them for years? Am I not a lover of liberty, and must I not exult in the fall of tyrants, and regret only that my hand had no share in their destruction? But a woman—how can the heart of woman be inured to the shedding of blood? Have women, I beseech thee, no capacity to reason and infer? Are they less open than men to the influence of habit? My hand never faltered when liberty demanded the victim. If thou wert with me at Paris, I could shew thee a fusil of two barrels, which is precious beyond any other relick, merely because it enabled me to kill thirteen officers at Jenappe. Two of these were emigrant nobles, whom I knew and loved before the revolution, but the cause they had since espoused, cancelled their claims to mercy. What, said the startled Constantia, have you fought in the ranks? Certainly. Hundreds of my sex have done the same. Some were impelled by the enthusiasm of love, and some by a mere passion for war; some by the contagion of example; and some, with whom I myself must be ranked, by a generous devotion to liberty. Brunswick and Saxe Coburg, had to contend with whole regiments of women; regiments they would have formed, if they had been collected into separate bodies. I will tell thee a secret. Thou wouldst never have seen Martinette de Beauvais, if Brunswick had deferred one day longer, his orders for retreating into Germany. How so? She would have died by her own hand. What could lead to such an outrage? The love of liberty. I cannot comprehend how that love should prompt you to suicide. I will tell thee. The plan was formed and could not miscarry. A woman was to play the part of a banished Royalist, was to repair to the Prussian camp, and to gain admission to the general. This would have easily been granted to a female and an ex-noble. There she was to assassinate the enemy of her country, and to attest her magnanimity by slaughtering herself. I was weak enough to regret the ignominious retreat of the Prussians, because it precluded the necessity of such a sacrifice. This was related with accents and looks that sufficiently attested its truth. Constantia shuddered and drew back, to contemplate more deliberately the features of her guest. Hitherto she had read in them nothing that bespoke the desperate courage of a martyr, and the deep designing of an assassin. The image which her mind had reflected, from the deportment of this woman, was changed. The likeness which she had feigned to herself, was no longer seen. She felt that antipathy was preparing to displace love. These sentiments, however, she concealed, and suffered the conversation to proceed. Their discourse now turned upon the exploits of several women, who mingled in the tumults of the capital and in the armies on the frontiers. Instances were mentioned of ferocity in some, and magnanimity in others, which almost surpassed belief. Constantia listened greedily, though not with approbation, and acquired, at every sentence, new desire to be acquainted with the personal history of Martinette. On mentioning this wish, her friend said, that she endeavored to amuse her exile, by composing her own memoirs, and that, on her next visit, she would bring with her the volume, which she would suffer Constantia to read. A separation of a week elapsed. She felt some impatience for the renewal of their intercourse, and for the perusal of the volume that had been mentioned. One evening Sarah Baxter, whom Constantia had placed in her own occasional service, entered the room with marks of great joy and surprise, and informed her that she at length had discovered Miss Monrose. From her abrupt and prolix account, it appeared, that Sarah had overtaken Miss Monrose in the street, and guided by her own curiosity, as well as by the wish to gratify her mistress, she had followed the stranger. To her utter astonishment the lady had paused at Mr. Dudley's door, with a seeming resolution to enter it, but presently resumed her way. Instead of pursuing her steps further, Sarah had stopped to communicate this intelligence to Constantia. Having delivered her news, she hastened away, but returning, in a moment, with a countenance of new surprise, she informed her mistress, that on leaving the house she had met Miss Monrose at the door, on the point of entering. She added that the stranger had inquired for Constantia, and was now waiting below. Constantia took no time to reflect upon an incident so unexpected and so strange, but proceeded forthwith to the parlor. Martinette only was there. It did not instantly occur to her that this lady and Mademoiselle Monrose might possibly be the same. The inquiries she made speedily removed her doubts, and it now appeared that the woman, about whose destiny she had formed so many conjectures, and fostered so much anxiety, was no other than the daughter of Roselli. Having readily answered her questions, Martinette inquired in her turn, into the motives of her friend's curiosity. These were explained by a succinct account of the transactions, to which the deceased Baxter had been a witness. Constantia concluded, with mentioning her own reflections on the tale, and intimating her wish to be informed how Martinette had extricated herself from a situation so calamitous. Is there any room for wonder on that head? replied the guest. It was absurd to stay longer in the house. Having finished the interment of Roselli, (soldier fashion,) for he was the man who suffered his foolish regrets to destroy him, I forsook the house. Roselli was by no means poor, but he could not consent to live at ease, or to live at all, while his country endured such horrible oppressions, and when so many of his friends had perished. I complied with his humor, because it could not be changed, and I revered him too much to desert him. But whither, said Constantia, could you seek shelter at a time like that? The city was desolate, and a wandering female could scarcely be received under any roof. All inhabited houses were closed at that hour, and the fear of infection would have shut them against you, if they had not been already so. Hast thou forgotten that there were at that time, at least ten thousand French in this city, fugitives from Marat and from St. Domingo? That they lived in utter fearlessness of the reigning disease; sung and loitered in the public walks, and prattled at their doors, with all their customary unconcern? Supposest thou that there were none among these, who would receive a countrywoman, even if her name had not been Martinette de Beauvais? Thy fancy has depicted strange things, but believe me, that, without a farthing and without a name, I should not have incurred the slightest inconvenience. The death of Roselli I foresaw, because it was gradual in its approach, and was sought by him as a good. My grief, therefore, was exhausted, before it came, and I rejoiced at his death, because it was the close of all his sorrows. The rueful pictures of my distress and weakness, which were given by Baxter, existed only in his own fancy. Martinette pleaded an engagement, and took her leave, professing to have come merely to leave with her the promised manuscript. This interview, though short, was productive of many reflections, on the deceitfulness of appearances, and on the variety of maxims by which the conduct of human beings is regulated. She was accustomed to impart all her thoughts and relate every new incident to her father. With this view she now hied to his apartment. This hour it was her custom, when disengaged, always to spend with him. She found Mr. Dudley busy in revolving a scheme, which various circumstances had suggested and gradually conducted to maturity. No period of his life had been equally delightful, with that portion of his youth which he had spent in Italy. The climate, the language, the manners of the people, and the sources of intellectual gratification, in painting and music, were congenial to his taste. He had reluctantly forsaken these enchanting seats, at the summons of his father, but, on his return to his native country, had encountered 16* nothing but ignominy and pain. Poverty and blindness had beset his path, and it seemed as if it were impossible to fly too far from the scene of his disasters. His misfortunes could not be concealed from others, and every thing around him seemed to renew the memory of all that he had suffered. All the events of his youth served to entice him to Italy, while all the incidents of his subsequent life, concurred to render disgustful his present abode. His daughter's happiness was not to be forgotten. This he imagined would be eminently promoted by the scheme. It would open to her new avenues to knowledge. It would snatch her from the odious pursuit of Ormond, and by a variety of objects and adventures, efface from her mind any impression which his dangerous artifices might have made upon it. This project was now communicated to Constantia. Every argument adapted to influence her choice, was employed. He justly conceived that the only obstacle to her adoption of it, related to Ormond. He expatiated on the dubious character of this man, the wildness of his schemes, and the magnitude of his errors. What could be expected from a man, half of whose life had been spent at the head of a band of Cassacks, spreading devastation in the regions of the Danube, and supporting by flagitious intrigues, the tyranny of Catharine, and the other half in traversing inhospitable countries, and extinguishing what remained of clemency and justice, by intercourse with savages? It was admitted that his energies were great, but misdirected, and that to restore them to the guidance of truth, was not in itself impossible, but it was so with relation to any power that she possessed. Conformity would flow from their marriage, but this conformity was not to be expected from him. It was not his custom to abjure any of his doctrines or recede from any of his claims. She knew likewise the conditions of their union. She must go with him to some corner of the world, where his boasted system was established. What was the road to it, he had carefully concealed, but it was evident that it lay beyond the precincts of civilized existence. Whatever were her ultimate decision, it was at least proper to delay it. Six years were yet wanting of that period, at which only she formerly considered marriage as proper. To all the general motives for deferring her choice, the conduct of Ormond superadded the weightiest. Their correspondence might continue, but her residence in Europe and converse with mankind, might enlighten her judgment and qualify her for a more rational decision. Constantia was not uninfluenced by these reasonings. Instead of reluctantly admitting them, she somewhat wondered that they had not been suggested by her own reflections. Her imagination anticipated her entrance on that mighty scene with emotions little less than rapturous. Her studies had conferred a thousand ideal charms on a theatre, where Scipio and Cæsar had performed their parts. Her wishes were no less importunate to gaze upon the Alps and Pyrenees, and to vivify and chasten the images collected from books, by comparing them with their real prototypes. No social ties existed to hold her to America. Her only kinsman and friend would be the companion of her journeys. This project was likewise recommended by advantages of which she only was qualified to judge. Sophia Westwyn had embarked, four years previous to this date, for England, in company with an English lady and her husband. The arrangements that were made forbade either of the friends to hope for a future meeting. Yet now, by virtue of this project, this meeting seemed no longer to be hopeless. This burst of new ideas and new hopes on the mind of Constantia took place in the course of a single hour. No change in her external situation had been wrought, and yet her mind had undergone the most signal revolution. The novelty as well as greatness of the prospect kept her in a state of elevation and awe, more ravishing than any she had ever experienced. Anticipations of intercourse with nature in her most august forms, with men in diversified states of society, with the posterity of Greeks and Romans, and with the actors that were now upon the stage, and above all with the being whom absence and the want of other attachments, had, in some sort, contributed to deify, made this night pass away upon the wings of transport. The hesitation which existed on parting with her father, speedily gave place to an ardor impatient of the least delay. She saw no impediments to the immediate commencement of the voyage. To delay it a month or even a week, seemed to be unprofitable tardiness. In this ferment of her thoughts, she was neither able nor willing to sleep. In arranging the means of departure and anticipating the events that would successively arise, there was abundant food for contemplation. She marked the first dawnings of the day, and rose. She felt reluctance to break upon her father's morning slumbers, but considered that her motives were extremely urgent, and that the pleasure afforded him by her zealous approbation of his scheme, would amply compensate him for this unseasonable intrusion on his rest. She hastened therefore to his chamber. She entered with blithsome steps, and softly drew aside the curtain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. Unhappy Constantia! At the moment when thy dearest hopes had budded afresh, when the clouds of insecurity and disquiet had retired from thy vision, wast thou assailed by the great subverter of human schemes. Thou sawest nothing in futurity but an eternal variation and succession of delights. Thou wast hastening to forget dangers and sorrows which thou fondly imaginedst were never to return. This day was to be the outset of a new career; existence was henceforth to be embellished with enjoyments, hitherto scarcely within the reach of hope. Alas! Thy predictions of calamity seldom failed to be verified. Not so thy prognostics of pleasure. These, though fortified by every calculation of contingencies, were edifices grounded upon nothing. Thy life was a struggle with malignant destiny; a contest for happiness in which thou wast fated to be overcome. She stooped to kiss the venerable cheek of her father, and, by whispering, to break his slumber. Her eye was no sooner fixed upon his countenance, than she started back and shrieked. She had no power to forbear. Her outcries were piercing and vehement. They ceased only with the cessation of breath. She sunk upon a chair in a state partaking more of death than of life, mechanically prompted to give vent to her agonies in shrieks, but incapable of uttering a sound. The alarm called her servants to the spot. They beheld her dumb, wildly gazing, and gesticulating in a way that indicated frenzy. She made no resistance to their efforts, but permitted them to carry her back to her own chamber. Sarah called upon her to speak, and to explain the cause of these appearances, but the shock which she had endured, seemed to have irretrievably destroyed her powers of utterance. The terrors of the affectionate Sarah were increased. She kneeled by the bedside of her mistress, and with streaming eyes, besought the unhappy lady to compose herself. Perhaps the sight of weeping in another possessed a sympathetic influence, or nature had made provision for this salutary change. However that be, a torrent of tears now came to her succor, and rescued her from a paroxysm of insanity, which its longer continuance might have set beyond the reach of cure. Meanwhile, a glance at his master's countenance made Fabian fully acquainted with the nature of the scene. The ghastly visage of Mr. Dudley shewed that he was dead, and that he had died in some terrific and mysterious manner. As soon as this faithful servant recovered from surprise, the first expedient which his ingenuity suggested, was to fly with tidings of this event to Mr. Melbourne. That gentleman instantly obeyed the summons. With the power of weeping, Constantia recovered the power of reflection. This, for a time, served her only as a medium of anguish. Melbourne mingled his tears with hers, and endeavored, by suitable remonstrances, to revive her fortitude. The filial passion is perhaps instinctive to man; but its energy is modified by various circumstances. Every event in the life of Constantia contributed to heighten this passion beyond customary bounds. In the habit of perpetual attendance on her father, of deriving from him her knowledge, and sharing with him the hourly fruits of observation and reflection, his existence seemed blended with her own. There was no other whose concurrence and council she could claim, with whom a domestic and uninterrupted alliance could be maintained. The only bond of consanguinity was loosened, the only prop of friendship was taken away. Others, perhaps, would have observed, that her father's existence had been merely a source of obstruction and perplexity; that she had hitherto acted by her own wisdom, and would find, hereafter, less difficulty in her choice of schemes, and fewer impediments to the execution. These reflections occurred not to her. This disaster had increased, to an insupportable degree, the vacancy and dreariness of her existence. The face she was habituated to behold, had disappeared forever; the voice, whose mild and affecting tones had so long been familiar to her ears, was hushed into eternal silence. The felicity to which she clung was ravished away; nothing remained to hinder her from sinking into utter despair. The first transports of grief having subsided, a source of consolation seemed to be opened in the belief that her father had only changed one form of being for another; that he still lived to be the guardian of her peace and honor; to enter the recesses of her thought; to forewarn her of evil and invite her to good. She grasped at these images with eagerness, and fostered them as the only solaces of her calamity. They were not adapted to inspire her with cheerfulness, but they sublimed her sensations, and added an inexplicable fascination to sorrow. It was unavoidable sometimes to reflect upon the nature of that death which had occurred. Tokens were sufficiently apparent that outward violence had been the cause. Who could be the performer of so black a deed, by what motives he was guided were topics of fruitless conjecture. She mused upon this subject, not from the thirst of vengeance, but from a mournful curiosity. Had the perpetrator stood before her, and challenged retribution, she would not have lifted a finger to accuse or to punish. The evil already endured, left her no power to concert and execute projects for extending that evil to others. Her mind was unnerved, and recoiled with loathing from considerations of abstract justice, or political utility, when they prompted to the prosecution of the murderer. Melbourne was actuated by different views, but, on this subject, he was painfully bewildered. Mr. Dudley's deportment to his servants and neighbors, was gentle and humane. He had no dealings with the trafficking or laboring part of mankind. The fund which supplied his cravings of necessity or habit, was his daughter's. His recreations and employments were harmless and lonely. The evil purpose was limited to his death, for his chamber was exactly in the same state in which negligent security had left it. No midnight footstep or voice, no unbarred door or lifted window afforded tokens of the presence, or traces of the entrance or flight of the assassin. The meditations of Constantia however, could not fail, in some of their circuities, to encounter the image of Craig. His agency in the impoverishment of her father, and in the scheme by which she had like to have been loaded with the penalties of forgery, was of an impervious and unprecedented kind. Motives were unveiled by time, in some degree, accounting for his treacherous proceeding, but there was room to suppose an inborn propensity to mischief. Was he not the author of this new evil? His motives and his means were equally inscrutable, but their inscrutability might flow from her own defects in discernment and knowledge, and time might supply her defects in this as in former instances. These images were casual. The causes of the evil were seldom contemplated. Her mind was rarely at liberty to wander from reflection on her irremediable loss. Frequently, when confused by distressful recollections, she would detect herself going to her father's chamber. Often his well known accents would ring in her ears, and the momentary impulse would be to answer his calls. Her reluctance to sit down to her meals, without her usual companion, could scarcely be surmounted. In this state of mind the image of the only friend who survived, or whose destiny, at least, was doubtful, occurred to her. She sunk into fits of deeper abstraction and dissolved away in tears of more agonizing tenderness. A week after her father's interment, she shut herself up in her chamber, to torment herself with fruitless remembrances. The name of Sophia Westwyn was pronounced, and the ditty that solemnized their parting was sung. Now, more than formerly, she became sensible of the loss of that portrait, which had been deposited in the hands of M'Crea, as a pledge. As soon as her change of fortune had supplied her with the means of redeeming it, she hastened to M'Crea for that end. To her unspeakable disappointment he was absent from the city; he had taken a long journey, and the exact period of his return could not be ascertained. His clerks refused to deliver the picture, or even, by searching, to discover whether it was still in their master's possession. This application had frequently and lately been repeated, but without success; M'Crea had not yet returned and his family were equally in the dark, as to the day on which his return might be expected. She determined on this occasion, to renew her visit. Her incessant disappointments had almost extinguished hope, and she made inquiries at his door, with a faltering accent and sinking heart. These emotions were changed into surprise and delight, when answer was made that he had just arrived. She was instantly conducted into his presence. The countenance of M'Crea easily denoted, that his visitant was by no means acceptable. There was a mixture of embarrassment and sullenness in his air, which was far from being diminished when the purpose of this visit was explained. Constantia reminded him of the offer and acceptance of this pledge, and of the conditions with which the transaction was accompanied. He acknowledged, with some hesitation, that a promise had been given to retain the pledge until it were in her power to redeem it, but the long delay, the urgency of his own wants, and particularly the ill treatment which he conceived himself to have suffered, in the transaction respecting the forged note, had, in his own opinion, absolved him from this promise. He had therefore sold the picture to a goldsmith, for as much as the gold about it was worth. This information produced, in the heart of Constantia, a contest between indignation and sorrow, that, for a time, debarred her from speech. She stifled the anger that was, at length, rising to her lips, and calmly inquired to whom the picture had been sold. M'Crea answered that for his part he had little dealings in gold and silver, but every thing of that kind, which fell to his share, he transacted with Mr. D—. This person was one of the most eminent of his profession. His character and place of abode were universally known. The only expedient that remained was to apply to him, and to ascertain, forthwith, the destiny of the picture. It was too probable, that when separated from its case, the portrait was thrown away or destroyed, as a mere incumbrance, but the truth was too momentous to be made the sport of mere probability. She left the house of M'Crea, and hastened to that of the goldsmith. The circumstance was easily recalled to his remembrance. It was true that such a picture had been offered for sale, and that he had purchased it. The workmanship was curious, and he felt unwilling to destroy it. He therefore hung it up in his shop and indulged the hope that a purchaser would, sometime, be attracted by the mere beauty of the toy. Constantia's hopes were revived by these tidings, and she earnestly inquired if it were still in his possession. No. A young gentleman had entered his shop some months before; the picture had caught his fancy, and he had given a price which the artist owned he should not have demanded, had he not been encouraged by the eagerness which the gentleman betrayed to possess it. Who was this gentleman? Had there been any previous acquaintance between them? What was his name, his profession, and where was he to be found? Really, the goldsmith answered, he was ignorant respecting all those particulars. Previously to this purchase, the gentleman had sometimes visited his shop, but he did not recollect to have since seen him. He was unacquainted with his name and his residence. What appeared to be his motives for purchasing this picture? The customer appeared highly pleased with it. Pleasure, rather than surprise, seemed to be produced by the sight of it. If I were permitted to judge, continued the artist, I 17 should imagine that the young man was acquainted with the original. To say the truth, I hinted as much at the time, and I did not see that he discouraged the supposition. Indeed, I cannot conceive how the picture could otherwise have gained any value in his eyes. This only heightened the eagerness of Constantia to trace the footsteps of the youth. It was obvious to suppose some communication or connexion between her friend and this purchaser. She repeated her inquiries, and the goldsmith, after some consideration, said;—Why, on second thoughts, I seem to have some notion of having seen a figure like that of my customer, go into a lodging house, in Front-Street, some time before I met with him at my shop. The situation of this house being satisfactorily described, and the artist being able to afford her no further information, except as to stature and guise, she took her leave. There were two motives impelling her to prosecute her search after this person; the desire of regaining this portrait and of procuring tidings of her friend. Involved as she was in ignorance, it was impossible to conjecture, how far this incident would be subservient to these inestimable purposes. To procure an interview with this stranger, was the first measure which prudence suggested. She knew not his name or his person. He was once seen entering a lodging house. Thither she must immediately repair, but how to introduce herself, how to describe the person of whom she was in search, she knew not. She was beset with embarrassments and difficulties. While her attention was entangled by these, she proceeded unconsciously on her way, and stopped not until she reached the mansion that had been described. Here she paused to collect her thoughts. She found no relief in deliberation. Every moment added to her perplexity and indecision. Irresistibly impelled by her wishes, she at length, in a mood that partook of desperate, advanced to the door and knocked. The summons was immediately obeyed by a woman of decent appearance. A pause ensued, which Constantia at length terminated, by a request to see the mistress of the house. The lady courteously answered that she was the person, and immediately ushered her visitant into an apartment. Constantia being seated, the lady waited for the disclosure of her message. To prolong the silence was only to multiply embarrassments. She reverted to the state of her feelings, and saw that they flowed from inconsistency and folly. One vigorous effort was sufficient to restore her to composure and self-command. She began with apologizing for a visit, unpreceded by an introduction. The object of her inquiries was a person, with whom it was of the utmost moment that she should procure a meeting, but whom, by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances, she was unable to describe by the usual incidents of name and profession. Her knowledge was confined to his external appearance, and to the probability of his being an inmate of this house, at the beginning of the year. She then proceeded to describe his person and dress. It is true, said the lady, such a one as you describe has boarded in this house. His name was Martynne. I have good reason to remember him, for he lived with me three months, and then left the country without paying for his board. He has gone, then? said Constantia, greatly discouraged by these tidings. Yes; he was a man of specious manners and loud pretensions. He came from England, bringing with him forged recommendatory letters, and after passing from one end of the country to the other, contracting debts which he never paid, and making bargains which he never fulfilled, he suddenly disappeared. It is likely that he has returned to Europe. Had he no kindred, no friends, no companions? He found none here. He made pretences to alliances in England, which better information has, I believe, since shewn to be false. This was the sum of the information procurable from this source. Constantia was unable to conceal her chagrin. These symptoms were observed by the lady, whose curiosity was awakened in turn. Questions were obliquely started, inviting Constantia to a disclosure of her thoughts. No advantage would arise from confidence, and the guest, after a few minutes of abstraction and silence, rose to take her leave. During this conference, some one appeared to be negligently sporting with the keys of a harpsichord, in the next apartment. The notes were too irregular and faint to make a forcible impression on the ear. In the present state of her mind, Constantia was merely conscious of the sound, in the intervals of conversation. Having arisen from her seat, her anxiety to obtain some information that might lead to the point she wished, made her again pause. She endeavored to invent some new interrogatory better suited to her purpose, than those which had, already, been employed. A silence on both sides ensued. During this interval, the unseen musician suddenly refrained from rambling, and glided into notes of some refinement and complexity. The cadence was aerial, but a thunderbolt, falling at her feet, would not have communicated a more visible shock to the senses of Constantia. A glance that denoted a tumult of soul bordering on distraction, was now fixed upon the door, that led into the room whence the harmony proceeded. Instantly the cadence was revived, and some accompanying voice, was heard to warble Ah! far beyond this world of woes, We meet to part—to part no more. Joy and grief in their sudden onset, and their violent extremes, approach so nearly, in their influence on human beings, as scarce to be distinguished. Constantia's frame was still enfeebled by her recent distresses. The torrent of emotion was too abrupt and too vehement. Her faculties were overwhelmed, and she sunk upon the floor motionless and without sense, but not till she had faintly articulated:— My God! My God! This is a joy unmerited and too great.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. I must be forgiven if I now introduce myself on the stage. Sophia Westwyn is the friend of Constantia, and the writer of this narrative. So far as my fate was connected with that of my friend, it is worthy to be known. That connexion has constituted the joy and misery of my existence, and has prompted me to undertake this task. I assume no merit from the desire of knowledge, and superiority to temptation. There is little of which I can boast, but that little I derived, instrumentally, from Constantia. Poor as my attainments are, it is to her that I am indebted for them all. Life itself was the gift of her father, but my virtue and felicity are her gifts. That I am neither indigent nor profligate, flows from her bounty. I am not unaware of the divine superintendence, of the claims upon my gratitude and service, which pertain to my God. I know that all physical and moral agents are merely instrumental to the purpose that he wills, but though the great Author of being and felicity must not be forgotten, it is neither possible nor just to overlook the claims upon our love, with which our fellow-beings are invested. The supreme love does not absorb, but chasten and enforce all subordinate affections. In proportion to the rectitude of my perceptions and the ardor of my piety, must I clearly discern and fervently love, the excellence discovered in my fellow-beings, and industriously promote their improvement and felicity. From my infancy to my seventeenth year, I lived in the house of Mr. Dudley. On the day of my birth I was deserted by my mother. Her temper was more akin to that of tygress than woman. Yet that is unjust, for beasts cherish their offspring. No natures but human, are capable of that depravity, which makes insensible to the claims of innocence and helplessness. But let me not recall her to memory. Have I not enough of sorrow? Yet to omit my causes of disquiet, the unprecedented forlornness of my condition, and the persecutions of an unnatural parent, would be to leave my character a problem, and the sources of my love of Miss Dudley unexplored. Yet I must not dwell upon that complication of iniquities, that savage ferocity and unextinguishable hatred of me, which characterized my unhappy mother! I was not safe under the protection of Mr. Dudley, nor happy in the caresses of his daughter. My mother asserted the privilege of that relation; she labored for years to obtain 17* the control of my person and actions; to snatch me from a peaceful and chaste asylum, and detain me in her own house, where, indeed, I should not have been in want of raiment and food, but where— O my mother! Let me not dishonor thy name! Yet it is not in my power to enhance thy infamy. Thy crimes, unequalled as they were, were, perhaps, expiated by thy penitence. Thy offences are too well known, but perhaps they who witnessed thy freaks of intoxication, thy defiance of public shame, the enormity of thy pollutions, the infatuation that made thee glory in the pursuit of a loathsome and detestable trade, may be strangers to the remorse and the abstinence which accompanied the close of thy ignominious life. For ten years was my peace incessantly molested, by the menaces or machinations of my mother. The longer she meditated my destruction, the more tenacious of her purpose, and indefatigable in her efforts, she became. That my mind was harassed with perpetual alarms, was not enough. The fame and tranquillity of Mr. Dudley and his daughter, were hourly assailed. My mother resigned herself to the impulses of malignity and rage. Headlong passions and a vigorous, though perverted understanding, were her's. Hence her stratagems to undermine the reputation of my protector, and to bereave him of domestic comfort, were subtle and profound. Had she not herself been careless of that good, which she endeavored to wrest from others, her artifices could scarcely have been frustrated. In proportion to the hazard which accrued to my protector and friend, the more ardent their zeal in my defence, and their affection for my person became. They watched over me with ineffable solicitude. At all hours and in every occupation, I was the companion of Constantia. All my wants were supplied, in the same proportion as her's. The tenderness of Mr. Dudley seemed equally divided between us. I partook of his instructions, and the means of every intellectual and personal gratification, were lavished upon me. The speed of my mother's career in infamy, was at length slackened. She left New-York, which had long been the theatre of her vices. Actuated by a new caprice, she determined to travel through the Southern States. Early indulgence was the cause of her ruin, but her parents had given her the embellishments of a fashionable education. She delighted to assume all parts, and personate the most opposite characters. She now resolved to carry a new name and the mask of virtue, into scenes hitherto unvisited. She journeyed as far as Charleston. Here she met an inexperienced youth, lately arrived from England, and in possession of an ample fortune. Her speciousness and artifices seduced him into a precipitate marriage. Her true character, however, could not be long concealed by herself, and her vices had been too conspicuous, for her long to escape recognition. Her husband was infatuated by her blandishments. To abandon her, or to contemplate her depravity with unconcern, were equally beyond his power. Romantic in his sentiments, his fortitude was unequal to his disappointments, and he speedily sunk into the grave. By a similar refinement in generosity, he bequeathed to her his property. With this accession of wealth, she returned to her ancient abode. The mask, lately worn, seemed preparing to be thrown aside, and her profligate habits to be resumed with more eagerness than ever, but an unexpected and total revolution was effected, by the exhortations of a Methodist divine. Her heart seemed, on a sudden, to be remoulded, her vices and the abettors of them were abjured, she shut out the intrusions of society, and prepared to expiate, by the rigors of abstinence and the bitterness of tears, the offences of her past life. In this, as in her former career, she was unacquainted with restraint and moderation. Her remorses gained strength, in proportion as she cherished them. She brooded over the images of her guilt, till the possibility of forgiveness and remission disappeared. Her treatment of her daughter and her husband constituted the chief source of her torment. Her awakened conscience refused her a momentary respite from its persecutions. Her thoughts became, by rapid degrees, tempestuous and gloomy, and it was at length evident, that her condition was maniacal. In this state, she was to me an object, no longer of terror, but compassion. She was surrounded by hirelings, devoid of personal attachment, and anxious only to convert her misfortunes to their own advantage. This evil it was my duty to obviate. My presence for a time, only enhanced the vehemence of her malady, but at length it was only by my attendance and soothing, that she was diverted from the fellest purposes. Shocking execrations and outrages, resolutions and efforts to destroy herself and those around her, were sure to take place in my absence. The moment I appeared before her, her fury abated; her gesticulations were becalmed, and her voice exerted only in incoherent and pathetic lamentations. These scenes, though so different from those which I had formerly been condemned to witness, were scarcely less excruciating. The friendship of Constantia Dudley was my only consolation. She took up her abode with me, and shared with me every disgustful and perilous office, which my mother's insanity prescribed. Of this consolation, however, it was my fate to be bereaved. My mother's state was deplorable, and no remedy hitherto employed, was efficacious. A voyage to England, was conceived likely to benefit, by change of temperature and scenes, and by the opportunity it would afford of trying the superior skill of English physicians. This scheme, after various struggles, on my part, was adopted. It was detestable to my imagination, because it severed me from that friend, in whose existence mine was involved, and without whose participation, knowledge lost its attractions, and society became a torment. The prescriptions of my duty could not be disguised or disobeyed, and we parted. A mutual engagement was formed, to record every sentiment and relate every event that happened, in the life of either, and no opportunity of communicating information, was to be omitted. This engagement was punctually performed on my part. I sought out every method of conveyance to my friend, and took infinite pains to procure tidings from her, but all were ineffectual. My mother's malady declined, but was succeeded by a pulmonary disease, which threatened her speedy destruction. By the restoration of her understanding, the purpose of her voyage was obtained, and my impatience to return, which the inexplicable and ominous silence of my friend daily increased, prompted me to exert all my powers of persuasion, to induce her to revisit America. My mother's frenzy was a salutary crisis in her moral history. She looked back upon her past conduct with unspeakable loathing, but this retrospect only invigorated her devotion and her virtue; but the thought of returning to the scene of her unhappiness and infamy could not be endured. Besides, life in her eyes, possessed considerable attractions, and her physicians flattered her with recovery from her present disease, if she would change the atmosphere of England for that of Languedoc and Naples. I followed her with murmurs and reluctance. To desert her in her present critical state would have been inhuman. My mother's aversions and attachments, habits and views were dissonant with my own. Conformity of sentiments and impressions of maternal tenderness, did not exist to bind us to each other. My attendance was assiduous, but it was the sense of duty that rendered my attendance a supportable task. Her decay was eminently gradual. No time seemed to diminish her appetite for novelty and change. During three years we traversed every part of France, Switzerland and Italy. I could not but attend to surrounding scenes, and mark the progress of the mighty revolution, whose effects, like agitation in a fluid, gradually spread from Paris, the centre, over the face of the neighboring kingdoms; but there passed not a day or an hour in which the image of Constantia was not recalled, in which the most pungent regrets were not felt at the inexplicable silence which had been observed by her, and the most vehement longings indulged to return to my native country. My exertions to ascertain her condition by indirect means, by interrogating natives of America, with whom I chanced to meet, were unwearied, but, for a long period, ineffectual. During this pilgrimage, Rome was thrice visited. My mother's indisposition was hastening to a crisis, and she formed the resolution of closing her life at the bottom of Vesuvius. We stopped, for the sake of a few day's repose, at Rome. On the morning after our arrival, I accompanied some friends to view the public edifices. Casting my eyes over the vast and ruinous interior of the Coliseo, my attention was fixed by the figure of a young man, whom, after a moment's pause, I recollected to have seen in the streets of New York. At a distance from home, mere community of country is no inconsiderable bond of affection. The social spirit prompts us to cling even to inanimate objects, when they remind us of ancient fellowships and juvenile attachments. A servant was despatched to summon this stranger, who recognised a country-woman with a pleasure equal to that which I had received. On nearer view, this person, whose name was Courtland, did not belie my favorable prepossessions. Our intercourse was soon established on a footing of confidence and intimacy. The destiny of Constantia was always uppermost in my thoughts. This person's acquaintance was originally sought, chiefly in the hope of obtaining from him some information respecting my friend. On inquiry I discovered that he had left his native city, seven months after me. Having tasked his recollection and compared a number of facts, the name of Dudley at length reoccurred to him. He had casually heard the history of Craig's imposture and its consequences. These were now relate as circumstantially as a memory, occupied by subsequent incidents, enabled him. The tale had been told to him, in a domestic circle which he was accustomed to frequent, by the person who purchased Mr. Dudley's lute, and restored it to its previous owner, on the conditions formerly mentioned. This tale filled me with anguish and doubt. My impatience to search out this unfortunate girl, and share with her her sorrows or relieve them, was anew excited by this mournful intelligence. That Constantia Dudley was reduced to beggary, was too abhorrent to my feelings to receive credit, yet the sale of her father's property, comprising even his furniture and clothing, seemed to prove that she had fallen even to this depth. This enabled me in some degree to account for her silence. Her generous spirit would induce her to conceal misfortunes from her friend, which no communication would alleviate. It was possible that she had selected some new abode, and that in consequence, the letters I had written, and which amounted to volumes, had never reached her hands. My mother's state would not suffer me to obey the impulse of my heart. Her frame was verging towards dissolution. Courtland's engagements allowed him to accompany us to Naples, and here the long series of my mother's pilgrimages, closed in death. Her obsequies were no sooner performed, than I determined to set out on my long projected voyage. My mother's property, which, in consequence of her decease, devolved upon me, was not inconsiderable. There is scarcely any good so dear, to a rational being, as competence. I was not unacquainted with its benefits, but this acquisition was valuable to me chiefly as it enabled me to reunite my fate to that of Constantia. Courtland was my countryman and friend. He was destitute of fortune, and had been led to Europe partly by the spirit of adventure, and partly on a mercantile project. He had made sale of his property, on advantageous terms, in the ports of France, and resolved to consume the produce in examining this scene of heroic exploits and memorable revolutions. His slender stock, though frugally and even parsimoniously administered, was nearly exhausted, and at the time of our meeting at Rome, he was making reluctant preparations to return. Sufficient opportunity was afforded us, in an unrestrained and domestic intercourse of three months, which succeeded our Roman interview, to gain a knowledge of each other. There was that conformity of tastes and views between us, which could scarcely fail, at an age, and in a situation like ours, to give birth to tenderness. My resolution to hasten to America, was peculiarly unwelcome to my friend. He had offered to be my companion, but this offer, my regard to his interest obliged me to decline; but I was willing to compensate him for this denial, as well as to gratify my own heart, by an immediate marriage. So long a residence in England and Italy, had given birth to friendships and connexions of the dearest kind. I had no view but to spend my life with Courtland, in the midst of my maternal kindred, who were English. A voyage to America, and reunion with Constantia were previously indispensable, but I hoped that my friend might be prevailed upon, and that her disconnected situation would permit her to return with me to Europe. If this end could not be accomplished, it was my inflexible purpose to live and to die with her. Suitably to this arrangement, Courtland was to repair to London, and wait patiently till I should be able to rejoin him there, or to summon him to meet me in America. A week after my mother's death, I became a wife, and embarked, the next day, at Naples, in a Ragusan ship, destined for New-York. The voyage was tempestuous and tedious. The vessel was necessitated to make a short stay at Toulon. The state of that city, however, then in possession of the English, and besieged by the revolutionary forces, was adverse to commercial views. Happily, we resumed our voyage, on the day previous to that on which the place was evacuated by the British. Our seasonable departure rescued us from witnessing a scene of horrors, of which the history of former wars, furnish us with few examples. A cold and boisterous navigation awaited us. My palpitations and inquietudes augmented as we approached the American coast. I shall not forget the sensations which I experienced on the sight of the Beacon at Sandy-Hook. It was first seen at midnight, in a stormy and beclouded atmosphere, emerging from the waves, whose fluctuation allowed it, for some time, to be visible only by fits. This token of approaching land, affected me as much as if I had reached the threshold of my friend's dwelling. At length we entered the port, and I viewed, with high raised, but inexplicable feelings, objects with which I had been from infancy familiar. The flag-staff erected on the battery, recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks, which I had taken on that spot, with the lost Constantia. The dream was fondly cherished, that the figure which I saw, loitering along the terrace was her's. On disembarking, I gazed at every female passenger, in hope that it was she whom I sought. An absence of three years, had obliterated from my memory none of the images which attended me on my departure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. After a night of repose rather than of sleep, I began the search after my friend. I went to the house which the Dudleys formerly inhabited, and which had been the asylum of my infancy. It was now occupied by strangers, by whom no account could be given of its former tenants. I obtained directions to the owner of the house. He was equally unable to satisfy my curiosity. The purchase had been made at a public sale, and terms had been settled not with Dudley, but with the sheriff. It is needless to say, that the history of Craig's imposture and its consequences, were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in New York. The Dudleys were well remembered, and their disappearance, immediately after their fall, had been generally noticed, but whither they had retired, was a problem which no one was able to solve. This evasion was strange. By what motives the Dudleys were induced to change their ancient abode, could be vaguely guessed. My friend's grandfather was a native of the West Indies. Descendants of the same stock still resided in Tobago. They might be affluent, and to them it was possible, that Mr. Dudley, in this change of fortune, had betaken himself for relief. This was a mournful expedient, since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted. Constantia's mother was stolen by Mr. Dudley from a convent at Amiens. There were no affinities, therefore, to draw them to France. Her grandmother was a native of Baltimore, of a family of some note, by name Ridgeley. This family might still exist, and have either afforded an asylum to the Dudleys, or, at least, be apprised of their destiny. It was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed 18 within the precincts of New York. A journey to Baltimore was the next expedient. This journey was made in the depth of winter, and by the speediest conveyance. I made no more than a day's sojourn in Philadelphia. The epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged, I had not heard of it till my arrival in America. Its devastations were then painted to my fancy in the most formidable colors. A few months only had elapsed since its extinction, and I expected to see numerous marks of misery and depopulation. To my no small surprise, however, no vestiges of this calamity were to be discerned. All houses were open, all streets thronged, and all faces thoughtless or busy. The arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously cultivated as ever. Little did I then think what had been, and what, at that moment, was the condition of my friend. I stopped for the sake of respite from fatigue, and did not, therefore, pass much time in the streets. Perhaps, had I walked seasonably abroad, we might have encountered each other, and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties. At Baltimore I made myself known, without the formality of introduction, to the Ridgeleys. They acknowledged their relationship to Mr. Dudley, but professed absolute ignorance of his fate. Indirect intercourse only had been maintained, formerly, by Dudley with his mother's kindred. They had heard of his misfortune, a twelvemonth after it happened, but what measures had been subsequently pursued, their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them. The failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope. Neither my own imagination nor the Ridgeleys, could suggest any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be accomplished. To leave America, without obtaining the end of my visit, could not be thought of without agony, and yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my uncertainties. On this theme I ruminated without ceasing. I recalled every conversation and incident of former times, and sought in them a clue, by which my present conjectures might be guided. One night, immersed alone in my chamber, my thoughts were thus employed. My train of meditation was, on this occasion, new. From the review of particulars from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained, I passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect. Mr. Dudley's early life, his profession of a painter, his zeal in this pursuit, and his reluctance to quit it, were remembered. Would he not revert to this profession, when other means of subsistence were gone. It is true, similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his resort to a different path, existed at present, and no painter of his name was to be found in Philadelphia, Baltimore, or New York. But would it not occur to him, that the patronage denied to his skill, by the frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen, might with more probability of success, be sought from the opulence and luxury of London? Nay, had he not once affirmed in my hearing, that if he ever were reduced to poverty, this was the method he would pursue? This conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed. Every new reflection augmented its force. I was suddenly raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region of lofty and gay hopes. Happiness, of which I had began to imagine myself irretrievably bereft, seemed once more to approach within my reach. Constantia would not only be found, but be met in the midst of those comforts which her father's skill could not fail to procure, and on that very stage where I most desired to encounter her. Mr. Dudley had many friends and associates of his youth in London. Filial duty had repelled their importunities to fix his abode in Europe, when summoned home by his father. On his father's death these solicitations had been renewed, but were disregarded for reasons, which he, afterwards, himself confessed, were fallacious. That they would, a third time be preferred, and would regulate his conduct, seemed to me incontestable. I regarded with wonder and deep regret, the infatuation that had hitherto excluded these images from my understanding and my memory. How many dangers and toils had I endured since my embarkation at Naples, to the present moment? How many lingering minutes had I told since my first interview with Courtland? All were owing to my own stupidity. Had my present thoughts been seasonably suggested, I might long since have been restored to the embraces of my friend, without the necessity of an hour's separation from my husband. These were evils to be repaired as far as it was possible. Nothing now remained but to procure a passage to Europe. For this end diligent inquiries were immediately set on foot. A vessel was found, which, in a few weeks, would set out upon the voyage. Having bespoken a conveyance, it was incumbent on me to sustain with patience the unwelcome delay. Meanwhile, my mind, delivered from the dejection and perplexities that lately haunted it, was capable of some attention to surrounding objects. I marked the peculiarities of manners and language in my new abode, and studied the effects which a political and religious system, so opposite to that with which I had conversed, in Italy and Switzerland, had produced. I found that the difference between Europe and America, lay chiefly in this; that, in the former, all things tended to extremes, whereas, in the latter, all things tended to the same level. Genius, and virtue, and happiness on these shores, were distinguished by a sort of mediocrity. Conditions were less unequal, and men were strangers to the heights of enjoyment and the depths of misery, to which the inhabitants of Europe are accustomed. I received friendly notice and hospitable treatment from the Ridgeleys. These people were mercantile and plodding in their habits. I found in their social circle, little exercise for the sympathies of my heart, and willingly accepted their aid to enlarge the sphere of my observation. About a week before my intended embarkation, and when suitable preparation had been made for that event, a lady arrived in town, who was cousin to my Constantia. She had frequently been mentioned in favorable terms, in my hearing. She had passed her life, in a rural abode with her father, who cultivated his own domain, lying forty miles from Baltimore. On an offer being made to introduce us to each other, I consented to know one whose chief recommendation, in my eyes, consisted in her affinity to Constantia Dudley. I found an artless and attractive female, unpolished and undepraved by much intercourse with mankind. At first sight, I was powerfully struck by the resemblances of her features to those of my friend, which sufficiently denoted their connexion with a common stock. The first interview afforded mutual satisfaction. On our second meeting, discourse insensibly led to the mention of Miss Dudley, and of the design which had brought me to America. She was deeply affected by the earnestness with which I expatiated on her cousin's merits, and by the proofs which my conduct had given of unlimited attachment. I dwelt immediately on the measures which I had hitherto ineffectually pursued to trace her footsteps, and detailed the grounds of my present belief, that we should meet in London. During this recital, my companion sighed and wept. When I finished my tale, her tears, instead of ceasing, flowed with new vehemence. This appearance excited some surprise, and I ventured to ask the cause of her grief. Alas! She replied, I am personally a strnager to my cousin, but her character has been amply displayed to me by one who knew her well. I weep to think how much she has suffered. How much excellence we have lost! Nay, said I, all her sufferings will, I hope, be compensated, and I by no means consider her as lost. If my search in London be unsuccessful, then shall I indeed despair. Despair then, already, said my sobbing companion, for your search will be unsuccessful. How I feel for your disappointment! but it cannot be known too soon. My cousin is dead! These tidings were communicated with tokens of sincerity and sorrow, that left me no room to doubt that they were believed by the relater. My own emotions were suspended till interrogations had obtained a knowledge of her reasons for crediting this fatal event, and till she had explained the time and manner of her death. A friend of Miss Ridgeley's father had witnessed the devastations of the yellow fever in Philadelphia. He was apprised of the relationship that subsisted between his friend and the Dudleys. He gave a minute and circumstantial account of the arts of Craig. He mentioned the removal of my friends to Philadelphia, their obscure and indigent life, and finally, their falling victims to the pestilence. He related the means by which he became apprised of their fate, and drew a picture of their death, surpassing all that imagination can conceive of shocking and deplorable. 18* The quarter where they lived was nearly desolate. Their house was shut up, and, for a time, imagined to be uninhabited. Some suspicions being awakened, in those who superintended the burial of the dead, the house was entered, and the father and child discovered to be dead. The former was stretched upon his wretched pallet, while the daughter was found on the floor of the lower room, in a state that denoted the sufferance, not only of disease, but of famine. This tale was false. Subsequent discoveries proved this to be a detestable artifice of Craig, who, stimulated by incurable habits, had invented these disasters, for the purpose of enhancing the opinion of his humanity, and of furthering his views on the fortune and daughter of Mr. Ridgeley. Its falsehood, however, I had as yet no means of ascertaining. I received it as true, and at once dismissed all my claims upon futurity. All hopes of happiness, in this mutable and sublunary scene, was fled. Nothing remained, but to join my friend in a world, where woes are at an end and virtue finds recompense. Surely, said I, there will sometime be a close to calamity and discord. To those whose lives have been blameless, but harassed by inquietudes, to which not their own, but the errors of others have given birth, a fortress will hereafter be assigned unassailable by change, impregnable to sorrow. O! my ill-fated Constantia! I will live to cherish thy remembrance, and to emulate thy virtue. I will endure the privation of thy friendship and the vicissitudes that shall befall me, and draw my consolation and courage, from the foresight of no distant close to this terrestrial scene, and of ultimate and everlasting union with thee. This consideration, though it kept me from confusion and despair, could not, but with the healing aid of time, render me tranquil or strenuous. My strength was unequal to the struggle of my passions. The ship in which I engaged to embark, could not wait for my restoration to health, and I was left behind. Mary Ridgeley was artless and affectionate. She saw that her society was dearer to me than that of any other and was therefore seldom willing to leave my chamber. Her presence, less on her own account, than by reason of her personal resemblance, and her affinity by birth to Constantia, was a powerful solace. I had nothing to detain me longer in America. I was anxious to change my present lonely state, for the communion of those friends, in England, and the performance of those duties, which were left to me. I was informed that a British Packet, would shortly sail from New York. My frame was sunk into greater weakness, than I had felt at any former period; and I conceived, that to return to New York, by water, was more commodious than to perform the journey by land. This arrangement was likewise destined to be disappointed. One morning I visited, according to my custom, Mary Ridgeley. I found her in a temper somewhat inclined to gaiety. She rallied me, with great archness, on the care with which I had concealed from her a tender engagement, into which I had lately entered. I supposed myself to comprehend her allusion, and, therefore, answered that accident rather than design, had made me silent on the subject of marriage. She had hitherto known me by no appellation, but Sophia Courtland. I had thought it needless to inform her, that I was indebted for my name to my husband, Courtland being his name. All that, said my friend, I know already, and so you sagely think that my knowledge goes no farther than that? We are not bound to love our husbands longer than their lives. There is no crime, I believe, in preferring the living to the dead, and most heartily do I congratulate you on your present choice. What mean you? I confess your discourse surpasses my comprehension. At that moment the bell at the door rung a loud peal. Miss Ridgeley hastened down at this signal, saying, with much significance— I am a poor hand at solving a riddle. Here comes one who, if I mistake not, will find no difficulty in clearing up your doubts. Presently, she came up, and said, with a smile of still greater archness;—Here is a young gentleman, a friend of mine, to whom I must have the pleasure of introducing you. He has come for the special purpose of solving my riddle.— I attended her to the parlor without hesitation. She presented me, with great formality, to a youth, whose appearance did not greatly prepossess me in favor of his judgment. He approached me with an air, supercilious and ceremonious, but the moment he caught a glance at my face, he shrunk back, visibly confounded and embarrassed. A pause ensued, in which Miss Ridgeley had opportunity to detect the error into which she had been led, by the vanity of this young man. How now, Mr. Martynne, said my friend, in a tone of ridicule, is it possible you do not know the lady who is the queen of your affections, the tender and indulgent fair one, whose portrait you carry in your bosom; and whose image you daily and nightly bedew with your tears and kisses? Mr. Martynne's confusion instead of being subdued by his struggle, only grew more conspicuous, and after a few incoherent speeches and apologies, during which he carefully avoided encountering my eyes, he hastily departed. I applied to my friend, with great earnestness, for an explanation of this scene. It seems that, in the course of conversation with him, on the preceding day, he had suffered a portrait which hung at his breast, to catch Miss Ridgeley's eye. On her betraying a desire to inspect it more nearly, he readily produced it. My image had been too well copied by the artist, not to be instantly recognised. She concealed her knowledge of the original, and by questions, well adapted to the purpose, easily drew from him confessions that this was the portrait of his mistress. He let fall sundry innuendoes and surmises, tending to impress her with a notion of the rank, fortune and intellectual accomplishments of the nymph, and particularly of the doating fondness and measureless confidence, with which she regarded him. Her imperfect knowledge of my situation, left her in some doubt as to the truth of these pretensions, and she was willing to ascertain the truth, by bringing about an interview. To guard against evasions and artifice in the lover, she carefully concealed from him her knowledge of the original, and merely pretended that a friend of her's, was far more beautiful than her whom this picture represented. She added, that she expected a visit from her friend the next morning, and was willing, by shewing her to Mr. Martynne, to convince him how much he was mistaken, in supposing the perfections of his mistress unrivalled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. Martynne, while he expressed his confidence, that the experiment would only confirm his triumph, readily assented to the proposal, and the interview above described took place accordingly, the next morning. Had he not been taken by surprise, it is likely the address of a man, who possessed no contemptible powers, would have extricated him from some of his embarrassment. That my portrait should be in the possession of one, whom I had never before seen, and whose character and manners entitled him to no respect, was a source of some surprise. This mode of multiplying faces is extremely prevalent in this age, and was eminently characteristic of those with whom I had associated in different parts of Europe. The nature of my thoughts had modified my features into an expression, which my friends were pleased to consider as a model for those who desired to personify the genius of suffering and resignation. Hence among those whose religion permitted their devotion to a picture of a female, the symbols of their chosen deity were added to features and shape that resembled mine. My own caprice, as well as that of others, always dictated a symbolical, and in every new instance, a different accompaniment of this kind. Hence was offered the means of tracing the history of that picture which Martynne possessed. It had been accurately examined by Miss Ridgeley, and her description of the frame in which it was placed, instantly informed me that it was the same which, at our parting, I left in the possession of Constantia. My friend and myself were desirous of employing the skill of a Saxon painter, by name Eckstein. Each of us were drawn by him, she with the cincture of Venus, and I with the crescent of Dian. This symbol was still conspicuous on the brow of that image, which Miss Ridgeley had examined, and served to identify the original proprietor. This circumstance tended to confirm my fears that Constantia was dead, since that she would part with this picture during her life, was not to be believed. It was of little moment to discover how it came into the hands of the present possessor. Those who carried her remains to the grave, had probably torn it from her neck and afterwards disposed of it for money. By whatever means, honest or illicit, it had been acquired by Martynne, it was proper that it should be restored to me. It was valuable to me, because it had been the property of one whom I loved, and it might prove highly injurious to my fame and my happiness, as the tool of this man's vanity, and the attester of his falsehood. I, therefore, wrote him a letter, acquainting him with my reasons for desiring the repossession of this picture, and offering a price for it, at least double its value, as a mere article of traffic. Martynne accepted the terms. He transmitted the picture, and with it a note, apologizing for the artifice of which he had been guilty, and mentioning, in order to justify his acceptance of the price which I had offered, that he had lately purchased it for an equal sum of a goldsmith in Philadelphia. This information suggested a new reflection. Constantia had engaged to preserve, for the use of her friend, copious and accurate memorials of her life. Copies of these were, on suitable occasions, to be transmitted to me, during my residence abroad. These I had never received, but it was highly probable that her punctuality, in the performance of the first part of her engagement, had been equal to my own. What, I asked, had become of these precious memorials? In the wreck of her property were these irretrievably ingulfed? It was not probable that they had been wantonly destroyed. They had fallen, perhaps, into hands careless or unconscious of their value, or still lay, unknown and neglected, at the bottom of some closet or chest. Their recovery might be effected by vehement exertions, or by some miraculous accident. Suitable inquiries, carried on among those who were active in those scenes of calamity, might afford some clue by which the fate of the Dudleys, and the disposition of their property, might come into fuller light. These inquiries could be made only in Philadelphia, and thither, for that purpose, I now resolved to repair. There was still an interval of some weeks, before the departure of the packet in which I proposed to embark. Having returned to the capital, I devoted all my zeal to my darling project. My efforts, however, were without success. Those who administered charity and succor during that memorable season, and who survived, could remove none of my doubts, nor answer any of my inquiries. Innumerable tales, equally disastrous with those which Miss Ridgeley had heard, were related; but, for a considerable period, none of their circumstances were sufficiently accordant with the history of the Dudleys. It is worthy of remark, in how many ways, and by what complexity of motives, human curiosity is awakened and knowledge obtained. By its connexion with my darling purpose, every event in the history of this memorable pest, was earnestly sought and deeply pondered. The powerful considerations which governed me, made me slight those punctilious impediments, which, in other circumstances, would have debarred me from intercourse with the immediate actors and observers. I found none who were unwilling to expatiate on this topic, or to communicate the knowledge they possessed. Their details were copious in particulars, and vivid in minuteness. They exhibited the state of manners, the diversified effects of evil or heroic passions, and the endless forms which sickness and poverty assume in the obscure recesses of a commercial and populous city. Some of these details are too precious to be lost. It is above all things necessary that we should be thoroughly acquainted with the condition of our fellow-beings. Justice and compassion are the fruit of knowledge. The misery that overspreads so large a part of mankind, exists chiefly because those who are able to relieve it do not know that it exists. Forcibly to paint the evil, seldom fails to excite the virtue of the spectator, and seduce him into wishes, at least, if not into exertions of beneficence. The circumstances in which I was placed were, perhaps, wholly singular. Hence the knowledge I obtained was more comprehensive and authentic than was possessed by any one, even of the immediate actors or sufferers. This knowledge will not be useless to myself or to the world. The motives which dictated the present narrative, will himder me from relinquishing the pen, till my fund of observation and experience be exhausted. Meanwhile, let me resume the thread of my tale. The period allowed me before my departure was nearly expired, and my purpose seemed to be as far from its accomplishment as ever. One evening I visited a lady, who was the widow of a physician, whose disinterested exertions had cost him his life. She dwelt with pathetic earnestness on the particulars of her own distress, and listened with deep attention to the inquiries and doubts which I laid before her. After a pause of consideration, she said, that an incident like that related by me, she had previously heard from one of her friends, whose name she mentioned. This person was one of those whose office consisted in searching out the sufferers, and affording them unsought and unsolicited relief. She was offering to introduce me to this person, when he entered the apartment. After the usual compliments, my friend led the conversation as I wished. Between Mr. Thompson's tale and that related to Miss Ridgeley, there was an obvious resemblance. The sufferers resided in an obscure alley. They had shut themselves up from all intercourse with their neighbors, and had died, neglected and unknown. Mr. Thompson was vested with the superintendence of this district, and had passed the house frequently without suspicion of its being tenanted. He was at length informed by one of those who conducted a hearse, that he had seen the window in the upper story of this house lifted, and a female shew herself. It was night, and the hearseman chanced to be passing the door. He immediately supposed that the person stood in need of his services, and stopped. This procedure was comprehended by the person at the window, who, leaning out, addressed him in a broken and feeble voice. She asked him why he had not taken a different route, and upbraided him for inhumanity in leading his noisy vehicle past her door. She wanted repose, but the ceaseless rumbling of his wheels would not allow her the sweet respite of a moment. This invective was singular, and uttered in a voice which united the utmost degree of earnestness, with a feebleness that rendered it almost inarticulate. The man was at a loss for a suitable answer. His pause only increased the impatience of the person at the window, who called upon him, in a still more anxious tone, to proceed, and entreated him to avoid this alley for the future. He answered that he must come whenever the occasion called him. That three persons now lay dead in this alley, and that he must be expeditious in their removal, but that he would return as seldom and make as little noise as possible. He was interrupted by new exclamations and upbraidings. These terminated in a burst of tears, and assertions, that God and man were her enemies. That they were determined to destroy her, but she trusted that the time would come when their own experience would avenge her wrongs, and teach them some compassion for the misery of others. Saying this, she shut the window with violence, and retired from it sobbing with a vehemence, that could be distinctly overheard by him in the street. He paused for some time, listening when this passion should cease. The habitation was slight, and he imagined that he heard her traversing the floor. While he staid, she continued to vent her anguish in exclamations and sighs, and passionate weeping. It did not appear that any other person was within. Mr. Thompson being next day informed of these incidents, endeavored to enter the house, but his signals, though loud and frequently repeated, being unnoticed, he was obliged to gain admission by violence. An old man, and a female, lovely in the midst of emaciation and decay, were discovered without signs of life. The death of the latter appeared to have been very recent. In examining the house, no traces of other inhabitants were to be found. Nothing, serviceable as food, was discovered, but the remnants of mouldy bread scattered on a 19 table. No information could be gathered from neighbors respecting the condition and name of these unfortunate people. They had taken possession of this house, during the rage of this malady, and refrained from all communication with their neighbors. There was too much resemblance between this and the story formerly heard, not to produce the belief that they related to the same persons. All that remained was to obtain directions to the proprietor of this dwelling, and exact from him all that he knew respecting his tenants. I found in him a man of worth and affability. He readily related, that a man applied to him for the use of this house, and that the application was received. At the beginning of the pestilence, a numerous family inhabited this tenement, but had died in rapid succession. This new applicant was the first to apprize him of this circumstance, and appeared extremely anxious to enter on immediate possession. It was intimated to him that danger would arise from the pestilential condition of the house. Unless cleansed and purified, disease would be unavoidably contracted. The inconvenience and hazard, this applicant was willing to encounter, and, at length, hinted that no alternative was allowed him, by his present landlord, but to lie in the street or to procure some other abode. What was the external appearance of this person? He was infirm, past the middle age, of melancholy aspect, and indigent garb. A year had since elapsed, and more characteristic particulars had not been remarked, or were forgotten. The name had been mentioned, but in the midst of more recent and momentous transactions, had vanished from remembrance. Dudley, or Dolby, or Hadley, seemed to approach more nearly than any other sounds. Permission to inspect the house was readily granted. It had remained, since that period, unoccupied. The furniture and goods were scanty and wretched, and he did not care to endanger his safety, by meddling with them. He believed that they had not been removed or touched. I was insensible of any hazard which attended my visit, and, with the guidance of a servant, who felt as little apprehension as myself, hastened to the spot. I found nothing but tables and chairs. Clothing was nowhere to be seen. An earthen pot, without handle, and broken, stood upon the kitchen hearth. No other implement or vessel for the preparation of food, appeared. These forlorn appearances were accounted for by the servant, by supposing the house to have been long since rifled of every thing worth the trouble of removal, by the villains who occupied the neighboring houses; this alley, it seems, being noted for the profligacy of its inhabitants. When I reflected that a wretched hovel like this, had been, probably, the last retreat of the Dudleys, when I painted their sufferings, of which the numberless tales of distress, of which I had lately been an auditor, enabled me to form an adequate conception, I felt as if to lie down and expire on the very spot where Constantia had fallen, was the only sacrifice to friendship, which time had left to me. From this house I wandered to the field, where the dead had been promiscuously and by hundreds, interred. I counted the long series of graves, which were closely ranged, and, being recently levelled, exhibited the appearance of a harrowed field. Methought I could have given thousands, to know in what spot the body of my friend lay, that I might moisten the sacred earth with my tears. Boards hastily nailed together, formed the best receptacle, which the exigencies of the time could grant to the dead. Many corpses were thrown into a single excavation, and all distinctions founded on merit and rank, were obliterated. The father and child had been placed in the same cart, and thrown into the same hole. Despairing, by any longer stay in the city, to effect my purpose, and the period of my embarkation being near, I prepared to resume my journey. I should have set out the next day, but a family, with whom I had made acquaintance, expecting to proceed to New York within a week, I consented to be their companion, and, for that end, to delay my departure. Meanwhile, I shut myself up in my apartment, and pursued avocations, that were adapted to the melancholy tenor of my thoughts. The day, preceding that appointed for my journey, arrived. It was necessary to complete my arrangements with the family, with whom I was to travel, and to settle with the lady, whose apartments I occupied. On how slender threads does our destiny hang! Had not a momentary impulse tempted me to sing my favorite ditty to the harpsichord, to beguile the short interval, during which my hostess was conversing with her visiter in the next apartment, I should have speeded to New York, have embarked for Europe, and been eternally severed from my friend, whom I believed to have died in phrenzy and beggary, but who was alive and affluent, and who sought me with a diligence, scarcely inferior to my own. We imagined ourselves severed from each other, by death or by impassable seas, but, at the moment when our hopes had sunk to the lowest ebb, a mysterious destiny conducted our footsteps to the same spot. I heard a murmuring exclamation; I heard my hostess call, in a voice of terror, for help; I rushed into the room; I saw one stretched on the floor, in the attitude of death; I sprung forward and fixed my eyes upon her countenance; I clasped my hands and articulated—Constantia!— She speedily recovered from her swoon. Her eyes opened, she moved, she spoke. Still methought it was an illusion of the senses, that created the phantom. I could not bear to withdraw my eyes from her countenance. If they wandered for a moment, I fell into doubt and perplexity, and again fixed them upon her, to assure myself of her existence. The succeeding three days were spent in a state of dizziness and intoxication. The ordinary functions of nature were disturbed. The appetite for sleep and for food were confounded and lost, amidst the impetuosities of a master passion. To look and to talk to each other, afforded enchanting occupation for every moment. I would not part from her side, but eat and slept, walked, and mused, and read, with my arm locked in her's, and with her breath fanning my cheek. I have indeed much to learn. Sophia Courtland has never been wise. Her affections disdain the cold dictates of discretion, and spurn at every limit, that contending duties and mixed obligations prescribe. And yet, O! precious inebriation of the heart! O! pre-eminent love! What pleasure of reason or of sense, can stand in competition with those attendant upon thee?— Whether thou hiest to the fanes of a benevolent deity, or layest all thy homage at the feet of one, who most visibly resembles the perfections of our Maker, surely thy sanction is divine; thy boon is happiness!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. The tumults of curiosity and pleasure did not speedily subside. The story of each other's wanderings, was told with endless amplification and minuteness. Henceforth, the stream of our existence was to mix; we were to act and to think in common; casual witnesses and written testimony should become superfluous. Eyes and ears were to be eternally employed upon the conduct of each other; death when it should come, was not to be deplored, because it was an unavoidable and brief privation to her that should survive. Being, under any modification, is dear, but that state to which death is a passage, is all-desirable to virtue and all-compensating to grief. Meanwhile, precedent events were made the themes of endless conversation. Every incident and passion, in the course of four years, was revived and exhibited. The name of Ormond, was, of course, frequently repeated by my friend. His features and deportment were described. Her meditations and resolutions, with regard to him, fully disclosed. My counsel was asked, in what manner it became her to act. I could not but harbor aversion to a scheme, which should tend to sever me from Constantia, or to give me a competitor in her affections. Besides this, the properties of Ormond were of too mysterious a nature, to make him worthy of acceptance. Little more was known, concerning him, than what he himself had disclosed to the Dudleys, but this knowledge would suffice to invalidate his claims. He had dwelt, in his conversations with Constantia, sparingly on his own concerns. Yet he did not hide from her, that he had been left in early youth, to his own guidance; 19* that he had embraced, when almost a child, the trade of arms; that he had found service and promotion in the armies of Potemkin and Romanzow; that he had executed secret and diplomatic functions, at Constantinople and Berlin; that, in the latter city, he had met with schemers and reasoners, who aimed at the new modelling of the world, and the subversion of all that has hitherto been conceived elementary and fundamental, in the constitution of man and of government; that some of those reformers had secretly united, to break down the military and monarchical fabric of German policy; that others, more wisely, had devoted their secret efforts, not to overturn, but to build; that, for this end, they embraced an exploring and colonizing project; that he had allied himself to these, and, for the promotion of their projects, had spent six years of his life, in journeys by sea and land, in tracts unfrequented, till then, by any European. What were the moral or political maxims, which this adventurous and visionary sect had adopted, and what was the seat of their new-born empire, whether on the shore of an Austral continent, or in the heart of desert America, he carefully concealed. These were exhibited or hidden, or shifted, according to his purpose. Not to reveal too much, and not to tire curiosity or overtask belief, was his daily labor. He talked of alliance with the family whose name he bore, and who had lost their honors and estates, by the Hanoverian succession to the crown of England. I had seen too much of innovation and imposture, in France and Italy, not to regard a man like this, with aversion and fear. The mind of my friend was wavering and unsuspicious. She had lived at a distance from scenes, where principles are hourly put to the test of experiment; where all extremes of fortitude and pusillanimity are accustomed to meet; where recluse virtue and speculative heroism give place as if by magic, to the last excesses of debauchery and wickedness; where pillage and murder are engrafted, on systems of all-embracing and self-oblivious benevolence; and the good of mankind is professed to be pursued, with bonds of association and covenants of secrecy. Hence my friend had decided without the sanction of experience, had allowed herself to wander into untried paths, and had hearkened to positions, pregnant with destruction and ignominy. It was not difficult to exhibit, in their true light, the enormous errors of this man, and the danger of prolonging their intercourse. Her assent to accompany me to England, was readily obtained. Too much despatch could not be used, but the disposal of her property must first take place. This was necessarily productive of some delay. I had been made, contrary to inclination, expert in the management of all affairs, relative to property. My mother's lunacy, subsequent disease and death, had imposed upon me obligations and cares, little suitable to my sex and age. They could not be eluded or transferred to others, and, by degrees, experience enlarged my knowledge and familiarized my tasks. It was agreed that I should visit and inspect my friend's estate, in Jersey, while she remained in her present abode, to put an end to the views and expectations of Ormond, and to make preparation for her voyage. We were reconciled to a temporary separation, by the necessity that prescribed it. During our residence together, the mind of Constantia was kept in perpetual ferment. The second day after my departure, the turbulence of her feelings began to subside, and she found herself at leisure to pursue those measures which her present situation prescribed. The time prefixed by Ormond for the termination of his absence, had nearly arrived. Her resolutions respecting this man, lately formed, now occurred to her. Her heart drooped as she revolved the necessity of disuniting their fates; but that this disunion was proper, could not admit of doubt. How information of her present views might be most satisfactorily imparted to him, was a question not instantly decided. She reflected on the impetuosity of his character, and conceived that her intentions might be most conveniently unfolded in a letter. This letter she immediately sat down to write. Just then the door opened, and Ormond entered the apartment. She was somewhat, and for a moment, startled by this abrupt and unlooked for entrance. Yet she greeted him with pleasure. Her greeting was received with coldness. A second glance at his countenance informed her that his mind was somewhat discomposed. Folding his hands on his breast, he stalked to the window, and looked up at the moon. Presently he withdrew his gaze from this object, and fixed them upon Constantia. He spoke, but his words were produced by a kind of effort. Fit emblem, he exclaimed, of human versatility! One impediment is gone. I hoped it was the only one, but no; the removal of that merely made room for another. Let this be removed. Well; fate will interplace a third. All our toils will thus be frustrated, and the ruin will finally redound upon our heads.—There he stopped. This strain could not be interpreted by Constantia. She smiled, and without noticing his incoherences, proceeded to inquire into his adventures during their separation. He listened to her, but his eyes, fixed upon her's, and his solemnity of aspect were immoveable. When she paused, he seated himself close to her, and grasped her hand with a vehemence that almost pained her, said; Look at me; steadfastly. Can you read my thoughts? Can your discernment reach the bounds of my knowledge and the bottom of my purposes? Catch you not a view of the monsters that are starting into birth here (and he put his left hand to his forehead.) But you cannot. Should I paint them to you verbally, you would call me jester or deceiver. What pity that you have not instruments for piercing into thoughts! I presume, said Constantia, affecting cheerfulness, which she did not feel, such instruments would be useless to me. You never scruple to say what you think. Your designs are no sooner conceived than they are expressed. All you know, all you wish, and all you purpose, are known to others as soon as to yourself. No scruples of decorum; no foresight of consequences, are obstacles in your way. True, replied he, all obstacles are trampled under foot, but one. What is the insuperable one? Incredulity in him that hears. I must not say what will not be credited. I must not relate feats and avow schemes, when my hearer will say, those feats were never performed; these schemes are not your's. I care not if the truth of my tenets and the practicability of my purposes, be denied. Still I will openly maintain them; but when my assertions will, themselves, be disbelieved; when it is denied, that I adopt the creed and project the plans, which I affirm to be adopted and projected by me, it is needless to affirm. Tomorrow, I mean to ascertain the height of the lunar mountains, by travelling to the top of them. Then I will station myself in the tract of the last comet, and wait till its circumvolution suffers me to leap upon it; then by walking on its surface, I will ascertain whether it be hot enough to burn my soles. Do you believe that this can be done? No. Do you believe, in consequence of my assertion, that I design to do this, and that, in my apprehension, it is easy to be done? Not; unless I previously believe you to be lunatic. Then why should I assert my purposes? Why speak, when the hearer will infer nothing from my speech' but that I am either lunatic or liar? In that predicament, silence is best. In that predicament, I now stand. I am not going to unfold myself. Just now, I pitied thee for want of eyes. 'Twas a foolish compassion. Thou art happy, because thou seest not an inch before thee or behind.—Here he was for a moment buried in thought; then breaking from his reverie, he said: So; your father is dead? True, said Constantia, endeavoring to suppress her rising emotions, he is no more. It is so recent an event, that I imagined you a stranger to it. False imagination! Thinkest thou, I would refrain from knowing what so nearly concerns us both? Perhaps your opinion of my ignorance extends beyond this. Perhaps, I know not your fruitless search for a picture. Perhaps, I neither followed you, nor led you to a being called Sophia Courtland. I was not present at the meeting. I am unapprized of the effects of your romantic passion for each other. I did not witness the rapturous effusions and inexorable counsels of the new comer. I know not the contents of the letter which you are preparing to write.— As he spoke this, the accents of Ormond gradually augmented in vehemence. His countenance bespoke a deepening inquietude and growing passion. He stopped at the mention of the letter, because his voice was overpowered by emotion. This pause afforded room for the astonishment of Constantia. Her interviews and conversations with me, took place at seasons of general repose, when all doors were fast and avenues shut, in the midst of silence, and in the bosom of retirement. The theme of our discourse was, commonly, too sacred for any ears but our own; disclosures were of too intimate and delicate a nature, for any but a female audience; they were too injurious to the fame and peace of Ormond, for him to be admitted to partake of them; yet his words implied a full acquaintance with recent events, and with purposes and deliberations, shrouded, as we imagined, in impenetrable secrecy. As soon as Constantia recovered from the confusion of these thoughts, she eagerly questioned him; what do you know? How do you know what has happened, or what is intended? Poor Constantia! he exclaimed, in a tone bitter and sarcastic. How hopeless is thy ignorance! To enlighten thee is past my power. What do I know? Every thing. Not a tittle has escaped me. Thy letter is superfluous; I know its contents before they are written. I was to be told that a soldier and a traveller, a man who refused his faith to dreams, and his homage to shadows, merited only scorn and forgetfulness. That thy affections and person were due to another; that intercourse between us was henceforth to cease; that preparation was making for a voyage to Britain, and that Ormond was to walk to his grave alone! In spite of harsh tones and inflexible features, these words were accompanied with somewhat that betrayed a mind full of discord and agony. Constantia's astonishment was mingled with dejection. The discovery of a passion, deeper and less curable than she suspected; the perception of embarrassments and difficulties in the path, which she had chosen, that had not previously occurred to her, threw her mind into anxious suspense. The measures she had previously concerted, were still approved. To part from Ormond was enjoined by every dictate of discretion and duty. An explanation of her motives and views, could not take place more seasonably than at present. Every consideration of justice to herself and humanity to Ormond, made it desirable that this interview should be the last. By inexplicable means, he had gained a knowledge of her intentions. It was expedient, therefore, to state them with clearness and force. In what words this was to be done, was the subject of momentary deliberation. Her thoughts were discerned, and her speech anticipated by her companion.—Why droopest thou, and why thus silent, Constantia? The secret of thy fate will never be detected. Till thy destiny be finished, it will not be the topic of a single fear. But not for thyself, but me, art thou concerned. Thou dreadest, yet determinest to confirm my predictions of thy voyage to Europe, and thy severance from me. Dismiss thy inquietudes on that score. What misery thy scorn and thy rejection are able to inflict, is inflicted already. Thy decision was known to me as soon as it was formed. Thy motives were known. Not an argument or plea of thy counsellor, not a syllable of her invective, not a sound of her persuasive rhetoric escaped my hearing. I know thy decree to be immutable. As my doubts, so my wishes have taken their flight. Perhaps, in the depth of thy ignorance, it was supposed, that I should struggle to reverse thy purpose, by menaces or supplications. That I should boast of the cruelty with which I should avenge an imaginary wrong upon myself. No. All is very well; go. Not a whisper of objection or reluctance, shalt thou hear from me. If I could think, said Constantia, with tremulous hesitation, that you part from me without anger; that you see the rectitude of my proceeding— Anger! Rectitude. I prithee peace. I know thou art going. I know that all objection to thy purpose would be vain. Thinkest thou that thy stay, undictated by love, the mere fruit of compassion, would afford me pleasure or crown my wishes? No. I am not so dastardly a wretch. There was something in thy power to bestow, but thy will accords not with thy power. I merit not the boon, and thou refusest it. I am content. Here Ormond fixed more significant eyes upon her. Poor Constantia! he continued. Shall I warn thee of the danger that awaits thee? For what end! To elude it, is impossible. It will come, and thou, perhaps, wilt be unhappy. Foresight, that enables not to shun, only precreates the evil. Come, it will. Though future, it knows not the empire of contingency. An inexorable and immutable decree enjoins it. Perhaps, it is thy nature to meet with calmness what cannot be shunned. Perhaps, when it is passed, thy reason will perceive its irrevocable nature, and restore thee to peace. Such is the conduct of the wise, but such, I fear, the education of Constantia Dudley, will debar her from pursuing. Feign would I regard it as the test of thy wisdom. I look upon thy past life. All the forms of genuine adversity have beset thy youth. Poverty, disease, servile labor, a criminal and hapless parent, have been evils which thou hast not ungracefully sustained. An absent friend and murdered father, were added to thy list of woes, and here thy courage was deficient. Thy soul was proof against substantial misery, but sunk into helpless cowardice, at the sight of phantoms. One more disaster remains. To call it by its true name would be useless or pernicious. Useless, because thou wouldst pronounce its occurrence impossible; pernicious, because, if its possibility were granted, the omen would distract thee with fear. How shall I describe it? Is it loss of fame? No. The deed will be unwitnessed by a human creature. Thy reputation will be spotless, for nothing will be done by thee, unsuitable to the tenor of thy past life. Calumny will not be heard to whisper. All that know thee, will be lavish of their eulogies as ever. Their eulogies will be as justly merited. Of this merit thou wilt entertain as just and as adequate conceptions as now. It is no repetition of the evils thou hast already endured; it is neither drudgery nor sickness, nor privation of friends. Strange perverseness of human reason! It is an evil; it will be thought upon with agony; it will close up all the sources of pleasurable recollection; it will exterminate hope; it will endear oblivion, and push thee into an untimely grave. Yet to grasp it is impossible. The moment we inspect it nearly, it vanishes. Thy claims to human approbation and divine applause, will be undiminished and unaltered by it. The testimony of approving conscience, will have lost none of its explicitness and energy. Yet thou wilt feed upon sighs; thy tears will flow without remission; thou wilt grow enamored of death, and perhaps will anticipate the stroke of disease. Yet, perhaps, my prediction is groundless as my knowledge. Perhaps, thy discernment will avail, to make thee wise and happy. Perhaps, thou wilt perceive thy privilege of sympathetic and intellectual activity, to be untouched. Heaven grant the non-fulfilment of my prophecy, thy disenthralment from error, and the perpetuation of thy happiness. Saying this, Ormond withdrew. His words were always accompanied with gestures and looks, and tones, that fastened the attention of the hearer, but the terms of his present discourse, afforded, independently of gesticulation and utterance, sufficient motives to attention and remembrance. He was gone, but his image was contemplated by Constantia; his words still rung in her ears. The letter she designed to compose, was rendered, by this interview, unnecessary. Meanings, of which she and her friend alone were conscious, were discovered by Ormond, through some other medium than words; yet that was impossible. A being, unendowed with preternatural attributes, could gain the information which this man possessed, only by the exertion of his senses. All human precautions had been used, to baffle the attempts of any secret witness. She recalled to mind the circumstances, in which conversations with her friend had taken place. All had been retirement, secrecy and silence. The hours usually dedicated to sleep, had been devoted to this better purpose. Much had been said, in a voice, low and scarcely louder than a whisper. To have overheard it at the distance of a few feet, was apparently impossible. Their conversations had not been recorded by her. It could not be believed, that this had been done by Sophia Courtland. Had Ormond and her friend met, during the interval that had elapsed, between her separation from the latter, and her meeting with the former? Human events are conjoined by links, imperceptible to keenest eyes. Of Ormond's means of information, she was wholly unapprized. Perhaps, accident would, sometime, unfold them. One thing was incontestable. That her schemes and her reasons for adopting them, were known to him. 20 What unforeseen effects had that knowledge produced! In what ambiguous terms had he couched his prognostics, of some mighty evil that awaited her! He had given a terrible, but contradictory description, of her destiny. An event was to happen, akin to no calamity which she had already endured, disconnected with all which the imagination of man is accustomed to deprecate, capable of urging her to suicide, and yet of a kind, which left it undecided, whether she would regard it with indifference. What reliance should she place upon prophetic incoherences, thus wild? What precautions should she take, against a danger thus inscrutable and imminent?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. These incidents and reflections were speedily transmitted to me. I had always believed the character and machinations of Ormond, to be worthy of caution and fear. His means of information I did not pretend, and thought it useless to investigate. We cannot hide our actions and thoughts, from one of powerful sagacity, whom the detection sufficiently interests, to make him use all the methods of detection in his power. The study of concealment is, in all cases, fruitless or hurtful. All that duty enjoins, is to design and to execute nothing, which may not be approved by a divine and omniscient observer. Human scrutiny is neither to be solicited, nor shunned. Human approbation or censure, can never be exempt from injustice, because our limited perceptions debar us from a thorough knowledge of any actions and motives but our own. On reviewing what had passed, between Constantia and me, I recollected nothing incompatible with purity and rectitude. That Ormond was apprized of all that had passed, I by no means inferred from the tenor of his conversation with Constantia, nor, if this had been incontestably proved, should I have experienced any trepidation or anxiety on that account. His obscure and indirect menaces of evil, were of more importance. His discourse on this topic, seemed susceptible only of two constructions. Either he intended some fatal mischief, and was willing to torment her by fears, while he concealed from her the nature of her danger, that he might hinder her from guarding her safety, by suitable precautions; or, being hopeless of rendering her propitious to his wishes, his malice was satisfied with leaving her a legacy of apprehension and doubt. Constantia's unacquaintance with the doctrines of that school, in which Ormond was probably instructed, led her to regard the conduct of this man, with more curiosity and wonder, than fear. She saw nothing but a disposition to sport with her ignorance and bewilder her with doubts. I do not believe myself destitute of courage. Rightly to estimate the danger and encounter it with firmness, are worthy of a rational being; but to place our security in thoughtlessness and blindness, is only less ignoble than cowardice. I could not forget the proofs of violence, which accompanied the death of Mr. Dudley. I could not overlook, in the recent conversation with Constantia, Ormond's allusion to her murdered father. It was possible that the nature of this death had been accidentally imparted to him; but it was likewise possible, that his was the knowledge of one who performed the act. The enormity of this deed, appeared by no means incongruous with the sentiments of Ormond. Human life is momentous or trivial in our eyes, according to the course which our habits and opinions have taken. Passion greedily accepts, and habit readily offers, the sacrifice of another's life, and reason obeys the impulse of education and desire. A youth of eighteen, a volunteer in a Russian army, encamped in Bessarabia, made prey of a Tartar girl, found in the field of a recent battle. Conducting her to his quarters, he met a friend, who, on some pretence, claimed the victim. From angry words they betook themselves to swords. A combat ensued, in which the first claimant ran his antagonist through the body. He then bore his prize unmolested away, and having exercised brutality of one kind, upon the helpless victim, stabbed her to the heart, as an offering to the manes of Sarsefield, the friend whom he had slain. Next morning, willing more signally to expiate his guilt, he rushed alone upon a troop of Turkish foragers, and brought away five heads, suspended, by their gory locks, to his horse's mane. These he cast upon the grave of Sarsefield, and conceived himself fully to have expiated yesterday's offence. In reward for his prowess, the General gave him a commission in the Cossack troops. This youth was Ormond; and such is a specimen of his exploits, during a military career of eight years, in a warfare the most savage and implacable, and, at the same time, the most iniquitous and wanton which history records. With passions and habits like these, the life of another was a trifling sacrifice to vengeance or impatience. How Mr. Dudley had excited the resentment of Ormond, by what means the assassin had accomplished his intention, without awekening alarm or incurring suspicion, it was not for me to discover. The inextricability of human events, the imperviousness of cunning, and the obduracy of malice, I had frequent occasions to remark. I did not labor to vanquish the security of my friend. As to precautions they were useless. There was no fortress, guarded by barriers of stone and iron, and watched by sentinels that never slept, to which she might retire from his stratagems. If there were such a retreat, it would scarcely avail her against a foe, circumspect and subtle as Ormond. I pondered on the condition of my friend. I reviewed the incidents of her life. I compared her lot with that of others. I could not but discover a sort of incurable malignity in her fate. I felt as if it were denied to her to enjoy a long life or permanent tranquillity. I asked myself, what she had done, entitling her to this incessant persecution? Impatience and murmuring took place of sorrow and fear in my heart. When I reflected, that all human agency was merely subservient to a divine purpose, I fell into fits of accusation and impiety. This injustice was transient, and soberer views convinced me that every scheme, comprising the whole, must be productive of partial and temporary evil. The sufferings of Constantia were limited to a moment; they were the unavoidable appendages of terrestrial existence; they formed the only avenue to wisdom, and the only claim to uninterrupted fruition, and eternal repose in an after scene. The course of my reflections, and the issue to which they led, were unforeseen by myself. Fondly as I doated upon this woman, methought I could resign her to the grave without a murmur or a tear. While my thoughts were calmed by resignation, and my fancy occupied with nothing but the briefness of that space, and evanescence of that time which severs the living from the dead, I contemplated, almost with complacency, a violent or untimely close to her existence. This loftiness of mind could not always be accomplished or constantly maintained. One effect of my fears, was to hasten my departure to Europe. There existed no impediment but the want of a suitable conveyance. In the first packet that should leave America, it was determined to secure a passage. Mr. Melbourne consented to take charge of Constantia's property, and, after the sale of it, to transmit to her the money that should thence arise. Meanwhile, I was anxious that Constantia should leave her present abode and join me in New York. She willingly adopted this arrangement, but conceived it necessary to spend a few days at her house in Jersey. She could reach the latter place without much deviation from the straight road, and she was desirous of resurveying a spot where many of her infantile days had been spent. This house and domain I have already mentioned to have once belonged to Mr. Dudley. It was selected with the judgment and adorned with the taste of a disciple of the schools of Florence and Vincenza. In his view, cultivation was subservient to the picturesque, and a mansion was erected, eminent for nothing but chastity of ornaments, and simplicity of structure. The massive parts were of stone; the outer surfaces were smooth, snow white, and diversified by apertures and cornices, in which a cement uncommonly tenacious was wrought into proportions the most correct, and forms the most graceful. The floors, walls and ceilings, consisted of a still more exquisitely tempered substance, and were painted by Mr. Dudley's own hand. All appendages of this building, as seats, tables and cabinets, were modelled by the owner's particular direction, and in a manner scrupulously classical. 20* He had scarcely entered on the enjoyment of this splendid possession, when it was ravished away. No privation was endured with more impatience than this; but, happily, it was purchased by one who left Mr. Dudley's arrangements unmolested, and who shortly after conveyed it entire to Ormond. By him it was finally appropriated to the use of Helena Cleves, and now, by a singular contexture of events, it had reverted to those hands, in which the death of the original proprietor, if no other change had been made in his condition, would have left it. The farm still remained in the tenure of a German emigrant, who held it partly on condition of preserving the garden and mansion in safety and in perfect order. This retreat was now revisited by Constantia, after an interval of four years. Autumn had made some progress, but the aspect of nature was, so to speak, more significant than at any other season. She was agreeably accommodated under the tenant's roof, and found a nameless pleasure in traversing spaces, in which every object prompted an endless train of recollections. Her sensations were not foreseen. They led to a state of mind, inconsistent, in some degree, with the projects adopted in obedience to the suggestions of a friend. Every thing in this scene had been created and modelled by the genius of her father. It was a kind of fane, sanctified by his imaginary presence. To consign the fruits of his industry and invention to foreign and unsparing hands, seemed a kind of sacrilege, for which she almost feared that the dead would rise to upbraid her. Those images which bind us to our natal soil, to the abode of our innocent and careless youth, were recalled to her fancy by the scenes which she now beheld. These were enforced by considerations of the dangers which attended her voyage, from storms and from enemies, and from the tendency to revolution and war, which seemed to actuate all the nations of Europe. Her native country was by no means exempt from similar tendencies, but these evils were less imminent, and its manners and government, in their present modifications, were unspeakably more favorable to the dignity and improvement of the human race, than those which prevailed in any part of the ancient world. My solicitations and my obligation to repair to England, overweighed her objections, but her new reflections led her to form new determinations with regard to this part of her property. She concluded to retain possession, and hoped that some future event would allow her to return to this favorite spot, without forfeiture of my society. An abode of some years in Europe would more eminently qualify her for the enjoyment of retirement and safety in her native country. The time that should elapse before her embarkation, she was desirous of passing among the shades of this romantic retreat. I was, by no means, reconciled to this proceeding. I loved my friend too well to endure any needless separation without repining. In addition to this, the image of Ormond haunted my thoughts, and gave birth to incessant but indefinable fears. I believed that her safety would very little depend upon the nature of her abode, or the number or watchfulness of her companions. My nearness to her person would frustrate no stratagem, nor promote any other end than my own entanglement in the same fold. Still, that I was not apprized, each hour, of her condition, that her state was lonely and sequestered, were sources of disquiet, the obvious remedy to which was her coming to New York. Preparations for departure were assigned to me, and these required my continuance in the city. Once a week, Laffert, her tenant, visited, for purposes of traffic, the city. He was the medium of our correspondence. To him I entrusted a letter, in which my dissatisfaction at her absence, and the causes which gave it birth, were freely confessed. The confidence of safety seldom deserted my friend. Since her mysterious conversation with Ormond, he had utterly vanished. Previously to that interview, his visits or his letters were incessant and punctual; but since, no token was given that he existed. Two months had elapsed. He gave her no reason to expect a cessation of intercourse. He had parted from her with his usual abruptness and informality. She did not conceive it incumbent on her to search him out, but she would not have been displeased with an opportunity to discuss with him more fully the motives of her conduct. This opportunity had been hitherto denied. Her occupations, in her present retreat, were, for the most part, dictated by caprice or by chance. The mildness of autumn permitted her to ramble, during the day, from one rock and one grove to another. There was a luxury in musing, and in the sensations which the scenery and silence produced, which, in consequence of her long estrangement from them, were accompanied with all the attractions of novelty, and from which she would not consent to withdraw. In the evening she usually retired to the mansion, and shut herself up in that apartment, which, in the original structure of the house, had been designed for study, and no part of whose furniture had been removed or displaced. It was a kind of closet on the second floor, illuminated by a spacious window, through which a landscape of uncommon amplitude and beauty was presented to the view. Here the pleasures of the day were revived, by recalling and enumerating them in letters to her friend. She always quitted this recess with reluctance, and, seldom, till the night was half spent. One evening she retired hither when the sun had just dipped beneath the horizon. Her implements of writing were prepared, but before the pen was assumed, her eyes rested for a moment on the variegated hues, which were poured out upon the western sky, and upon the scene of intermingled waters, copses and fields. The view comprised a part of the road which led to this dwelling. It was partially and distantly seen, and the passage of horses or men, was betokened chiefly by the dust which was raised by their footsteps. A token of this kind now caught her attention. It fixed her eye, chiefly by the picturesque effect produced by interposing its obscurity between her and the splendors which the sun had left. Presently she gained a faint view of a man and horse. This circumstance laid no claim to attention, and she was withdrawing her eye, when the traveller's stopping and dismounting at the gate, made her renew her scrutiny. This was reinforced by something in the figure and movements of the horseman, which reminded her of Ormond. She started from her seat with some degree of palpitation. Whence this arose, whether from fear or from joy, or from intermixed emotions, it would not be easy to ascertain. Having entered the gate, the visitant, remounting his horse, set the animal on full speed. Every moment brought him nearer, and added to her first belief. He stopped not till he reached the mansion. The person of Ormond was distinctly recognised. An interview, at this dusky and lonely hour, in circumstances so abrupt and unexpected, could not fail to surprise, and, in some degree, to alarm. The substance of his last conversation was recalled. The evils which were darkly and ambiguously predicted, thronged to her memory. It seemed as if the present moment was to be, in some way, decisive of her fate. This visit, she did not hesitate to suppose, designed for her, but somewhat uncommonly momentous, must have prompted him to take so long a journey. The rooms on the lower floor were dark, the windows and doors being fastened. She had entered the house by the principal door, and this was the only one, at present, unlocked. The room in which she sat, was over the hall, and the massive door beneath could not be opened, without noisy signals. The question that occurred to her, by what means Ormond would gain admittance to her presence, she supposed would be instantly decided. She listened to hear his footsteps on the pavement, or the creaking of hinges. The silence, however, continued profound as before. After a minute's pause, she approached the window more nearly, and endeavored to gain a view of the space before the house. She saw nothing but the horse, whose bridle was thrown over his neck, and who was left at liberty to pick up what scanty herbage the lawn afforded to his hunger. The rider had disappeared. It now occurred to her, that this visit had a purpose different from that which she at first conjectured. It was easily conceived, that Ormond was unacquainted with her residence at this spot. The knowledge could only be imparted to him, by indirect or illicit means. That these means had been employed by him, she was by no means authorized to infer from the silence and distance he had lately maintained. But if an interview with her, were not the purpose of his coming, how should she interpret it?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. While occupied with these reflections, the light hastily disappeared, and darkness, rendered, by a cloudy atmosphere, uncommonly intense, succeeded. She had the means of lighting a lamp, that hung against the wall, but had been too much immersed in thought, to notice the deepening of the gloom. Recovering from her reverie, she looked around her with some degree of trepidation, and prepared to strike a spark, that would enable her to light her lamp. She had hitherto indulged an habitual indifference to danger. Now the presence of Ormond, the unknown purpose that led him hither, and the defencelessness of her condition, inspired her with apprehensions, to which she had hitherto been a stranger. She had been accustomed to pass many nocturnal hours in this closet. Till now, nothing had occurred, that made her enter it with circumspection, or continue in it with reluctance. Her sensations were no longer tranquil. Each minute that she spent in this recess, appeared to multiply her hazards. To linger here, appeared to her the height of culpable temerity. She hastily resolved to return to the farmer's dwelling, and, on the morrow, to repair to New York. For this end, she was desirous to produce a light. The materials were at hand. She lifted her hand to strike the flint, when her ear caught a sound, which betokened the opening of the door, that led into the next apartment. Her motion was suspended, and she listened as well as a throbbing heart would permit. That Ormond's was the hand that opened, was the first suggestion of her fears. The motives of this unseasonable entrance, could not be reconciled with her safety. He had given no warning of his approach, and the door was opened with tardiness and seeming caution. Sounds continued, of which no distinct conception could be obtained, or the cause that produced them assigned. The floors of every apartment being composed, like the walls and ceiling, of cement, footsteps were rendered almost undistinguishable. It was plain, however, that some one approached her own door. The panic and confusion that now invaded her, was owing to surprise, and to the singularity of her situation. The mansion was desolate and lonely. It was night. She was immersed in darkness. She had not the means, and was unaccustomed to the office of repelling personal injuries. What injuries she had reason to dread, who was the agent, and what were his motives, were subjects of vague and incoherent meditation. Meanwhile, low and imperfect sounds, that had in them more of inanimate than human, assailed her ear. Presently they ceased. An inexplicable fear deterred her from calling. Light would have exercised a friendly influence. This, it was in her power to produce, but not without motion and noise, and these, by occasioning the discovery of her being in the closet, might possibly enhance her danger. Conceptions like these, were unworthy of the mind of Constantia. An interval of silence succeeded, interrupted only by the whistling of the blast without. It was sufficient for the restoration of her courage. She blushed at the cowardice which had trembled at a sound. She considered that Ormond might, indeed, be near, but that he was probably unconscious of her situation. His coming was not with the circumspection of an enemy. He might be acquainted with the place of her retreat, and had come to obtain an interview, with no clandestine or mysterious purposes. The noises she had heard, had, doubtless, proceeded from the next apartment, but might be produced by some harmless or vagrant creature. These considerations restored her tranquillity. They enabled her, deliberately, to create a light, but they did not dissuade her from leaving the house. Omens of evil seemed to be connected with this solitary and darksome abode. Besides, Ormond had unquestionably entered upon this scene. It could not be doubted that she was the object of his visit. The farm house was a place of meeting, more suitable and safe than any other. Thither, therefore, she determined immediately to return. The closet had but one door, and this led into the chamber where the sounds had arisen. Through this chamber, therefore, she was obliged to pass, in order to reach the staircase, which terminated in the hall below. Bearing the light in her left hand, she withdrew the bolt of the door, and opened. In spite of courageous efforts, she opened with unwillingness, and shuddered to throw a glance forward or advance a step into the room. This was not needed, to reveal to her the cause of her late disturbance. Her eye instantly lighted on the body of a man, supine, motionless, stretched on the floor, close to the door through which she was about to pass. A spectacle like this, was qualified to startle her. She shrunk back and fixed a more steadfast eye, upon the prostrate person. There was no mark of blood or of wounds, but there was something in the attitude, more significant of death than of sleep. His face rested on the floor, and his ragged locks concealed what part of his visage was not hidden by his posture. His garb was characterized by fashionable elegance, but was polluted with dust. The image that first occurred to her, was that of Ormond. This instantly gave place to another, which was familiar to her apprehension. It was at first too indistinctly seen to suggest a name. She continued to gaze and to be lost in fearful astonishment. Was this the persen whose entrance had been overheard, and who had dragged himself hither to die at her door? Yet, in that case, would not groans and expiring efforts have testified his condition, and invoked her succor? Was he not brought hither in the arms of his assassin? She mused upon the possible motives that induced some one thus to act, and upon the connexion that might subsist, between her destiny and that of the dead. Her meditations, however fruitless, in other respects, could not fail to show her the propriety of hastening from this spot. To scrutinize the form or face of the dead, was a task, to which her courage was unequal. Suitably accompanied and guarded, she would not scruple to return and ascertain, by the most sedulous examination, the causes of this ominous event. She stept over the breathless corpse, and hurried to the staircase. It became her to maintain the command of her muscles and joints, and to proceed without faltering or hesitation. Scarcely had she reached the entrance of the hall, when, casting anxious looks forward, she beheld a human figure. No scrutiny was requisite to inform her, that this was Ormond. She stopped. He approached her with looks and gestures, placid but solemn. There was nothing in his countenance rugged or malignant. On the contrary, there were tokens of compassion. So, said he, I expected to meet you. A light, gleaming from the window, marked you out. This, and Laffert's directions, have guided me. What said Constantia, with discomposure in her accent, was your motive for seeking me? Have you forgotten, said Ormond, what passed at our last interview? The evil that I then predicted is at hand. Perhaps, you were incredulous; you accounted me a madman or deciever; now I am come to witness the fulfilment of my words, and the completion of your destiny. To rescue you, I have not come; that is not within the compass of human powers. Poor Constantia! he continued, in tones that manifested genuine sympathy, look upon thyself as lost. The toils that beset thee are inextricable. Summon up thy patience to endure the evil. Now will the last and heaviest trial betide thy fortitude. I could weep for thee, if my manly nature would permit. This is the scene of thy calamity, and this the hour. These words were adapted to excite curiosity mingled with terror. Ormond's deportment was of an unexampled tenor, as well as that evil which he had so ambiguously predicted. He offered no protection from danger, and yet gave no proof of being himself an agent or auxiliary. After a minute's pause, Constantia recovering a firm tone, said: Mr. Ormond! Your recent deportment but ill accords with your professions of sincerity and plain dealing. What your purpose is, or whether you have any purpose, I am at a loss to conjecture. Whether you most deserve censure or ridicule, is a point which you afford me not the means of deciding, and to which, unless on your own account, I am indifferent. If you are willing to be more explicit, or if there be any topic on which you wish further to converse, I will not refuse your company to Laffert's dwelling. Longer to remain here, would be indiscreet and absurd. 21 So saying she motioned towards the door. Ormond was passive, and seemed indisposed to prevent her departure, till she laid her hand upon the lock. He then, without moving from his place, exclaimed. Stay. Must this meeting, which fate ordains to be the last, be so short? Must a time and place so suitable, for what remains to be said and done, be neglected or misused? No. You charge me with duplicity, and deem my conduct either ridiculous or criminal. I have stated my reasons for concealment, but these have failed to convince you. Well. Here is now an end to doubt. All ambiguities are preparing to vanish. When Ormond began to speak, Constantia paused to hearken to him. His vehemence was not of that nature, which threatened to obstruct her passage. It was by entreaty that he apparently endeavored to detain her steps, and not by violence. Hence arose her patience to listen. He continued. Constantia! thy father is dead. Art thou not desirous of detecting the author of his fate? Will it afford thee no consolation to know that the deed is punished? Wilt thou suffer me to drag the murderer to thy feet? Thy justice will be gratified by this sacrifice. Somewhat will be due to him who avenged thy wrong in the blood of the perpetrator? What sayest thou? Grant me thy permission, and, in a moment, I will drag him hither. These words called up the image of the person, whose corpse she had lately seen. It was readily conceived that to him Ormond alluded, but this was the assassin of her father, and his crime had been detected and punished by Ormond! These images had no other effect than to urge her departure; she again applied her hand to the lock, and said; This scene must not be prolonged. My father's death I desire not to hear explained or to see revenged, but whatever information you are willing or able to communicate, must be deferred. Nay, interrupted Ormond, with augmented vehemence, art thou equally devoid of curiosity and justice? Thinkest thou, that the enmity which bereft thy father of life, will not seek thy own? There are evils which I cannot prevent thee from enduring, but there are, likewise, ills which my counsel will enable thee and thy friend to shun. Save me from witnessing thy death. Thy father's destiny is sealed; all that remained was to punish his assassin; but thou and thy Sophia still live. Why should ye perish by a like stroke? This intimation was sufficient to arrest the steps of Constantia. She withdrew her hand from the door, and fixed eyes of the deepest anxiety on Ormond;—What mean you? How am I to understand— Ah! said Ormond, I see thou wilt consent to stay. Thy detention shall not be long. Remain where thou art during one moment; merely while I drag hither thy enemy, and shew thee a visage which thou wilt not be slow to recognise. Saying this, he hastily ascended the staircase, and quickly passed beyond her sight. Deportment thus mysterious, could not fail of bewildering her thoughts. There was somewhat in the looks and accents of Ormond, different from former appearances; tokens of a hidden purpose and a smothered meaning, were perceptible; a mixture of the inoffensive and the lawless, which added to the loneliness and silence that encompassed her, produced a faltering emotion. Her curiosity was overpowered by her fear, and the resolution was suddenly conceived, of seizing this opportunity to escape. A third time she put her hand to the lock and attempted to open. The effort was ineffectual. The door that was accustomed to obey the gentlest touch, was now immoveable. She had lately unlocked and passed through it. Her eager inspection convinced her that the principal bolt was still withdrawn, but a smaller one was now perceived, of whose existence she had not been apprized, and over which her key had no power. Now did she first harbor a fear that was intelligible in its dictates. Now did she first perceive herself sinking in the toils of some lurking enemy. Hope whispered that this foe was not Ormond. His conduct had bespoken no willingness to put constraint upon her steps. He talked not as if he was aware of this obstruction, and yet his seeming acquiescence might have flowed from a knowledge that she had no power to remove beyond his reach. He warned her of danger to her life, of which he was her self-appointed rescuer. His counsel was to arm her with sufficient caution; the peril that awaited her was imminent; this was the time and place of its occurrence, and here she was compelled to remain, till the power that fastened, would condescend to loose the door. There were other avenues to the hall. These were accustomed to be locked, but Ormond had found access, and if all continued fast, it was incontestable that he was the author of this new impediment. The other avenues were hastily examined. All were holted and locked. The first impulse led her to call for help from without, but the mansion was distant from Laffert's habitation. This spot was wholly unfrequented. No passenger was likely to be stationed where her call could be heard. Besides, this forcible detention might operate for a short time, and be attended with no mischievous consequences. Whatever was to come, it was her duty to collect her courage and encounter it. The steps of Ormond above now gave tokens of his approach. Vigilant observance of this man was all that her situation permitted. A vehement effort restored her to some degree of composure. Her stifled palpitations allowed her steadfastly to notice him, as he now descended the stairs, bearing a lifeless body in his arms. There, said he, as he cast it at her feet, whose countenance is that? Who would imagine that features like those, belonged to an assassin and imposter? Closed eyelids and fallen muscles, could not hide from her lineaments so often seen. She shrunk back and exclaimed—Thomas Craig! A pause succeeded, in which she alternately gazed at the countenance of this unfortunate wretch and at Ormond. At length, the latter exclaimed. Well, my girl; hast thou examined him? Dost thou recognise a friend or an enemy? I know him well; but how came this? What purpose brought him hither? Who was the author of his fate? Have I not already told thee that Ormond was his own avenger and thine? To thee and to me he has been a robber. To him thy father is indebted for the loss not only of property but life. Did crimes like these merit a less punishment? And what recompense is due to him whose vigilance pursued him hither, and made him pay for his offences with his blood? What benefit have I received at thy hand to authorize me, for thy sake, to take away his life? No benefit received from me, said Constantia, would justify such an act. I should have abhorred myself for annexing to my benefits, so bloody a condition. It calls for no gratitude for recompense. Its suitable attendant is remorse. That he is a thief, I know but too well; that my father died by his hand is incredible.—No motives or means— Why so? interrupted Ormond. Does not sleep seal up the senses? Cannot closets be unlocked at midnight? Cannot adjoining houses communicate by doors? Cannot these doors be hidden from suspicion by a sheet of canvass? These words were of startling and abundant import. They reminded her of circumstances in her father's chamber, which sufficiently explained the means by which his life was assailed. The closet, and its canvass-covered wall; the adjoining house untenanted and shut up—but this house, though unoccupied, belonged to Ormond! From the inferences which flowed hence, her attention was withdrawn by her companion, who continued. Do these means imply the interposal of a miracle? His motives? What scruples can be expected from a man inured, from infancy, to cunning and pillage? Will he abstain from murder when urged by excruciating poverty, by menaces of persecution; by terror of expiring on the gallows? Tumultuous suspicions were now awakened in the mind of Constantia. Her faltering voice scarcely allowed her to ask; how know you that Craig was thus guilty; that these were his incitements and means?— Ormond's solemnity now gave place to a tone of sarcasm and looks of exultation. Poor Constantia! Thou art still pestered with incredulity and doubts! My veracity is still in question! My knowledge, girl, is infallible. That these were his means of access I cannot be ignorant, for I pointed them out. He was urged by these motives, for they were stated and entorced by me. His was the deed, for I stood beside him when it was done. These indeed, were terms that stood in no need of further explanation. The veil that shrouded this formidable being, 21* was lifted high enough to make him be regarded with inexplicable horror. What his future acts should be, how his omens of ill were to be solved, were still involved in uncertainty. In the midst of fears for her own safety, by which Constantia was now assailed, the image of her father was revived; keen regret and vehement upbraiding were conjured up. Craig then was the instrument, and your's the instigation that destroyed my father! In what had he offended you? What cause had he given for resentment? Cause! replied he, with impetuous accents, Resentment! None. My motive was benevolent; my deed conferred a benefit. I gave him sight and took away his life, from motives equally wise. Know you not that Ormond was fool enough to set value on the affections of a woman? These were sought with preposterous anxiety and endless labor. Among other facilitators of his purpose, he summoned gratitude to his aid. To snatch you from poverty, to restore his sight to your father, were expected to operate as incentives to love. But here I was the dupe of error. A thousand prejudices stood in my way. These, provided our intercourse were not obstructed, I hoped to subdue. The rage of innovation seized your father; this, blended with a mortal antipathy to me, made him labor to seduce you from the bosom of your peaceful country; to make you enter on a boisterous sea; to visit lands where all is havoc and hostility. To snatch you from the influence of my arguments. This new obstacle I was bound to remove. While revolving the means, chance and his evil destiny, threw Craig in my way. I soon convinced him that his reputation and his life were in my hands. His retention of these depended upon my will, on the performance of conditions which I prescribed. My happiness and your's, depended on your concurrence with my wishes. Your father's life was an obstacle to your concurrence. For killing him, therefore, I may claim your gratitude. His death was a due and disinterested offering, at the altar of your felicity and mine. My deed was not injurious to him. At his age, death, whose coming, at some period, is inevitable, could not be distant. To make it unforeseen and brief, and void of pain; to preclude the torments of a lingering malady; a slow and visible descent to the grave; was the dictates of beneficence. But of what value was a continuance of his life? Either you would have gone with him to Europe, or have staid at home with me. In the first case, his life would have been rapidly consumed by perils and cares. In the second, separation from you, and union with me, a being so detestable, would equally have poisoned his existence. Craig's cowardice and crimes, made him a pliant and commodious tool. I pointed out the way. The unsuspected door, which led into the closet of your father's chamber, was made by my direction, during the life of Helena. By this avenue I was wont to post myself, where all your conversations could be overheard. By this avenue, an entrance and retreat were afforded to the agent of my newest purpose. Fool that I was! I solaced myself with the belief that all impediments were now smoothed, when a new enemy appeared; my folly lasted as long as my hope. I saw that to gain your affections, fortified by antiquated scruples, and obsequious to the guidance of this new monitor, was impossible. It is not my way to toil after that which is beyond my reach. If the greater good be inaccessible, I learn to be contented with the less. I have served you with successless sedulity. I have set an engine in act to obliterate an obstacle to your felicity, and lay your father at rest. Under my guidance, this engine was productive only of good. Governed by itself or by another, it will only work you harm. I have, therefore, hastened to destroy it. Lo! it is now before you motionless and impotent. For this complexity of benefit I look for no reward. I am not tired of well-doing. Having ceased to labor for an unattainable good, I have come hither to possess myself of all that I now crave, and by the same deed to afford you an illustrious opportunity to signalize your wisdom and your fortitude. During this speech, the mind of Constantia became more deeply pervaded with dread of some over-hanging but incomprehensible evil. The strongest impulse was, to gain a safe asylum, at a distance from this spot, and from the presence of this extraordinary being. This impulse was followed by the recollection, that her liberty was taken away; that egress from the hall was denied her, and that this restriction might be part of some conspiracy of Ormond, against her life. Security from danger like this, would be, in the first place, sought, by one of Constantia's sex and opinions, in flight. This had been rendered, by some fatal chance, or by the precautions of her foe, impracticable. Stratagem or force was all that remained, to elude or disarm her adversary. For the contrivance and execution of frauds, all the habits of her life and all the maxims of her education, had conspired to unfit her. Her force of muscles would avail her nothing, against the superior energy of Ormond. She remembered that to inflict death, was no iniquitous exertion of self defence, and that the penknife which she held in her hand, was capable of this service. She had used it to remove any lurking obstruction in the wards of her key, supposing, for a time, this to be the cause of her failing to withdraw the bolt of the door. This resource, was, indeed, scarcely less disastrous and deplorable, than any fate from which it could rescue her. Some uncertainty still involved the intentions of Ormond. As soon as he paused, she spoke. How am I to understand this prelude? Let me know the full extent of my danger; why it is that I am hindered from leaving this house, and why this interview was sought. Ah! Constantia! This, indeed, is merely a prelude to a scene that is to terminate my influence over thy fate. When this is past, I have sworn to part with thee forever. Art thou still dubious of my purpose? Art thou not a woman? And have I not intreated for thy love, and been rejected? Canst thou imagine that I aim at thy life? My avowals of love were sincere; my passion was vehement and undisguised. It gave dignity and value to a gift in thy power, as a woman, to bestow. This has been denied. That gift has lost none of its value in my eyes. What thou refusedst to bestow, it is in my power to extort. I came for hat end. When this end is accomplished, I will restore thee to liberty. These words were accompanied by looks, that rendered all explanation of their meaning useless. The evil reserved for her, hitherto obscured by half disclosed and contradictory attributes, was now sufficiently apparent. The truth in this respect unveiled itself with the rapidity and brightness of an electrical flash. She was silent. She cast her eyes at the windows and doors. Escape through them was hopeless. She looked at those lineaments of Ormond which evinced his disdain of supplication and inexorable passions. She felt that intreaty and argument would be vain. That all appeals to his compassion and benevolence would counteract her purpose, since, in the unexampled conformation of this man's mind, these principles were made subservient to his most flagitious designs. Considerations of justice and pity were made, by a fatal perverseness of reasoning, champions and bulwarks of his most atrocious mistakes. The last extremes of opposition, the most violent expedients for defence, would be justified by being indispensable. To find safety for her honor, even in the blood of an assailant, was the prescription of duty. The equity of this species of defence, was not, in the present confusion of her mind, a subject of momentary doubt. To forewarn him of her desperate purpose, would be to furnish him with means of counteraction. Her weapon would easily be wrested from her feeble hand. Ineffectual opposition would only precipitate her evil destiny. A rage, contented with nothing less than her life, might be awakened in his bosom. But was not this to be desired? Death, untimely and violent, was better than the loss of honor. This thought led to a new series of reflections. She involuntarily shrunk from the act of killing, but would her efforts to destroy her adversary be effectual? Would not his strength and dexterity, easily repel or elude them? Her power, in this respect, was questionable, but her power was undeniably sufficient to a different end. The instrument, which could not rescue her from this injury, by the destruction of another, might save her from it by her own destruction. These thoughts rapidly occurred, but the resolution to which they led, was scarcely formed, when Ormond advanced towards her. She recoiled a few steps, and, shewing the knife which she held, said: Ormond! Beware! Know that my unalterable resolution is, to die uninjured. I have the means in my power. Stop where you are; one step more, and I plunge this knife into my heart. I know that to contend with your strength or your reason, would be vain. To turn this weapon against you, I should not fear, if I were sure of success; but to that I will not trust. To save a greater good by the sacrifice of life, is in my power, and that sacrifice shall be made. Poor Constantia! replied Ormond, in a tone of contempt; so! thou preferrest thy imaginary honor to life! To escape this injury without a name or substance. Without connexion with the past or future; without contamination of thy purity or thraldom of thy will; thou wilt kill thyself; put an end to thy activity in virtue's cause; rob thy friend of her solace; the world of thy beneficence; thyself of being and pleasure? I shall be grieved for the fatal issue of my experiment; I shall mourn over thy martyrdom to the most opprobious and contemptible of all errors, but that thou shouldst undergo the trial is decreed. There is still an interval of hope, that thy cowardice is counterfeited, or that it will give place to wisdom and courage. Whatever thou intendest, by way of prevention or cure, it behoves thee to employ with steadfastness. Die with the guilt of suicide and the brand of cowardice upon thy memory, or live with thy claims to felicity and approbation undiminished. Choose which thou wilt. Thy decision is of moment to thyself, but of none to me. Living or dead, the prize that I have in view shall be mine.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. It will be requisite to withdraw your attention from this scene for a moment, and fix it on myself. My impatience of my friend's delay, for some day's preceding this disastrous interview, became continually more painful. As the time of our departure approached, my dread of some misfortune or impediment increased. Ormond's disappearance from the scene, contributed but little to my consolation. To wrap his purposes in mystery, to place himself at seeming distance, was the usual artifice of such as he; was necessary to the maturing of his project, and the hopeless entanglement of his victim. I saw no means of placing the safety of my friend beyond his reach. Between different methods of procedure, there was, however, room for choice. Her present abode was more hazardous than an abode in the city. To be alone, argued a state more defenceless and perilous, than to be attended by me. I wrote her an urgent admonition to return. My remonstrances were couched in such terms, as, in my own opinion, laid her under the necessity of immediate compliance. The letter was despatched by the usual messenger, and for some hours I solaced myself with the prospect of a speedy meeting. These thoughts gave place to doubt and apprehension. I began to distrust the efficacy of my arguments, and to invent a thousand reasons, inducing her, in defiance of my rhetoric, at least to protract her absence. These reasons, I had not previously conceived, and had not, therefore, attempted, in my letter, to invalidate their force. This omission was possible to be supplied in a second epistle, but, meanwhile, time would be lost, and my new arguments, might, like the old, fail to convince her. At least, the tongue was a much more versatile and powerful advocate than the pen, and by hastening to her habitation, I might either compel her to return with me, or ward off danger by my presence, or share it with her. I finally resolved to join her, by the speediest conveyance. This resolution was suggested, by the meditations of a sleepless night. I rose with the dawn and sought out the means of transporting myself, with most celerity, to the abode of my friend. A stagehoat, accustomed, twice a day, to cross New York bay to Staten Island, was prevailed upon, by liberal offers, to set out upon the voyage at the dawn of day. The sky was gloomy, and the air boisterous and unsettled. The wind, suddenly becoming tempestuous and adverse, rendered the voyage at once tedious and full of peril. A voyage of nine miles was not effected in less than eight hours, and without imminent and hairbreadth danger of being drowned. Fifteen miles of the journey remained to be performed by land. A carriage, with the utmost difficulty, was procured, but lank horses and a crazy vehicle were but little in unison with my impatience. We reached not Amboy ferry till some hours after nightfall. I was rowed across the sound, and proceeded to accomplish the remainder of my journey, about three miles, on foot. I was actuated to this speed, by indefinite, but powerful motives. The belief that my speedy arrival was essential to the rescue of my friend from some inexplicable injury, haunted me with ceaseless importunity. On no account would I have consented to postpone this precipitate expedition, till the morrow. I at length arrived at Dudley's farmhouse. The inhabitants were struck with wonder at the sight of me. My clothes were stained by the water, by which every passenger was copiously sprinkled, during our boisterous navigation, and soiled by dust; my frame was almost overpowered by fatigue and abstinence. To my anxious inquiries respecting my friend, they told me that her evenings were usually spent at the mansion, where, it was probable, she was now to be found. They were not apprized of any inconvenience or danger, that betided her. It was her custom sometimes to prolong her absence till midnight. I could not applaud the discretion nor censure the temerity of this proceeding. My mind was harassed by unintelligible omens and self-confuted fears. To obviate the danger and to banish my inquietudes, was my first duty. For this end I hastened to the mansion. Having passed the intervening hillocks and copses, I gained a view of the front of the building. My heart suddenly sunk, on observing that no apartment, not even that in which I knew it was her custom to sit at these unseasonable hours, was illuminated. A gleam from the window of the study, I should have regarded as an argument, at once, of her presence and her safety. I approached the house with misgiving and faltering steps. The gate leading into a spacious court was open. A sound on one side attracted my attention. In the present state of my thoughts, any near or unexplained sound, sufficed to startle me. Looking towards the quarter, whence my panic was excited, I espied, through the dusk, a horse grazing, with his bridle thrown over his neck. This appearance was a new source of perplexity and alarm. The inference was unavoidable, that a visitant was here. Who that visitant was, and how he was now employed, was a subject of eager but fruitless curiosity. Within and around the mansion, all was buried in the deepest repose. I now approached the principal door, and looking through the keyhole, perceived a lamp, standing on the lowest step of the staircase. It shed a pale light over the lofty cieling and marble balustrades. No face or movement of a human being was perceptible. These tokens assured me that some one was within; they also accounted for the nonappearance of light, at the window above. I withdrew my eye from this avenue, and was preparing to knock loudly for admission, when my attention was awakened by some one, who advanced to the door from the inside, and seemed busily engaged in unlocking. I started back and waited with impatience, till the door should open and the person issue forth. Presently I heard a voice within, exclaim, in accents of mingled terror and grief—O what—what will become of me? Shall I never be released from this detested prison? The voice was that of Constantia. It penetrated to my heart like an icebolt. I once more darted a glance through the crevice. A figure, with difficulty recognised to be that of my friend, now appeared in sight. Her hands were clasped on her breast, her eyes wildly fixed upon the ceiling and streaming with tears, and her hair unbound and falling confusedly over her bosom and neck. My sensations scarcely permitted me to call—Constantia! For Heaven's sake what has happened to you? Open the door, I beseech you. What voice is that? Sophia Courtland! O my friend! I am imprisoned. Some dæmon has barred the door, beyond my power to unfasten. Ah! Why comest thou so late? Thy succor would have somewhat profited, if sooner given, but now, the lost Constantia—here her voice sunk into convulsive sobs.— In the midst of my own despair, on perceiving the fulfilment 22 of my apprehensions, and what I regarded as the fatal execution of some project of Ormond, I was not insensible to the suggestions of prudence. I entreated my friend to retain her courage, while I flew to Laffert's, and returned with suitable assistance to burst open the door. The people of the farm house readily obeyed my summons. Accompanied by three men of powerful sinews, sons and servants of the farmer, I returned with the utmost expedition to the mansion. The lamp still remained in its former place, but our loudest calls were unanswered. The silence was uninterrupted and profound. The door yielded to strenuous and repeated efforts, and I rushed into the hall. The first object that met my sight, was my friend, stretched upon the floor, pale and motionless, supine, and with all the tokens of death! From this object my attention was speedily attracted, by two figures, breathless and supine, like that of Constantia. One of them was Ormond. A smile of disdain still sat upon his features. The wound, by which he fell, was secret, and was scarcely betrayed by the effusion of a drop of blood. The face of the third victim was familiar to my early days. It was that of the imposter, whose artifice had torn from Mr Dudley his peace and fortune. An explication of this scene was hopeless. By what disastrous and inscrutable fate, a place like this became the scene of such complicated havoc, to whom Craig was indebted for his death, what evil had been meditated or inflicted by Ormond, and by what means his project had arrived at this bloody consummation, were topics of wild and fearful conjecture. But my friend—the first impulse of my fears was, to regard her as dead. Hope and a closer observation, outrooted, or at least, suspended this opinion. One of the men lifted her in his arms. No trace of blood or mark of fatal violence was discoverable, and the effusion of cold water restored her, though slowly, to life. To withdraw her from this spectacle of death was my first care. She suffered herself to be led to the farm house. She was carried to her chamber. For a time she appeared incapable of recollection. She grasped my hand, as I sat by her bedside, but scarcely gave any other tokens of life. From this state of inactivity she gradually recovered. I was actuated by a thousand forebodings, but refrained from molesting her by interrogation or condolence. I watched by her side in silence, but was eager to collect from her own lips, an account of this mysterious transaction. At length she opened her eyes, and appeared to recollect her present situation, and the events which led to it. I inquired into her condition, and asked if there were any thing in my power to procure or perform for her. O! my friend! she answered, what have I done; what have I suffered within the last dreadful hour? The remembrance, though insupportable, will never leave me. You can do nothing for my relief. All I claim is your compassion and your sympathy. I hope, said I, that nothing has happened to load you with guilt or with shame. Alas! I know not. My deed was scarcely the fruit of intention. It was suggested by a momentary frenzy. I saw no other means of escaping from vileness and pollution. I was menaced with an evil worse than death. I forbore till my strength was almost subdued; the lapse of another moment would have placed me beyond hope. My stroke was desperate and at random. It answered my purpose too well. He cast at me a look of terrible upbraiding, but spoke not. His heart was pierced, and he sunk, as if struck by lightning, at my feet. O much erring and unhappy Ormond! That thou shouldst thus untimely perish! That I should be thy executioner! These words sufficiently explained the scene that I had witnessed. The violence of Ormond had been repulsed by equal violence. His foul attempts had been prevented by his death. Not to deplore the necessity which had produced this act was impossible; but, since this necessity existed, it was surely not a deed to be thought upon with lasting horror, or to be allowed to generate remorse. In consequence of this catastrophe, arduous duties had devolved upon me. The people that surrounded me, were powerless with terror. Their ignorance and cowardice left them at a loss how to act in this emergency. They besought my direction, and willingly performed whatever I thought proper to enjoin upon them. No deliberation was necessary to acquaint me with my duty. Laffert was despatched to the nearest magistrate with a letter, in which his immediate presence was entreated, and these transactions were briefly explained. Early the next day the formalities of justice, in the inspection of the bodies and the examination of witnesses, were executed. It would be needless to dwell on the particulars of this catastrophe. A sufficient explanation has been given of the causes that led to it. They were such as exempted my friend from legal animadversion. Her act was prompted by motives which every scheme of jurisprudence known in the world not only exculpates, but applauds. To state these motives, before a tribunal hastily formed, and exercising its functions on the spot, was a task not to be avoided, though infinitely painful. Remonstrances, the most urgent and pathetic, could scarcely conquer her reluctance. This task, however, was easy, in comparison with that which remained. To restore health and equanimity to my friend; to repel the erroneous accusations of her conscience; to hinder her from musing, with eternal anguish, upon this catastrophe; to lay the spirit of secret upbraiding by which she was incessantly tormented; which bereft her of repose; empoisoned all her enjoyments, and menaced, not only the subversion of her peace, but the speedy destruction of her life, became my next employment. My counsels and remonstrances were not wholly inefficacious. They afforded me the prospect of her ultimate restoration to tranquillity. Meanwhile, I called to my aid, the influence of time and of a change of scene. I hastened to embark with her for Europe. Our voyage was tempestuous and dangerous, but storms and perils at length gave way to security and repose. Before our voyage was commenced, I endeavored to procure tidings of the true condition and designs of Ormond. My information extended no further, than that he had put his American property into the hands of Mr. Melbourne, and was preparing to embark for France. Courtland, who has since been at Paris, and who, while there, became confidentially acquainted with Martinette de Beauvais, has communicated facts of an unexpected nature. At the period of Ormond's return to Philadelphia, at which his last interview with Constantia, in that city, took place, he visited Martinette. He avowed himself to be her brother, and supported his pretensions, by relating the incidents of his early life. A separation, at the age of fifteen, and which had lasted for the same number of years, may be supposed to have considerably changed the countenance and figure she had formerly known. His relationship was chiefly proved, by the enumeration of incidents, of which her brother only could be apprized. He possessed a minute acquaintance with her own adventures, but concealed from her the means by which he had procured the knowledge. He had rarely and imperfectly alluded to his own opinions and projects, and had maintained an invariable silence, on the subject of his connexion with Constantia and Helena. Being informed of her intention to return to France, he readily complied with her request to accompany her in this voyage. His intentions in this respect, were frustrated by the dreadful catastrophe that has been just related. Respecting this event, Martinette had collected only vague and perplexing information. Courtland, though able to remove her doubts, thought proper to withhold from her the knowledge he possessed. Since her arrival in England, the life of my friend has experienced little variation. Of her personal deportment and domestic habits, you have been a witness. These, therefore, it would be needless for me to exhibit. It is sufficient to have related events, which the recentness of your intercourse with her hindered you from knowing, but by means of some formal narrative like the present. She and her friend only were able to impart to you the knowledge which you have so anxiously sought. In consideration of your merits and of your attachment to my friend, I have consented to devote my leisure to this task. It is now finished, and I have only to add my wishes, that the perusal of this tale may afford you as much instruction, as the contemplation of the sufferings and vicissitudes of Constantia Dudley has afforded to me. Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. TO ************ ***************. What could excite in you any curiosity as to my affairs? You once knew me a simple lad, plying the file and tweezers at the bench of a watchmaker, with no prospect before me but of laboring, for a few years at least, as a petty and obscure journeyman, at the same bench where I worked five years as an apprentice. I was sprung from obscurity, destitute of property, of parents, of paternal friends; was full of that rustic diffidence, that inveterate humility, which are alone sufficient to divert from us the stream of fortune's favors. Such was I three years ago! Now am I rich, happy, crowned with every terrestrial felicity, in possession of that most exquisite of all blessings, a wife, endowed with youth, grace, dignity, discretion. I do not, on second thoughts, wonder at your curiosity. It was impossible for me to have foreseen, absurd to have hoped for such a destiny. All that has happened, was equally beyond my expectations and deservings. You ask me, how all these surprising things came about? The enclosed letters, which I have put into a regular series, contain all the information you wish. The packet is a precious one; you will find in it a more lively and exact picture of my life, than it is possible, by any other means, to communicate. Preserve it, therefore, with care, and return it safely and entire, as soon as you have have read it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLARA HOWARD. LETTER I. To Clara Howard. New York, March 7. Why do I write? For whose use do I pass my time thus? There is no one living who cares a jot for me. There was a time, when a throbbing heart, a trembling hand, and eager eyes, were always prepared to read, and ruminate on the scantiest and poorest scribble that dropped from my pen; but she has disappeared; the veil between us is like death. Yet why should I so utterly despair of finding her? What all my toils may not accomplish, may be effected at a moment the least expected, and in a manner the least probable. I may travel a thousand miles north and south, and not find her. I may lingeringly and reluctantly give up the fruitless search, and return home. A few hours after, I may stroll, in a melancholy, hopeless mood, into the next street—and meet her. By such invisible threads is the unwitting man led through this maze of life! But how will she be met? Perhaps—horrid thought!— she may have become vile, polluted; and how shall I endure to meet her in that condition! One so delicate, carrying dignity to the verge—beyond the verge of pride; preferring to starve rather than incur contempt. But that degradation is impossible. Yet, if she dreaded not my censure, if she despaired not of my acquiescence in her schemes, why conceal from me her flight? Why not leave behind her a cold farewell. Could she be insensible to the torments and inquietudes, which her silence would entail upon me? Could she question the continuance and fervency of my zeal for your welfare? What have I done to estrange her heart, to awaken her resentment? She does not live with Sedley. That question Mr. Phillip's report has decided. At least she does not live with him as his wife. Impossible that Mary Wilmot should be allied to any man by a different tie. It is sacrilege so much as to whisper to one's heart the surmise. Yet have I not written it? Have I not several times pondered on it? What has so often suggested these frightful images? This mysterious, this impenetrable silence it is, that astounds and perplexes me—this evident desire, which her conduct betrayed, to be not sought after by me, and this departure in company with Sedley—the man whom so long a devotion, so many services, had not induced her to suffer his visits. To sever herself thus abruptly and for ever from me, to whom she had given all her tenderness, with whom she had divided all her cares, during years—to whom the marriage promise had been solemnly pledged, and trust herself, on some long and incomprehensible journey, with one whom she had thought it her duty to shun—to exclude, on all occasions, from her company—is beyond my comprehension. But I am tired of the pen already—of myself—of the world. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Ah, Clara! can so groundless a punctilio govern thee? The settled gloom of thy aspect; thy agitation, when too tenderly urged by me; thy tears, that, in spite of heroic resolutions, will sometimes find way, prove thy heart to be still mine. But I will urge thee, I will distress thee no more. Thy last words have put an end to my importunity. Can I ever forget them, or the looks and gestures with which they were spoken? "I never will be yours! Have I not heard all your pleas —all your reasonings? And am I not now furnished with all the means of a right judgment? I have listened to you twenty times upon this topic, and always patiently. Now listen to me. "I never will be yours, while Mary's condition is unknown. I never will be yours, while she is single; unmarried to another, and unhappy. I will have no intercourse with you. I will not grant you even my esteem, unless you search for her, find her, and oblige her to accept your vows. "There is now no obstacle on account of fortune. I have enough for several, and will give you half. All that my parents have, and you know they are rich, they will either divide between you and me, or will give entirely to me. In either case, competence, and even abundance, shall be hers and yours." * * * * * * * * * * 'Tis nine months since I first entered this house; not on the footing of a stranger or a guest, but of a child. Yet my claims upon my revered friend are not filial. He loves me, because all the virtues I possess are of his own planting and rearing. He that was once the pupil has now become the son. How painful and how sweet is the review of the past year! How benign were the auspices under which I entered this house! Commended to the confidence and love of their daughter, treated with complacency, at first; then with confidence by that daughter; and, finally, honored with her love. And yet, a single conversation—the mention of one unhappy name, has reversed totally my condition. I am still beloved by Clara; but that passion produces nothing but her misery and mine. I must go, she tells me; and duty tells me that I must go in search of the fugitive. I will not rest till I have ascertained her destiny. Yet I can forebode nothing but evil. The truth, whatever it be, will avail me nothing. I set out to-morrow; meanwhile Clara shall have this scribble; perhaps she will not spurn it. Wilt thou, Clara? Thou once lovedst me; perhaps, dost love me still; yet of that I must entertain some doubts. I part with thee tomorrow, perhaps, for ever. This I will put into thy hands at parting. Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER II. To Clara Howard. Hatfield, March, 20. You knew my intention to stop, a few days, at this place, to see my sisters, and my old friend. I promised to write to you, and inform you of my welfare. I gave the promise with coldness and reluctance, because I predicted that no benefit would flow to either from our correspondence. Will you believe that I was a little sullen at our parting; that your seeming cheerfulness was construed by my perverse heart into something very odious? The words inhuman and insensible girl rose to my lips, and had like to have been uttered aloud. I did not reflect, that, since you have resolved to pursue a certain path, my regard for you, if unmixed with selfishness, should prompt me to wish, that you may encounter as few asperities as possible, and to rejoice at the easiness of a sacrifice, which, whether difficult or easy, must be made. I had not left you a day, before my inconstant disposition restored me to my virtuous feelings. I repented of the coldness with which I had consented to your scheme of correspondence, and tormented myself with imagining those pangs which my injustice must have given you. I determined to repair my fault as quickly as possible; to write to you often, and in a strain worthy of one who can enter into your feelings, and estimate, at its true value, the motive which governs your actions. I have, indeed, new and more urgent motives for writing. I arrived at this hospitable mansion late in the evening. I have retired, for the first time, to my chamber, and have instantly taken up my pen. The nature of the tidings I send will justify my haste. I will relate what has happened, without further preface. I approached my friend's door, and lifted the latch without giving any signal of my approach. I found the old gentleman, seated with his pipe, near the fire, and looking placidly on the two girls, who were busy at draughts, for which they 2 had made squares on the pine table, with chalk, and employed yellow and red grains of corn in place of pawns. They started at my entrance, and seeing who it was, threw themselves into my arms, in a transport of surprise and delight. After the first raptures of our meeting had passed, Mr. Hickman said to me—"Well, my boy, thou hast come just in time. Godfrey Cartwright has just carried away letters for thee. He goes to town tomorrow, and I gave him a packet that has lain here for some time, to put into the office for thee." "A packet? For me? From whom?" "When thou knowest the truth, thou wilt be apt to blame us a little, for our negligence; but I will tell thee the whole affair, and thou shalt judge how far we are culpable. A week ago, I was searching the drawers in my cherry-tree desk, for the copy of a bond which old Duckworth had placed in my hands for safe keeping, when I lighted on a bulky packet, sealed up, and inscribed with thy name. I thought it strange, that a paper of that kind should be found in my possession, and looked at it again and again, before I could comprehend the mystery. At last I noticed in the corner, the words `By Mr. Cartwright.' Cartwright, thou knowest, is the man we employ to take and bring letters to and from the city. Hence, I supposed it to be a packet brought by him on some occasion, and left here for thee; but by whom it was received, when it was brought, and how it should chance to repose in this drawer, I could not guess. I mentioned the affair to my sister, but she had no knowledge of the matter. At length, after examining the packet and comparing circumstances, she gradually recollected its history. " `Alack-a-day!' cried she, `I do remember something of it now. Cartwright brought it here, just the same evening of the very day that poor Philip left here and went to town. I remember I put it into that drawer, supposing that to be as good a place as any to keep it safe in, till we should hear from the lad, and have some inkling whereabouts to send it to him; but, as I am a living soul, I forgot all about it from that day to this.' "Such is the history of your packet, which, you see, was mislaid through accident and my sister's bad memory." This packet instantly connected itself, in my fancy, with the destiny of poor Mary. It came hither nearly at the time of her flight from Abingdon. It, no doubt, came from her, and contained information of unspeakable moment to our mutual happiness. When I reflected on the consequences of this negligence, I could scarcely restrain my impatience. I eagerly inquired for the packet. "Not a half-hour ago," said Hickman, "I delivered it to Cartwright, with directions to put it into the post-office for New York. He sets out early in the morning, so that thou wilt receive it on thy return to New York." Cartwright lives five miles from this house. The least delay was intolerable; and, my horse not being yet unsaddled, I mounted him immediately, and set out, in spite of expostulation and entreaty. The night was remarkably gloomy and tempestuous, and I was already thoroughly fatigued; but these considerations were forgotten. I arrived at Cartwright's hovel, in less than an hour, and having gotten the packet, I returned with equal despatch. Immediately after, I retired to my chamber, and opened the packet, on which I instantly recognized the well known hand of Miss Wilmot. I will wave all comments, and send you the letter. To Philip Stanley. Abington, Nov. 11. I need not tell you, my friend, what I have felt, in consequence of your silence. The short note which I received, a fortnight after you had left me, roused my curiosity and my fears, instead of allaying them. You promised me a longer account of some mysterious changes that had taken place in your condition. This I was to receive in a few days. At the end of a week I was impatient. The promised letter did not arrive. Four weeks passed away, and nothing came from you. Your packet has at last put an end to suspense; but why did you not send it sooner? Why not send me your story piecemeal; or, at least, tell me, in half a line, how you were employed, and what occasioned your delay? Why did you not come yourself? Philip, I am displeased; I was going to say angry with you. You have sported with my feelings. I ought to lay down my pen while I am in this humor. The pangs your negligence has given me, have not yet been soothed to rest, and when I find that so much unhappiness has been given through mere heedlessness, I can scarcely keep my patience. I was sitting on a bench in the garden, when a country lad entered the enclosure. As soon as I caught a glimpse of him, and observed that his attention was fixed upon me, and his right hand already in his pocket, my heart whispered that he was the bearer of tidings from you. I attempted to rise and meet him, but my knees trembled so much, that I was obliged to give up my design. He drew forth his packet and threw it into my lap, answering, at the same time, my inquiries respecting you, by telling me that you were well, and that you had been busy, for a long time, night and day, in writing that there letter to me. He had stopt a moment to give it, and could not stay, but merely to receive three lines from me, informing you of my health. You do not deserve the favor. Besides, my fingers partake the fluttering of my heart. A tumult of joy and vexation overpowers me. But, though you do not merit it, you shall have a few lines. This paper was spread upon my lap, and I had taken the pen to write to my aunt Bowles, but I will devote it to you, though my tremors, you see, will scarcely permit me to write legibly. Your messenger chides my lingering; and I will let him go with nothing but a verbal message, for, on second thoughts, I will defer writing till I have read your long letter. Nov. 15. Yes; the narrative of Morton is true. The simple recital which you give, leaves me no doubt. The money is his, and shall be restored the moment he demands it. For what I have spent, I must a little while be his debtor. This he must consent to lose, for I never can repay it. Indeed, it is not much. Since my change of fortune, I have not been extravagant. A hundred dollars is the most I have laid out, and some of this has been in furniture, which I shall resign to him. Be under no concern, my friend, on my account. Think not how I shall endure the evils of my former condition, for I never shall return to it. Thy Mary is hastening to the grave with a very quick pace. That is her only refuge from humiliation and calamity, and to that she looks forward with more confidence than ever. I was not fashioned of stubborn materials. Poverty, contempt, and labor, are a burden too great for me. I know, that for these only am I reserved, and this interval of better prospects was no comfort to me. I always told you my brother had no just claim to this money, and that the rightful claimant would sooner or later appear. You were more sanguine, and were willing to incur, even on grounds so imperfect, the irrevocable obligations of marriage. See into what a gulf your rashness would have hurried you, and rejoice that my obstinacy insisted on a delay of half a year. You know my motives for accepting, and on what conditions I accepted your proffered vows. I have never concealed from you my love. What my penetration easily perceived, your candor never strove to conceal. Your indifference, your freedom from every thing like passion, was not only to be seen in your conduct, but was avowed by your lips. I was not so base as to accept your hand, without your heart. You talked of gratitude, and duty, and perfect esteem. I obtained, you told me, your entire reverence, and there was no female in the world whom you loved so much. It was true that you did not love me, but you preferred me to all other women. Union with me was your supreme desire. Your reason discerned and adored my merits, and the concurrence of the heart could not but follow. Fondly devoted to you as I was, and urged as these arguments were, with pathetic eloquence, I could not be deceived for more than a moment. My heart was filled with contradictory emotions. I secretly upbraided you for obduracy in withholding your love, while I, at the same time, admired and loved you the more for your generosity. Your conduct rendered the sacrifice of my happiness to yours the more difficult while it increased the necessity, 2* and enforced the justice of that sacrifice. I could not discover the probability, that marriage would give birth to that love which previous tenderness and kindness had been unable to produce. I doubted not your fidelity, and that the consciousness of conferring happiness would secure your contentment; but I felt that this was insufficient for my pride, if not for my love. I sought your happiness. To be the author of it was the object of inexpressible longings. To be happy without you was impossible; but the misery of loneliness, however great, was less than that of being the spectator of your misery, or even that of defrauding you of the felicity attending marriage with a woman whom you could truly love. Meanwhile, our mutual poverty was itself an insurmountable bar to marriage. My brother's death put me in seeming possession of competence. Circumstances were now somewhat changed. If no claimant appeared, I should be able, by giving myself to you, to bestow upon the object of my love that good, the want of which nothing can compensate. There were no other means of rescuing your sisters and yourself from indigence and dependence. What I was willing to share with you, you would not share with me on any terms but those of wedlock. Too well did I see on what weak foundations was built this scheme of happiness. This property was never gained by my brother's own industry, and how could I apply to my own use what I could not doubt belonged to another, though that other should never appear to claim it at my hands. My reluctance was partly subdued by your urgency. I consented waveringly, and with a thousand misgivings, to be yours at the end of six months, if no one should appear, meantime, to make out a good title to this money. I listened to your arguments and suppositions, by which you would fain account for my brother's acquisition of so large a sum consistenly with honesty, and for his silence as to his possession of it. I was willing to be convinced, and consented to sacrifice my peace by marrying the man I loved, because this marriage would secure to him the competence which I could not enjoy alone. This end cannot now be effected. New reasons have sprung up for foregoing your affection, even had Morton perished at sea. A friend has returned to you, who is far more able to relieve your poverty than I should be. It is easy to see on what conditions this relief is intended to be given. He has a daughter, whom he deems worthy of his adopted son. He knows your merit, and cannot fail of perceiving that it places you on a level with the most accomplished of human beings. I see how it is. This Clara will be yours. That intelligence, that mein, that gracefulness, which rustic obscurity cannot hide, which the garb of a clown could never disguise, accompanied with the ardent commendations of her father, will fascinate her in a moment. I cannot hesitate what to wish, or how to act. That passion which a form, homely and uncouth like mine, tarnished and withered by drudgery and sorrow, and by comparative old age, for I am nine years older than you; which a mind, void of education, and the refinements of learned and polished intercourse, was incapable of weakening, cannot fail to be excited by the youth and beauty, the varied accomplishments and ineffable graces of this stranger. She will offer you happiness, and wealth, and honor, and you will accept them at her hands. As for me, I cannot be yours, because I am not my own. My resolution to be severed from you is unalterable; but this is not necessary to insure our separation. It cannot take place, even if all my wishes were in favor of it. Long before the expiration of the half year, I shall be removed beyond your reach. This is not the illusion of despair. I feel in my deepest vitals, the progress of death. Nature languishes within me, and every hour accelerates my decay. My friend, thou must not parley with me; thou must not afflict me with arguments or entreaties, by letters or visits. I must see thee, and hear from thee no more; but I know thy character too well to expect this from thee. As soon as thou receivest this letter, thou wilt hasten hither, and endeavor to shake my purpose. I am not doubtful of my own constancy, but I would save myself and thee from a trial that will answer no end. I shall leave this place early tomorrow. Whither I am going must never be told to thee. Thy pursuit and thy inquiries will be incessant and anxious, but the measures I have taken for eluding thy search will defeat all thy efforts. I know that these assurances will not dissuade thee from making them, and I sorrow to reflect on the labors and anxieties to which thou wilt subject thyself for my sake; but I shall derive consolation from the belief that my retreat will never be discovered. I inclose an order on the bank for the money that remains in it, drawn in favor of Morton, and an assignment to him of the few tables and chairs that furnish my lodgings here. These thou wilt faithfully deliver into his hands. I likewise return you your papers and letters. And now—Philip—best and most beloved of men!— and is it come to this? Must I bid thee farewell for ever? Do not, I beseech thee, think hardly of me for what I have done. Nothing but a sense of duty, nothing but a supreme regard to thy happiness, could suggest my design. I cannot falter in the execution, since I could not waver in the sense of my duty. I am ashamed of my weakness, that hinders me from pronouncing my last farewell. Make haste to forget the unhappy Mary; make haste to the feet of your new friend, and to secure that felicity which an untoward fate denied me the power of bestowing. My friend, my benefactor, farewell. Mary.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER III. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, March 24. I write to you, in a mood not very well suited to the business. I am weary and impatient. The company which surrounds me is alien to my temper and my habits. I want to shut out the tokens of their existence—to forget where I am, and restore myself to those rapturous scenes and that blissful period, which preceded my last inauspicious meeting with Morton. I write to you, and yet I have nothing to say that will please you. My heart overflows with bitterness. I would pour it out upon you, and yet my equity will only add new keenness to my compunction, when I come to review what I have written. I am disposed to complain. I want an object to whom to impute my disasters, and to gratify my malice by upbraiding. There is a kind of satisfaction in revenge that I want to taste. I want to shift my anxieties from my own shoulders to those of another who deserves the burden more than I. Your decision has made me unhappy. I believe your decision absurd, yet I know your motives are disinterested and heroic. I know the misery which adherence to your schemes costs you. It is only less than my own. Why then should I aggravate that misery? It is the system of nature that deserves my hatred and my curses—that system which makes our very virtues instrumental to our misery. But chiefly my own folly have I to deplore—that folly which made me intrust to you the story of Miss Wilmot, bofore the bonds had been formed which no after repentance could break. I ought to have forgotten her existence. I ought to have claimed your love and your hand. You would have bestowed them upon me, and my happiness would have been placed beyond the reach of caprice. What has wrought this change in my thoughts? I set out from Hatfield with a heart glowing with zeal for the poor Mary. I burnt with impatience to throw myself at her feet, and tender her my vows. This zeal, time has extinguished. I call to mind the perfections of another. I compare them with those of the fugitive. My soul droops at the comparison, and my tongue would find it impossible to utter the vows, which my untoward fate may exact from me. Yet there is no alternative. I must finish the course that I have begun. I must conjure up impetuosity and zeal in this new cause. I must act and speak with the earnestness of sincerity, and the pathos of hope; otherwise I shall betray my cause, and violate my duty. Alas! it is vain to deny it, my powers are not equal to the task. I have inquired at the house where Mrs. Vallentine formerly lived. A new family are there, and no intelligence of the former tenant can be gained from them. This lady has friends, no doubt, in the city; but I know them not. It is chance alone that can give me their company. My efforts are languid, and my prospects dim. I shall stay here for as short a time as possible, and then proceed to Virginia. I will not rest till I have restored to Mary her own. This money shall be faithfully delivered. To add my heart to the gift is impossible. With less than my affections she will never be satisfied, and they are no longer mine to bestow, Having performed this duty, what will remain for me. My future destiny it will be your province to prescribe. I shall cease, however, to reason with you, or to persuade. Decide agreeably to your own conception of right, and secure to yourself happiness, even by allotting misery, banishment, or death, to Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IV. To Philip Stanley. New York, March 26. If I thought the temper which dictated your last letter would continue beyond the hour or the night, I should indeed be unhappy. My life has known much sorrow, but the sharpest pangs will be those arising from the sense of your unworthiness. In my eyes, marriage is no sensual or selfish bargain. I will never vow to honor the man who deserves only my contempt; and my esteem can be secured only by a just and disinterested conduct. Perhaps esteem is not the only requisite to marriage. Of that I am not certain; but I know that it is an indispensable requisite to love. I cannot love any thing in you but excellence. Infatuation will render you hateful or pitiable in my eyes. I shall hasten to forget you, and for that end shall estrange myself from your society, and drop your correspondence. You know what it is that reason prescribes to you with regard to Miss Wilmot. If you cannot ardently and sincerely seek her presence, and find, in the happiness which she will derive from a union with you, sufficient motives to make you zealously solicit that union, you are unworthy not merely of my love, but of my esteem. Henceforth I will know you not. Let me not have reason to charge you with hypocrisy, or to consider your love for me as the mere child of sensuality and selfishness. You have often told me that you desire my happiness above all things—that you love me for my own sake. Your sincerity and rectitude are now put to the test. Do not belie your professions, by a blind and unjust decision. Allow me to judge in what it is that my happiness consists, and prove your attachment to me by promoting my happiness. Misguided friend! What is it you want? To gain your end by exciting my pity? Suppose the end should be thus accomplished; suppose I should become your wife, merely to save your life, to prevent hazards and temptations to which my rejection might expose you. Mournful, indeed, full of anguish and of tears, would be the day which should make me your bride. My act would be a mere submission to humiliating and painful necessity. I should look to reap from such an alliance, nothing but repinings and sorrow. By soliciting my hand, by consenting to ratify a contract made on such principles, you would irretrievably forfeit my esteem. My condition would be the most disastrous that can betide a human being. I should be bound, beyond the power of loosening my bonds, to one whom I despised. I am, indeed, in no danger of acting upon these principles. I shall never so little consult my own dignity and yours, as to accept your hand through compassion. I am not unacquainted with the schemes which your foolish despondency has suggested to you. I know very well what alternatives you have sometimes resolved to offer me; of compliance with your wishes, or of banishing you to the desert, and dissolving that connexion between my father and you, which is so advantageous to yourself and your sisters. Fie upon you! Even to have entertained such thoughts fixes a stain upon your character not easily effaced. Nothing but the hope that the illusion is transitory, and that sober reflection will, in a short time, relieve you from the yoke of such cowardly and ignoble designs, prevents this from being the last token of friendship you will ever receive from Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER V. To Miss Howard. Philadelphia, March 28. Clara, thou hast conquered me. I see the folly of my last letter, and deplore it. It, indeed, merited the indignation and the scorn which it has received. Never shall you again be grieved and provoked by the like folly. I am now master of my actions and my thoughts, and will steadily direct them to a single purpose, the pursuit of the poor Mary, and the promotion of her happiness. How inconsistent and capricious is man! Today, his resolutions and motives are as adverse to those of yesterday, as those of one man can be, at any time and in any situation, to those of another. Yesterday! Heaven preserve me from a repetition of the same thoughts! I shudder on looking back upon the gulf, on the brink of which I was tottering. How could I so utterly forget my own interest; the regard due to the woman who truly loves me; to my sisters and my noble friend? But the humiliation is now past. I think it is; I am sure it is. I am serene, resolute, and happy. The remorse my errors have produced is now at an end. Better thoughts, resolutions worthy of your pupil and your friend have succeeded. Not that my past feelings have been, perhaps, quite as culpable as you describe them. My repinings were drawn from fallacious sources, but they were not wholly selfish. I imagined you loved me; that my alliance with another, however sanctioned by your judgment, would produce some regret. Believing your judgment misinformed, believing these regrets to be needless, I was not willing to create them. I need not say that this was all my reluctance. That would be false; but as they partly originated hence, my feelings were not wholly selfish; and if I may judge of my own emotions, surely you wrong me in calling my passion by the odious name of sensual. But these things are past. You have not done me justice; and in return, I have imputed to you feelings, of which you knew nothing. Henceforth, my conduct shall convince you that I cannot stoop to solicit that boon from your pity, which is refused by your love. Conjugal claims and enjoyments are mutual. The happiness received is always proportioned to that conferred. A wretch, worthy of eternal abhorrence, must he be, and endowed with tygerlike ferocity, who seeks and is contented with the person, while the heart is averse or indifferent. Such a one, believe me, Clara, am not I. On Tuesday, I expect to despatch all my concerns in this city, and to proceed southward. Adieu, Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VI. To Philip Stanley. New York, April 1. There is an obscurity in your letter, my friend, that I cannot dispel. The first part afforded me much pleasure, but the sequel disappointed me. You seem to have strangely misconstrued my meaning. Whether this misconstruction be real or pretended, it does not become me to enter into any explanation. If it be real, it affords a proof of a narrow and ungenerous heart, a heart incapable of perceiving the possibility of sacrificing its own personal gratification to that of another, and of deriving, from that very sacrifice, a purer and more lasting felicity. It shews you unable to comprehend that the welfare of another may demand selfdenial from us, and that in bestowing benefits on others, there is a purer delight than in gratifications merely selfish and exclusive. You question my love, because I exhort you to do your duty, and to make another happy that is worthier than I. Why am I anxious for that other and for you? Why should 3 I rejoice in your integrity, and mourn for your degradation? Why should I harbor such glowing images of the bliss which your Mary would derive from a union with you? Would not my indifference and negligence on these heads, would not my ardor to appropriate your affections to myself, prove me to be—there is no name sufficiently abhorrent and contemptuous for such a heart. And yet, such is the deportment you expect from me! Any thing but this will prove me to be indifferent, or averse to you! Desist, I beseech you, in time. If you proceed thus, quickly will you lose what remains of that esteem which I once felt for you. Instead of earnestly promoting your alliance with Miss Wilmot, I shall anxiously obstruct it, on account of your unworthiness. If this misconstruction be pretended only, if you mean to assail, by this new expedient, my imaginary weakness; if you imagine, that in order to remove an unjust imputation from my character, I will do what will make me really culpable; if you imagine that I shall degrade myself in my own estimation, merely for the purpose of raising myself in yours, you have grossly deceived yourself. Formerly you talked, with much self-complacency, of the trials to which I had subjected my fortitude, and consoled yourself with thinking that adhering to my new scheme was productive of misery. I say, that you consoled yourself with this reflection. In your eyes, my character was estimable in proportion to the reluctance with which I performed what was just. Your devotion to me was fervent in proportion as the performance of my duty was attended with anguish and suffering! Philip, are you, indeed, so sordid as to reason in this manner? Are you so blind as to account this the surest road to my esteem? Are you not ashamed of your infatuation and absurdity? I need not disguise or deny my unhappiness from any pity to you, or through the value which I set on your esteem. You exult in proportion to my misery. You revere me in proportion as my sentiments are mean and selfish! I am to be upbraided and despised, in proportion to the fulness of that enjoyment, which the approbation of my conscience, the sense of doing right myself, and of conferring good on others, has given me! Let me constantly hear from you, respecting your movements. I am in hopes that time and reflection will instil into you better principles. Till then, I shall not be displeased, if your letter be confined to a mere narrative of your journey. Adieu, Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VII. To Philip Stanley. New York, April 5. You were to leave Philadelphia on Tuesday, you told me. I imagined the interval would be engrossed with business, and therefore expected not to hear from you, till after that day; but that day, and the whole week is past, and no tidings. This silence does not proceed from sullenness—I hope, I persuade myselfit does not. Whatever anger you conceived against me, let not that, I entreat you, make you ungrateful to my father, cruel to your sisters, unjust to yourself. Letters have been hourly expected from you, relative to concerns which you had in charge. Have you neglected them? Have you betrayed your trust? Have you suffered an unmanly dejection to unfit you for this charge? Have you committed any rashness? Heaven forbid! Yet, what but some fatal event has occasioned this delay! Perhaps, while I thus write to you, you are— Let me not think of it. I shiver with a deadly cold at the thought. Thou art fiery and impetuous, my friend. Thy spirit is not curbed by reason. There is no outrage on discretion—no crime against thyself, into which thy headlong spirit may not hurry thee. Perhaps, my last letter was harsh, unjust. My censures were too bitter. I made not suitable allowances for your youth—the force of that attachment which you own for me. Knew I so little of my own nature, and the illusions of passion, as to expect you to act and speak with perfect wisdom? Would to Heaven I had not written that letter, or that I had sufficiently considered its contents before I sent it. It was scribbled hastily, in a moment of resentment. Of that which I so hastily censured in you, I was guilty myself. I ought to have staid till cool reflection had succeeded. But, perhaps, we torment ourselves needlessly. It is said, that the late storms have overflowed the rivers, swept away the bridges, and flooded the roads. Perhaps your letters are delayed from this cause. Perhaps the ways have been impassable. Mr. Talbot has been abroad during the morning. We expect him to return presently. He may bring us letters. * * * * * * * * * * No intelligence yet received! I am excessively uneasy. Your friend is displeased. He is almost ready to repent the confidence he has placed in you. Nothing can justify your silence. Your sickness should not hinder you from informing him of certain transactions. Their importance required you to give him early notice of any disaster that might befall you, and common produce would enjoin you to take measures for conveying this intelligence by the hands of others, in case of your incapacity. The coming of the post has been interrupted only for one day. The reason why we have not heard from you, can only be your not having written. My thoughts are too much disturbed to permit me to write any more. I will lay down the pen and despatch this; perhaps it may find you, and produce some effect. Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VIII. To Miss Howard. Schuylkill, April 10. I write to you by the hand of another. Be not greatly surprised or alarmed. Perhaps my strength is equal to the performance of this duty for myself; but my good friend, and affectionate nurse, Mrs. Aston, insists upon guiding the pen for me. She sits by my side, and promises to write whatever I dictate. My theme is of an interesting and affecting nature. Perhaps it might appear to you improper to employ any hand but my own. Circumstances must apologize for me. I cannot hold the pen; the friend, whose hand I employ, deserves my affection and gratitude. On her discretion I can rely. Besides, I am now approaching a bourne where our scruples and reserves usually disappear. The suggestions of self interest, and the calculations of the future are sure to vanish at the approach of death. When I wrote you last, I told you my intention to leave the city on Tuesday. I afterwards received your letter. Your censure was far more severe than my conscience told me I deserved. But my own heart did not secure me from regret. I was highly culpable to allow my peace to be molested by the tenor of your letter. In different circumstances, I should certainly conceal from you its effect upon my feelings. I intended to have concealed them from you. I perceived that, with respect to you, I was thenceforth to regard myself as a stranger and an outcast, and resolved that you should see me and hear from me no more. In embracing this scheme, I found no tranquillity. Clara, I loved you, and that love led me to place my supreme happiness in the possession of your heart. For this you call me sensual and selfish. This at least convinced me of one thing—that the happiness which I formed to myself is beyond my reach! It behoved me, doubtless, to dismiss all fruitless repinings, as well as to forbear all unprofitable efforts. My courage was equal to the last, but not to the first. Though the confession will degrade me still lower in your opinion, it is now no time to prevaricate or counterfeit; and I will not hide from you my anguish and dejection. These did not unfit me for performing my duty to your father, but they banished health and repose from my pillow. I set out on Tuesday morning, for Baltimore. The usual floods of this season having carried away the bridge on the Schuylkill, we prepared to pass it in a boat. The horses which drew the stage being unaccustomed to this mode of 3* conveyance, and being startled by the whirlpools and eddies, took fright, when the boat had gained the middle of the river, and suddenly rushed out at the further end into the stream. All the passengers, except two females, had dismounted from the carriage before it entered the boat. The air was extremely cold, and a drizzling shower was falling. These circumstances induced the father of the two girls, who was one of our company, to dissuade them from alighting, as he imagined no danger would arise during the passage. Happily the passengers and boatmen were behind the carriage; so that, in rushing forward, the horses drew nothing after them but the coach and those in it. The coach and horses instantly sunk. The curtains, on all sides, had been lowered and fastened; but the rushing waters burst the fastenings, and by a miraculous chance, the two females, who sat on one seat behind, were extricated in a moment from the poles and curtains. The coach sunk to the bottom, but the girls presently rose to the surface. I threw off my upper and under coat in a moment, and watching the place of their reappearance, plunged into the water, and by the assistance of others, lifted one breathless corpse into the boat. Meanwhile, the father, more terrified, and less prudent, threw himself cloaked and encumbered as he was, into the water, to save his children. Instead of effecting this, he was unable to save himself. No one followed my example in plunging into the river, and the father and one of his children perished together. The immediate consequence of this exposure, in a feverish state of my frame, was a violent ague, which gave place to a high fever and delirium. I stopt at the inn on the opposite bank, to change my wet clothes for dry; but, having done this, was unable to proceed, and betook myself to my bed. I suspected nothing more than an intermittent, which, however violent during its prevalence, would pass away in less than an hour. In this I was mistaken. My understanding was greatly disturbed. I had no remembrance of the past, or foresight of the future. All was painful confusion, which has but lately disappeared. Clear conceptions have returned to me, but my strength is gone, and I feel the cold of death gradually gaining on my heart. My force of mind is not lessened. I can talk and reason as coherently as ever; and my conclusions are far more wise than while in perfect health. The family of Mr. Aston, residing in this neighborhood, hearing of my condition, have afforded me every succor and comfort I needed. It was not till this moment that I have been able to employ the suitable means of conveying to you tidings of these events. Your letter has just been brought me from the post-office, and my good friend, who now holds the pen, and who has watched by my pillow during my sickness, was good enough to read it to me. What shall I say? To one regarding me as selfish and unjust; as even capable of villany and foul ingratitude; who among so many conjectures, as to the cause of my silence, was ready to suspect me of breach of faith, the low guilt of embezzlement! what shall I say? Nothing; I can say nothing. The prayers of a dying man for thy felicity, Clara, will, at least, be accepted as sincere. There is no personal motive to vitiate this prayer. Thy happiness must, henceforth, be independent of mine. I can neither be the author nor partaker of it. Be thou, lovely and excellent woman! be happy! I break off here, to write to your father. I have much to say to him which another day, perhaps another hour, may for ever prevent me from saying. Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IX. To Philip Stanley. New York, April 12. My father carries you this. The merciful God grant that he may find you alive! Philip, is it impossible for you to forgive me? But I deserve it not. I have lost you for ever! My wickedness and folly merited no less. My father smiles, and says there is hope. He vows to find you out; to restore you to health, to bring you back to us alive and happy. Good God! what horrible infatuation was it that made me write as I did! If thou diest, just—just will be my punishment. Never more will I open my eyes to the light. My father, my mother, will not suffer me to go to thee— to see thee once more; to receive thy last sigh; to clasp thy cold remains; to find my everlasting peace in the same grave. They will not hearken to me; they will not suffer me to go. In my frantic thoughts, I ran to the water's edge. I was stepping into the boat to cross the river, determined to see thee ere a new day returned, but I was pursued. I am detained by force; by entreaties more powerful than bonds and fetters. I need not go. Thou art gone for ever. My prayer for forgiveness thou canst not hear. Heaven has denied me the power to repair the wrongs that I have done thee. To expiate my folly, to call thee back to my bosom, and to give my stubborn heart to thy possession, cannot be for the wretched Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER X. To Mrs. Howard. Philadelphia, April 14. I have been here thirty hours, and have not written to you. I know your impatience, and that of your girl; but, till this hour, I was unable to give you information that would relieve your fears. Philip was, indeed, ill. I found him in a state wholly desperate. He had not strength to lift his eye-lids at my approach, or to articulate a welcome. I found in his chamber his nurse and his physician. The former is a young lady, newly married, who resides in this neighborhood, and a sister of the person whom our pupil saved from drowning. She has paid him the kindest and most anxious attention. Let me hasten to tell you that the crisis has passed, and terminated favorably. A profound sleep of ten hours has left him free from pain and fever, though in a state of weakness which could not be carried beyond its present degree without death. Set your hearts at rest. The lad is safe. I promised to bring him back alive and well, and will certainly fulfil my promise; but some weeks must elapse before he will be fit for the journey. You must wait with patience till then. Farewell. Yours, very sincerely, E. Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XI. To Philip Stanley. New York, April 15. To describe the agony which my father's silence produced, both to my mother and myself, would be useless. Thanks to my God, you art out of danger. I can now breathe with freedom. Tell me, beloved Philip, by your own hand, or, if your weakness will not suffer it, by that of your friend, that you forgive me. Oh that I were not at this unfriendly distance from you! that I could pour out the tears of my remorse, of my gratitude, of my love, upon your hand! I am jealous of your lovely nurse; she is performing those functions which belong to me. You are grateful for her services, are you not? Not more so than I am. Give her my fervent thanks—but stay, I will give them myself. I will write to her immediately, tell her of the obligations she had laid upon me, and solicit her friendship. She is an angel, I am sure. Prithee, my friend, make haste and be well, and fly to us. The arms of thy Clara are open to receive thee. She is ready to kneel to thee for pardon; to expiate her former obduracy by tears of gratitude and tenderness. Lay on my past offences what penalty thou wilt; the heavier it be, the more cheerfully shall I sustain it; the more adequate it will be to my fault. Mary—my heart droops when I think of her. How imperfect are schemes of human felicity! May heaven assist me in driving from my mind the secret conviction, that her claim to your affection is still valid. Alas! how fleeting is our confidence! Come to me, my friend. Exert all thy persuasive cloquence. Convince me that I have erred in resigning thy heart and hand to another; in imagining the claim of Mary better than mine. I call upon thy efforts to rescue me from self-condemnation; but I call on thee without hope. My reason cannot be deceived. The sense of the injustice I have done her, will poison every enjoyment which a union with thee can afford me. Yet come. I repent not of my invitation. I retract not my promise. Make me irrevocably thine. I shall at least be happy while I forget her, and I will labor to forget her. Adieu. Yours, Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XII. To Miss Howard. Philadelphia, April 23. When you know my reason for not accompanying your father, you will approve of my conduct. I am once more in health, but could not, at this season, perform the journey without hazard. Meanwhile, some affairs remain to be transacted in this city, to which my strength is fully equal; and the assurance of your love has lulled all my cares to repose. In less than a week I will be with you. Rely upon my power to convince you that your present decision is just. If I had doubts of its rectitude, your offer, transporting as it is, would never be accepted. How little did you comprehend my character, in believing me capable of urging you to the commission of what I deemed wrong! And think you that even now I will accept your hand, unattended with the fullest concurrence of your reason? No; but I doubt not to obtain that concurrence. I will fly to you on the wings of transport, and armed with reasons which shall fully remove your scruples. These reasons, as well as a thousand affecting incidents, which have lately befallen me, I will reserve for our meeting. Meanwhile, place the enclosed portrait in your bosom. It is that of my nurse, Mrs. Aston. She sends it to you, and desires me to tell you that she has received your letter, and will answer it very shortly. Adieu. Yours, Philip Stanley. P. S. I stay at No. —, North Eighth Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIII. To Francis Harris. Philadelphia, April, 23. Do you wish for some account of my present situation? I will readily comply with your request. I am, indeed, in a mood, just now, extremely favorable to the telling of a long story. I have no companions in this city, and various circumstances, while they give me a few days solitude and leisure, strongly incline me likewise to ruminate and moralize on past adventures. When I last wrote to you, I told you my destiny had undergone surprising changes since we parted. I had then no leisure to enter into minute particulars. Alas! my friend, changes still more surprising have since occurred, but changes very different from those to which I then alluded. Then they were all benign and joyous; since, they have been only gloomy and disastrous. But how far must I go back to render my narrative intelligible? You went your voyage, if I mistake not, just after I was settled, with my uncle and sisters, in the neighborhood of Hatfield. I believe you were acquainted with the beginning, at least of my intercourse with Mr. Howard. I described to you, I believe, the dignified, grave and secluded deportment of that man; the little relish he appeared to have for the society around, and the flattering regards he bestowed on me. I was a mere country lad, with little education but what was gained by myself; diffident and bashful as the rawest inexperience could make me. He was a man of elevated and sedate demeanor; living, if not with splendor, yet with elegance; withdrawing, in a great degree, from the society of his neighbors; immersed in books and papers, and wholly given to study and contemplation. I shall never forget the occasion on which he first honored me with his notice; the unspeakable delight which his increasing familiarity and confidence, my admission to his house, and my partaking of his conversation and instructions, afforded me. I recollect the gradual disappearance, in his intercourse with me, of that reserve and austerity, which he still maintained to the rest of mankind, with emotions of gratitude and pleasure unutterable. He had reason to regard me, indeed, somewhat like his own son. I had no father; I had no property; there was no one among my own relations, who had any particular claim upon my reverence or affection. A thousand tokens in my demeanor, must have manifested a veneration for him next to idolatry. My temper was ardent and impetuous, and several little incidents occurred, during the many years that I frequented his house, that brought forth striking proofs of my attachment to him. I greedily swallowed his lessons, and remember how often his eyes sparkled, his countenance brightened into smiles, and his tongue lavished applause, on my wonderful docility and rapid progress. He shewed his affection for me, by giving his instructions, inquiring into my situation, and directing me in every case of difficulty that occurred; but he never offered to become my real father; to be at the expense of my subsistence, or my education to any liberal profession. Indeed, he was anxious to persuade me that the farmer's life was the life of true dignity, and that, however desirable to me property might be, I ought to entertain no wish to change my mode of life. That was a lesson which he was extremely assiduous to teach. He never gave me money, nor ever suffered the slightest hint to escape him that he designed to carry his munificence any farther than to lend me his company, his conversation, and his books. Indeed, in my attachment to him, there was nothing sordid or mercenary. It never occurred to me to reflect on this frugality, this limitation of his bounty. What he gave was, in my own eyes, infinitely beyond my merits; and instead of panting after more, I was only astonished that he gave me so much. Indeed, had I had wisdom enough to judge of appearances, I should have naturally supposed that there existed many others who had stronger claims upon his fortune than I had, and might actually enjoy his bounty. His family and situation were, indeed, wholly unknown to me and his neighbors. He was a native of Britain; had not been long in America; lived alone, and in affluence; was a man past the middle of life; enjoyed a calm, studious, and contemplative existence. This was the sum of all the knowledge I ever obtained of him. Indeed, my curiosity never carried me into stratagems or guesses, in order to discover what he did not voluntarily disclose, or what he was desirous to conceal. The mournful day of his departure from Hatfield, and from America, at last arrived. I never was taught to believe that he designed to pass his life in America. I naturally regarded him as merely a sojourner, but never inquired how long he meant to stay among us. When he told me, therefore, that he should embark in a week, I felt no surprise, though it was impossible to conceal my impatience and regret. I never felt a keener pang than his last embrace gave me. He parted from me with every mark of paternal tenderness. Yet he left nothing behind him as a memorial of his affection. Even the books that I had often read under his roof, some of which were my chief favorites, and would have been prized, for the donor's sake, beyond their weight in rubies, he carried away with him. Neither did he explain the causes of his voyage, or give me any expectation of seeing him again. My obligations to Mr. Howard cannot be measured. To him am I indebted for whatever distinguishes me from the stone which I turned up with my plough, or the stock which I dissevered with my axe. My understanding was awakened, disciplined, informed; my affections were cherished, exercised, and regulated by him. My heart was penetrated with a sentiment, in regard to him—perhaps it would be impious to call it devotion—the divinity only can claim that; yet this man was a sort of divinity to me—the substitute and representative of heaven, in my eyes, and for my good. I besought him to let me accompany him. I anxiously inquired whether I might cherish the hope of ever seeing him again? The first request he made me ashamed of ever having urged, by shewing me that I had sisters who needed my protection, and for whose sake I ought to labor to attain independence. His own destiny would be regulated by future events, but he deemed it most probable that we should never see each other more. 4 The melancholy inspired by this separation from one who was not only my best, but my sole friend, was not dissipated like other afflictions of youth, by the lapse of a few months. Being accompanied with absolute uncertainty as to his condition and place of residence, it produced the same effect that his death would have done. This melancholy, though no variety of scene could have effaced it, was, no doubt, aggravated by the cheerless solitude in which I was placed. The rustic life was wholly unsuitable to my temper and taste. My active mind panted for a nobler and wider sphere of action; and after enduring the inconveniences of my sequestered situation for some time, I, at length, bound myself apprentice to a watchmaker in the city. My genius was always turned towards mechanics, and I could imagine no art more respectable or profitable than this. Shortly after my removal to this city, I became acquainted with a young man by the name of Wilmot. There were many points of resemblance between us. We were equally fond of study and reflection, and the same literary pursuits happened to engage our passions. Hence a cordial and incessant intercourse took place between us. I suppose you know nothing of Wilmot. Yet possibly you have heard something of the family. They were of no small note in Delaware. Not natives of the country. The father was an emigrant, who brought a daughter and this son with him, when children, from Europe. He purchased a delightful place on the Brandywine, built a house, laid out gardens, and passed a merry life among horses, dogs, and boon companions. He died, at length, by a fall from his horse, when his daughter Mary was sixteen years of age, and the son four or five years younger. These children had been trained up in the most luxurious manner. The girl had been her own mistress, and the mistress of her father's purse, from a very early age. All the prejudices and expectations of an heiress were early and deeply imbibed by her; and her father's character had hindered her from forming any affectionate or useful friends of her own sex, while those who called themselves his friends were either merely jovial companions or cunning creditors. It very soon appeared that Wilmot's fortune had lasted just as long as his life. House, and land, and stock, were sold by auction, to discharge his numerous debts, and nothing but a surplus on the sale of the furniture remained to the heirs. Mary, after a recluse and affluent education, was thus left, at the inexperienced age of sixteen, friendless and forlorn, to find the means of subsistence for herself and her brother, in her own ingenuity and industry. It cannot be supposed that she escaped all the obvious and enervating effects of such an education. Her pride was sorely wounded by this reverse, but nature had furnished her with a vigorous mind, which made it impossible for her to sink, either into meanness or despair. She was not wise enough to endure poverty and straitened accommodations, and a toilsome calling, with serenity; but she was strenuous enough to adopt the best means for repairing the ills that oppressed her. She retired, with the wreck of her father's property, from the scene in which she had been accustomed to appear with a splendor no longer hers. Her sensibility found consolation in living obscure and unknown. For this end, she removed to this city, took cheap lodgings in the suburbs, and reduced all her expenses to the most frugal standard. With the money she brought with her, she placed her brother at a reputable grammar school; and her acquaintance, by very slow degrees, extending beyond her own roof among the good and considerate part of the community, she acquired, by the exercise of the needle, a slender provision for herself and her brother. The boy was a noble and generous spirit, and endowed with an ardent thirst of knowledge. He made a rapid progress in his learning, and at the age of sixteen, became usher in the school in which he had been trained. He was smitten with the charms of literature; and greatly to his sister's disappointment and vexation, refused to engage in any of those professions which lead to riches and honor. He adopted certain antiquated and unfashionable notions about the "grandeur of retreat," "honorable poverty," a studious life, and the dignity of imparting knowledge to others. The desk, bar, and pulpit, had no attractions for him. This, no doubt, partly arose from youthful timidity and self diffidence, and age might have insensibly changed his views. My intercourse with Wilmot introduced me, of course, to the knowledge of his sister. I usually met him at her lodgings. Sundays and all our evenings were spent together; and as Mary had few or no visitants, on her own account, she was nearly on the same footing of domestic familiarity with me, as with her brother. She was much older than I. Humiliation and anxiety had deeply preyed on her constitution, which had never been florid or robust, and made still less that small portion of external grace or beauty, which nature had conferred upon her. Dignity, however, was conspicuous in her deportment, and intelligence glowed in her delicate and pliant features. Her manners were extremely mild, her voice soft and musical, and her conversation full of originality and wisdom. The high place to which she admitted me in her esteem, and the pleasure she took in my company, demanded my esteem and gratitude in return. In a short time, she took place of her brother in my confidence and veneration. I never loved Mary Wilmot. Disparity of age, the dignity and sedateness of her carriage, and perhaps the want of personal attractions, inspired me with a sentiment very different from love. Yet there was no sacrifice of inclination which I would not cheerfully have made, in the cause of her happiness. Though union with her could not give me the raptures that fortunate love is said to produce, it was impossible to find them with another while she was miserable. I had no experience of the passions. I knew, and conversed with no woman but Mary, and imagined that no human being possessed equal excellences. I had no counter longing to contend with; and, to say truth, did not suspect that my regard for any woman, could possibly be carried further than what I felt for her. Mary's knowledge of the heart, the persuasion of her own defects, or her refined conception of the passions, made her less sanguine and impetuous. Her love was to be indisputably requited by a love as fervent, before she would permit herself to indulge in hopes of felicity, or allow me to esteem, in her, my future wife. Our mutual situation by no means justified marriage. Secure and regular means of subsistence were wanting, as I had, somewhat indiscreetly, bound myself to serve a parsimonious master, for a much longer period than was requisite to make me a proficient in my art. Meanwhile, there subsisted between us the most affectionate and cordial intercourse, such as was worthy of her love, and my boundless esteem. As long as the possibility of marriage was distant, this discord of feelings was of less moment. A very great misfortune, however, seemed to have brought it, for a time, very near. Wilmot embarked on the river, in an evil hour, and the boat being upset by a gust of wind, was drowned. The brother and sister tenderly loved each other, and this calamity was long and deeply deplored by the survivor. One unexpected good, however, grew out of this event. Wilmot was found to be credited in the bank of P. for so large a sum as five thousand dollars. You will judge of the surprise produced by such a discovery, when I tell you that this credit appeared to have been given above two years before Wilmot's death; that we, his constant and intimate associates, had never heard the slightest intimation of his possessing any thing beyond the scanty income of his school; that his expenses continued, till the day of his death, perfectly conformable to the known amount of this wretched income; and that no documents could be found among his papers, throwing any light on the mystery. I shall not recount the ten thousand fruitless conjectures that were formed to account for this circumstance. None was more probable than that Wilmot held this money for another. Mary was particularly confident of the truth of this conclusion, though to me it was not unembarrassed with difficulties, for why was no written evidence, no memorandum or letter, to be found respecting the trust? and why did he maintain so obstinate a silence on the subject to us, to whom he was accustomed to communicate every action and every thought? We endeavored to recollect Wilmot's conversation and deportment, at the time this money was deposited by him, in his own name, in the bank. This clue seemed to lead to some discovery. I well remembered a thoughtfulness, at that period, not usual in my friend, and a certain conversation, that took place between us, on the propriety of living on the bounty of others, when able to maintain ourselves by our own industry. I short, I was extremely willing to conclude that 4* this money had been a present to Wilmot, from some paternal friend of his family, or, perhaps, some kinsman from a distance. At all events, as this sum had lain undisturbed in the bank for two years, I saw no reason why it should not be applied to the purpose of subsistence, by his sister, to whom it now fully belonged. It was difficult to overcome her scruples. At length she determined to use as small a part as her necessities could dispense with, and to leave the rest untouched for half a year longer, when, if no claimant appeared, she might use it with less scruple. This half year of precaution expired, and nobody appeared to dispute her right. She now became extremely anxious to divide this sum, gratuitously, with me. To me, the only obstacle to marriage was, the want of property. This obstacle, if Mary Wilmot consented to bestow her hand where her heart had long reposed, would be removed. It was difficult, however, to persuade her to accept a man on whom she doated; but who, though urgent in his proffers, was not so deeply in love as herself. At length, she consented to be mine, provided, at the end of another half year, I should continue equally desirous of the gift. At this time I was become my own master, and having placed Mary in a safe and rural asylum at Abingdon, I paid a visit of a few weeks to my uncle near Hatfield. I had been here scarcely a fortnight, when, one evening, a stranger whom I had formerly known in my boyish days, as the son of a neighboring farmer, paid me a visit. This person had been abroad for several years, on mercantile adventures, in Europe and the West Indies. He had just returned, and after various ineffectual inquiries after Wilmot, with whom he had formerly been in habits of confidence, he had come to me, in the prosecution of the same search. After various preliminaries, he made me acquainted with the purpose of his search. The substance of his story was this;—After toiling for wealth, during several years, in different ports of the Mediterranean, he at length acquired what he deemed sufficient for frugal susbsistence in America. His property he partly invested in a ship and her cargo, and partly in a bill of exchange for five thousand dollars. This bill he transmitted to his friend Wilmot, with directions to reserve the proceeds till his arrival. He embarked, meanwhile, in his own vessel, sending, at the same time, directions to his wife, who was then at Glasgow, to meet him in America. Unfortunately the ship was wrecked on the coast of Africa; the cargo was plundered or destroyed by the savage natives, and he, and a few survivors, were subjected to innumerable hardships, and the danger of perpetual servitude. From this he was delivered by the agents of the United States, in consequence of a treaty being ratified between us and the government of Algiers. Morton was among the miserable wretches whose chains were broken on that occasion, and he had just touched the shore of his native country. His attention was naturally directed, in the first place, to the fate of the property transmitted to Wilmot. Wilmot, he heard, died suddenly. Wilmot's sister, his only known relation, was gone, nobody could tell whither. The merchant on whom his bills had been drawn, was partner in a Hamburgh house, to which he had lately returned. The ships in which he sent his letters had safely arrived. His bills had never been protested at any of the notaries, but all the written evidences of this transaction, that had remained in his own hands, had been buried, with his other property, in the waves. After some suspense, and much inquiry, he was directed to me, as the dearest friend of Wilmot, and the intended husband of his sister. You will see, my friend, that the mystery which perplexed us so long, was now at an end. The coincidence between the sum remitted, and that in our possession, and between the time of the probable receipt of the bills, and that of the deposit made by Wilmot at the bank, left me in no doubt as to the true owner of the money. I explained to Morton, with the utmost clearness and simplicity, every particular relative to this affair. I acknowledged the plausibility of his claim; assured him of Miss Wilmot's readiness, and even eagerness, to do him justice, and promised to furnish him, on his return to Philadelphia, with a letter, introducing him to my friend. We parted. This was a most heavy and unlooked for disappointment of all our schemes of happiness. My heart bled with compassion for the forlorn and destitute Mary. To be thus rescued from obscurity and penury, merely to have these evils augmented by the bitterness of disappointment, was a hard lot. I was just emancipated from my servitude. I was perfectly skilled in my art, but mere skill might supply myself with scanty bread, without enabling me to support a family. For that end, credit to procure a house, and the means of purchasing tools and materials, were necessary; but I knew not which way to look for them. My nearest relation was my uncle Walter, who had taken me and my sisters, in our infancy, into his protection, and had maintained the girls ever since. His whole property, however, was a small farm, whose profits were barely sufficient to defray the current expenses of his family. At his death, this asylum would be lost to us, as his son, who would then become the occupant, had always avowed the most malignant envy and rancorous aversion to us. As my uncle was old, and of a feeble constitution, and as the girls were still young and helpless, I had abundant theme on my own account, for uneasy meditation. To these reflections were added the miseries, which this reverse of fortune would bring down upon the woman whom I prized beyond all the world. One day, while deeply immersed in such contemplations as these, and musefully and mournfully pacing up and down the piazza of the inn at Hatfield, a chaise came briskly up to the door and stopped. I lifted my eyes, and beheld, alighting from it, a venerable figure, in whom I instantly recognised my friend and benefactor, Mr. Howard. The recognition was not more sudden on my side than on his, though a few years, at my age, were sufficient to produce great changes in personal appearance. Surprise and joy nearly deprived me of my senses, when he took me in his arms and saluted me in the most paternal manner. We entered the house, and as soon as I regained my breath, I gave utterance to my transports, in the most extravagant terms. After the first emotion had subsided, he informed me that the sole object of his present journey to Hatfield was a meeting with me. He had just arrived, with a wife and daughter, in America, where he designed to pass the rest of his days. It was his anxious hope to find me well and in my former situation, as he was now able to take the care of providing for me into his own hands. He inquired minutely into my history since we parted. I could not immediately conquer my reserve, on that subject nearest my heart; but in other respects, I was perfectly explicit. My narrative seemed not to displease him, and he condescended in his turn, to give me some insight into his own condition. I now discovered that he was sprung from the younger branch of a family, at once ancient and noble. He received an education more befitting his birth than his fortune; and had, by a thoughtless and dissipated life, wasted his small patrimony. This misfortune had contributed to tame his spirit, to open his eyes on the folly of his past conduct, and to direct him in the choice of more rational pursuits. He was early distinguished by the favorable regards of a lady of great beauty and accomplishments. This blessing he did not prize as he ought. Though his devotion to Clara Lisle was fervent, he suffered the giddiness of youth, and the fascinations of pleasure, to draw him aside from the path of his true interest. Her regard for him made her overlook many of his foibles, and induced her to try various means to restore him to virtue and discretion. These efforts met with various success, till at length, some flagrant and unexpected deviation, contrary to promises, and in defiance of her warnings, caused a breach between them that was irreparable. The head of the nobler branch of Mr. Howard's family was a cousin, a man of excellent, though not of shining character. He had long been my friend's competitor for the favor of Miss Lisle. The lady's friends were his strenuous advocates, and used every expedient of argument or authority, to subdue her prepossessions for another. None of these had any influence, while my friend afforded her any hopes of his reformation. His rashness and folly having, at length, extinguished these hopes, she complied, after much reluctance and delay, with the wishes of her family. This event, communicated by the lady herself in a letter to my friend, in which her motives were candidly stated, and the most pathetic admonitions were employed to point out the errors of his conduct, effected an immediate reformation. The blessing which he neglected or slighted, when within his reach, now acquired inestimable value. His regrets and remorses were very keen, and terminated in a resolution to convert the wreck of his fortune into an annuity, and retire for the rest of his life to America. This income, though small, was sufficient, economically managed, to maintain him decently, at such a village as Hatfield. His residence here, at a distance from ancient companions, and from all the usual incitements to extravagance, completed, in a few years, a thorough change in his character. He became, as I have formerly described him, temperate, studious, gentle, and sedate. The irksomeness of solitude was somewhat relieved by his acquaintance with me, and by the efforts which his growing kindness for poor Philip induced him to make for improving and befriending the lad. These efforts he imagined to be crowned with remarkable success, and gradually concentred all his social feelings in affection for me. He resolved to be a father to me while living, and to leave his few moveables, all he had to leave, to me, at his death. These prospects were somewhat disturbed by intelligence from home, that his cousin was dead. Eighteen years absence from his native country, and from Miss Lisle, had greatly strengthened his attachment to his present abode, but had not effaced all the impressions of his youth. The recollection of that lady's charms, her fidelity to him, in spite of the opposition of her family, and of his own demerits, her generous efforts to extricate him from his difficulties, which even proceeded so far, as to pay, indirectly, and through the agency of others, a debt for which he had been arrested, always filled his heart with tenderness and veneration. These thoughts produced habitual seriousness, gratitude to this benefactor, an ardent zeal to fulfil her hopes by the dignity of his future deportment; but was not attended with any anger or regret at her compliance with the prudent wishes of her family, and her choice of one infinitely more worthy than himself. At this he sincerely rejoiced, and felt a pang, at the news of that interruption to her felicity, occasioned by her husband's death. This event, however, came gradually to be viewed with somewhat different emotions. He began to reflect, that a tenderness so fervent as was once cherished for him, was not likely to be totally extinguished, by any thing but death. His cousin, though a man of worth, had been accepted from the impulse of generosity and pity, and not from that of love. She had been contented, and perhaps happy in her union with him; but, if her first passion was extinct, he imagined there would be found no very great difficulty in reviving it. Both were still in the prime of life, being under thirty eight years of age. The correspondence so long suspended, was now renewed between them; and Mr. Howard, with altered views, and renovated hopes, now embarked for that country which he had believed himself to have for ever abjured. This new state of his affairs by no means lessened his attachment to the fortunate youth, who had been for eight years the sole companion of his retirement; while his own destiny was unaccomplished, he thought it proper to forbear exciting any hopes in me. Should his darling purpose be defeated, he meant immediately to return. Should he meet with success, and his present views, as to the preference due to America, as a place of abode, continued, he meant to exert his influence with the elder and younger Clara, for his cousin had left behind him one child, a daughter, now in the bloom of youth, to induce them to emigrate. In every case, however, he was resolved the farmer-boy should not be forgotten. His projects were crowned, though not immediately, with all the success to be desired. The pair, whom so many years, and so wide an interval had severed, were now united, and the picture which Mr. Howard drew of the American climate and society, obtained his wife's consent to cross the ocean. "My dear Philip," said Mr. Howard to me, after relating these particulars, "I have a pleasure in this meeting with you, that I cannot describe. You are the son, not of my instincts, but of my affections and my reason. Formerly I gave you my advice, my instructions, and company, only because I had nothing more to give. Now I am rich, and will take care that you shall never be again exposed to the chances of poverty. Though opulent, I do not mean to be idle. He that knows the true use of riches, never can be rich enough; but my occupation will leave me leisure enough for enjoyment; and you, who will share my labor, shall partake liberally of the profit. For this end, I mean to admit you as an inseparable member of my family, and to place you, in every respect, on the footing of my son. "My family consists of my wife and her daughter. The latter is now twenty three, and you will be able to form a just conception of her person and mind, when I tell you, that in both respects, she is exactly what her mother was at her age. There is one particular, indeed, in which the resemblance is most striking. She estimates the characters of others, not by the specious but delusive considerations of fortune or birth, but by the intrinsic qualities of heart and head. In her marriage choice, which yet remains to be made, she will forget ancestry and patrimony, and think only of the morals and understanding of the object. Hitherto, her affections have been wholly free, but"—here Mr. Howard fixed his eyes with much intenseness and significance, on my countenance—"her parents will neither be grieved nor surprised, if, after a residence of some time under the same roof with her brother Philip, she should no longer be able to boast her freedom in that respect. If ever circumstances should arise to put my sincerity to the test, you shall never find me backward to convince you that I practise no equivocations and reserves, and prescribe no limitations or conditions, when I grant you the privilege of calling me father. "My stay with you at present must be short. I am going, on business of importance, to Virginia. I shall call here on my return, which I expect will be soon, and take you with me to New York, where I purpose to reside for some time. The interval may be useful to you, in settling and arranging your little matters, and equipping yourself for your journey." Such, my friend, was the result of this meeting with Mr. Howard. Every thing connected with this event was so abrupt and unexpected, that my mind was a scene of hurry and confusion, till his departure, next morning, left me at liberty to think on what had past. He left me with marks of the most tender affection, with particular advice in what manner to adjust my affairs, and with a promise of acquainting me by letter with all his motions. I waited with some impatience for Mr. Howard's return. Many things had dropped from him, in our short interview, on which I had now leisure to reflect. His views, with regard to me, could not fail to delight my youthful fancy. I was dazzled and enchanted by the prospect which he set before me, of entering on a new and more dignified existence, of partaking the society of beings like Mrs. Howard and her daughter, and of aiding him in the promotion of great and useful purposes. One intimation, however, had escaped him, which filled me with anxious meditations. The young Clara was the companion of his voyage hither. She had landed on this shore. To her presence and domestic intercourse, I was about to be introduced, and I was allowed to solicit her love. He was willing to bestow her upon me, and had, without doubt, gained the concurrence of her mother in this scheme. It was thus he meant to insure the felicity, and establish the fortune of his pupil. There is somewhat in the advantages of birth and rank, in the habit of viewing objects through the medium of books, that gives a sacred obscurity, a mysterious elevation, to human beings. I had been familiar with the names nobility and royality, but the things themselves had ever been shrouded in an awe creating darkness. Their distance had likewise produced an interval, which I imagined impossible for me to overpass. They were objects to be viewed, like the Divinity, from afar. The only sentiments which they could excite, were reverence and wonder. That I should ever pass the mound which separated my residence and my condition from theirs, was utterly incredible. The ideas annexed to the term peasant are wholly inapplicable to the tillers of ground in America; but our notions are the offspring more of the books we read, than of any other of our external circumstances. Our books are almost wholly the productions of Europe, and the prejudices which infect us are derived chiefly from this source. These prejudices may be somewhat rectified by age, and by converse with the world, but they flourish in full vigor in youthful minds, reared in seclusion and privacy, and undisciplined by intercourse 5 with various classes of mankind. In me, they possessed an unusual degree of strength. My words were selected and defined according to foreign usages, and my notions of dignity were modelled on a scale, which the revolution has completely taken away. I could never forget that my condition was that of a peasant, and in spite of reflection, I was the slave of those sentiments of self contempt and humiliation, which pertain to that condition elsewhere, through chimerical and visionary on the western side of the Atlantic. My ambition of dignity and fortune grew out of this supposed inferiority of rank. Experience had taught me, how slender are the genuine wants of a human being, and made me estimate, at their true value, the blessings of competence, and fixed property. Our fears are always proportioned to our hopes, and what is ardently desired, appears, when placed within our reach, to be an illusion designed to torment us. We are inclined to question the reality of that which our foresight had never suggested as near, though our wishes had perpetually hovered around it. When the death of Wilmot put his sister in possession of a sum of money, which, when converted into land, would procure her and the man whom her affection had distinguished, a domain of four or five hundred fertile acres, my emotions I cannot describe. Many would be less affected in passing from a fisherman's hovel to the throne of an opulent nation. It so much surpassed the ordinary bounds of my foresight and even of my wishes, that, for a time, I was fain to think myself in one of my usual walking dreams. My doubts were dispelled only by the repetition of the same impressions, and by the lapse of time. I gradually became familiarized to the change, and by frequently revolving its benefits and consequences, raised the tenor of my ordinary sensations to the level, as it were, of my new condition. From this unwonted height, Morton's reappearance had thrown us down to our original obscurity. But now my old preceptor had started up before me, and, like my good genius, had brought with him gifts immeasurable, and surpassing belief. They existed till now, in another hemisphere; they occupied an elevation in the social scale, to which I could scarcely raise my eyes; yet they were now within a short journey of my dwelling. I was going to be ushered into their presence; but my privilege was not to be circumscribed by any sober limits. This heiress of opulence and splendor, this child of fortune, and appropriator of elegance and grace, and beauty, was proffered to me as a wife! I reflected on the education which I had received from Mr. Howard; his affection for me, which had been unlimited; his relation to his wife's daughter, and the authority and respect which that relation, as well as his personal qualities, produced. I reflected on the futility of titular distinction; on the capriciousness of wealth, and its independence of all real merit, in the possessor; but still I could not retain but for a moment, the confidence and self respect which flowed from these thoughts. I was still nothing more than an obscure clown, whose life had been spent in the barnyard and cornfield, and to whose level, it was impossible for a being, qualified and educated like Clara, ever to descend. You must not imagine, however, that this descent was desired by me. I was bound, by every tie of honor, though not of affection, to Mary Wilmot. Incited by compassion and by gratitude, I had plighted my vows to her, and had formed no wish or expectation of revoking them. These vows were to be completed in a few months, by marriage; but this event, by the unfortunate, though seasonable and equitable claim of Morton, was placed at an uncertain distance. Marriage, while both of us were poor, would be an act of the utmost indiscretion. What, however, was taken away by Morton, might, I fondly conceived, be restored to us by the generosity of Mr. Howard. It was not, indeed, perfectly agreeable to the dictates of my pride, to receive fortune as the boon of any one; but I had always been accustomed to regard Mr. Howard more as my father than teacher, and it seemed as if I had a natural right to every gift which was needful to my happiness, and which was in his power to bestow. Mary and her claims on me, were, indeed, unknown to my friend. He had no reason to be particularly interested in her fate; and her claims interfered with those schemes which he had apparently formed, with relation to Clara and myself. How, I asked, might he regard her claims? In what light would he consider that engagement of the understanding, rather than of the heart, into which I had entered? How far would he esteem it proper to adhere to it; and what efforts might he make to dissolve it? Various incidents had hindered me from thoroughly explaining to him my situation, during his short stay at Hatfield; but I resolved to seize the opportunity of our next meeting, and by a frank disclosure, to put an end to all my doubts. Meanwhile, I employed the interval of his absence, in giving an account of all these events to Mary, and impatiently waited the arrival of a letter. The period of my friend's absence was nearly expired, and the hourly expectation of his return prevented me from visiting Mary in person. Instead of his coming, however, I at length received a letter from him in these terms. Richmond, Nov. 11. "I shall not call on you at Hatfield. I am weary of traversing hills and dales; and my detention in Virginia being longer than I expected, shall go on board a vessel in this port, bound for New York. Contract, in my name, with your old friend, for the present accommodation of the girls, and repair to New York as soon as possible. Search out No.—, Broadway. If I am not there to embrace you, inquire for my wife or daughter, and mention your name. Make haste; the women long to see a youth in whose education I had so large a share; and be sure, by your deportment, not to discredit your instructer, and belie my good report. Yours, E. Howard Being, by this letter, relieved from the necessity of staying longer at Hatfield, I prepared to visit my friend at Abingdon. Some six or seven days had elapsed since my messenger had left with her my last letter, and I had not since heard from her. I had been enjoined to repair to New York with expedition, but I could not omit the present occasion of an interview with Mary. Morton's claim would produce an essential change in her condition, and I was desirous of discussing with her the validity of this claim, and the consequences of admitting it. I had not seen Morton since his first visit. I now, in my way to Abingdon, called at his father's house. The old man appeared at the door. His son had visited and staid with him a few days, but liad afterwards returned to the city. He had gone thither to settle some affairs, and had promised to come back in a few weeks. He knew not in what affairs he was engaged— could not tell how far he had succeeded, or whereabouts in the city he resided. I proceeded to Abingdon, not without some expectation of Morton's having already accomplished his wishes, and persuaded my friend to refund the money; and yet, in a case of such importance, I could not easily believe that my concurrence, or at least my advice, would be dispensed with. I went to her lodgings as soon as I arrived. I had procured her a pleasant abode, at the house of a lady who was nearly allied to my uncle, and where the benefits of decent and affectionate society could be enjoyed without leaving her apartments. Mrs. Bordley was apprized of the connexion which subsisted between her inmate and me, and had contracted and expressed much affection for her guest. On inquiring for Miss Wilmot of her hostess, she betrayed some surprise. "Mary Wilmot?" she answered; "that is a strange question from you; surely you know she is not here." "Not here!" cried I, somewhat startled; "what has become of her?" "You do not know then that she has left us for good and all?" "No, indeed; not a syllable of any such design has reached me; but wither has she gone?" "That is more than I can say. If you are uninformed on that head, it cannot be expected that I should be in the secret. I only know, that three days ago she told me of her intention to change her lodgings, and she did so accordingly, yesterday morning at sunrise." "But what was her motive? What cause of dislike did she express to this house? I expected she would remain here, till she changed it for a house of her own." "Why indeed, that may be actually the case now, for she went away with a very spruce young gentleman, in his 5* chaise. But that cannot be. Poor creature! She was in no state for so joyous a thing as matrimony. She was very feeble; nay, she was quite ill; she had scarcely left her bed during five days before, and with difficulty got out of it, and dressed herself, when the chaise called for her. She would eat nothing, notwithstanding all my persuasion, and the pains I took to prepare some light nice thing, such as a weak stomach could bear. When she told me she meant to leave my house, I was as much surprised as you, and inquired what had offended or displeased her in my behaviour. She assured me that she had been entirely satisfied, and that her motives for leaving me had no connexion with my deportment. There was a necessity for going, though she could not explain to me what it was. I ventured to ask where she designed to go, but she avoided answering me for some time; and when I repeated the question, she said she could not describe her new lodgings—she knew not in what spot she was destined to take up her rest—and confessed that there were the most cogent reasons for her silence on that head. I mentioned the coldness of the weather, and her own ill health; but she answered, that no option had been left her, and that she must go, if it were even necessary to carry her from her bed to the carriage. All this, as you may well suppose, was strange; and I renewed my questions and entreaties, but she gave me no satisfaction, and persisted in her resolutions. Accordingly, on Thursday morning, a chaise stopped at the door, took her in, with a small trunk, and hastened away." I was confounded and perplexed at this tale. No event was less expected than this. No intimation had even been dropped by Mary, that created the least suspicion of this design. She had left, as Mrs. Bordley proceeded to inform me, all her furniture, without direction to whom, or in what manner to dispose of it, and yet had said that she never designed to return. The gentleman with whom she departed was unknown to Mrs. Bordley, and had stopt so short a time, as not to suffer her to obtain, by remarks or interrogatories, any gratification of her curiosity. Having ineffectually put a score of questions to Mrs. Bordley, I entered the deserted apartments. The keys of closets and drawers no where appeared, though the furniture was arranged as usual. Inquiring of my companion for these— "Aye," said she, "I had almost forgotten. The last thing she said before the chair left the door, holding out a bunch of keys to me, was, `Give these to—' there her voice faltered, and I observed the tears flow. I received the keys, and though she went away without ending her sentence, I took for granted it was you she meant." I eageily seized the keys, and hoped, by their assistance, to find a clue to this labyrinth. I opened the closets and drawers and turned over their contents, but found no paper which would give me the intelligence I wanted. No script of any kind appeared; nothing but a few sheets, and the like cumbrous furniture. A writing desk stood near the wall, but blank paper, wafers, and quills, were all that it contained. I desisted, at length, from my unprofitable labor, and once more renewed my inquiries of Mrs. Bordley. She described the dress and form of the young man who attended the fugitive. I could not at first recognize in her description any one whom I knew. His appearance bespoke him to be a citizen, and he seemed to have arrived from the city, as well as to return thither. She dwelt with particular emphasis on the graces of the youth, and frequently insinuated that a new gallant had supplanted the old. For some time, I was deaf to these surmises; but, at length, they insensibly revived in my fancy, and acquired strength. I began to account for appearances so as to justify my suspicion. She had not informed me of her motions; but that might arise from compunction and shame. There might even be something illicit in this new connexion, to which necessity might have impelled her. The claims of Morton were made known to her by me, but possibly they had been previously imparted by himself. To shun that poverty to which this discovery would again reduce her, she listened to the offers of one, whose opulence was able to relieve her wants. The notion that her conduct was culpable, vanished in a moment, and I abhorred myself for harboring it. I remembered all the proofs of a pure and exalted mind, impatient of contempt and poverty, but shrinking with infinitely more reluctance from vice and turpitude, which she had given. I called to mind her treatment of a man, by name Sedley, who had formerly solicited her love, and this remembrance gave birth to a new conjecture, which subsequent reflection only tended to confirm. Sedley had contracted a passion for Mary six or eight years ago. He was a man of excellent morals, and heir to a great fortune. He had patrimony in his own possession, and had much to hope for from his parents. These parents hated and reviled the object of their son's affections, merely because she was poor, and their happiness seemed to depend on his renouncing her. To this he would never consent, and Mary might long ago have removed all the evils of her situation, had she been willing to accept Sedley's offers; but though she had the highest esteem for his virtues, and gratitude for his preference, her heart was another's. Besides, her notions of duty were unusually scrupulous. Her poverty had only made her more watchful against any encroachments on her dignity, and she disdained to enter a family, who thought themselves degraded by her alliance. Sedley was a vehement spirit. Opposition whetted, rather than blunted his zeal; and Mary's conduct, while it heightened his admiration and respect, gave new edge to his desires. The youth, whom she loved, did not admit a mutual affection, and his poverty would have set marriage at a hopeless distance, even if it had been conceived. Sedley, therefore, believed himself the only one capable of truly promoting her happiness, and persisted in courting her favor longer and with more constancy, than might have been expected from his ardent feelings and versatile age. I need not repeat that Mary's affections were mine. To Sedley, therefore, I was the object of aversion and fear, and there never took place between us intercourse sufficient to subdue his prejudices. After her brother's death, marriage was resolved upon between us, and Sedley slackened the ardor of his pursuit. Still, however, he would not abjure her society. Some secret revolution, perhaps, had been wrought in the mind of my friend. Her consent to marriage had been extorted by me, for she was almost equally averse to marriage with one by whom she was not loved with that warmth which she thought her due, as with one who possessed every title to preference but her love. These scruples had been laid aside, in consideration of the benefit which her brother's death, by giving her property, enabled her to confer upon me, who was destitute. This benefit it was no longer in her power to confer. She would consider herself as severed from me for ever, and in this state a renewal of Sedley's importunities might subdue her reluctance. On comparing Mrs. Bordley's description of the voice, features, garb, and carriage of Mary's attendant, with those of Sedley, I fancied I discovered a strong resemblance between them. Some other coincidences, which came to light in the course of the day, made me certain as to the person of her companion. It was Sedley himself. I was willing to gain all the knowledge of this affair which was within my reach. Sedley's usual place of abode was his father's house in Virginia, but he chiefly passed his time in Philadelphia, where he resided with his sister, who was a lady of great merit, and left, by her husband's death, in opulent circumstances. This lady had made frequent overtures of friendship to Mary, but these had, for the most part, been declined. This reserve was not wholly free from pride. A mistaken sensibility made her shun those occasions for contempt or insult, which might occur in her intercourse with the rich. The relation in which she stood to Sedley was another impediment. A just regard for his happiness compelled her to exclude herself as much as possible from his company. The kindness of Mrs. Valentine had not been diverted by these scruples and reserves, and some intercourse had taken place between them before Mary's retirement to Abingdon. This change of views in my friend had given me much disquiet, but some reflection convinced me that it was a cause of rejoicing rather than regret. Wedlock had been desired by me, more from zeal for the happiness of another, than for my own. I had lamented that destiny which made the affections of three persons merely the instruments of their misery, and had exerted my influence to give a new direction to my friend's passions. This undertaking was no less delicate than arduous, and no wonder, that in hands so unskilful as mine, the attempt should fail. I could not be much displeased that this end was effected, though I was somewhat mortified on finding that she did not deem me worthy of being apprized of her schemes. I reflected, however, that this information might only be delayed; and imagined a thousand plausible reasons which might induce her to postpone intelligence so unexpected, if not disagreeable to me. Next morning I repaired to the city, and to Mrs. Valentine's house. I inquired of a female servant for Miss Wilmot, but was told that she had been there, a few hours, on the preceding Thursday, and had then gone, in company with her mistress and Mr. Sedley, to New York. No time had been fixed for their return, but Mrs. Valentine had said that her absence might last for six or eight months. The steward, who might afford me more information, was out of town. Thus my conjectures were confirmed; and having no reason for further delay, I immediately set out in the same road. My thoughts, disembarrassed from all engagements with Mary, persuaded of her union with Sedley, and convinced that this union would more promote her happiness than any other event, I returned without reluctance to Clara Howard. I was impatient to compare those vague and glittering conceptions which hovered in my fancy, with the truth; therefore adopted the swiftest conveyance, and arrived, in the evening of the same day, at Powle's Hook ferry. My excursions had hitherto been short and rare, and the stage on which I was now entering, abounded with novelty and grandeur. The second city in our country was familiar to my fancy by description; but my ideas were disjointed and crude, and my attention was busy in searching, in the objects that presented themselves, for similitudes which were seldom to be met with. A sort of tremulous, but pleasing astonishment, overwhelmed me, while I gazed through the twilight, on the river and the city on the further shore. My sensations of solemn and glowing expectation chiefly flowed from the foresight of the circumstances in which I was preparing to place myself. Men exist more for the future than the present. Our being is never so intense and vivid, if I may so speak, as when we are on the eye of some anticipated revolution, momentous to our happiness. Our attention is attracted by every incident that brings us nearer to the change, and we are busy in marking the agreement between objects as they rise before us, and our previous imaginations. Thus it was with me. My palpitations increased as I drew near the house to which I had been directed, and I could scarcely govern my emotions sufficiently to inquire of the servant who appeared to my summons, for Mrs. Howard. I was ushered into a lighted parlor, and presently a lady entered. She bore no marks of having passed the middle age, and her countenance exhibited the union of fortitude and sweetness. Her air was full of dignity and condescension. Methought I wanted no other assurance but that which the sight of her conveyed, that this was the wife of my friend. I was thrown, by her entrance, into some confusion, and was at a loss in what manner to announce myself. The moment she caught a distinct glance of my figure, her features expanded into a smile, and offering her hand, she exclaimed— "Ahah! This, without doubt, is the young friend, whom we have so anxiously looked for. Your name is Philip Stanley, and as such I welcome you, with the tenderness of a mother, to this home."—Turning to a servant who followed her, she continued, "Call Clara hither. Tell her that a friend has arrived." Before I had time to comment on this abrupt reception, the door was again opened. A nymph, robed with the most graceful simplicity, entered, and advancing towards me, offered me her hand. "Here," said the elder lady, "is the son and brother, whom Mr. Howard promised to procure for us. Welcome him, my girl, as such." Lifting her eyes from the floor, and casting on me bashful but affectionate looks, the young lady said, in a half whisper, "He is truly welcome"—and again offered the hand which, confounded and embarrassed as I at first was, I had declined to accept. Now, however, I was less backward. An unaffected and sprightly conversation followed, that tended to banish those timidities which were too apparent in my deportment. Mrs. Howard entered into a gay and almost humorous description of my person, such as she had received before my arrival, and remarked the differences between the picture and the original, intermingling questions, which, compelling me to open my lips in answer to them, helped me to get rid of my awkwardness. Presently supper was prepared, and despatched with the utmost cheerfulness. My astonishment and rapture were unspeakable. Such condescension and familiarity, surpassing all my fondest imaginations, from beings invested with such dazzling superiority, almost intoxicated my senses. My answers were disadvantageous to myself, for they were made in such a tumult and delirium of emotions, that they could not fail of being incoherent or silly. Gradually these raptures subsided, and I acted and spoke with more sobriety and confidence. I had leisure also to survey the features of my friends. Seated at opposite sides of the table, with lights above and around us, every lineament and gesture were distinctly seen. It was difficult to say which person was the most lovely. The bloom and glossiness of youth had, indeed, disappeared in the elder, but the ruddy tints and the smoothness of health, joined to the most pathetic and intelligent expression, set the mother on a level, even in personal attractions, with the daughter. No music was ever more thrilling than the tones of Clara. They sunk deeply into my heart, while her eyes, casually turned on me, and beaming with complacency, contributed still more to enchant me. In a few days, the effects of novelty gradually disappearing, I began to find myself at home. Mr. Howard's arrival, and the cordiality of his behavior, contributed still more to place me at ease. Those employments he designed for me now occurred. They generally engrossed the half of each day. They were light, despatched without toil or anxiety, and conduced, in innumerable ways, to my pleasure and improvement. They introduced me to men of different professions and characters, called forth my ingenuity and knowledge, and supplied powerful incitements to new studies and inquiries. At noon, the day's business was usually dismissed, and the afternoon and evening were devoted to intellectual and social occupations. These were generally partaken by the ladies, and visits were received and paid so rarely, as to form no interruption to domestic pleasures. Collected around the fire, and busied in music, or books, or discourse, the hours flew away with unheeded rapidity. The contrast which this scene bore to my past life perpetually recurred to my reflections, and added new and inexpressible charms to that security and elegance by which I was at present surrounded. Clara was the companion of my serious and my sportive hours. I found, in her character, simplicity and tenderness, united to powerful intellects. The name of children was often conferred upon us by my friend and his wife; all advances to familiarity and confidence between us were encouraged; our little plans of walking or studying together were sanctioned by smiles of approbation; and their happiness was evidently imperfect while ours was suspended or postponed. In this intercourse there was nothing to hinder the growth of that sentiment, which is so congenial with virtuous and youthful bosoms. My chief delight was in sharing the society and performing offices of kindness for Clara; and this delight the frankness of her nature readily shewed to be mutual. Love was not avowed or solicited, and did not frequently recur, in an undisguised shape, to my thoughts. My desires seemed to be limited to her presence, and to participating her occupations and amusements. Satisfied in like manner with this, no marks of impatience or anxiety were ever betrayed by her, but in my absence. The fulness of content which I now experienced did not totally exclude the remembrance of Mary. I had heard and seen nothing of Morton since my departure from Hatfield. The only way of accounting for this, was to suppose that Mary and he had met, and that the former, persuaded of the equity of his claim, had resigned to him the money which he had remitted to her brother. The silence which she had observed, involved me in the deepest perplexity. I spared no pains to discover Mrs. Valentine's residence, but my pains were fruitless. My inquiries 6 rendered it certain that, at least, no such person resided in New York. Thus occupied, the winter passed away. On a mild, but blustering evening in March, I happened to be walking, in company with Clara, on the battery. I chanced, after some time, to spy before me, coming in an opposite direction, the man whose fate had engaged so much of my attention. It was Morton himself. On seeing me, he betrayed much satisfaction, but no surprise. We greeted each other affectionately. Observing that he eyed my companion with particular earnestness, I introduced him to her. This meeting was highly desirable, as I hoped to collect from it an explication of what had hitherto been a source of perplexity. I likewise marked a cheerfulness in my friend's deportment, which shewed that some favorable change had taken place. He seemed no less anxious than I for a confidential interview; and an appointment of a meeting on the same evening was accordingly made. Having conducted Clara home, I hastened to the place appointed. I was forthwith ushered into a parlor, where Morton was found in company with a lady of graceful and pensive mien, with a smiling babe in her arms, to whom he introduced me as to his wife. This incident confirmed my favorable prognostics, and I waited, with impatience, till the lady's departure removed all constraint from our conversation. In a short time she left us alone. "I congratulate you," said I, "on your reunion with your family, but cannot help expressing my surprise that you never favored me with a second visit, or gave me any intelligence of your good fortune." He apologized for his neglect, by saying, that the arrival of his wife and daughter, in New York, obliged him, shortly after our interview, to hasten to this city, where successive engagements had detained him till now. He was, nevertheless, extremely desirous of a meeting, and intended, as soon as pleasant weather should return, to go to Hatfield, on purpose to see me. This meeting, however, had fortunately occurred to preclude the necessity of that journey. He then inquired into the health of Miss Wilmot, and her present situation. "I was anxious to see her," he continued, "on account of that affair, on which we conversed at our last meeting. As her brother's friend, I was, likewise, desirous of seeing her, and tendering her any service in my power, but when taking measures to bring about an interview, I received a letter from my wife, who, to my infinite surprise and satisfaction, had embarked for America, and arrived safely at New York. My eagerness to see my family made me postpone this interview for the present, and one engagement has since so rapidly succeeded another, that I have never been at leisure to execute this design." "What," said I, "has no meeting taken place between Mary Wilmot and you? Has she not restored the money you claimed?" "Surely," replied he, "you cannot be ignorant that I have never received it. I doubted whether I ought to receive it, even if my title were good. It was chiefly to become acquainted with her, that I looked for her, and my good fortune has since enabled me to dispense with any thing else. The property, left by her brother, may rightfully belong to her, notwithstanding present appearances. At any rate, her possessions shall be unmolested by me." He then proceeded to inform me, that his wife's parents being deceived by his long silence, and the intelligence of his shipwreck, into the opinion of his death, had relented, and settled an independent and liberal pension on their daughter, on condition of her choosing some abode at a distance from them. She proposed to retire, with her child, to some neat and rural abode in Cornwall, and was on the point of executing this design, when letters were received from her husband, at Algiers, which assured her of his safety, and requested her to embark for America, where it was his intention to meet her. She had instantly changed her plans, and selling her annuity on good terms, had transported herself and her property to New York, where her husband being apprized of her arrival, hastened to join her. "Thus," continued Morton, "you have, in my destiny, a striking instance of the folly of despair. My shipwreck, and my long absence, in circumstances which hindered all intercourse between me and my family, were the most propitious events that could have happened. Nothing but the belief of my death, and the consequent distresses of my wife, could have softened the animosity of her parents. Her disobedience, they thought, had been amply punished, and fate having taken from me the power of receiving any advantage from their gift, they consented to make her future life secure, at least, from want. "It was also lucky, that their returning affection stopped just where it did. Their resentment was still so powerful as to make them refuse to see her, and to annex to their gift, the stern condition of residing at a distance from them. Hence she was enabled to embark for America, without detecting their mistake, as to my death. They carefully shut their ears against all intelligence of her condition, whether direct or indirect, and will probably pass their lives in ignorance of that, which, if known, would only revive their upbraidings and regrets. "I am not sorry for the hardships I have endured. They are not unpleasing to remembrance, and serve to brighten and endear the enjoyments of my present state, by contrast with former sufferings. I have enough for the kind of life which I prefer to all others, and have no desire to enlarge my stock. Meanwhile, I am anxious for the welfare of Miss Wilmot, and shall rejoice in having been, though undesignedly, the means of her prosperity. "I heard, in Philadelphia, that a marriage was on foot between her and you. I flattered myself, when I met you this evening, that your companion was her, and secretly congratulated you on the possession of so much gracefulness and beauty. In this, it seems, I was partly mistaken. This is a person very different from Mary Wilmot; but a friend, whom I met, shortly after parting from you, and to whom I described her, assured me that this was the object of your choice. Pray, what has become of Miss Wilmot?" I frankly confessed to him my ignorance of her condition, and related what had formerly been the relation between her and me. I expressed my surprise at finding that she was still in possession of the money, after the representations I had made; and at the silence she had so long observed. When I recollected in what manner, and in whose company, she had left Abingdon, I could not shut out some doubts, as to her integrity. She was, indeed, mistress of her own actions, and Sedley was not unworthy of her choice; but her neglect of my letter, and her keeping this money, were suspicious accompaniments. This belief was too painful to attain my ready acquiescence, and I occasionally consoled myself, by imagining her conduct to proceed from some misapprehension, on the one or other part. Mrs. Valentine's reputation was unspotted, and under her guardianship, it was scarcely possible for any injury to approach my friend's person or morals. My anxiety to discover the truth was now increased. After being so long accustomed to partake her cares, and watch over her safety, I could not endure this profound ignorance. I was even uncertain as to her existence. It was impossible but that my friendship would be of some benefit. My sympathy could not fail to alleviate her sorrow, or enhance her prosperity. But what means had I of removing this painful obscurity? I knew not which way to look for her. My discoveries must be wholly fortuitous. Notwithstanding my own enjoyments, I allowed the image of Mary Wilmot to intrude into my thoughts too frequently. Some change in my temper was discerned by Clara, and she inquired into the cause. At first, I was deterred by indefinite scruples, from unfolding the cause, but some reflection shewed me I was wrong, in so long concealing from her a transaction of this moment. I therefore seized a favorable opportunity, and recounted all the incidents of my life, connected with this poor fugitive. When I began, however, I was not aware of the embarrassments which I was preparing to suffer and inflict. We used to sit up much longer than our friends, and after they had retired to repose, taking their places on the sofa, allowed the embers to die gradually away, while we poured forth, unrestrained, the effusions of the moment. It was on one of these occasions that, after a short preface, I began my story. I detailed the origin of my intercourse with Miss Wilmot, the discovery of her passion for me, the contest between that passion and my indifference on one side, and the claims and solicitations of Sedley on the other. I was listened to with the deepest emotion. Curiosity enabled her to stifle it for some time; but when I came to the events of Wilmot's 6* death, the discovery of his property, and the consequent agreement to marry, she was able to endure the recital no longer. She burst into tears, and articulated with difficulty. —"Enough, my friend, I know the rest—I know what you would say. Your melancholy is explained, and I see that my fate is fixed in eternal misery." I was at once shocked, astonished, and delighted, by the discovery which was thus made, and made haste, by recounting subsequent transactions, to correct her error. She did not draw the same inferences from the flight and silence of the girl, or drew them with less confidence than I. She was not consoled by my avowals of passion for herself, and declared that she considered my previous contract as inviolable. Nothing could absolve me from it, but the absolute renunciation of Miss Wilmot herself. I considered the silence and disappearance of Mary as a sufficient renunciation of her claims, and once more dwelt upon the scruples and objections which she had formerly raised to our alliance, which had been, imperfectly, and for a time, removed by the death of her brother, and which Morton's arrival had restored to their original strength. Some regard, likewise, was due to my own felicity, and to that of one whose happiness deserved to be as zealously promoted as that of the fugitive. It was true, that I had tendered vows to Miss Wilmot, which my understanding, and not my heart—which gratitude, and not affection, had dictated. This tender, in the circumstances in which I was then placed, was necessary and proper; but these circumstances had now changed. My offer had been tacitly rejected. Not only my love, but my friendship, had been slighted and despised. My affections had never been devoted to another, and the sacrifice of inclination was limited to myself. This indifference, however, existed no more. It was supplanted by a genuine and ardent attachment for one in all respects more worthy. I was willing to hope that this attachment was mutual. Fortune, and her parents, and and her own heart, were all propitious to my love; and to stifle and thwart it, for the sake of one who had abjured my society and my friendship—who renounced my proffered hand, and cancelled all my promises—who had possibly made herself unworthy of my esteem, by the forfeiture of honor itself, or more probably had given up all her claims on my justice and compassion, by accepting another, would be, in the highest degree, absurd and unjustifiable. These arguments wrought no effect upon Clara. It was her duty, she answered, to contend with selfish regards, and to judge of the feelings of others by her own. Whatever reluctance she might experience in resigning me to another, in whatever degree she might thwart the wishes and schemes of her parents, it was her duty to resign me, and she should derive more satisfaction from disinterested, than from selfish conduct. She would not attempt to disguise her feelings and wishes, and extenuate the sacrifice she was called on to make, but she had no doubt as to what was right, and her resolution to adhere to it would be immoveable. This resolution, and this inflexibility, were wholly unexpected. I was astonished and mortified; and having exhausted all my arguments in vain, gave way to some degree of acrimony and complaint, as if I were capriciously treated. At one time, I had thoughts of calling her parents to my aid, and explaining to them my situation with regard to Mary, and soliciting them to exert their authority in my behalf with Clara. A deep and incurable sadness now appeared in my friend, and strong, though unostentatious, proofs were daily afforded, that an exquisite sense of justice had dictated her deportment, and that she had laid upon herself a task to which her fortitude was scarcely equal. It appeared to me the highest cruelty to aggravate the difficulty of this task, by enlisting against her those whose authority she most revered, and whose happiness she was most desirous of promoting. My eagerness to trace Miss Wilmot to her retreat, to find out her condition, and make her, if possible, my advocate with Clara, was increased by this unhappy resolution. I began to meditate anew upon the best means of effecting this. I blamed myself for having so long failed to employ all the means in my power, and resolved to begin my search without delay. Clara, whose conclusions respecting Miss Wilmot's motives were far more charitable than mine, was no less earnest in inciting me to this pursuit. She believed Miss Wilmot's conduct to have been consistent with integrity, that it flowed from a generous but erroneous self-denial, and that the re-establishment of intercourse between us would terminate in the happiness of both. The incidents formerly related had made it certain that Miss Wilmot had flown away in company with Sedley. Sedley's patrimony and fixed abode were in Virginia. There, it was most probable, that he and the fugitive would be found. There, at least, should Sedley have abandoned his ancient residence, was it most likely that the means of tracing his footsteps would be found. Mary, if not at present in his company, or in that of his sister, had not perhaps concealed her asylum from them, and might be discovered by their means. Fortunately, Mr. Howard had engagements at Richmond, which would shortly require his own presence, or that of one in whom he could confide. He had mentioned this necessity in my presence, in such a way as shewed that he would not be unwilling to transfer his business to me. Hitherto I had been unwilling to relinquish my present situation; but now I begged to be entrusted with his commission, as it agreed with my own projects. In a few days I set out upon this journey. Passing necessarily at no great distance from Hatfield, I took that opportunity of visiting my uncle and sisters. You may imagine my surprise on finding, at my uncle's house, a letter for me, from Mary, which had arrived there just after my departure, in the preceding autumn, and had lain, during the whole winter, neglected and forgotten, in a drawer. This letter was worthy of my friend's generous and indignant spirit, and fully accounted for her flight from Abingdon. She was determined to separate herself from me, to die in some obscure recess, whither I should never be able to trace her, and thus to remove every obstacle in the way of my pretensions to one, younger, lovelier, and richer than herself. In this letter was inclosed an order for the money, which, as I had taught her too hastily to believe, belonged to another. I believe you know that I am not a selfish or unfeeling wretch. What but the deepest regret could I feel at the ignorance in which I had so long been kept of her destiny; what but vehement impatience to discover the place of her retreat, and persuade her to accept my vows, or, at least, to take back the money to which Morton's title was not yet proved, which would save her at least from the horrors of that penury she was so little qualified to endure, and to which, for more than six inclement months, she had been, through unhappy misapprehensions, subjected? In this mood I hastened to this city, but my heroism quickly evaporated. I felt no abatement of my eagerness to benefit the unhappy fugitive, by finding her, counselling her, consoling her, repossessing her of the means of easy, if not of affluent subsistence; but more than this, I felt myself incapable of offering. I knew full well, that, when acquainted with the whole truth, she never would accept me as her's; but I despaired of gaining any thing with respect to Clara, by that rejection. I despaired of ever lighting again on Miss Wilmot. Besides, my pride was piqued and wounded by resolutions that appeared to me absurd—to arise from prejudiced views and a narrow heart—from unreasonable regards bestowed upon one, of whose merits she had no direct knowledge, and blameable indifference to another, whom she had abundant reasons to love. The letters that passed between us only tended to convince me that she was implacable, and I left the city of Philadelphia with a secret determination of never returning. I resolved to solicit Mr. Howard's permission to accompany some surveyors employed by him, who were to pass immediately into the western country. By this means, I hoped to shake off fetters that were now become badges of misery and ignominy. The wisdom of man, when employed upon the future, is incessantly taught its own weakness. Had an angel whispered me, as I mounted the stage for Baltimore, that I should go no farther on that journey than Schuylkill, and that, without any new argument or effort on my part, Clara would, of her own accord, call me back to her and to happiness, I should no doubt have discredited the intimation. Yet such was the event. In order to rescue a drowning passenger, I leaped into the river. The weather being bleak and unwholesome, I was seized, shortly after my coming out, with a fever, which reduced me, in a very few days, to the brink of the grave. Now was the solicitude of my Clara awakened. When in danger of losing me for ever, she discovered the weakness of her scruples, and effectually recalled me to life, by entreating me to live for her sake. I have not yet perfectly recovered my usual health. I am unfit for business or for travelling; and standing in need of some amusement which will relieve, without fatiguing my attention, I called to mind your claims on me, and determined to give you the account you desired. When I received your letter, informing me of your design to meet me in New York, I was utterly dispirited and miserable. My design of coming southward, I knew, would prevent an immediate meeting with you, and as I had then conceived the project of a journey to the western waters, I imagined that we should never have another meeting. Now, my friend, my prospects are brighter, and I hope to greet you the moment of your arrival in New York. I shall go thither as soon as I am able. I shall never repose till my happiness with Clara is put beyond the power of man to defeat. But, alas! what has become of Mary Wilmot. Heaven grant that she be safe. While unacquainted with her destiny, my happiness will never be complete; day and night I torment myself with fruitless conjectures about her. Yet she went away with Sedley, a man of honor, and her lover, and with his sister, whose integrity cannot be questioned. With these she cannot be in danger, or in poverty. This reflection consoles me. I long to see you my friend. I hope to be of some service to you. You will see, by this long detail, that fortune has been kind to me. Indeed, when I take a view of the events of the last year, I cannot find language for my wonder, my blessings are so numerous and exorbitant, my merits so slender. I wish thee patience to carry thee to the end of this long letter. Adieu, Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond, Nov. 11. "I shall not call on you at Hatfield.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIV. To Philip Stanley. New York, April 28. Why don't you come home, my love? Are you not quite well? Tell me when; the day, the hour, when I may expect you. I will put new elegance into my garb; new health into my cheeks; new light, new love, new joy into my eyes, against that happy hour. Would to Heaven I were with you. I represented to my father what an excellent nurse I should prove, but he would not suffer me to accompany him. I have a good mind to steal away to you, even now; but are you not already quite well? Yes, you are; or, very soon will be. Time and care are all that are required to make you so. But, poor Mary—Does not your heart, my Philip, bleed for poor Mary? Can I rob her of so precious a good; bereave her of the gem of which she has so long been in secure possession? Can I riot in bliss, and deck myself in bridal ornaments, while she lives pining in dreary solitude, carrying to the grave a heart broken by the contumelies of the world; the horrors of indigence and neglect; and chiefly by the desertion of him on whom she doated? Do I not know what it is to love? Cannot I easily imagine what it is to bear about an unrequited passion? Have I not known, from infancy, the pleasures of affluence and homage? Cannot I conceive the mortifications to one thus bred up, of poverty and labor? Indeed, my friend, I conceive them so justly, that till Mary is discovered, and has either been found happy, or been made happy, no selfish gratification whatever can insure my peace. I should not thus be deeply interested for a mere stranger. I know your Mary. Your details, full of honesty and candor, have made me thoroughly acquainted with her. You have given me, in the picture of her life, the amplest picture of a human being that I ever was allowed to survey. Her virtue, my friend, has been tried. Not without foibles, for which she was indebted to her education; but her signal excellence lies in having, in spite of a pernicious education, so few faults. My friend, you must find her. As you value my happiness, you must. Nay, as you value my love. If your zeal did not lead you to move heaven and earth in her cause, you would be, in my eyes, a wretch. Nay, if you did not— But I am straying from the path. I must not think of her, least my admiration and my pity for her get the better of my love for you. Pray, make haste and be well, that you may make as happy as she can be, your devoted Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XV. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, April 30. I will never yield to you, my friend, in zeal for one whom I reverence and love so much as Mary Wilmot. How I adore your generous, your noble spirit! While limited to the real good of that girl; while zealous to confer happiness on her, without an equivalent injury to others, I applaud, and will strive to emulate your generosity. An incident has just occurred, that seems to promise some intelligence concerning her. It has made me very uneasy. I am afraid she is not happy. I am afraid she is—is not happy; I mean, I fear she is—unhappy. But I know not what I would say. I am bewildered—by my terrors on her account. Let me tell you what I have heard. Judge for yourself. Unhappy the hour that I wrote the last letter from Hatfield. Yet who could imagine that the intelligence contained in it would suggest so rash, so precipitate a flight! This Sedley, whose fidelity, whose honor I have so often applauded, is, I am afraid, a miscreant—a villain. Mary— the very thought takes away my breath—is, I fear, a lost, undone creature. Yet how?—Such a fall surely was impossible. Mary Wilmot, whose whole life has been exposed to my view— whom I have seen in the most unguarded moments—whose indifference to Sedley—whose unconquerable aversion to his most honorable and flattering offers I have so often witnessed, could not forget herself. Her dignity—I will not believe it. But what am I saying? Let me recollect myself, and lay distinctly before you the cause of my apprehensions. This morning, being disengaged, and the air mild, instead of going on with this letter, I stole abroad to enjoy the sweet breath of heaven. My feet carried me unawares to the door of the house in which I formerly passed a servitude of three years. My old master, Watkins, of time measuring memory, has been some time dead. The widow turned her stock into revenue, and now lives at her ease. Though not eminently good, she is far from being a bad woman. She never behaved otherwise than kindly to "Philip Sobersides," as she used to call me, and I felt somewhat like gratitude, which would not let me pass the door. So I called to see the old dame. I found her by a close-stove in the parlor, knitting a blue stocking—"Lack a day!" said she, "why, as I's a living soul, this is our Philip!" After the usual congratulations and inquiries were made, she proceeded—"Why, what a fine story is this, Philip, that we hear of you?—Why, they say you've grown a rich man's son, and are going to be married to a fine rich great lady, from some other country." I avoided a direct answer. She continued—"Ah! dear me, we all thought you were going to be married to poor Molly Wilmot, the mantuamaker—Nay, for the matter o' that, my poor dear man, I remember, said as how, that if so be we'd wait a year or so, we should see things turn up so, that you and her should be married already, at that time; and that, I remember, was just as your time was up. But Molly (with a very significant air this was said) has carried her goods to a much worse market, it seems." "Why, know you any thing of Miss Wilmot?" "Why, I don't know but as I does. I doesn't know much to her advantage though, you may depend, Philip." I was startled—"What do you know of her?—Tell me, I beseech you, all you know." "Why, I don't know much, not I; but Peggy, my nurse, said something or other about her, yesterday. She drank tea with me—" 7 "Pray," said I, impatiently, "what said your nurse of Miss Wilmot?" "Why, I don't know as I ought to tell—" But I will not teaze you, Clara, as I was tired with the jargon of the old woman. I will give you the sum of her intelligence in my own words. The nurse had lately been in the family of Mr. Kalm, of Germantown, between which and that of Mrs. Valentine, I have long known that much intimacy subsisted. Sedley, it seems, passed through this city about three weeks ago, and spent a day at Mr. Kalm's. At dinner, when the nurse was present, the conversation turned upon the marriage of Sedley, which, it seems, was just concerted with the daughter of a wealthy family in Virginia. The lady's name was mentioned, but the nurse forgot it. Mrs. Kalm, who is noted for the freedom of her discourse, reminded Mr. Sedley of the mantuamaker who eloped with him from Abingdon last autumn, and jestingly inquired into her present condition. Sedley dealt in hints and innuendoes, which imported that he was on as good terms with Molly Wilmot as he desired to be; that all his wishes with respect to her were now accomplished; that she knew her own interest too well to allow any obstruction to his marriage to come from her; that she would speedily resume her customary station in society, as the cause of her present disappearance was likely to be soon removed. I will not torment you or myself by dwelling on further particulars. My informant was deplorably defective in the means of imparting any clear and consistent meaning. An hour was employed in recollecting facts and answering questions, all which, taken together, imported nothing less than that an improper connexion had for some months subsisted between Sedley and my friend—a connexion of such a nature as was not consistent with his marriage with another. Comfort me—counsel me, my angel. I gathered from the beldame's tale, the probability at least, that Mary Wilmot was still in this city. Shall I seek her?—shall I?— Tell me, in short, what I must believe? what I shall do? Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVI. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 2. Ah! my friend, art thou so easily misled? Does slander find in thee a dupe of her most silly and extravagant contrivances? An old nurse's envious and incoherent tale! At second hand, too, with all the deductions and embellishments which must cleave to every story, as it passes through the imagination of two gossips! Art thou not ashamed of thyself, Philip? To impute black pollution to the heart whose fortitude, whose purity, so many years of trial have attested, on the authority of a crazy beldame repeating the malignant inferences, and embellishing the stupid hints of an old nurse. Sedley is a villain and a slanderer. Had I been present when he thought proper to blast the fame of the innocent and absent, I should not have controled my indignation—I should have cast the furious lie in his teeth. And is it possible, my friend, that on such evidence as this you build your belief that Mary has become an abandoned creature?—I am ashamed of such credulity. She is in the same city, you believe, yet sit idly in your chamber, lamenting that depravity which exists only in your fancy, and finding in such absurd and groundless suspicions, a reason for withholding that property which, whether she be vile as dirt, or bright as heaven, is equally her right. Seek her out this moment—never rest till you have found her—restore to her her own property—tender her your counsel, your aid. Mention me to her as one extremely anxious to cultivate her good opinion, and enjoy her friendship. Do this, Philip, instantly, I exhort, I entreat, I command you; and let me know the result. Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVII. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, May 4. I have just returned from Germantown, and find your letter on my table. Thank heaven, I have not merited all your rebukes. That anxiety to ascertain the truth, and that unwillingness to trust to such witnesses as gossips and nurses, which you think I ought to feel, I really have felt. My last was written in the first tumult of my thoughts. The moment I laid down the pen, and began more deliberately to reflect upon the subject, doubts and hopes thronged into my imagination; I resolved to bend every nerve to discover the retreat of Mary, and ascertain her true situation. As Sedley was so well known to Mrs. Kalm, I resolved to visit that lady. I had no acquaintance with her, but I overlooked the impropriety of my application, and set out immediately to Germantown. Being admitted to an apartment, in which I found that lady alone, I introduced myself in some confused way, I scarcely know how; and inquired whether she knew the person whom Sedley was about to marry, and whether she could afford me any information of the place where Mary Wilmot was likely to be found? She answered with great civility, that Sedley's sister was her dear friend; that Mrs. Valentine resided at this time in New England; that her brother passing lately through this city, in order to join her, had spent part of a day with Mr. Kalm; that Sedley had given his friends leave to consider him as upon the eve of marriage, but had not thought proper to disclose to them the name and family of the lady; that they were totally in the dark on both these heads, but were inclined to believe that she was a woman of Boston; that as to Mary Wilmot, she knew nothing of her or her affairs. Mrs. Kalm's curiosity was somewhat excited by the singularity of my introduction, and she soon became inquisitive in her turn. Encouraged by her frank and communicative humor, I ventured to explain unreservedly the motive of my inquiries. She smiled at the impression which the tale of the nurse and gossip had made on my fears. "Your uneasiness," said she, "was without any foundation. Perhaps we might have jestingly talked of Miss Wilmot's elopement with Sedley, because his pretensions to that girl are pretty well known; but I am not now to be told that your friend was, on that journey, the companion not of the brother, but the sister; and that Miss Wilmot's reputation and virtue could not be safer under her own guardianship than under Mrs. Valentine's—besides, there is not a man in the world of stricter principles than Sedley.—What you have heard, or something like it, might actually have passed at that dinner; but no one could have construed it in a way injurious to Sedley or your friend, but who was wholly unacquainted with the parties, or who was very hungry after slander. "Sedley certainly talked as if he knew more of Miss Wilmot than he just then thought fit to disclose.—What he said was accompanied with nods and smiles of some significance; but I should just as readily have put an evil construction on his hints, had he been talking of his own sister. All the world knows that a woman of merit would be sure to receive from Sedley, exactly the treatment which an affectionate brother would be disposed to give. "As to Miss Wilmot's disappearance, I never knew till now there was any thing mysterious or suspicious in her conduct. It is true, she left her former residence; but considering in whose company she left it, and the privacy and solitude in which she had previously lived, I was inclined to think she had risen into sight and notice, and instead of retiring from observation, had come forth more conspicuously than ever. This was necessarily the case, if she lived or associated, as she probably did, with Mrs. Valentine. "When Sedley talked of the cause of her journey being removed, and her reassuming her station among us, I confess he was unintelligible to me. I knew of no cause for her journey but her own pleasure, and perhaps Mrs. Valentine's entreaties. The construction which a casual hearer seems to have put upon his words was foolish and preposterous; indeed, it is highly offensive to me, since it pre-supposed 7* that I could patiently hear any one utter such insinuations at my table." Mrs. Kalm seemed much hurt at the misapprehensions of the nurse, and was very earnest in vindicating Sedley's innocence. She bore testimony to the undeviating and exemplary propriety of Miss Wilmot's conduct, ever since it had been within the reach of her observation. Thou wilt imagine, Clara, with what unspeakable delight I listened to her eulogy. I was astonished at my own folly, in drawing such extravagant conclusions. My own heart pleads guilty to thy charges of credulity and precipitation; but I hope I shall not be so grossly or so easily deceived a second time. Mrs. Kalm could give me no account of the present situation of my friend; but she gave me Mrs. Valentine's address. From her, no doubt, I shall be able to obtain all the information I want. I was a stupid wretch not sooner to inquire among the lady's numerous friends where she was to be found. I will write to her immediately. Congratulate me, my beloved, on this opening of brighter prospects for one who is equally and deservedly dear to both of us. Unless you make haste to write, I shall receive your congratulations in person, for I feel myself already well enough to travel in your company to the world's end. Adieu. Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVIII. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, May 5. Though I am so soon to be with you, and have received no answer to my last, yet I cannot be alone in my chamber, and be within reach of pen and paper, without snatching them up and talking to my friend thus. This is a mode of conversing I would willingly exchange for the more lively and congenial intercourse of eyes and lips; but 'tis better than total silence. What are you doing now? Busy, I suppose, in turning over the leaves of some book—some painter of manners or of nature is before you—some dramatist, or poet, or historian, furnishes you with occupation. The day here is celestially benign—such only as our climate can know. It is not less splendid and serene with you, so you have strolled into that field, which is not excelled for the grandeur of its scenery, the balsamic and reviving virtue of its breezes, its commodiousness of situation for the purpose of relieving those condemned to a city life, by any field on this globe. The battery —what a preposterous name! Yet not the only instance of a mound serving at once the double purpose of pleasure and defence. Did you not say the bulwarks of Paris were pleasure walks? You have been in Sicily and Provence, did you ever meet with sun, sky, and water, more magnificent, and air more bland than you are now contemplating and breathing? for methinks I see that lovely form gliding along the green, or fixed in musing posture at the rails, and listening to the rippling of the waters. Perhaps some duty keeps you at home. You expect a visitant; are seated at your toilet, adding all the enchantments of drapery, the brilliant hues and the flowing train of muslin, to a form whose excellence it is to be beautiful when unadorned, and yet to gain from every ornament new beauty. What a rare lot is yours, Clara!—One of the most fortunate of women art thou. Wealth, affluence, is yours; but wealth is only the means of every kind of happiness; it is not happiness itself. But you have not only the tools, but the inclination to use them. In no hands could riches be placed so as to produce more felicity to the possessor, and to those within reach of her munificence. Which is the most unerring touchstone of merit—poverty or riches? Ingeniously to supply the place, or gracefully to endure the want of riches, is the privilege of great minds. To retain humility and probity in spite of riches, and to effect the highest good of ourselves and others by the use of them, is the privilege of minds still greater. The last privilege is Clara's; the first, vanity has sometimes said—no matter what. It was, indeed, vanity that said it—vanity, that is now humbled into wisdom and self distrust. So far from bearing poverty with dignity, I cannot justly call my former situation by that name, and was far from bearing even the moderate privations of that state with fortitude. And are, indeed, these privations forever at an end? Is the harder test of wisdom, the true use of riches, now to be imposed upon me? It is—Clara Howard and all that she inherits will be mine. I ought to tremble for the consequences of exposure to such temptations; and if I stood alone I should tremble; but, in reality, whatever is your's, or your father's gift, is not mine. Your power over it shall be unlimited and uncontroled by me; and this, not more from the equity of your claim to the sole power, than from the absolute rectitude with which that power will be exercised by you. Had I millions of my own acquiring, I should deem it no more than my duty to resign to you the employment of them. Ah! my divine friend, I will be no more than your agent —your almoner; one whose aid may make charity less toilsome to you—may free the pleasures of beneficence from some of those pains by which they are usually attended. I will go before you, plucking up thorns and removing asperities from the path that you choose. All my recompense shall be the consciousness in whose service I labor, and whose pleasures I enhance. They tell us that ambition is natural to man; that no possession is so pleasing as power and command. I do not find it so. I would fain be a universal benefactor. The power that office or riches confers is requisite to this end; but power in infirm hands is productive only of mischief. I who know my own frailty, am therefore undesirous of power—so far from wishing to rule others, it is my glory and my boast to submit to one whom I deem unerring and divine. Clara's will is my law; her pleasure the science that I study; her smiles the reward, next to an approving God, my soul prizes most dearly. Indeed, my friend, before you honor me with your choice, you should contrive to exalt me or lower yourself. Some parity there ought to be between us—an angel in the heavens like thee, is not a fit companion for a mere earthworm like Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIX. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 5. Ah, hah! give them to me. Two letters at once—this is unexpected happiness. Charming papers! Lie there, and still the little rebel that will not allow me speech. And thinkest thou my lips said this, as my father threw the letters into my lap?—No such thing. My heart was mutinous, 'tis true; but no one present—there were many present— was aware of its tumults, except, indeed, my mother—her observant eye saw what was passing within; or rather, she guessed from the superscription what I felt, and therefore considerately furnished me with an excuse for retiring. "Clara, my dear, I imagine your good woman has come I think I saw her go down the steps—my friends will excuse you for a moment." I hastily withdrew, and then, Philip, having gained the friendly covert of my chamber, I eagerly—rapturously, kissed and read thy letters. I thought it would prove a mere slander; and yet I was uneasy. The mere possibility of its truth shocked and distressed me more than I can tell; but thy intelligence has not only removed the disquiet which thy foregoing letter had produced, but, in reality, has given me uncommon pleasure. I flatter myself that your letter to Mrs. Valentine will receive a speedy and satisfactory answer. Human life, Philip, is a motley scene. Thou wilt not thank me for the novelty of that remark; but the truth of it, I think, has received new illustration in the little incidents on which thy last letters have commented. Had not the old nurse's tale incited thee to inquiry, thou wouldst not, at this moment, have been in the way to gain any knowledge of poor Mary—had not thy sad prognostics filled me with melancholy, my mother's attention would not have been excited to the cause of my uneasiness. I did not conceal from her the cause. I made her pretty well acquainted with the history of Mary. She was deeply interested in the story I told and suggested many inquiries respecting her, which I had overlooked. She has made me extremely anxious as to some particulars, on which perhaps you can give me the desired information. Pray tell me what you know of the history of her family, before her father's leaving Europe. Where was he born? Where lived he? What profession did he follow? What know you of the history of Mary's mother? Excuse me for confining myself, at present, to these inquiries. Tell me all you know on this subject, and I will then acquaint you with the motive of my inquisitiveness. I shall expect to hear from you on Thursday morning. Adieu. Be careful of thyself, if thou lovest thy Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XX. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, May 8. I am at a loss, dear Clara, to account for thy questions; but I will answer them to the utmost of my power. The same questions frequently occurred to me, in my intercourse with the Wilmots. It was natural, you know, to suppose that they had left relations in their native country, with whom it might be of some advantage to renew their intercourse. Mary was ten years old when her father took up his abode in Delaware; but he had been already five years in the country, so that you will easily perceive she was not likely to possess much personal knowledge of events, previous to their voyage. Her mother's death happened just before their removal to Wilmington. It appears to have been the chief cause of that removal. Your letter has put me on the task of recollection. I am sorry that I am able to collect and arrange very few circumstances, such as you demand. The Wilmots were either very imperfectly acquainted with the history of their parents, or were anxious to bury their history in oblivion. The first was probably the situation of the son; but I have often suspected, from the contradictions and evasions of which Mary was at different times guilty, when this subject was talked of between us, that the daughter pretended ignorance, for the sake of avoiding the mortification of telling the truth. When once urged pretty closely on this head, she indeed, told me the subject was a painful one to her; that she knew nothing of her European kindred, which would justify the searching them out; and that she would hold herself obliged to me if I never recalled past events to her remembrance. After this injunction I was silent; but in the course of numberless conversations afterwards, hints were casually dropped, which afforded me, now and then, a glimpse into their family history. When Mary spoke of her father, it was always with reverence for his talents, gratitude for his indulgence to her, and compassion for that frailty of character, which made him seek in dissipation relief from sorrow on account of the death of a wife whom he adored; and a refuge, as she sometimes obscurely intimated, from some calamity or humiliation which befel him in his native country. My friend's heart always throbbed, and her eyes were filled with tears, whenever her mother was remembered. She took a mournful pleasure in describing her mother's person and manners, in which she was prone to believe all human excellence was comprised. Her own melancholy temper and gloomy destiny she imagined to have descended to her by inheritance; and she once allowed me to collect from her discourse, that her mother had died the victim of some early and heavy disappointment. We were once, the winter before last, conversing by an evening fire, on that most captivating topic, ourselves. Having said something of my attachment to my country, and especially to the hill side, where I first drew breath, and inquired into her feelings in relation to the same objects— "Alas!" said she, "I should be puzzled to say to what country I belonged—I am a German by my father, English by my mother. I was born at a hotel in Paris; I was nursed by a woman of Nice, where I passed my infancy; and my youth and womanhood, and probably my whole life, belong to America. Now, what is the country, Germany, England, France, Italy, or America, which I have a right to call my own? The earliest object of my recollection is the face of my nurse, who accompanied us in all our wanderings, and who died just before my father, on Brandywine. The olives, the orange-walks, and the seashore scenery of Savoy, are still fresh in my remembrance. Should I visit them again, no doubt my feelings would be strongly affected; but I never expect to visit them." "But your father's, your mother's natal spot would have some charms, methinks, to one of your sensibility." "Some influence, no doubt, the contemplation would have, but no charms. Strange, if I should ever have an opportunity of trying their effect upon my feelings." "You are acquainted then with the birth-place of your father and mother?" "Yes, I have heard them described so often, and with such minuteness, that I should recognize them, I think, at any distance of time.—My father was born in the Grey Street, next to the chapel of St. Anne, at Altona. My mother and family have subsisted, from the days of William the Norman, at a spot, five miles from Taunton, in Devonshire." I was in hopes that these particulars were peliminary to more interesting disclosures; but my friend now changed the subject of conversation, and would not be brought back to the point I wished. Mr. Wilmot was a man of liberal education and cultivated taste. This appears from the representations of his daughter, and likewise from several books which she preserved by connivance of his creditors, and which are enriched by many notes and memorandums in her father's handwriting. These betoken an enlarged mind and extensive knowledge. She has likewise a sort of journal, kept by him when a mere youth, during two or three year's residence in Boulogne, in the character, as I suspect, of a commercial agent.—This journal, which I have occasionally seen, affords many proofs of a sprightly and vigorous mind. This, my friend, is the whole of my present recollections on this subject. I am anxious to know what has suggested your inquiry. Is your mother acquainted with any of the family in Europe?—With the history of Wilmot before he came hither? Pray tell me all you know in your next. Adieu. Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXI. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 10. As soon as I had read your letter, I hurried to my mother. All her conjectures are ascertained—a native of Holstein—family abode near Taunton—victim of some early distress! These circumstances place the truth beyond controversy—but I will tell you the story with somewhat more order. I told you that my mother's curiosity was awakened by the effect of your gloomy prognostics. I told her every thing respecting Mary Wilmot, but her love for you. "Wilmot, Wilmot," said she, "an English family—came over twenty years ago. I think I know something of them. Their story was a singular one—a disastrous one. I should like to know more of their history. I think it not improbable that these are the same Wilmots with whose history I am perfectly acquainted—nay more, who were no very distant relations of our own. Pray write to Philip, and get from him all he knows of their early adventures. Inquire if the father was from Holstein, and the mother from Devonshire, and if Mary was born at Paris?" You see, my friend, your letter has satisfactorily confirmed these guesses; and now will I relate to you the early history of this family, in the words of my mother. Mary will be greatly astonished when she comes to find how much you know of her family—much more, 'tis probable, than she herself knows—and to discover that the nearest relation she has in the world is myself. Being alone with my mother on Thursday evening, she fulfilled the promise she had made, to tell me all she knew of the Wilmots, in these words— "Mary Anne was the only daughter of my father's only brother, consequently she was my cousin. She was nearly of my own age, and being the only child of a man respectable for birth and property, and my near relation, and particularly of my own sex, we were intimately connected it 8 an early age. She lost her mother in her infancy, and our family having several daughters, our house was thought more suited to her education than her father's. She lived with me and my sisters till she was eighteen years of age, receiving from us, our brothers, and our parents, exactly the same treatment which a real sister and daughter received. "There was no particular affection between Mary and myself; our tempers did not chance to coincide—her taste led her to one species of amusement, and mine to another. This difference stood in the way of that union of interests which, however, took place between her and my elder sister. Still, there were few persons in the world for whom I had a more ardent esteem; or more tender affection, than for my cousin Mary Anne. She parted from us at the age of eighteen, in obedience to the summons of her father, who wished to place her at the head of his household. We lived in the north, and Mr. Lisle lived in Devonshire, so that we had little hope of any intercourse but by letter. This intercourse was very punctually maintained between her and my sister, and it was by means of this correspondence that we obtained the knowledge of subsequent events. "On leaving our family, my cousin entered into a world of strangers; a sphere very incongenial with her temper and habits. So long a separation had deprived the parental character of all those claims to reverence and confidence, which are apt to arise when the lives of father and daughter are spent under the same roof. She saw in my uncle a man, who, in many essential particulars both of speculation and of practice, was at variance with herself, and to whom nature had given prerogatives, which her fearful temper foreboded would be oftener exerted to her injury than benefit. His inmates, his companions, his employments, his sports, were dissonant with all the feelings she was most accustomed to cherish; in short, her new situation was in the highest degree irksome. "She naturally looked abroad for that comfort which she could not find at home; she formed intimacies with several persons of her own sex, among others, with Miss Saunders, the daughter of a Bristol merchant, with whom she spent as much time as her father would allow her to spend. Her winter months were generally passed in the society of that young lady at Bristol, while her friend in summer was her guest in the country. "It was at the house of Mr. Saunders that she became acquainted with Veelmetz, or Wilmot, a young man of uncommon elegance and insinuation. He was a native of Germany, but had received his early education in England. He had at this time been for two or three years chief, or confidential clerk, in an English mercantile house at Boulogne; but made occasional excursions on behalf of his employers to the neighboring countries. Some concerns detained him a few months at Bristol, and being on a familiar footing with the family of Saunders, he there became acquainted with my cousin. "On the first interview my cousin was in love with the stranger. It is impossible to tell how far the laws of strict honor were observed by Wilmot in his behavior to my cousin, either before or after the discovery of her attachment to him—certain it is, that his heart was devoted to another, at the period of his interview with Mary Anne; that she at all times earnestly acquitted him of any duplicity or treachery towards her, and ascribed the unfortunate cause of their mutual shame and embarrassment to some infatuation; in consequence of which, a man who concealed not his love and engagement to another, and without the sanction or the promise of marriage, prevailed on her to forget her dignity and her duty. "Both parties deserved blame—which deserved it most, and how far their guilt might be extenuated or atoned for by the circumstances attending it, it is impossible to tell. Mary Anne was a great, a mixed, and doubtless a faulty character. The world in general was liberal of its eulogies on the probity, as well as on the graces and talents of Wilmot. His subsequent behavior lays claim to some praise; but his fatal meeting with my cousin proved that the virtue of both was capable of yielding, when the integrity of worse people would easily have stood firm. "About the same time Wilmot returned to Boulogne, and my cousin accompanied her father to Paris. The lady to whom the former was betrothed, was the daughter of the principal in that house where Wilmot had long been a servant, and in which, in consequence of his merits, he was now shortly to become a son and partner. The nuptial day was fixed. "Before the arrival of that day, he wrote a letter to Mary Anne, acquainting her with his present situation, reminding her that he never practised any fraud or concealment in his intercourse with her, yet, nevertheless, offering to come, and either by an open application to her father, or by a clandestine marriage, prevent any evil that might threaten her safety or her reputation. "This letter placed my cousin in the most distressful dilemma that can be conceived. Her heart was still fondly devoted to him that made this offer; a fair fame was precious in her eyes; her father's wrath was terrible. She knew that the accident which Wilmot was willing to provide against, would soon inevitably befall her; yet in her answer to his letter the possibility of this accident was denied, her attachment was denied, and he was earnestly conjured to complete his own happiness and that of a worthier woman. "There were many generous pleas by which my cousin might have accounted for her conduct; she knew that the marriage he offered would never be crowned with her father's consent; that, on the contrary, his hatred and vengeance would pursue them for ever; that Wilmot would thereby forfeit the honor already plighted to another—would inflict exquisite misery on that other and on himself, and would for ever cut himself off from that road to fortune which had now been opened to him. "She was candid enough to confess that these considerations, though powerful, did not singly dictate her conduct. Her heart was in reality full of grief—despondency and horror took possession of her whole soul. She hoped to protract the discovery of her personal condition to a very late period, and then, when further concealment was hopeless, designed to put a violent end to life and all its cares. "Meanwhile, Wilmot's conscience being somewhat relieved by my cousin's answer, he gave himself up without restraint to the pleasurable prospects before him. The day of happiness was near at hand; he had little leisure for any thing but the offices of love and tenderness, and was engaged on the evening of a fine day to accompany his mistress, with a numerous party, on a rural excursion. The carriage, ready to receive them, was at the door, and he only waited in a court before the house till the lady had adjusted her dress for the occasion. "His mistress, Adela, having made the requisite adjustments, came out. She looked around for her lover in vain. Some accident, it was easily imagined, had called him for a few moments away. She collected patience to wait; but she waited and expected in vain—night came, and one day succeeded another, but Wilmot did not appear. Inquiries were set on foot, and messengers were despatched, but Wilmot had entirely vanished. "Some intelligence was at last gained of him. It appeared, that while walking to and fro in the court, two persons had come up to him, and after a short dialogue had retired with him to an inn; there they had been closeted for a few minutes, after which they came forth, and mounting horses that stood at the gate, hastily left the city together. "The suspense and anxiety which this circumstance produced in the lady and her family, may be easily imagined. Their conjectures wandered from one object to another, without obtaining satisfaction—they could gain, from all their inquiries, no knowledge of the persons who had summoned the young man away—they inferred that the messengers were the bearers of no good tidings, since the attendants at the inn reported that Wilmot's countenance and motions betrayed the utmost consternation, on descending from the chamber where the conference was held. "Their suspense was at length terminated by the return of the fugitive himself. Wan, sorrowful, and drooping, a horseman languidly alighted about ten days after Wilmot's disappearance at the gate—it was Wilmot himself. The family flocked about, eager to express their joy, terror, and surprise. He received their greetings with affected cheerfulness; but presently requesting an interview with Adela, retired with her to her closet. "I suppose, my dear, you conjecture the true cause of all these appearances. My cousin's secret was betrayed by an unfaithful confidant to her father, whose rage at the discovery was without bounds. He rushed into his daughter's presence in a transport of fury, and easily extorted from her 8* the author of her disgrace. Without a moment's delay, he ordered horses, and, in company with a friend, made all possible haste to Boulogne. The daughter's uncertainty as to the cause and object of his journey, was ended by the return of Mr. Lisle in company with Wilmot. The alternative offered to the youth, was to meet the father with pistols, or to repair his child's dishonor by marriage. Mr. Lisle's impetuosity overbore all my cousin's opposition, and Wilmot, the moment he discovered her true situation, was willing to repair the wrong to the utmost of his power. "The ceremony being performed, Mr. Lisle's pride was so far satisfied; but his rage demanded nothing less than eternal separation from his daughter. Wilmot was obliged to procure lodgings in a different quarter, and my poor cousin left her father's presence, for the last time, with his curses ringing in her ears. "The horror occasioned by these events brought on a premature labor, the fruit of which did not perish, as might have been expected, but has survived to this day, and is no other than your Mary Wilmot. "Poor Wilmot had an arduous office still to perform; these events, and his new condition, were to be disclosed to Adela. This it was easy to do by letter; but he rather chose to do full justice to his feelings in a formal interview; and this was the purpose for which he returned to Boulogne. "It is not possible to imagine a more deplorable situation than that in which Wilmot was now placed; he was torn for ever from the object of his dearest affections; at the moment when all obstacles were about to disappear, and a few days were to unite those hearts which had cherished a mutual passion from infancy, he was compelled to pay the forfeit of past transgressions, by binding himself to one who had his esteem, but not his love. Adela was the pride and delight of her family, and Wilmot had made himself scarcely a less fervent interest in their affections; that privilege he was now compelled to resign, and by the same act, to break the heart of the daughter, and excite unextinguishable animosity in the bosom of her friends. Every tie dear to the human heart was now violently broken—every flattering scheme of honor and fortune baffled and defeated; nor had he the consolation to reflect, that by these sacrifices he had secured the happiness of at least one human being. My cousin was an involuntary actor in this scene; she had been overborne by her father's menaces, and even by the expostulations and entreaties of Wilmot himself. The irrevocable ceremony was hurried over without a moment's deliberation or delay, and before she had time to collect her thoughts and form her resolutions, to recover from the first confusions of surprise and affright, she found herself a wife and a mother. "It was, perhaps, merely the very conduct which my cousin's feelings taught her to pursue, that secured her ultimately some portion of happiness. All the fault of the first transgression she imputed to herself; Wilmot was the innocent and injured person; she only was the injurer and criminal. Those upbraidings which the anguish of his heart might have prompted him to use, were anticipated, dwelt upon, and exaggerated; all the miseries of this alliance passed in as vivid hues before her imagination, as before his. These images plunged her into the most profound and pitiable sorrow. "Wilmot's generosity would by no means admit that her's only was the guilt; on the contrary, his candor, awakened by her example, was busy in aggravating his own crime. His heart was touched by the proofs of her extreme dejection— her disinterested regard; he reflected that her portion of evil was at least equal to his own. Her sensibility to reputation, her sense of right, her dependence on her father for the means of subsistence, her attachment to her country and kindred, all contributed to heighten her peculiar calamity, since she believed her fame to be blasted forever; since her conscience reproached her with all the guilt of their intercourse; since her father had sworn never to treat her as his child; since she had lost, in her own opinion, the esteem of all her relations and friends, and solemnly vowed never to set foot in her native country. "Wilmot's efforts to console his wife produced insensibly, a salutary effect on his own feelings. Being obliged to search out topics of comfort for her use, they were equally conducive to his own, and a habit of regarding objects on their brightest side—of considering my cousin as merely a subject of tenderness and compassion, somewhat blunted the edge of his own misfortunes. "My father took infinite, though unsolicited, pains to reconcile the parent and child; but my uncle could not be prevailed on to do more than allow Wilmot a small annuity, with which he retired to the town of Nice, and by a recluse and frugal life, subsisted, if not with elegance, at least with comfort. Mary Anne was extremely backward to cultivate the society of her old friends; their good offices she took pains to repel and elude, and her only source of consolation with regard to them, appeared to be the hope that they had entirely forgotten her. We, her cousins, were not, however, deterred by her repulses, but did every thing in our power to befriend her cause with her inexorable father, and to improve her domestic situation. We had the pleasure to find that Wilmot, though his vivacity, his ambitious and enterprising spirit was flown, was an affectionate husband and provident father. "At my uncle's death we had hopes that Mary Anne's situation would be bettered. His will, however, bequeathed all his estate to his nephew, my elder brother; and the Wilmots were deprived even of that slender stipend which they had hitherto enjoyed. This injustice was in some degree repaired by my brother, who, as soon as the affairs of the deceased were arranged, sent a very large present to Wilmot. They did not make us acquainted with the motives of their new resolutions; we were merely informed indirectly, that on the receipt of this sum, Wilmot repaired with his family to some port in France, and embarked for the colonies. Time insensibly wore away the memory of these transactions, and 'tis a long time since my sisters and I have been accustomed, in reviewing past events, to inquire—`What has become of poor Mrs. Wilmot and her children?" Such, Philip, was my mother's relation; is it not an affecting one?—And is, indeed, thy Mary the remnant of this family? They had several children, but most of them found an early grave in Europe, and the eldest, it seems, is the sole survivor. We must make haste, my friend, to raise her from obscurity, and make her happy. Is it not likely that Mary knows nothing of her mother's history?—Being only ten years old at her death, the child would scarcely be made the confidant of such transactions. The father, it is likely, would be equally prone to silence on such a topic. Our fortune is strongly influenced by our ignorance.— What can be more lonely and forlorn than the life thy poor friend has led? Yet had she returned to her mother's native country, and disclosed her relation to the present mistress of Littlelisle, she would have been instantly admitted to the house and bosom of a fond mother. My uncle, to whom I told you the estate of Mary's grandfather was bequeathed, died unmarried, and left his property to the sister who was the intimate of Mary Anne, and who never lost the tenderest respect for her youthful friend. This happened some years after Wilmot's voyage to the colonies. My aunt being childless and a widow, was extremely solicitous to discover Mary Anne's retreat, and restore her, or her children, to at least a part of that property, to the whole of which their title was, strictly speaking, better than her own; for this end, she made a great many inquiries in America, but none of them met with success. I have written a long letter; yet I could add much more, were I not afraid of losing this post, so let me hear thy comments on all these particulars, and tell me, especially, when I may certainly expect thy return. Adieu. Clara.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXII. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, May 11. Thanks, a thousand thanks, my beloved friend, for thy story. It has absorbed and overwhelmed every other thought and feeling. Since I received it, I have done nothing but peruse and ponder on thy letter; it has opened cheerful prospects for my poor friend. Shall we not see her restored to her native country, to her original rank, and the affluence to which she is entitled by her birth, her education, and her former sufferings? I trust we shall. 'Tis impossible to guess how far she is acquainted with the history of her parents; but that and every other doubt will, I hope, speedily be put to flight. I hope that this is the last letter I shall have occasion to write to you—the next time I shall address you will be through no such wild and ambiguous medium. May I find my Clara all gentleness—all condescension— all love; so, with all his heart, prays her Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIII. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 11. By the calm tenor of this letter, you will hardly judge of the state of my mind before I sat down to write. To describe it would be doing wrong to myself and to you; I am not anxious to pass for better than I am; to hide my weakness, or to dwell upon my folly. In this letter to paint the struggles between reason and passion, would be making more arduous that task which I must assign to you. I have formerly concealed these struggles; my motive was not shame. I aimed not to shun contempt by concealing my defects, for, alas! the spirit with which I had to deal modelled his opinions by a standard different from mine; that which was selfish and base in my eyes, was praise worthy in his. I passed for obdurate and absurd, in proportion as I acted in a manner which appeared to me generous and just. I concealed these struggles, because I hated to reflect upon my own faults; because they were past, and the better thoughts that succeeded were sources of complacency too precious to be lost, and attained and preserved with so much difficulty, that to review the conflicts which it cost me to gain them, would hazard their loss. Thus it is at present. I write to you not to give utterance and new existence to anguish no longer felt; I write to you to tell my present views, and they cannot waver or change. My friend, the bearer of this, is your Mary. She is not happy—she is not another's! She is poor, but good; and no doubt as much devoted to you as ever. Need I point out to you the road which you ought to take?—Need I enforce by arguments that duty which compels you to consult her happiness, by every honest means? Could I but inspire you, my friend, with the sentiments that now possess my heart; could I but make your convictions at once just and strong, and convert you into a cheerful performer of your duty, I should indeed be happy. You will wonder by what means Mary has been made known to me. I will tell you. I went to pay a visit, long since due, to Mrs. Etheridge—it was but yesterday. After a cursory discourse, she mentioned that she expected in a few minutes to see a lady, who was going on the morrow to Philadelphia. I had written to you, and was not unwilling to make use of this opportunity; "What," I asked, "is her name, her character, her situation?" "Mary Wilmot; she has just come from New Haven, where she has passed the winter with a friend. She is amiable, but unfortunate." You will imagine with what emotions I listened to these words. For some minutes I was too much surprised to think or to speak clearly. My companion noticed my emotion, but before she could inquire into the cause, a visitant was announced, and Miss Wilmot herself entered the room. Being introduced to each other, my name occasioned as much surprise and embarrassment as her's had given to me. The interview ended abruptly; but not till I had so far collected my thoughts as to request her to be the bearer of a letter. She mentioned the place where it might be left, and we parted. I ought to have acted in a different manner—I ought to have asked her company home; have sought her confidence; have unbosomed myself to her, and removed every obstacle to her union with you, which might arise from an erring judgment or an unwise generosity. But I was unfitted for this by the suddenness of our interview. I had not time to subdue those trembling and mixed feelings which the sight of her produced, before she withdrew; and I had not courage enough to visit her at her lodgings, and be the bearer of my own letter. So much the more arduous is the task which belongs to you; my deficiencies must be supplied by you. Act uprightly and ingenuously, my friend, I entreat you; seek her presence, and shew her this and every other letter from me; offer her—beseech her—compel her to accept your vows. Accuse me not of fickleness; acquit me of mean and ungenerous behavior. Dream not that reasoning or entreaty will effect any change in my present sentiments. I love you, Philip, as I ought to love you—I love your happiness—your virtue. I resign you to this good girl, as to one who deserves you more than I; whose happiness is more dependent on the affections of another than mine is. What passion is now wanting in you, time will shortly supply. In such a case, you must and will act and feel as you ought. Let me not hear from you till you have seen her. I know whence will arise the failure of your efforts on such an interview. If she withstand your eloquence, it will be because you have betrayed your cause, or because she acts from a romantic and groundless generosity with regard to me. The last obstacle, it will be my province to remove; I will write to her, and convince her that by rejecting you on my account, she does me injury and not benefit, and is an enemy to your happiness; for while Mary lives, and is not bound to another, I will never be to you any thing but Your friend, Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIV. To Clara Howard. Philadelphia, May 13. MY FRIEND, I do not mean to reason with you. When I tell you that you are wrong, I am far from expecting your assent to my assertion. I say it not in a tone of bitterness or deprecation; I am calm, in this respect, as yourself; there is nothing to ruffle my calm. We fluctuate and are impatient only when doubtful of the future. Our fate being sealed, and an end being put to suspense and to doubt, the passions are still—sedateness and tranquillity at least are ours. There is nothing, I repeat, to ruffle my calm. I am not angry with you, for I know the purity and rectitude of your motives—your judgment only is misguided; but that is no source of impatience or repining to me; it is beyond my power, or that of time, to rectify your error. I do not pity you. You aspire to true happiness, the gift of self-approbation and of virtuous forbearance. You have adopted the means necessary to this end, and the end is gained—why then should I pity you?—You would not derive more happiness from a different decision. Another would indeed be more happy, but you would perhaps be less; at any rate, your enjoyments would not be greater than they now are, for what gratification can be compared to that arising from the sense of doing as we ought? I believe you in the wrong, and I tell you so. It is proper that the truth should be known; it is proper that my opinion, and the grounds of it, should be known to you; not that after this disclosure you will think or act differently; of that I have not the least hope. You are wrong, Clara; you study, it seems, the good of others; you desire the benefit of this girl, and since her happiness lies in being united to me, and in possessing my affections, you wish to unite us, and to transfer to her my love. It cannot be done; marry her I may, but I shall not love her—I cannot love her. This incapacity, you will think, argues infirmity and vice in me, and lessens me in your esteem. It ought not to produce this effect; it is a proof of neither wickedness nor folly. I cannot love her, because my affections are already devoted to one more attractive and more excellent than she. She has my reverence; if wedlock unites us, my fidelity will never be broken. I will watch over her safety with unfailing solicitude; she shall share every feeling and thought; the ties of the tenderest friendship shall be her's, but—nothing more. You will say that more is due to her; that a just man will add to every office of a friend the sanction of ineffable passion. I will not discuss with you the propriety of loving my wife, when her moral and intellectual excellence is unquestionable, and when all her love is bestowed upon me. I will only repeat, that passion will never be felt. 9 What then will be the fruit of marriage? Nothing but wo to her whom you labor, by uniting us, to make happy. You rely, however, on the influence of time and intercourse to beget that passion which is now wanting. And think you that this girl will wed a man who loves her not? She never will. Our union is impracticable, not from opposition or refusal on my side, but on hers. As to me, my concurrence shall be full, cheerful, zealous; argument and importunity will not be wanting. If they fail, you will ascribe their failure to my coldness, ambiguity, or artifice, or to mistaken generosity in her with regard to you. The last motive, after due representations, will not exist—the former cause may possess some influence, for I shall act with scrupulous sincerity. I shall counterfeit no passion and no warmth; the simple and unembellished truth shall be told to her, and this, I know, will be an insurmountable impediment. But suppose, for a moment, this obstacle to disappear, and that Mary is happy as the wife of one who esteems her indeed, but loves her not. Your end is accomplished—you proceed to reap the fruits of disinterested virtue, and contemplate the felicity which is your own work. This girl is the only one of God's creatures worthy of benevolence; no other is entitled to the sacrifice of your inclination. None there are in whose happiness you find a recompense for evils and privations befalling yourself. As to me, I am an inert and insensible atom, or I move in so remote a sphere that my pains or pleasures are independent of any will or exertion of yours. But no; that is a dignity of which I must not boast. I am so far sunk into depravity, that all my desires are the instigations of guilt, and all my pleasures those of iniquity. Duty tells you to withstand and to thwart, not to gratify my wishes. I love you, and my happiness depends upon your favor. Without you, or with another, I can know no joy; but this, in your opinion, is folly and perverseness; to aspire to your favor, when it is beyond my reach, is criminal infatuation; not to love her who loves me, and whose happiness depends upon my love, is, you think, cruel and unjust. Be it so; great indeed is my demerit. Worthless and depraved am I, but not single in iniquity and wretchedness; for the rule is fallacious that is not applicable to all others in the same circumstances. That conduct which in me is culpable, is no less culpable in others. Am I cruel and unjust in refusing my love to one that claims it? So are you, whose refusal is no less obstinate as to me, as mine with respect to another; and who hearkens not to claims upon your sympathy, as reasonable as those of Mary on mine. And how is it that Miss Wilmot's merits tower so far above mine? By placing her happiness in gaining affections which are obstinately withheld; by sacrificing the duty she owes herself, her fellow-creatures, and her God, to grief, because the capricious feelings of another have chosen a different object of devotion, does she afford no proof of infatuation and perverseness? Is she not at least sunk to a level with me? But Mary Wilmot and I are not the only persons affected by your decision—there is another more entitled to the affections of this woman than I, because he loves her; because, in spite of coldness, poverty, and personal defects; in spite of repulse from her, the aversion of his family, and the inticements of those to whom his birth, fortune, and exterior accomplishments have made him desirable, continues to love her. With regard to this man, is she not exactly in the same relation as I am to her? Is it not her duty to consult his happiness, and no longer oppose his laudable and generous wishes? For him and for me your benevolence sleeps; with regard to us, you have neither consideration nor humanity; they are all absorbed in the cause of one whose merits, whose claim to your sympathy and aid, if it be not less, is far from being greater than Sedley's or mine. My path is indeed plain; I mean to visit Miss Wilmot; but before I see her, I shall transmit to her all the letters that have passed between you and me on this subject, and particularly a copy of this. She shall not be deceived; she shall judge with all the materials of a right judgment before her. I am prepared to devote myself to her will— to join my fate to her's tomorrow. I do not fear any lessening of my reverence for her virtues, of that tenderness which will be her due, and which it becomes him to feel in whose hands is deposited the weal or wo of a woman truly excellent. We have wherewith to secure the blessings of competence; with that we will seek the shores of the Ohio, and devote ourselves to rural affairs. You and yours I shall strive to forget—justice to my wife and to myself will require this at my hand. Adieu. Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXV. To Mary Wilmot. Philadelphia, May 14. I am impatient to see you, and assure myself from your own lips of your welfare; but there is a necessity for postponing my visit till tomorrow evening—then I will see you; meanwhile, read the inclosed papers. One is a narrative of occurrences since the date of my last letter to you from Hatfield; the rest are letters that have been written to Miss Howard, or received from her, down to the present hour.— Read them, and reflect deeply and impartially on their contents; they require no preface or commentary. Make up your mind by evening, when I will attend you, with a heart overflowing with the affection of a friend, and prepared to perform, with zeal and cheerfulness, whatever the cause of your felicity requires from Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVI. To Miss Howard. Philadelphia, May 15. I sit down to relate what, perhaps, will afford you pain instead of pleasure. I know not whether I ought to give you pain by this recital. Having no longer the power of living for my own happiness, I had wrought up my mind to the fervent wish of living for the sake of another. I found consolation in the thought of being useful to a human being. Now my condition is forlorn and dreary. That sedate and mixed kind of happiness on which I had set my wishes is denied me. My last hope, meagre and poor as it was, is extinguished for ever. The fire that glowed in my bosom languishes; I am like one let loose upon a perilous sea, without rudder or sail. I have made preparations to leave this city tomorrow by the dawn of day, on a journey from which I neither wish nor expect to return. I at this moment anticipate the dawn of comfort from the scenes of the wilderness and of savage life; I begin to adopt, with seriousness, a plan which has often occurred to my juvenile reveries. In my uncle's parlor there hangs a rude outline of the continent of North America; many an hour have I gazed upon it, and indulged in that romantic love of enterprise for which I have ever been distinguished. My eye used to leap from the shore of Ontario, to the obscure rivulets which form, by their conflux, the Alleghany. This have I pursued through all its windings, till its stream was lost in that of the Ohio. Along this river have I steered and paddled my canoe of bark many hundreds of leagues, till the Mississippi was attained. Down that mighty current I allowed myself to be passively borne, till the mouths of the Missouri opened to my view. A more arduous task, and one hitherto unattempted, then remained for me; in the ardors of my fancy, all perils and hardships were despised, and I boldly adventured to struggle against the current of Missouri, to combat the dangers of an untried navigation, of hostile tribes, and unknown regions. Having gained the remotest sources of the river, I proceeded to drag my barque over mountains and rocks, till I lighted upon the valleys and streams that tend to the north and west. On one of these I again embarked. The rivulets insensibly swelled into majestic streams; lurking sands and overhanging cliffs gradually disappeared, and a river flowed beneath me, as spacious in its breadth and depth, and wandering through as many realms, as the Wolga or the Oronoco. After a tedious navigation of two thousand miles, I at last entered a bay of the ocean, and descried the shores of the great Pacific. This purpose being gained, I was little anxious to return, and allowed my fancy to range at will over the boundless field of contingencies, by some of 9* which I might be transported across the ocean to China, or along the coast to the dominions of the Spaniards. This scheme, suspended and forgotten for a while, I have now resumed. Tomorrow I go hence, in company with a person who holds a high rank in the Spanish districts westward of the Mississippi. You will not receive this letter, or be apprised of my intentions, till after I am gone. I shall despatch it at the moment of my leaving this city. I shall not write to Mr. Howard; I want not his aid or his counsel. I know that his views are very different from mine. I shall awaken opposition and remonstrance, which will answer no end but to give me torment and inquietude. To you I leave the task of informing him of my destiny, or allow him, if you please, to be wholly unacquainted with it—either conduct is indifferent to me. But there is one in whose welfare you condescend to take some interest, and of whom I am able to communicate some tidings. Some commands which you laid upon me in relation to Mary have been fulfilled, and I shall now acquaint you with the result. She sent me your letter not many hours after it was written, with a note informing me of her place of abode, and requesting a meeting with me. A letter from you by her hands, was a cause of sufficient wonder; but the contents of your letter were far more wonderful than the mode of its conveyance.—The handwriting assured me it was yours; the style and sentiments were alien to all that my fancy had connected with your name. With these tokens of profound indifference to my happiness, of ineffable contempt for my person and character, I compared the solicitude and tenderness which your preceding letter had breathed, and was utterly lost in horror and doubt. But this is not the strain in which I ought to write to you. Reason should set my happiness beyond the love or enmity of another, not wiser or more discerning or benevolent than myself. If reason be inadequate to my deliverance, pride should hinder me from disclosing my humiliation—from confessing my voluntary servitude. After my discomposure was somewhat abated, I proceeded to reflect on what was now to be done. Compliance with your dictates was obvious; since I was no longer of importance to your happiness, it was time to remember what was due to that angelic sufferer. I have already told you that I sent your letters, and promised to see her in the evening. I went at the appointed hour. I entered her apartment with a throbbing heart, for she is my friend. Near a year had passed since I had last seen her; this interval had been tormented with doubts of her safety, of her happiness, of her virtue, and even her existence. These doubts were removed, or about to be solved; my own eyes were to bear testimony to the truth of her existence. I was admitted to her; I hastened to communicate my wishes; I enforced them by all the eloquence that I was master of, but my eloquence was powerless. She was too blind an admirer, and assiduous a follower of Clara Howard, to accept my proffers. I abruptly withdrew. Heaven protect thee and her! I shall carry, I fear, the images of both of you along with me. Their company will not be friendly to courage or constancy. I shall shut them out as soon as I can, Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVII. To Miss Howard. Philadelphia, May 13, Noon. I feel some reluctance and embarrassment in addressing you in this manner; but am enabled, in some degree, to surmount them, by reflecting on the proofs which are now in my hands, of the interest which you take in my welfare, and of the inimitable generosity of your sentiments. I am likewise stimulated by the regard, which, in common with yourself, I feel for an excellent youth, to whose happiness this letter may essentially contribute. I have seen you but for a moment. I was prepared to find in you all that could inspire veneration and love. That my prepossessions, were fully verified, will perhaps redound little to the credit of my penetration or your beauty, since we seldom fail to discover in the features, tokens of all that we imagine to exist within. I know you by more copious and satisfactory means; by several letters which Philip Stanley has put into my hands. By these it likewise appears that you have some acquaintance with me, collected from the same source, and from the representations of my friend. The character and situation, the early history and unfortunate attachment of Mary, and that expedient which she adopted to free herself from useless importunities and repinings, are already known to you. This makes it needless for me to mention many particulars of my early life; they authorize the present letter, and allow me, or perhaps, to speak more truly, they enjoin me, to confide in you a relation of some incidents that have lately occurred. Your sensibility would render them of some moment in your eyes, should they possess no relation but to a forlorn and unhappy girl; but their importance will be greater, inasmuch as they are connected with your own destiny, and with that of one whom you justly hold dear. I shall claim your attention for as short a time as possible. A letter, written last autumn, to Philip Stanley, informing him of the motives that induced me to withdraw from his society, has been shewn to you; it will therefore be needless to explain these motives anew. I console myself with believing, that they merited and obtained the approbation of so enlightened and delicate a judge as Clara Howard. The place of my retreat was determined by the kind offers and solicitations of a lady, by name Valentine. In other circumstances, similar solicitations from her had been refused; but now I was anxious to retire to a great and unknown distance from my usual home—to retire without delay; but my health was imperfect. I was a female, without knowledge of the world, without the means of subsistence, and the season was cold and boisterous. Mrs. Valentine was opulent; her character entitled her to confidence and love; her engagements required her immediate departure; she would travel with all possible advantages; her new abode was at a great distance from my own; and she meant to continue absent during the ensuing year. There was but one consideration to make me hesitate. Her brother had long offered me his affections. Mrs. Valentine had been his advocate, and endeavored to win my favor, or, at least, to facilitate his own exertions, by promoting our intercourse. I had been hitherto unjust to the merits of this man. His constancy, his generosity, his gifts of person, understanding, and fortune, might have won the heart of a woman less prepossessed in favor of another. My indifference, my aversion, were proportioned to that fervent love with which my heart was inspired by another. I thought it my duty to avoid every means by which the impracticable wishes of Sedley might be fostered. For this end, I had hitherto declined most of those offers of friendship and intercourse with which I had been honored by his sister. My unhappy situation had now reduced me to the necessity of violating some of my maxims. I should never have accompanied Mrs. Valentine, however, had I not been previously assured that her brother designed to live at a distance. It was impossible to object to his design of accompanying us to the end of our journey. That journey was accomplished. We arrived at the eve of winter, in the neighborhood of Boston. The treatment I received from my friend was scrupulously delicate; she acted with the frankness and affection of a sister; but I think with shame on that absurd pride which hindered me from practising the same candor. I was born in an affluent condition; but the misfortunes of my parents, while they trained me up in a thousand prejudices, left me at the age of eighteen totally destitute of property or friends. There was no human being on whom the customs of the world would allow me to depend. My only relation was a younger brother, who was still a boy, and who needed protection as much as myself. In this state, I had recourse for honest bread to my needle; but the bread thus procured was mingled with many bitter tears. I conceived myself degraded by my labor; my penury was aggravated by remembrance of my former enjoyments. I shrunk from the salutation, or avoided the path of my early companions; I imagined that they would regard my fallen state with contempt, or with pity, no less hard to be endured than scorn. I labored sometimes, by unjustifiable and disingenuous artifices, to conceal my employments and my wants, and masked my cares as well as I was able, under cheerful looks. This spirit led me to conceal from Mrs. Valentine my forlorn condition. I looked forward without hope, to the hour when new labor would be requisite to procure for me shelter and food. For these I was at present indebted to my friend; but I loved to regard myself merely as a visitant, and anticipate the time when I should cease to lie under obligation. Meanwhile, there were many little and occasional sources of expense, to which my ill-supplied purse was unequal, while a thousand obstacles existed under this roof, to any profitable application of my time; hence arose new cause of vexation, and new force to my melancholy. All my stratagems could not conceal from my friend my poverty. For a time she struggled to accommodate herself to my scruples, and to aid me, without seeming to know the extent of my necessities. These struggles were frustrated by my obstinate pride; I steadily refused either money or credit. At length she resolved to enter into full explanations with me on the subject. She laid before me, with simplicity and candor, all her suspicions and surmises, and finally extorted from me a confession that I was not mistress of a single dollar in the world; that I had no kinsman to whom I could betake myself for the supply of my wants; no fund on which I was authorized to draw for a farthing. This declaration was heard with the strongest emotion. She betrayed surprise and disappointment. After a pause, she expressed her astonishment at this news. She reminded me how little it agreed with past appearances. She had known me during the latter part of my brother's life, and since. My brother's profession had apparently been useful to my subsistence, and since his death, though indeed the period had been short, I had lived in a neat seclusion, and at leisure. These hints induced me to be more frank in my disclosures. I related what is already known to you; the fate of the money which I inherited from my brother, the doubtful circumstances that attended my brother's possession, and the irresistible claims of Morton. Every word of my narrative added anew to my friend's surprise and disappointment. She continued for a long time silent; but much disquiet was betrayed by her looks. I mistook these for signs of disapprobation of my conduct, and began to justify myself. "Dear Madam, would you not, in my place, have acted in this manner?" "Just so, Mary; your conclusion was highly plausible." "I believe my conclusion," replied I, "to be certain. I did not require any stronger proof of Morton's title." "And yet his claim was fallacious. This money was yours, and only yours." This assertion was made with a confidence that convinced me of its truth, and caused my mind instantly to adopt a new method of accounting for the acquisition of this money. My eyes, fixed upon my companion, betrayed my suspicion that my benefactress was before me. Humiliation and gratitude were mingled in my heart; tears gushed from my eyes while I pressed her hand to my lips. "Ah!" said I, "if Morton were not the giver, who should know the defects of his title but the real giver?" "Your gratitude, Mary, is misplaced. You might easily imagine that my funds would never allow me to be liberal to that amount." "Is it not you? Whose then was the bounteous spirit? You are at least acquainted with the real benefactor." "I confess that I am; but may not be authorized to disclose the name." I besought her to disclose the name. "The motive," said my friend, "is obvious. It could only be the dread that, knowing your scrupulousness on this head, you would refuse the boon, and thus frustrate a purpose truly benevolent. This apprehension being removed, there can certainly be no reason for concealment. I am entirely of your opinion, that the author of every good deed should be known not only to the subject of the benefit, but to all mankind." After much solicitation, she at length confessed that this money was the gift of Mr. Sedley to my brother. She stated the motives of this uncommon liberality. Sedley had made his sister acquainted with his passion for me, and had engaged her counsel and aid. Her counsel had always been, to abandon a pursuit where success was hopeless.— "Perceiving your reluctance," continued my friend, "and finding it to arise from a passion for another, I earnestly dissuaded him from persisting in claims, which were hurtful to you without profiting himself. His passion sometimes led him to accuse you of frowardness and obstinacy; and, at those times, I had much ado to defend you, and to prove your right to consult your own happiness. "But these moments, I must say, in justice to my brother, were few. I could generally reason him into better temper. He could see, at least for a time, the propriety of ceasing to vex you with entreaties and arguments, and was generous enough to wish you happiness, even with another. This spirit led him to inquire into the character and condition of your chosen friend. For this purpose he cultivated the acquaintance of your brother, and discovered that the only obstacle to your union with young Stanley, was your mutual poverty. After many struggles, many fits of jealousy and anger, and melancholy, he determined to lay aside every selfish wish, and to remove this obstacle to your happiness, by giving you possession of sufficient property. "This undertaking was in the highest degree arduous and delicate. To make the offer directly to you was chimerical. No power on earth, he well knew, could persuade you to receive a free gift in money from one whose pretensions had been such as his. To bestow it upon Stanley would be exposing the success of his scheme to hazard; his scruples would be likely to exclaim against such a gift, as loudly as yours, especially when attended with those conditions which it would be necessary to prescribe. There was likewise no certainty that his gift might not be diverted by Stanley to other purposes than those which he sought; neither did he wish to insure your marriage with another, upon terms which should appear to lay you under obligations to that other. Besides, your union with Stanley was, in some degree, uncertain; a thousand untoward events might occur to protract or prevent it, whereas your poverty was a present and constant evil. "After discussing a great number of expedients, he adopted one at length, which perhaps, was as unskilful as any which he could have lighted on. By talking with your brother, he found him possessed of a quick, indignant, and lofty spirit; one that recoiled from pecuniary obligations; that placed a kind of glory in being poor; and in devoting his efforts to benevolent, rather than to lucrative purposes. He saw that direct offers of money, to any considerable amount, and accompanied with no conditions, or by conditions which respected his sister, would be disdainfully rejected, he determined, therefore, to leave him no option, and to put a certain sum in his possession, without it being possible for him to discover the donor, or to refuse the gift. This sum was therefore sent to him, under cover of a short billet, without signature, and in a disguised hand. "The scheme was not disclosed to me till after it was executed. I did not approve it; I am no friend to indirect proceedings. I was aware of many accidents that might make this gift a hurtful one, or, at least, useless to the end Sedley proposed. Your brother's scruples, which hindered him from openly accepting it, were likely to prevent him from applying so large a sum to his own, or to your benefit; he would either let it lie idle in his coffers, under the belief that so ambiguous a transfer gave him no right to it, or he would more probably spend it on some charitable scheme. I was acquainted with his enthusiasm, in the cause of what he called the good of mankind, and that his notions of the goods and evils of life differed much from those of his sister. "This act, however, was not to be recalled, and it was useless to make my brother repent of his precipitation. I I hoped that his intention would not be defeated, and watched the conduct of your brother very carefully, to discover the effect of his new acquisition. The effect was such as I expected. Your brother's mode of life underwent no change, and the money, as there were easy means of discovering, lay in one of the banks untouched. "My curiosity was awakened anew at your brother's death, and Sedley had the satisfaction of perceiving that your condition was visibly improved. You no longer hired out your labor; you lived in retirement indeed, but with some degree of neatness; and your time was spent in improving and adorning your mind, and in those offices of kindness and charity which, however arduous in themselves, are made light by the consciousness of dignity attending them. 10 "I admire and love you, and that day which would make you my sister, I should count the happiest of my life. You have treated me with much distance and reserve; but I flattered myself that my overtures to intimacy had been rejected not on my own account, but on that of my brother. Since you have been my companion, I have noticed the proofs of your poverty with great uneasiness. I know that your money, all but a few hundred dollars, still lies in one of the banks. Will you pardon me for having been attentive to your conduct? For my brother's sake, and for your own, I have watched all your movements, and could tell you the times and portions in which these hundreds have been drawn out; and have formed very plausible guesses as to the mode in which you have disposed of them. "How to reconcile your seeming poverty with the possession of some thousands; how to account for your acquiescence in my wishes to attend me hither, and for forbearing to use any more of this money for the supply of your own wants, has puzzled me a great deal. I perceive that you have dropped all intercourse with your former friend, and given up yourself a prey to melancholy. These things have excited, you will imagine, a great deal of reflection; but I have patiently waited till you yourself have thought proper to put aside the curtain that is drawn between us. This you have at length done, and I, in my turn, have disclosed what I am afraid my brother will never forgive me for doing." I could not but be deeply affected by this representation. The generosity of Sedley and his sister; their perseverance in laboring for my good, when no personal advantage, not even the homage of a grateful spirit, could flow to themselves, made me feel the stings of somewhat like ingratitude. The merits and claims of Sedley came now to assume a new aspect. I had hitherto suffered different objects to engross my attention. I did not applaud or condemn myself for my conduct towards him, merely because I did not think of him. I was occupied by gloomy reveries, in which no images appeared but those of Stanley and my brother. Now the subjects of my thoughts were changed; time had insensibly, and in some degree, worn out those deep traces which I brought away with me from Abingdon. Pity and complacency, and reverence for Sedley; gratitude to his sister, from whom I had received so many favors, and who would deem herself amply repaid by my consent to make her brother happy, hourly gained ground in my heart. These tendencies did not escape my friend, who endeavored to strengthen and promote them. She insisted on the merits of her brother, arising from the integrity of his life, the elevation of his sentiments, and especially the constancy of his affection to me. She praised my self denial with regard to Stanley, and hinted that my duty to him was but half performed. It became me to shew that my happiness was consistent with self denial. "Marriage with Miss Howard will give him but little pleasure," she said, "while he is a stranger to your fate, or while he knows that you are unhappy. For his sake it becomes you to shake off all useless repinings. To waste your days in this dejection, in longings after what is unattainable, and what you have voluntarily given up, is contemptible, and, indeed, criminal. You have profited but little by the lessons of that religion you profess, if you see not the impiety of despair, and the necessity of changing your conduct. You have indeed fallen into a very gross error with regard to your friend. In some respects, you have treated him in an inhuman manner." "Good Heaven, Mrs. Valentine, in what respect have I been inhuman?" "Have you not detailed to me the contents of the letter which you left behind you at Abingdon? In that letter have you not assured him that your heart was broken? that you expected and wished for death?—wishes that sprung from the necessity there was of renouncing his love. Have you not given him reason to suppose that you are enduring all the evils of penury and neglect? That you are languishing in some obscure corner, unknown, neglected, forgotten, and despised by all mankind? Have you not done this?" "Alas! it is too true." "Not to mention that this picture was by no means justified by the circumstances in which you left Abingdon, and in which you could not but expect to pass the winter, amidst all the comforts which my character, my station in society, my friends, my fortune, and my friendship, must bestow; not to mention these things, which rendered your statement to him untrue, what must have been the influence of this picture upon the feelings of that generous youth? Can you not imagine his affliction?" "O yes, indeed I can. I was wrong; I now see my error. I believed that I should not have survived to this hour; I wanted to cut off every hope, every possibility of his union with me." "And do you think that by that letter, this end was answered? Do you not perceive that Stanley's sympathy for you must have been infinitely increased by that distressful picture? that his resolution to find you out in your retreat, and compel you to be happy, would receive tenfold energy? You imagine yourself to have resigned him to Miss Howard, but your letter and your flight could only bind him by stronger ties to yourself. Should this lady be inclined to favor Stanley, of what materials must her heart be composed, if she do not refuse, or at least, hesitate to interfere with your claims? If she do not refuse, how must her happiness be embittered by reflections on your forlorn state? for no doubt the young man's sincerity will make her mistress of your story." "Do not dwell upon this theme," said I, "I am grieved for my folly. I have been very wrong; tell me rather, my beloved monitor, what I ought to have done—what I may still do." "It would be useless to dwell on what is past, and cannot be undone; the future is fully in your power. Without doubt, you ought to hasten to repair the errors you have committed." "By what means?" "They are obvious. You must dismiss these useless, these pernicious regrets, which, in every view, religious or moral, are criminal; you must give admission to cheerful thoughts, fix your attention on the objects of useful knowledge, study the happiness of those around you, be affable and social, and entitle yourself to the friendship and respect of the many amiable persons who live near us; above all, make haste to inform Stanley of your present condition, disclose to him your new prospects of being useful and happy, and teach him to be wise by your example. But let your kindness be most shewn where your power is greatest, and where you are most strongly bound by the ties of gratitude. Think of my brother as he merits to be thought of—hasten to reward him for those years of anguish which your perverseness has given him, and which have consumed the best part of his life." "But how shall I gain an interview with Stanley? I know not where he is. You say that my draft has never been presented; it must be so, since the money is still there, in my own name. Some accident perhaps has befallen him; he may not be alive to receive the fruits of my repentance." "Set your heart at rest," replied my friend, with a significant smile; "he is well." "Indeed! You speak as if you had the means of knowing. Surely, Madam, you know nothing of him." "I know enough of him. He is now in New York, in the same house with Miss Howard." "In the same house? And—perhaps—married?" "Fie upon you, Mary. Is this the courage you have just avowed, to turn pale, to falter at the mere possibility of what you have so earnestly endeavored to accomplish?" "Forgive me—it was a momentary folly. He is then— married?" "No. They live under the same roof; but it is nothing but a vague surmise that they will ever be married." "Dear lady, by what means—" "Through my brother's letters, which, if you please to read them, will give you all the information that I possess. Why that sudden gravity? They will not taint your fingers, or blast your sight; they are worthy of my brother, and will depict truly that character which you could not fail to love, if you were but thoroughly acquainted with it." This rebuke suppressed the objection which I was going to raise against perusing these letters. They were put into my hands; they contained no information respecting Stanley, but that he resided at New York. They contained, chiefly, incidents and reflections relative to Sedley and to me; in this respect they were copious. I read them often, and found myself daily confirmed in the resolutions which I began to form. I need not dwell upon the struggles which I occasionally experienced, and those fits of profound melancholy into which I was still sometimes plunged; I shall only say, that listening only to the dictates 10* of justice and gratitude, and to the pathetic remonstrances of my friend, I finally prevailed upon myself to consent to her brother's wishes. I should have written to Stanley, informing him of my destiny; but I proposed to return to Philadelphia with Mrs. Valentine, and hoped to meet him there, or at New York. I was not unaware of the effects of an interview with him. My soul was tremulous with doubt, and torn by conflicting emotions. I was ready, in dreary moments, to revoke my promise to Sedley, to trust once more to some kind chance that might make Stanley mine, or to consecrate my life to mournful recollections of my lost happiness. These were transient moments, and the bitter tears which attended them were soon dried up. I found complacency in the resolution to devote my life to Sedley's happiness, and to the society of his beloved sister. Having arrived at New York, I was told of Stanley's absence, and learned that he was then somewhere southward. I was informed by Mrs. Etheridge, with whom Sedley made me acquainted, of your general character. I wanted to see you; to know you; to repose my thoughts in your bosom; to be Stanley's advocate with you; but I could not procure sufficient courage to request an introduction to you. A thousand scruples deterred me. I thought that to justify confidence and candor on such delicate topics, much time and many interviews would be necessary; but I could not remain in New York beyond a day. I went to Mrs. Etheridge strangely perplexed. Perhaps I should have ventured to beseech that lady's company to your house; but the meeting that took place on that occasion, confused me beyond the possibility of regaining composure. The superscription of your letter added to my surprise, and made me more willing to decline a meeting, since this letter would guide me to the very spot where Stanley was to be found. I once more entered my native city. Sedley was prepared to meet and welcome me. He was apprised of my intention as to Stanley, and did not disapprove—he even wrote the billet by which I invited your friend to come to my lodgings. My purpose was to unfold the particulars contained in this letter to Stanley, and to introduce my two friends to each other. In answer to my billet I received a voluminous packet, containing certain letters and narratives relative to him and to you. How shall I describe my feelings on perusing them! They supply the place of a thousand conversations; they leave nothing to be said; they take away every remnant of hesitation; they inspire me with new virtue and new joy. I am not grieved that Stanley and his Clara are subjected to trials of their magnanimity, since I foresee the propitious issue of the trial. I am not grieved that the happiness of Mary has been an object of such value in your eyes, as to merit the sacrifice of your own. I exult that my feelings are akin to your's, and that it is in my power to vie with you in generosity. But Stanley's last letter gives me pain; the more, because in the tenor of your's which preceded it, there is an apparent harshness, not, perhaps, to be mistaken by an unimpassioned reader, but liable to produce fallacious terrors in a heart deeply enamoured. I see the extent of this error in him; but am consoled by hoping that my reasoning, when we meet, or at least, that time will dispel this unfriendly cloud. I am impatient for his coming. Mary Wilmot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVIII. To Miss Howard. Philadelphia, May 13. My friend, we have met, but such a meeting! The letters had told me of his sickness, but I expected not to behold a figure so wan, so feeble, so decayed. I expected much anxiety—much conflict in his features, between apprehension and hope; but not an aspect so wild, so rueful, so melancholy. His deportment and his words were equally adverse to my expectations. After our first tears of congratulation were exhausted, he exclaimed, in a tone of unusual vehemence—"Why, my friend, have you thus long abandoned me? You have been unjust to yourself and to me; and I know not how to pardon you, except on one condition." "What is that?" "That we now meet to be united by the strongest ties, and never to part more. On that condition I forgive you." I was prepared for this question; but the tones and looks with which it was accompanied, and especially its abruptness, disconcerted me—I was silent. "I came to this interview," resumed he, "with one determination. I will not tremble, or repine, or upbraid, because my confidence in the success of my efforts is perfect, and not to be shaken. I came to offer you the vows of a husband. They are now offered, and received. You have no power to decline them. Let me then salute you as—my wife." I shrunk back, and spread out my hand to repulse him. I was still unable to speak. "I told you the purpose of my coming," said he, in a solemn tone; "this purpose is the dearest to my heart. Of every other good I am bereaved; but to the attainment of this there can be no obstacle but caprice, or inhumanity, or folly; such as I never can impute to you. If you love me, if you have regard to my welfare, if you wish me to love, grant me that good which is all that remains to endear existence. If you refuse this gift, I shall instantly vanish from society. I shall undertake a journey, in which my life will be exposed to numberless perils. If I pass them in safety, I shall be dead to all the offices and pleasures of civilized existence. I shall hasten to embrute all my faculties. I shall make myself akin to savages and tygers, and forget that I once was a man. This is no incoherent intimation; it is the fixed purpose of my soul, to be changed only by your consenting to be mine. Ponder well on the consequences of a refusal—it decides my everlasting destiny." "Have you not read my letter? Have I not read your's and Clara's? How then can you expect my concurrence? Have you not anticipated my refusal?" "I anticipated misery. Having found injustice and a callous heart in another, where I least expected to find them, I was prone, in the bitterness of disappointment, to ascribe them to every human creature; but that was rash and absurd —Mary cannot be unjust." "To whom do you impute a hard heart?" "Not to you. You merit not the imputation; you will prove yourself compassionate and good; you will not scorn me, cast me off, drive me into hopeless exile, and inextricable perils. You are too good, and have been too long my friend; the partaker of my cares; the solace of my being; the rewarder of my tenderness. You will not reject me—banish me—kill me." "You know not what you say; your thoughts are confused. You love, and are beloved by another—by one who merits your eternal devotion and gratitude. They are due to her, and never will I rob her of them." "What mean you? Did not you say you had read the packets? and do not these inform you that I have no place in the affections of any human being but yourself? Convince me that I have, indeed, a place in yours—that I am not utterly deserted. Consent to be mine own—my beloved wife, and thus make me as happy as my fate will permit." "Alas, my friend! you are not in your right mind. Disappointment has injured your reason, or you could never solicit me thus—you could never charge Clara Howard with a hard heart." "Talk not of Clara Howard—talk only of yourself and of me. Rid me of suspense and anxiety, by consenting to my wishes—make me happy. Take away, at least, the largest portion of my misery, by your consent. Will you not be mine?" "Never. Former objections time has rendered more strong; but your letters would have fixed my resolutions, had they wavered. These shew how far the happiness of of Miss Howard and your own depend upon my perseverance; and persevere I must." "What mean you? Miss Howard's happiness, say you, depends upon your noncompliance with her wishes; on your rejecting the prayers she has made with the utmost degree of earnestness?" "They are generous prayers, which suppose me weaker, and more infatuated than I am. They are prayers which counteract their own purpose, since they exhibit an example of disinterestedness and self-oblivion, which I cannot fail to admire and to imitate. Our cases are indeed not parallel. Her love for you is answered and returned by equal love. To me your heart is indifferent, and I have resolved to conquer my perverse affections, or perish." "You have read her letters—her last letter, and you talk of her love! Once, I grant, it might have been—it was so; but that time of affability, of softness, of yielding, is gone; she is now rugged, austere, unfeeling. Her preposterous abstractions and refinements have gained force through the coldness of her heart. There is no self-sacrifice, for she loves me not; there is no regard for my welfare or felicity, for she loves me not." "O, Philip, can you be so perverse, so unjust? You merit not the love of so pure a spirit; you merit not the happiness which such a one is qualified to give you. But your disappointment has disturbed your reason. I can pity and forgive you, and will intercede with her for your forgiveness. I see her merits and her superior claims too clearly, ever to consent to your separation. You are discomposed," I continued, "surely you have been very sick. You seem to have just risen from the grave, you are so pale, so wan, so feeble. Your state of health has made you unfit to judge truly of the motives of your friend, and to adopt her magnanimity. If you will have patience, I can convince you that it is my duty to reject your offers, and that Clara Howard may still, if you please, be yours." "Then," replied he, "you do reject them?" "Do not look so wildly. I am sure you are not well. You seem ready to sink upon the floor; you are cold— very cold. Let us defer this conversation a little while. I have much to say on the subject of my history, since we parted. That being known to you, you will see reason to judge differently of my motives for rejecting your offers; instead of making that rejection more difficult by importunity and vehemence, you will see the justice of concurring with me, and of strengthening my resolution." "Impossible," said he, "that any thing has happened to change my views. Are not your affections, merits, and integrity, the same as formerly? Answer me sincerely." "I will—I have no reason for concealment. Time has not lessened my merits, it is true; but—" "That assurance is enough for me. I will eagerly listen to your story, but not until my fate is decided. Have pity on that sinking frame, and that wounded heart which you behold; there is but one cure, and that is deposited in your hands. To every other my joy or sorrow, my life or death is indifferent. Will you take me to your bosom? Shall my image be fostered, and my soul find peace there? or shall I cast myself upon a sea of storms and perils, and vanish from this scene for ever?" "How you grieve me! I beseech you be not so impetuous. Listen to my story first, and then say in what manner I ought to act." "There is no room for delay. Say you will be mine, and then I shall enjoy repose; I shall be able to listen. Till then I am stretched upon the rack. Answer me; will you be mine?" "O, no!" I replied; "while I have a heart not wholly sordid and selfish, I cannot consent; my conscience will not let me." "Find consolation," he answered, "in the approbations of that conscience, for a sentence that has ratified the doom of one who deserved differently from you. I perceive you are inflexible, and will therefore leave you." "But whither are you going? Will you not return to Clara? "To Clara! No. Far different is the path that I am to tread. I shall never see her more." He now moved towards the door, as if going. "Philip, what can you mean? Stay; do not go till you have heard me further. I entreat you, as you value my peace, and my life, hear me further." "Will you then consent?" said he, returning with a more cheerful brow. "How good you are! The same dear girl; the same angelic benignity as formerly. Confirm my happiness by new assurances; confirm it by permitting this embrace." I was compelled to avert my face; to repulse him from my arms. "To what unlooked-for trials have you subjected me! but I must not retract my resolutions. No, Philip, the bar between us is insuperable. I must never be yours." "Never!—never!—be mine!—Well—May the arms of a protecting Providence encircle thee! may some other rise to claim and possess thy love! may ye never, neither thou nor Clara, know remorse for your treatment of me!" Saying this, he snatched his hat from the table, and ran out of the house. I called, but he was gone beyond my hearing. I was justly alarmed by this frantic demeanor. I knew not how to account for it, but by imagining that some remains of delirium still afflicted his understanding. I related this conversation to Sedley. I entreated him to pursue Philip to his lodgings, to prevail upon him to return hither; or to calm his mind, by relating what his abrupt departure had prevented me from saying. Sedley cheerfully complied with my request; but Stanley was not to be found at his lodging. He waited his return till ten, eleven, and twelve o'clock, but in vain. Meanwhile, I found some relief in imagining they had met; that Sedley's address and benevolence had succeeded in restoring our friend to better thoughts. My disappointment and alarm at his return, on hearing that Stanley had not been met with, were inexpressible. That night passed away without repose. Early the next morning, I again entreated Sedley to go in search of the fugitive. He went, but presently returned to inform me that Stanley had set out in the stage for Baltimore, at day-dawn. I cannot comprehend his intimations of a journey to the wilderness; of embruting his faculties; of exposing his humanity, his life, to hazard. Could he have interpreted your letters into avowals of hatred or scorn, or even of indifference? One, indeed, who knew you less perfectly, might impute to you a rigor in judging; a sternness not suitable to the merits of this youth. Your letters are void of that extenuating spirit, that reluctance to inflict sufferings, which, perhaps, the wisest inflexibility will not be slow to feel, or unwilling to express. But Philip had sufficient knowledge to save him from a wrong construction. Yet that, alas! is not true. He ought to have had that knowledge; but it was wanting. Possibly he has not told you his designs. He cannot inform you of the truth with respect to me. My present situation should be known to you, to enable you to act with propriety. I shall not prescribe to you; I am not mistress of your thoughts and motives; may Heaven direct you right. A friend will go to Baltimore on Tuesday, time enough for you to receive this, and to write to Philip. If sent to me, I will entrust it to my friend. I have not time to add a word more. Accept the reverence and love of Mary Wilmot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIX. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 15. Stanley, how shall I address you? In terms of indignation or of kindness? Shall I entreat you to return, or exhort you to obey the wild dictates of caprice? Shall I leave you to your froward destiny, and seek, in the prospect of a better world, a relief from the keen distress, the humiliating sorrows of this scene of weakness and error? Shall I link my fate with one who is deaf to the most pathetic calls of his duty? who forgets or spurns the most urgent obligations of gratitude? whom the charms of nature, the attractions of science, the claims of helpless and fond sisters, who trust for shelter, for bread, for safety from contempt, and servitude, and vice, to his protection, his counsel, his presence, cannot detain from forests and wilds, where inevitable death awaits him? Shall I bestow one drop of tender remembrance on him who upbraids and contemns me for sacrificing every selfish regard to his dignity; for stifling in my bosom that ignoble passion which makes us trample on the claims of others, which seeks its own gratification at the price of humanity and justice, which can smile in the midst of repinings and despair, of creatures no less worthy, no less susceptible of good? 11 You say that I love you not. Till this moment your assertion was untrue. My heart was not free, till these proofs of your infatuation and your folly were set before me. Till now, I was willing to account you not unworthy. I hoped that time and my efforts would reclaim you to some sense of equity and reason. But now—must I then deem you utterly lost? Have you committed this last and irretrievable act? O, no! it was surely but a momentary madness; the fit will be past before this letter reaches you; you will have opened your eyes to the cowardice, the ignominy, the guilt of this flight; you will hasten to close those wounds which have rent my heart; you will return to me with the speed of the wind, and make me, by the rectitude of your future conduct, forget that you have ever erred. Has it come to this! now, that the impediment has vanished, that my feelings may be indulged at the cost of no one's peace; now that the duty which once so sternly forbade me to be yours, not only permits, but enjoins me to link together our fates; that the sweet voice of an approving conscience is ready to sanction and applaud every impulse of my heart, and make the offices of tenderness not only free from guilt, but coincident with every duty; that now— Philip, let me hope that thou hast hesitated, doubted, lingered in thy fatal career—let me foster this hope that I may retain life. My fortitude, alas! is unequal to this test. No disaster should bereave me of serenity and courage; but to this, while I despise myself for yielding, I must yield. If this letter do not reach thee—if it fill not thy heart with remorse, thy eyes with tenderness—if it cure thee not of thy phrenzy, and bring thee not back— It must—it will. Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXX. To Philip Stanley. Philadelphia, May 15. What has become of that fortitude, my friend, which I was once accustomed to admire in you? You used to be circumspect, sedate, cautious; not precipitate in judging or resolving. What has become of all these virtues? Why would you not give your poor friend a patient hearing? Why not hesitate a moment, before you plunged all whom you love into sorrow and distress? Was it impossible for six months of reflection to restore the strength of my mind, to introduce wiser resolutions and more cheerful thoughts, than those with which I parted from you? I was then sick. My lonely situation, the racking fears your long silence had produced, a dreary and lowering sky, and the tidings your letter conveyed of my return again to that indigence so much detested by my pride, were surely enough to sink me deeply in despondency; to make me, at the same time, desire and expect my death. I saw the bright destiny that was reserved for you. My life, I thought, stood in the way of your felicity. I knew your impetuous generosity, your bewitching eloquence. I knew the frailty of my own heart. Hence my firm resolve to shun an interview with you, to see you no more, at least till your destiny had been accomplished. Happy was the hour in which I formed this resolution. By it I have not only secured that indirect happiness, arising from the contemplation of yours, but the ineffable bliss of requiting that love, of which my heart was so long insensible. Yes, my friend, the place that you once possessed in my affections, is now occupied by another—by him of whose claims I know you have always been the secret advocate— by that good, wise, and generous man, whom I always admitted to be second to yourself; but for whom my heart now acknowledges a preference. Had you waited for an explanation of my sentiments, you would have saved me, your beloved Clara, yourself, and all your friends, the anxieties your present absence has produced. That rashness may excite remorse, but it cannot be recalled; let it then be speedily forgotten, and let this letter put a stop to your flight. Dear Philip! come back. All the addition of which my present happiness is capable, must come from you. The heart-felt approbation, the sweet ineffable complacency with which my present feelings are attended, want nothing to merit the name of perfect happiness, but to be witnessed and applauded by you. Your Clara—that noblest of women, joins me in recalling you, and is as eager to do justice to your passion, as I am to recompense the merits of Sedley; therefore, my friend, if you value my happiness or Clara's, come back. Will you not obey the well known voice, calling you to virtue and felicity, of Your sister, Mary Wilmot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXI. To Clara Howard. Wilmington, May 17. I have received and have read your letter. To say thus much is enough. From what a depth of humiliation and horror have I emerged! How quickly was I posting to my ignominy and my ruin! Your letter overtook me at this place, where a benignant fate decreed that I should be detained by sickness.—Clara, thou hast judged truly. My eyes are open to my folly, and my infatuation. The mists that obscured my sight are gone; I am once more a reasonable creature. How shall I atone for my past misconduct, or compensate thee, my heavenly monitor, for the disquiet which thou hast endured for my sake? By hasting to thy feet, and pouring out before thee the tears of my repentance. Thy forgiveness is all that I dare claim—thy tenderness I do not merit. Years of service and self-denial, are requisite to qualify me for receiving that best gift. Your letter, with one from Mary, were left upon my pillow by a traveller passing through this town to Baltimore. I had swallowed laudanum, to secure me some sleep, on the night of my arrival hither. I was unable to proceed further, my mind and body being equally distempered. After a perturbed sleep, I awoke before the light, and lifting my head from the pillow, to acquaint myself with my situation, I perceived, by the light of a candle on the hearth, a packet lying beside me. I snatched it with eagerness, and found enclosed, thy letter, and one from Mary. For a time, I imagined myself still dreaming. The contents of each letter so far surpassed and deceived every expectation—every wish that I had formed; such pure and unmerited felicity was offered me, and by means so abrupt and inexplicable, that I might well hesitate to believe it real. Next morning, on inquiry, I discovered that a midnight coach had arrived, in which a traveller, chancing to hear of my condition, and my name, entered my apartment, while I slept, and left this packet, which, as I saw, was intended to have been conveyed to Baltimore. My fever, though violent, proved to be merely an intermittent. By noon this day, though feeble and languid, I was freed from disease; I am also free from anxiety. The purest delight thrills in my bosom, mixed now and then, and giving place to compunction, for the folly of my late schemes. In truth, I have been sick; since the perusal of thy letter by Mary, I have been half crazy, shivering and glowing by turns; bereft of appetite and restless—every object was tinged with melancholy liues. But I shall not try to extenuate my fault. May thy smiles, my beloved Clara, and thy voice, musical and thrilling as it used to be, disperse every disquiet. No time shall be lost in returning to thee. My utmost haste will not enable me to offer thee, before Tuesday morning, the hand and heart of Philip Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXII. To Philip Stanley. New York, May 19. You are coming, my friend. I shall chide you and thank you in the same breath, for your haste. I hope you will incur no injury by a journey at night. Knowing that you mean not to lay by, I am unable to go to bed. The air was blustering in the evening, and now, at midnight, it blows a storm. It is not very cold, but a heavy rain is falling. I sit by my chamber fire, occupied in little else than listening to it; and my heart droops, or gains courage, according to the pauses or increases of the wind and rain. Would to Heaven thou hadst not this boisterous river to cross. It is said to be somewhat dangerous in a high wind. This is a land of evils; the transitions of the seasons are so quick, and into such extremes. How different from the pictures which our fancy drew in our native land! This wind and rain! how will you endure them in your crazy vehicle, thumping over rocks, and sinking into hollows?—I wish you had not been in such haste; twenty hours sooner or later would be of no moment; and this river—to cross it at any time, is full of danger—what must it be at night, and in a storm? Your adventurous spirit will never linger on the opposite shore till day dawns, and the wind has died away. But well know I the dangers and toils of a midnight journey, in a stage-coach, in America. The roads are knee deep in mire, winding through crags and pits, while the wheels groan and totter, and the curtains and roof admit the wet at a thousand seams. It is three, and the day will soon come. How I long to see thee, my poor friend! Having once met, never, I promise thee, will we part more. This heart, with whose treasures thou art imperfectly acquainted, will pour all its sorrows and joys into thy honest bosom. My maturer age, and more cautious judgment, shall be counsellors and guides to thy inexperienced youth. While I love thee and cherish thee as a wife, I shall assume some of the prerogatives of an elder sister, and put my circumspection and forethought in the balance against thy headlong confidence. I revere thy genius and thy knowledge. With the improvements of time, very far wilt thou surpass the humble Clara; but in moral discernment, much art thou still deficient; here I claim to be more than equal; but the difference shall not subsist long. Our modes of judging and our maxims shall be the same; and this resemblance shall be purchased at the cost of all my patience, my skill, and my love. Alas! this rain is heavy. The gale whistles more loudly than ever. Would to Heaven thou wast safely seated near me, at this quiet fireside! Clara Howard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXIII. To Mary Wilmot. New York, May 21. Rejoice with me, my friend; Stanley is arrived; and has been little incommoded by his journey. He has brought with him your letter. Will you pardon me for omitting to answer it immediately, and as fully as it deserves? As soon as the tumults of my joy settle down into calm, unruffled felicity, I will comment upon every sentence; at present, I must devote myself to console this good lad for his sufferings, incurred, as he presumes to say, entirely on my account. And so you have deferred the happiness of your Sedley for a whole month. I wonder he has any patience with you; but he that has endured, without much discontent, the delay of six or eight years (is it not so long?) ought to be ashamed of his impatience at a new delay of a few weeks. Dear Mary, shall I tell you a secret? If you add one week of probation to the four already decreed, it is by no means impossible, that the same day may witness the happiness of both of us. May that day, whenever it shall come, prove the beginning of joy to Mary, and to her, who, in every state, will be your affectionate Clara Howard.</field>
