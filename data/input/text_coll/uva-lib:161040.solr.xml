      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Summer School of Pure Mathematics. During the summer vacation of 1899, the following courses in Pure Mathematics will be offered: I. Undergraduate Mathematics. The courses in Undergraduate Mathematics will be arranged so as to cover the subjects usually embraced in a College course in Mathematics: that is, they will consist of: (a) A course in Algebra, Geometry and (elementary) Trigonometry; (b) A course in Trigonometry and Conic Sections; and (c) A course in Differential and Integral Calculus. These courses would be advantageous to teachers wishing to review certain subjects in Undergraduate Mathematics, or to students desiring to complete their preparation for entering one of the undergraduate classes in an University or School of Technology. The instruction in these courses will be largely individual in its character. II. Graduate Mathematics. The course in Graduate Mathematics will consist of lectures on topics of special interest in the departments of Differential Equations, Modern Higher Geometry (Projective Geometry, Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, etc.), and the applications of Lie's Transformation Groups to these subjects. This course would be advantageous to teachers and graduate students who wish to become acquainted with some of the more important discoveries of Modern Mathematics: and who desire some indications as to the training necessary to lead up to independent research work. Each of the courses will consist of thirty lectures, beginning July 1st, and extending over about two months. The fee for tuition in one course will be $30, and for each additional course, $20. Board can be had near the University, or on the grounds, at from $16 to $20 a month, for meals, lodging and servants' attendance. For any further information, address J. M. PAGE, Associate Professor of Pure Mathematics. University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Summer Courses in Mathematics and Engineering. These courses are designed to benefit three classes of students; those preparing for entrance to College or University; those who aim to secure promotion to higher classes; and those who are already engaged in teaching Pure and Applied Mathematics in School or College. Each course consists of five lessons a week extended over six weeks. The subjects usually offered are the following, but special courses will be arranged to suit the needs of individual students: 1. Trigonometry. 2. Analytical Geometry. 3. Infinitesimal Calculus. 4. Theoretical Mechanics. 5. Strength of Materials. 6. Graphical Statics. 7. Steam Engineering. 8. Railway Engineering. The instruction is in all cases individual in its character and adapted to the state of preparation and the purposes of the student. Correspondence is invited and suggestions will be given as to the arrangement of work and the preliminary reading desirable for its effective pursuit. The fee for tuition in one course is $30; in each additional course, $20. Work begins 3d July, 1899. Address WILLIAM M. THORNTON, Professor of Applied Mathematics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia. Summer Course in Physics, 1899. The new Rouss Physical Laboratory will be open to students in Physics during the coming summer vacation. The regular work will begin Monday, July 3d, and end Saturday, September 2d, but, as the Laboratory is seldom closed, those who wish to may arrange to begin earlier or to continue later. Instruction, both theoretical and practical, will be given according to the needs of each student, and individual experimental work, for which the Laboratory is admirably adapted, will be strongly emphasized. Among those who might profit by such a course are: a. Students who expect to take Physics or first year Medicine next session. b. Teachers of Physics who wish to obtain a working knowledge of such laboratory arts as glass-blowing, soldering, electroplating, etc. c. Candidates for such Civil Service Examinations as demand a knowledge of general Physics. d. Those who wish the facilities of a laboratory and the use of a library for original research. e. Physicians and medical students who desire a practical knowledge of the manipulation of batteries, electro-magnets, induction coils, and X-ray apparatus. The Laboratory will be open on equal terms to both men and women. The tuition fee will be $30. For further information, address W. J. HUMPHREYS (Instructor in Physics), Rouss Physical Laboratory, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Summer Course of Law Lectures, 1899. The thirtieth session of the Summer Law School will begin July 1, 1899, and continue two months. There are one hundred lectures, of one and a half hours each, included in the course. PERSONS BENEFITED. The classes of persons for whom the course is especially designed, and who will derive peculiar profit from it, are: First: Those just beginning their professional studies, who design to attend a full course of the Law School here or elsewhere. Second: Those who, for want of time, means or inclination to resort to a Law School, propose to pursue their studies privately. It is not too much to say that in general this two months' course will impart to the faithful student a better knowledge of the law, and more facility in future study and acquisition, than a year or even two years of private reading, without regular instruction. Third: Those who desire a review of elementary principles, in preparation for collegiate work, or as candidates for admission to the bar. Fourth: Those practitioners who, not having had the advantage of systematic instruction, find their progress slow, painful and unsatisfactory, so as not seldom to discourage that persistent application which is indispensable to permanent success in the law. To persons of this class, experience has shown this course to be so serviceable that, in the interest of the profession, and with a view to promote familiarity with its cardinal doctrines, hardly less than in respect of their private emolument, the instructors would fain see even their elder brethren try for themselves the value of a summer so spent. In no branch of his profession is the average practitioner so deficient as in the elementary principles. Fifth: Those young gentlemen who do not propose to follow the profession of the law, but who desire some acquaintance with its leading principles as a part of a liberal education, and as training for business or literary pursuits. For catalogue of the Summer Law School, containing full information, apply to either of the undersigned. University Station, Charlottesville, Va. W. M. LILE, R. C. MINOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Summer Class in Chemistry. I propose to give private instruction in Chemistry—theoretical and practical— during the coming summer vacation, beginning July 1st and ending September 1st. The subject matter of the course will be selected in accordance with the special wants of the individual students. The following subjects are among those which have in past years rendered the course useful. 1. Special training in particular departments of Practical Chemistry; e. g., the analysis of coal and coke, iron ores, iron and steel, the assaying of ores of the precious metals, the examination of fertilizers and material for their manufacture, toxicological and sanitary chemistry for students or for practitioners of medicine, etc. 2. Special preparation for the duties of teachers of Chemistry on the part of those seeking positions as such, or of those who already hold appointments but have no had the opportunity of gaining experience in lecture-room work experiments of demonstration, etc. 3. Review of the general principles of Chemistry on the part of those who have already studied the subject, as in the case of candidates for examination before the Medical Boards of the United States Army and Navy, of the Marine Hospital service, and of the several States. 4. Preparation for study in the regular classes of the University on the part of those who intend coming here in the following session. 5. Training in the methods and reasoning of original research. A certificate of work in this course done faithfully and well will be signed by the Professor and given to any who may deserve and desire it. This course is open, not only to men, but also to ladies, who, either as teachers or otherwise, desire such serious study of Chemistry as is possible within the designated time. The fee for tuition will be $50.00, payable at the beginning of the course. Laboratory material consumed, and apparatus broken, will be charged for at their actual cost, the expense under these heads amounting usually to a few dollars, say from $5 to $10. Board can be obtained in the neighborhood at from $16 to $20 per month for meals, furnished room and attendance. J. W. MALLET. University of Virginia March 4, 1899.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE NEW UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS. The Work of repairing the damage done to the Rotunda of the University by the great fire in the autumn of 1895, and of erecting new buildings to accommodate the Academic Department, as well as the Departments of Law and Engineering, was brought to a successful close during the Spring of 1898. Through the generosity of the Legislature, as well as that of its Alumni and friends all over the country, the University is thus in far better condition to accommodate all its different departments than ever before; and the new buildings, which have now been occupied for more than a year by the different schools for which they were designed, were last June dedicated with appropriate ceremonies, and formally turned over to the Governor of the State by the Rector of the Board of Visitors of the University. The Rotunda was restored, as nearly as possible in accordance with the original plans of Mr. Jefferson, as far as its outward form is concerned. The interior—with the exception of the two classrooms in the basement which are to be used as a Law Library room, and a lecture-room, respectively—has been devoted exclusively to the use of the Library, forming thus a noble room, with its circle of Corinthian columns, mosaic floor, double galleries, cornice balustrade, and skylighted dome. The whole has been rendered as nearly fire-proof as possible; so that it is believed that the central feature of the University will never again be in peril. At the base of the Rotunda are four terraced wings (as originally designed by Mr. Jefferson, but never fully executed), two of which supply offices for the University administration—while the other two are occupied by the Department of Law and the Young Men's Christian Association. The Annex was not rebuilt. Where it stood lies a broad and hand some terrace, at the foot of the staircase which leads down from the north portico of the Rotunda; and in its stead, three new buildings have been erected at the foot of the Lawn. The chief and central one of these buildings, which directly faces the Rotunda, contains in its middle portion on the first floor an amphitheatrical Public Hall capable of seating some fifteen hundred people; on the second floor the lecture-room and offices of the Biological Laboratory—while in its wings, with their numerous and capacious lecture-rooms, are domiciled most of the other Academic Schools. Above the portico of this building, which is supported by Ionic columns, is written in Greek as a motto of the University: "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free," and this inscription is interpreted by allegorical figures in the tympanum above it. The central figure is Truth, with a globe in one hand and a mirror in the other, symbolizing universality and accuracy; to the left is Liberty, with her torch, and to the right, Victory, with her laurel wreath. On the eastern side of the central building stands the Rouss Physical Laboratory. This building contains a large anphitheatrical lecture-room, an apparatus room, and a general laboratory, together with a number of smaller private laboratories for advanced students, rooms for optical work, a tower for experimental purposes and a shop in the basement; forming on the whole one of the best arranged and equipped laboratories of its kind in the country. On the western side of the central building is located the Mechanical Laboratory, which is also adequately equipped. The first floor contains a large lecture-room, an electrical engineering laboratory, a drawing-room, rooms for blue-printing, etc.; while in the basement are rooms filled with the most approved machinery for wood and iron work, etc. The boilers, forges, and foundries are in an annex behind the central building, from which steam for power and heating is conducted to the Mechanical and Physical Laboratories. Both the central building, and the Rotunda, are also heated by steam from this source. A large new dormitory, with the most improved modern equipment for heat, light, sanitation, etc., is also under construction, and will be ready for occupation by the opening of next session. The three buildings at the foot of the Lawn are architecturally in harmony, both in form and in detail, with the other edifices on the Lawn; and they complete, at its southern end, a quadrangle which is worthy of the majestic and time-honored Rotunda. All who knew the University as it was, will agree that its beauty and usefulness have been greatly enhanced by the changes which have been made. Great as was the calamity which at the time of the fire befell the University, the Visitors and Faculty can but feel that the outcome has been a still greater benefit. With the ample accommodations which, owing to the growth of the University in every department, were greatly needed even before the demand for them was so suddenly rendered imperative, with renewed vigor and enthusiasm, with steadfast adherence to the great principles upon which it has always firmly stood, the University goes forward in the spirit of true progress to wider opportunity and greater usefulness. It looks confidently to its loyal Alumni and its warm-hearted friends everywhere in the belief that not only their good wishes but their earnest efforts as well will be given to the advancement of its interests and the maintenance of its prestige and honor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Announcements. 1899-1900. Charlottesville, the seat of The University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary Arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above the sea-level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles off; the system of drains and sewers is complete; the new Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in case of illness students receive treatment from the members of the Faculty of Medicine, with skillful nursing when necessary, in a well-equipped infirmary. The Session begins on the 15th day of September and continues nine months. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 19th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither the public also are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in five Departments—the Academic, and those of Engineering, Law, Medicine, and Agriculture. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-two distinct schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction of professors who are responsible only to the Board of Visitors for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.—The system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and examinations permit. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Equipment.—The equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in the Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the new Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, and the Pathological Laboratory. The Engineering Department possesses a newly-equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. In addition to the Law, and other Departmental Libraries, the general University Library is common to all the Departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present about forty-five thousand volumes.* * At the time of the fire in 1895, the Library contained some fifty-three thousand volumes. By generous contributions from sister institutions of learning, and from publishing firms and private individuals, the number of volumes has already been nearly restored to what it was before the fire. It is confidently expected that liberal money appropriations will be made by the Visitors in the near future toward further enlarging the library. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for six hours daily to attend to their wants. Preparation.—Some special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek, Modern Languages, English Literature and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning, which he may not wish to pursue here. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purpose of difigence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome the disadvantages of inadequate training, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. Admission.—To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement. If the applicant has been a student at any other incorporated institution, he must produce a certificate from such institution, or other satisfactory evidence, of general good conduct. Conduct.—The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as the remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. Discipline and Religious Worship.—Morality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every evening, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations. Entrance Examinations are not required except from Academic students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirements for these examinations are stated elsewhere (page 133). But applicants for admission to the different classes in the several Schools are required to exhibit to the Professors suitable evidences of adequate preliminary training. The Method of Instruction in all departments of the University is partly by lecture, partly by the study of appropriate texts. The regulations require that at each meeting the Professor shall examine the class orally on the subject-matter of the previous lecture before beginning the new lecture. Associated with this instruction in the class is a large amount of practical laboratory work in the scientific courses, and of private parallel reading and essay writing in the literary courses. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are merely auxiliary to the written examinations, which are the main test of the student's proficiency. The standard is in no case less than three-fourths, and a student who attains this standard is entitled to a certificate to that effect. No special examination is granted except upon the physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty may accept as adequate ground. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three Professors, one of whom is the Professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make report to the Faculty of the results of the examination. The committee, not the Professor, is responsible throughout. Honor System.—For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution which the Faculty adopted with apparent unanimity: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this place. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the Faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of Faculty-action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examination-room, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, or indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in presence of a committee of the Faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Candidates for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the specific details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures, the correlative text, and the prescribed courses of private reading. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at the daily oral examinations, as well as at the written examinations, are taken into the account. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in the B. A. course of each Academic School, and students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. course in any School are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, Bachelor of Science, Doctor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Law. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No merely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.—Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such Licentiate is a matter of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.—At the beginning of the next session printed notices containing useful directions for the guidance of new students in matriculating, choosing boarding-houses, etc., will be posted on the University bulletin-board, and will be distributed as generally as possible among the new students upon their arrival.</field>

Each of the included schools offers one or more undergraduate courses of instruction, comprising the work required of students who elect the course in question as one of the requisites for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. These are followed in each School by graduate courses, the completion of any one of which, together with that of the undergraduate course preceding it, entitles the student to a diploma of graduation in the School in question. A certain number of these graduations is required of Bachelors of Arts who proceed to the degree of Master of Arts. Subsequent work of a still more advanced and specialized character is offered in the various Schools of the Department as preliminary to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A detailed account of the courses and equipment of the Schools is given, followed by a specific statement of the requirements for academic degrees. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Peters, Mr. Wright. B. A. COURSE. A. First Year.—A student who is able to translate Cæsar or Vergil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this course, which begins with Sallust or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to select portions of Sullust, Ovid, Curtius, and Vergil. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. These examinations are conducted in writing. B. Second Year.—The work of this year will be directed to the acquirement of readiness in translation and syntactical interpretation, with as little specialistic investigation as is consistent with a general but sound and permanent knowledge of the language. As an indispensable auxiliary to this end, written exercises in translating English into Latin and Latin into English will be required. Proper attention will be given to Roman History and Literature. The metrical work will be limited to the structure and accurate recitation of the Dectylic, Anapæstic, Trochaic, and Iambic verses, with the verses occurring in the odes of Horace. Translation will be confined to Livy, Horace, Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus. Selections from each author will be assigned as parallel reading. The student who completes the work of this year will be entitled to a diploma of graduation in the B. A. course in Latin. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course commences with Juvenal or Livy, and includes selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is taken up early in the session and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the language. Portions of the authors read in the lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the lectures. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the third or final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In Roman History and Literature the work is that of the B. A. course. The completion of the work of this year entitles the student to the diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in Latin, if the work of the B. A. course has been completed. Text-Books.—Any approved edition of the authors above named. Grammars.—Gildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History.—Liddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature.—Bender's, as a Handbook and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. PH. D. This course is intended for students who propose to teach, or desire to equip themselves for original investigation in the language. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize them with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which can not be considered to any great extent in the undergraduate course. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys, Mr. Young. In this School there are three courses: B. A. COURSE. I. A general course, comprising what is deemed essential to a liberal classical education. This course extends over two years. A. First Year Class.—As a preparation for this class an accurate knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translating are necessary. A thorough study of three books of Xenophon's Anabasis may be regarded as a minimum of preparatory reading. The work of the class is directed to the acquirement of practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is carefully reviewed, and weekly exercises, based on Greek authors, are written. The authors read are Xenophon and Lysias. B. Second Year Class.—This class, for which the work of the preceding year, or some equivalent, is the necessary preparation, continues the study of Attic prose, and enters upon the study of Epic and Ionic Greek and the Drama. The Syntax is reviewed, and weekly exercises are given for translation into Attic prose. The authors read are Plato, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus, and Homer. Instruction is given in History, Literature, Antiquities, and the simpler Metres. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of B. A. In preparing students for the B. A. course teachers are urged not to use Homer, but to confine the instruction to Attic prose. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. II. An advanced course, adapted specially to the requirements of those who desire to become teachers of the classics. It extends through one session of nine months. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required; but, when sufficiently prepared, students may be allowed to pursue both courses simultaneously. In this course the Syntax of the Verb is thoroughly studied, and weekly exercises, including passages from modern English authors, are given to be translated into idiomatic Greek. Lectures are given on Rhythm and Metres, and the students are practiced in reading rhythmically the lyric parts of the Drama and the works of the Lyric Poets. The authors read are Demosthenes, Æschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Pindar, and other Lyric Poets. The course will be varied and modified as occasion may require. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of M. A. PH. D. III. A higher course, designed for those who wish to devote themselves to classical scholarship. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course, or equivalent preparation, is required, but in special cases students may prosecute both courses at the same time. At present it consists of four special courses, each comprising two hours per week during a half session. The third year's course will be adapted to the aims of the students. The lectures will be employed chiefly in directing the private study of students. The recent acquisition of the library of the late Professor Hertz has greatly increased the facilities for philological research, and in connection with each course special topics will be assigned to each student for investigation. In each course, in addition to the special objects of study, attention will be given to the literary aspect of the authors read and to the subject-matter involved. The courses offered are as follows: I. A course of selected readings extending over the whole field of Greek literature in the order of historical development. This course is intended as a general survey. II. A course in Attic prose, especially the orators, directed partly to questions of grammar, and partly to the artistic form and the style. III. A study of the Attic drama, including the special study in class of the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophocles and the Frogs of Aristophanes. IV. A study of the Greek poets, with special reference to music, rhythm, metre, and structure. The ancient doctrine of metre and rhythm will be carefully examined, and portions of the Lyric poets, including Pindar, read in class. For all the classes of this School private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. HELLENISTIC. Instruction will be given in New Testament Greek. This course will extend through one session of nine months, the class meeting three times a week. The preparation should be equivalent to that required for the second year B. A. course. The instruction will be free from sectarian bias, and will be specially adapted to ministerial students intending to prosecute further studies at a theological seminary, though others will not be excluded. The course will begin with the study of the Gospel according to Matthew, for which purpose any recent text will suffice. Other needed works will be indicated after the session opens. Text-Books.—Goodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Hogue's Irregular Verbs; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (intermediate, and in Courses II and III, unabridged seventh edition); Myers's History of Greece; Jebb's Primer of Greek Literature. Any editions of Greek authors may be used, except when particular ones are specially prescribed; but students should always have at hand Teubner's texts for reference, and for use on examinations. At present Rhythm and Metres and some other subjects are taught wholly or partly by lecture. HEBREW. The Instructor, Mr. Young, will conduct a course in Hebrew. No knowledge of the language will be required for admission to this course. The text-books needed will be made known at the opening of the session. SCHOOL OF TEUTONIC LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison, Mr. Abbot. The subjects taught in this school are the English and German languages (including Old and Middle English, Gothic, Old and Middle High German). I. English. B. A. COURSE. The B. A. course in English is designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the historical (philological) and the literary sides. The opportunity is seized from the beginning to interest the student in the history and etymology of current English words and phrases, to point him by a general course of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and Middle English to the gradual genesis and evolution of Modern English as we have it now, and to furnish him with ample material for the prosecution of further study and research in one of the most delightful fields open to the modern student. A carefully graded series of texts and text-books will lead the student from the language of Alfred through Chaucer and the Elizabethans to the English of Victoria; and practical weekly or fortnightly exercises in English composition on assigned topics will, it is hoped, shape his style and enlarge his knowledge of contemporary English. Three times a week. Text-Books—First Term: Harrison and Baskervill's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Emerson's or Champneys' History of the English Language; Williams' Composition and Rhetoric. Second Term: Corson's Introduction to Chaucer; Harrison-Baskervill (completed); Williams' Composition and Rhetoric (continued); Brooke's English Literature (begun). Third Term: Anglo-Saxon, Brooke, Corson and Williams, completed; Hales's Longer English Poems; the Arden Shakspere. Note: It is desirable that students entering this class should have studied at least a standard English Grammar and a standard Rhetoric. No previous knowledge of Old English is required. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course is a more specialized form of the B. A. course on the same general lines; a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon is essential to its profitable prosecution. The historical study of the language is pursued in greater detail; the student's attention is concentrated on the history and origins of English; lectures on the Poetry and Life of the Anglo-Saxons are given; Fourteenth Century English receives detailed attention, and selected works of the Elizabethan period will be examined and studied critically. The effort will constantly be made to make these courses in the English Language run parallel on the linguistic side with the courses in English Literature, so that the two may profitably be taken together. Three times a week. Text-Books.—First Term: Sweet's or Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Sweet's Short English Grammar; Morris and Skeat's Specimens, II. Second Term: Skeat's Principles, I; the Student's Chaucer; Brooke's History of Old English Literature; Professor's Lectures; Anglo-Saxon continued. Third Term: Beowulf; Skeat's Principles, II; Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (completed); Moulton's Literary Study of the Bible; Brooke (completed). Note: In 1899 the M. A. class discussed once a week in the English Seminary, second term, written reports on points connected with Chaucer's language, vocabulary, proverbs, learning, versification, etc. During the third term the English Bible formed the center of the Seminary work. (As in '98.) A piece of technical work, such as the construction of a vocabulary, the examination of particular points in syntax or grammar, or the discussion of a particular author, may be required of the M. A. graduate. PH. D. Here only general hints and suggestions can be given, the course adapting itself to the preferences of the student. The foundations will be laid in a thorough knowledge of Gothic, Old and Middle High German, and Old French to the Sixteenth Century; phonetics will be carefully studied; and the principles of comparative grammar and syntax will be duly explained. Frequent conference, stated examination, and original research will form essential parts of this course. The Professor's large and choice collection of Anglo-Saxon, English, German, and French philological works is open to the students. II. German. B. A. COURSE. The B. A. Course in German is, like the corresponding course in English, designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the philological and the literary sides. To accomplish this purpose successfully an accurate knowledge of English grammar and a few months' familiarity with the rudiments of German are necessary as preliminary to entering the class. A carefully selected series of text-books will gradually introduce the student to the pronunciation, grammar, syntax, and translation of the language; exercises once a week in German script will familiarize him with grammatical analysis; and appropriate texts on the history and literature of Germany will introduce him to these important sides of the study. Parallel reading is required. Three times a week. Text-Books.—Thomas's Practical German Grammar; Joynes's Introductory German Reader; Grimm's Haus-Märchen; Von Klenze's or Buchheim's Deutsche Gedichte; Deering's Schiller's Wilhelm Tell; Hosmer's History of German Literature. Dictionaries: Whitney's or Heath's. Scientific German. Students taking this course will study thoroughly Part I or Thomas's Practical German Grammar and will read Gore's, Hodges's, Dippold's or Brandt's Scientific German Reader. A student successfully passing his examination on these four scientific books, together with exercises, Hosmer's Literature and Thomas's Grammar, would be doing about the equivalent of the literary B. A. German course and would be recommended for the B. A. degree. A lighter course (suggested above) would be valuable to Medical, Biological, and general scientific students, but would lead to no degree. Dictionary: Tolhausen's Technological (English, German and French definitions). M. A. COURSE. This course is a more specialized continuation of the B. A. course in German on the same general lines, and is open to students who have completed the B. A. or its equivalent. The historical study of German is taken up; the masterpieces of German literature are systematically studied in critical annotated texts; exercises oral and written continue throughout the year; and the literature and life of Germany are studied in some detail. Parallel reading is required. Three times a week. Text-Books.—Whitney's Compendious Grammar; Behaghel's Historical Grammar; Stein's German Exercises; Goethe's Meisterwerke (Bernhardt); Lessing, Schiller, Heine (annotated editions); Wenckebach's Meisterwerke des Mittelalters; Francke's or Scherer's History of German Literature. Dictionary: Whitney's, Heath's, Adler's or Flügel-Schmidt-Tanger. Note: The work in the B. A. and the M. A. courses is so conveniently divided and distributed by the three-term system that the student gets over the ground without hardship or difficulty. PH. D. COURSE. A student of German, having completed the B. A. and M. A. courses as above outlined, is now prepared to enter upon studies more advanced still. German and English combine admirably for the doctorate as "major" and "cognate minor" to each other, either from the German or from the English point of view. Conference with the Professor is requested for the purpose of arranging the student's studies. If German is elected, Gothic, systematically studied through Wright's Primer, Bernhardt's Gotische Bibel and Skeat, is the foundation. Behaghel's Hêliand (Saxon) may well follow this. A course in Old and Middle High German, studied in the works and editions of Braune, Wright, Sievers, Erdmann, and Henry, connects the Gothic and modern High German, and gives ample philological as well as literary training to the German specialist. Frequent conference, stated examination, and original research form essential parts of this course, which culminates in a dissertation on some special linguistic or literary point connected with the study, handed in before May 1 of the graduating year. Ph. D. combinations suggested: German (major), English Language (cognate minor), English Literature (second minor); English Language, English Literature, German; English Literature, English Language, German etc. SCHOOL OF ROMANCE LANGUAGES. * * Professor to be elected in June, 1899. ——— The subjects taught in this School are the French, Spanish, and Italian Languages. The following courses were offered during the session of 1898-99: FRENCH AND SPANISH: General. The courses offered in this School are General (B. A.), Special (M. A.), and Advanced, or Post-Graduate (Ph. D.). B. A. COURSE. The General Course embraces such a knowledge of the selected language as an intelligent student may be expected to acquire in one year. Some previous preparation is most desirable. The aim of this course is to acquaint the student with the pronunciation, phonology, grammar, and general syntax of the language through systematic oral and written practice, to initiate him into the literature through easy and abundant reading, and to lay a solid foundation for the prosecution of his Special and Advanced courses, if he elects to continue his studies in this School. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. The Special Course embraces a systematic extension of the General Course along the same lines, but is at once more comprehensive and more specialized in certain directions; incessant practice in translation and composition, gradually increasing in difficulty, is continued; instruction in syntax, in historical grammar, and in literature is given by lecture and abstract; and an orderly reading of the great writers in each language, chronologically arranged, is planned and accomplished by class work and collateral reading. PH. D. The Advanced course is intended for those students who elect Romance Languages for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. It embraces three years of graduate work in any two languages of the group, and is especially adapted to students who have graduated in Latin and Greek. Study of the comparative grammar, vocabulary, and literature of these languages is made a special feature of this course. Most attractive combinations can be made in this department, such as French-Italian, Spanish-French, Portuguese-Spanish, Provençal-French, Latin-French, etc. Graduation in Latin is indispensable for the prosecution of a Ph. D. course in Romance Languages. Instruction will be given by conference, assigned private work, and stated examination, and a dissertation evincing original research in some department of grammar, phonetics, syntax, literature or history, will in every case be required. Detailed courses for intending students will be arranged by the Professor on application. FRENCH: Special. B. A. COURSE. Text-Books.—Whitney's Large French Grammar and Introductory French Reader; Matzke's French Pronunciation; Bruno's Tour de la France; Joynes' Classic French Plays; Kuhns' St. Pierre's Paul et Virginie; Fortier's Littérature Françalse. Exercises. Parallel reading (completion of the texts begun in class). Heath's, Gase's or Bellows' Dictionary. The texts used have been so chosen as to form a suitable general introduction (a) to the grammar, (b) to the vocabulary, (c) to the history and geography, and (d) to the literature of France in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. A course in Scientific French, for the benefit of medical and other students, will be offered as occasion requires. M. A. COURSE. For pronunciation: Matzke's French Pronunciation; Koschwitz's Parlers Parisiens. For reference and study: Harrison's French Syntax; Brachet-Toynbee's Historical French Grammar. For reading: Fasnacht's Select Specimens of Great French Writers; Masson's series of French Prose (for the study of select periods of French culture and civilization); Voltaire's Siècle de Louis XIV (for the study of one typical reign); professor's lectures on Eminent French Writers; Chardenal's Advanced Exercises. Examinations on definite assigned work. SPANISH: Special. B. A. COURSE. Text-Books.—Manning's Spanish Grammar (for rapid survey); Knapp's Reader (for current Spanish Prose); Todd's Don Quijote, with Selections from Lope and Calderon (for classical prose and poetry); Valera's Pepita Jiménez; Harrison's History of Spain; Seoane's Dictionary. Exercises. Definite collateral reading and examinations on assigned work. M. A. COURSE. Text-Books.—Knapp's Grammar, with lectures based on Foerster's Sprachlchre and Wiggers' Grammatik der Spanischen Sprache; Selections from the lyric and dramatic poets and from the great prose writers, in connection with Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature; Isla's Le Sage's Gil Blas; El Romancero del Cid; Seoane's Dictionary. Exercises, assigned collateral reading, and stated examinations on definite assigned work. Ph. D. Courses in Old French, Provençal and Old Spanish will be arranged and offered as they are required. The texts, editions, grammars, and chrestomathies of Schwan, Bartsch, Keller, Groeber Suchier, Vietor, Gaston Paris, Meyer, Darmesteter, and others, will be used, and the professor's extensive collection of Modern Language works will be freely open to students of the School. ITALIAN. B. A. COURSE. No previous knowledge of the language is required, but some knowledge of Latin or French will be helpful. The object of this course is to introduce the student into the language by easy steps and to present to him the language in its modern form as represented by the most popular authors. A rapid review is made of the grammar, then an introductory reader is taken up, and then some complete work. Special stress is laid on pronunciation and weekly exercises are required. Text-Books.—Grandgent's Grammar; Bowen's Reader; De Amicis' Cuore and La Vita Militare; Pellico's Le Mie Prigioni. M. A. COURSE. The same requirements exist here as in M. A. German. Text-Books.—Vockeradt's Grammatik: Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi; Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata; Dante's Divina Commedia. LINDEN KENT MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. Professor Kent, Mr. Tilley. B. A. COURSE. This course includes practical instruction in composition and in the critical analysis of prose and poetry, but its general aim, held steadfastly in view, is literary. The double purpose of the course is: first, to aid the student in learning the principles of good writing and in acquiring by practice the power of expressing himself correctly and clearly, if not with facility and literary finish; second, to raise the standard of reading by cultivating the student's literary taste and by interesting him in the splendid achievements of English and American literature. In order to pursue this course with full profit the student should have, in addition to maturity of mind and general mental training, an accurate knowledge of the principles of English grammar, including punctuation and orthography, and familiarity with the foundations of rhetoric. Previous practice in composition is well-nigh essential to the successful prosecution of the work of this class, while general information as to the history and contents of English and American literature will add materially to the student's appreciation of the lectures.* * In this connection the earnest attention of those charged with the direction of academics, high schools and schools of lower grade is called to the sad and disastrous want of adequate elementary training in English, manifested by many of their representative students. This B. A. course includes: 1. Rhetoric.—This will comprise a rapid review of the principles of style as illustrated by the Sentence and the Paragraph, and a careful study of invention in prose discourse. There will be frequent written and blackboard exercises, and particular attention will be given to the critical analysis of selected specimens of Descriptive, Narrative, Expository, Argumentative, and Persuasive Prose. This course, based on the Professor's notes, will be supplemented by lectures, outlines, diagrams, etc. Text-Books.—To be assigned at the beginning of the course. 2. Poetics.—This course, following the general outline of the textbook, will comprise the mechanism of verse, the artistic elements of poetry, history of important verse forms, poetic style, kinds of poetry, etc. Class exercises in the analysis of poems, in the composition of verse, and in recognition of forms, etc., will be assigned from time to time. Text-Book.—Kent's Study of Poetry (in preparation). 3. English Literature.—This course will consist, first, of a general history of English literature, of which the text-book will serve as a syllabus; then of a close study of two of Shakespeare's Plays; of the Lyric Poetry of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries; and of the Prose of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth. The entire course is supplemented by class explanations, graphical representations, assigned and suggested readings, and lectures. Text-Books.—Pancoast's Introduction to English Literature; Carpenter's English Lyric Poetry, 1500-1700; Craik's English Prose, Volumes IV and V; Kent's Graphic Representations of English and American Literature. 4. Essays.—Besides the frequent written exercises five essays will be required of each student applying for graduation in this B. A. course. These will be due October 7, November 18, January 13, March 10, April 28. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. To this class will be admitted such students as have finished the B. A. course here, or have had such training here or elsewhere as to warrant the belief that they would pursue the course with profit. But, because of the written work required in each class, the Professor strongly advises young men not to undertake to pursue the B. A. and M. A. courses both during the same session. M. A. COURSE. In this course there will be occasional lectures, but in general the exercises of the class will be conducted by questions, conversation, and conference. Readings will be assigned, independent investigation insisted upon, and written reports required from time to time. The students will be encouraged to form their own judgments and to express them orally or in writing. References for each author, period, or subject studied will be given, and the free use of the library in this and all courses is cordially recommended. COURSES HERETOFORE OFFERED. I. Representative Writers of English Prose. II. History of Lyric Poetry from 1560 to 1800. III. British Essayists from Bacon to Burke. IV. Victorian and American Poets. V. Tennyson, the Representative Poet of the Nineteenth Century. VI. The British Essay in the Nineteenth Century. VII. Shakespeare, as a Dramatic Artist. VIII. Chief English Literary Tendencies in the Nineteenth Century. COURSES ANNOUNCED FOR 1899-1900. VII. Shakespeare, as a Dramatic Artist. This course, extending from September 15, to December 16, is intended to trace the development of Shakespeare's literary powers and to inculcate a full and reverential appreciation of his mind and art. His Sonnets will be studied in so far as they throw light upon his development, reveal the influences active in his work, or mark the stages of his progress, but the main effort of the class will be directed to a careful analysis of the dramatic structure and literary values of the leading plays and to the comprehension and enjoyment of these masterpieces. Text-Books.—Lee's Life of William Shakespeare; Globe Edition of Shakespeare's Complete Works; Kent's Shakespeare Note-Book. In addition, for the plays studied in class single annotated volumes will be strongly recommended. III. British Essayists from Bacon to Burke. This course, extending from January 2, to March 10, is intended to acquaint the student both with the subject-matter treated by the essayists studied and with the developing form of the essays themselves. There will be no special text-book but the essays themselves will of course be read, in editions available in the University Library. V. Tennyson, the Representative Poet of the Nineteenth Century. This course, extending from March 19 to June 1, will contain a rapid survey of English Poetry with emphasis on Eighteenth Century Classicism; a review of Romanticism as illustrated by Cowper, Burns, and others; and a special study of Tennyson's relation to his century. Tennyson's poetry will be taken up chronologically but of the longer poems only In Memoriam and The Princess will be closely studied. Text-Books.—The works of Tennyson; Rolfe's Edition of the In Memoriam; Cook's Edition of The Princess. Essays and Dissertation.—Besides the written exercises and studies in this course there will be required two essays and a dissertation. The essays, due October 21 and February 15, respectively, will treat some literary themes preferably such as are suggested by the class work. The dissertation must show independent and original investigation of some limited theme selected with the Professor's approval. The subject of the dissertation must be recorded by January 15, and the dissertation itself be handed in by May 15. PH. D. This course will be as far as possible adapted to the needs and prospective careers of the students desiring to pursue it. Its purposes will be to cultivate more fully the love of letters, to encourage independent and scholarly research, and to further the art of literary expression. It will include the study of some writer or school of writers, or of some period or movement of literature, and will take into consideration the political, social, and literary characteristics of the time under discussion. For 1899-1900 the course proposed will be an investigation of the Literary History of the Southern States prior to 1860. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL AND ECONOMICAL SCIENCE. Professor Dabney. In this School two distinct sciences are taught. For, although economic conditions have profoundly influenced the history of nations, and although there is such a thing as the history of Economics (just as, for that matter, there is a history of Mathematics, and as there has been a decided influence of mathematical discoveries upon History), still History and Economics are distinct subjects, and are investigated by different methods. HISTORY. The study of History, like that of other great subjects, has its own peculiar charms and advantages. It cannot equal the study of language in cultivating the habit of minute accuracy and attention to details. Nor can it compete with mathematical study in accustoming the student to habits of clear and rigidly consecutive thought. But, on the other hand, there is no other subject that surpasses History in its power to broaden and deepen both the mind and the heart. Its charm lies in its human interest. For its theme is man—"the proper study of mankind"—a theme that must ever be more attractive to the majority of human beings than either the asymptotes of the hyperbola or the subjunctive mood. But, while History deals with man, it should not be confounded with biography, which deals with individual men. Biography is an invaluable adjunct to History, but History deals with the life of societies, nations and states. Fully, fairly, and impartially to comprehend this life in all its marvelously varied social, political, religious, moral and intellectual manifestations, is totally beyond the power of any human brain. Yet the earnest student, who seeks the truth and resolutely turns his back upon partisanship in every from, can learn enough of even so vast a theme to reward him richly for his pains. But let him not yield credence to the common delusion that History is "easy" to learn,—a mere collection of entertaining anecdotes concerning eminent men. To understand the life of nations— the evolution and dissolution of organized masses of men—is a fascinating, but immensely difficult task. Such a task is, very properly, not attempted in primary schools, children being taught the rediments of History with other purposes in view. Nor is it wise for the younger students at a university to attempt the task. The greater their maturity, the greater also will be the benefit they may derive from historical study; and they are therefore advised, as a general rule, to defer its pursuit until they have had at least one year's training in other university work. Two courses in History are offered: one in General History and one in English and American History. B. A. COURSE. General History.—In this course, which comprises the historical work required for the B. A. degree, great stress is laid on the view that the career of man as revealed in History, is not a mere jumble of disconnected dates and facts, but a continuous stream, having its sources and tributaries in the far-off past, its outlet in the remote future. No attempt is made, however, to traverse in the classroom the entire length of this stream; for, although constant efforts are made to demonstrate the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development, the lectures are confined to the more important periods, the student being required to fill the gaps by private reading. These periods, and therefore, the text-books studied, may be more or less varied each year. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.—Fisher's Outlines of Universal History; Grant's Greece in the Age of Pericles; Froude's Caesar: Capes's Age of the Antonines; Thatcher's and Schwill's Europe in the Middle Age; Seebohm's Era of the Protestant Revolution: Gardiner's Thirty Years' War; Longman's Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War; Dabney's Causes of the French Revolution; Morris's French Revolution and First Empire. GRADUATE COURSE. M. A. English and American History.—In this higher course the principles taught in the one preceding will be applied to a more special field; and, in order that the students may be encouraged to exercise independent thought and judgment, they will be required to write essays on assigned topics. Moreover, it should be distinctly understood that the text-books are by no means regarded by the Professor as infallible authorities. On the contrary, some of them contain much that is emphatically rejected by him. And yet such books may be exceedingly useful; for to educate a man is not to stuff him full of cut-and-dried opinions, but rather to draw forth and develop his own judgment by presenting to his mind opinions that oppose and even clash violently with each other. Graduates in General History will derive most benefit from this course. It may be taken, however, by others; and, as considerable attention will be paid to constitutional development, students intending to study Law will find the course of advantage. Candidates for the M. A. degree selecting History as one of their four subjects must graduate both in this course and in the preceding. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.—Gardiner's History of England; Green's Short History of the English People; Gardiner's Atlas of English History; Percy Greg's History of the United States; Thwaites's Colonies; Hart's Formation of the Union; Wilson's Division and Re-union; Curry's Southern States of the American Union. ECONOMICS. In its value both as a mental discipline to the student, and as a subject of practical interest to the citizen, it is difficult to over-estimate the importance of this science. As a mental discipline the study of Economics combines to a certain extent the advantages of linguistic, mathematical and historical training. One of the most serious difficulties of the subject is the fact that many of its technical terms are also used in loose popular significations; and a close study of Economics teaches a man to be very careful in the exact and discriminating use of words. The rigid reasoning, too, by which economic laws are deductively derived from a few simple and fundamental facts in human and physical nature is as relentlessly logical as that by which the properties of triangles or circles are deduced from the axioms of Geometry. And, finally, the historical investigation of economic phenomena with a view to the verification, modification or refutation of the laws deductively ascertained, or to the inductive discovery of other laws, is attended with the advantages of other historical study, as above set forth, and sheds a flood of light upon many questions in social, political, or even religious history. B. A. COURSE. Like Mathematics, Economics is treated as Pure and Applied. In the first term of the session the whole field of Pure or Deductive Economics, an abstract science which deliberately and properly ignores, for the sake of clearness and simplicity, many important phases of social life, is traversed in outline; and a few brief practical applications are made to special topics. In the second term a thorough deductive, as well as inductive and historical, investigation of the principles of Money and Credit is undertaken; while a few lectures are devoted to the consideration of protective tariffs. The third term is devoted to a discussion of the periodical commercial panics and crises of the nineteenth century, and to the history of the vast changes in production, transportation and industrial organization that have taken place throughout the world in recent years. Text-Books.—Walker's Political Economy, (Advanced Course); Horace White's Money and Banking; selected pamphlets from the Sound Currency series published by the N. Y. Reform Club, viz: Nipher's The Appreciation of Gold, Warner's The Currency Famine of 1893, Watkins's Cotton and the Currency, White's Coin's Financial Fool, and the Report of the Monetary Commission of the Indianapolis Convention of 1897; Philpott's Tariff Chats; Porter Sherman's Tariff Primer; Hyndman's Commercial Crises of the Nineteenth Century; Wells's Recent Economic Changes. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Davis. There are two classes arranged for two successive sessions. The First Class studies during the first half-session, Deductive and Inductive Logic; during the second half-session, Psychology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.—The Professor's Elements of Deductive Logic, Elements of Inductive Logic, Theory of Thought, and Elements of Psychology. The Second Class studies during the first half-session, Ethics; during the second half-session, Philosophy. Two lectures a week. Text-Books.—The Professor's Essay in Ethics; Janet's La Morale; Lotze's Grundzüge der praktischen Philosophie; Külpe's Introduction to Philosophy; Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. Professor Echols, Associate Professor Page. The work of the School of Mathematics is divided into two parts: Part I.—The Undergraduate Course, leading to the degree of B. A., is designed with a view of giving an intelligent comprehension of the fundamental principles of mathematics to those who pursue it as a component part of a general education, and as a preparation to those who desire a working knowledge of the subject for use in subsequent studies in Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering. Part II.—The Graduate Course, leading to the degrees of M. A. and Ph. D., has a twofold design. In the first place its object is to require a thorough and systematic study of the chief branches of pure mathematics as exhibited in the writings of the best authors; and in the second place, to inculcate a serious and thoughtful contemplation of pure mathematics as an art, a science, and a branch of philosophy. In this school, as at present designed, there are six classes. B. A. COURSE. In this course there are two classes, each of which meets three times a week (three hours) throughout the session. Class A.—This class meets three times a week; and devotes about three months to each of the three subjects, Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. In Algebra the class begins with Ratio and Proportion, proceeding to the progressions, the Binomial Formula, Convergence and Divergence of Series, Logarithms, Determinants, and the Theory of Equations. In Geometry the work begins with the Solution of numerous original exercises in Plane Geometry, proceeds through Solid Geometry, with exercises, and terminates with a short course in Geometrical Conic Sections. The year is closed by a course in elementary Plane Trigonometry, embracing the Solution of Triangles by means of Logarithms, the usual applications to the problems of Heights and Distances, etc. The preparation necessary to enter this class is a good knowledge of Arithmetic, of Algebra through Simultaneous Quadratic Equations, and of Plane Geometry. Text-Books.—Charles Smith's Algebra; Venable's Legendre's Geometry, with Exercises; Venable's Notes on Geometric Conic Sections; and Wells' Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. Class B.—The preparation for this class consists in a thorough knowledge of the topics worked over in Class A. This class devotes about three months to each of the three subjects, Trigonometry, Analytical Geometry, and Calculus. The subject of Trigonometry, plane and spherical, is carefully worked over and followed by the study of the Conic Sections analytically. The last three months of the session are devoted to the study of the elementary principles and applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus. Text-Books.—Loney's Trigonometry, Part I; Charles Smith's Conic Sections; Osborne's Calculus. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. Class C.—This class meets three times each week (four and a half hours) throughout the session. It begins with the study of Analytical Geometry of three dimensions, and takes a systematic course in the Differential and Integral Calculus, completing the course with a study of Differential Equations. Text-Books.—Charles Smith's Solid Geometry; Williamson's Differential and Integral Calculus; Murray's Differential Equations. This course is required for graduation in the M. A. course of Mathematics. PH. D. Class D.—This class meets three times each week throughout the session. The topics discussed are: The Theory of the Number System; Determinants; the Infinitesimal and Finite Calculus and the general Theory of Functions. Reference Books.—Scott's Determinants: Laurent Traité d'Analyse; Chrystal's Algebra; Boole's Finite Differences; Tannery's Théorie des Fonctions d'une Variable, and Harkness and Morley's Theory of Functions; Picard, Traité d'Analyse. Class E.—The first half-year will be devoted to a course on the Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Geometry, with special reference to the Theory of Surfaces—and curves on surfaces. During the second half-year a course in Pure Geometry, beginning with Projective Geometry and proceeding to elementary Higher Geometry, will be offered. This class, and the following one, meet three times a week, and the subjects will be presented by lectures. Reference Books.—Joachimsthal's Anwendung der Differential and Integralrechnung auf die Allgemeine Theorie der Flächen, und der Linien Doppelter Krümmung, Salmon's Geometry of Three Dimensions: Darboux's Théorie Général des Surfaces; Reye's Geometrie der Lage; Klein's Höhere Geometrie, Volume I; Page's Differential Equations. Class F.—In this class will be presented a course in Lie's Theory of Transformation Groups, with Applications to Differential Equations and to Higher Geometry. Reference Books.—Lie's Works on Transformation Groups; Klein's Höhere Geometrie, Volume II. The candidate for the Ph. D. degree is required to complete the work of all the classes in the graduate courses, and to present a thesis which shall be acceptable to the faculty. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Professor Thornton. The work of this School is divided between the Academic and the Engineering Departments. In the former the following courses are offered, each of three lectures a week: B. A. COURSE. General Mechanics.—In this course, which comprises the work in Mechanics for the B. A. degree, the subjects studied are Statics, Strength of Materials, Graphical Statics, Hydrostatics, the Elementary Dynamics of a Particle, and of a Rigid Body. Elementary mathematical methods are employed, but no student is prepared to undertake the course who has not a sound working knowledge of Algebra, Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry, with the elements of Analytical Geometry. Text-Books.—Jessop's Applied Mathematics; Jacoby's Graphical Statics; Greene's Structural Mechanics; Lectures. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. Advanced Mechanics.—This course comprises the work in Mechanics for the M. A. degree. Free use is made of the methods of the Infinitesimal Calculus, and only suitably prepared students will be admitted to it. The subjects studied are the Dynamics of a Particle, and of a Rigid Body, Dynamics of Machines, Hydraulics, and Thermodynamics. Text-Books.—Lectures on Dynamics by the Professor; Bovey's Hydraulics; Peabody's Thermodynamics. PH. D. For candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, two courses are offered. 1. Analytical Mechanics.—Minchin's Statics, Williamson's Dynamics, Routh's Rigid Dynamics. 2. Theory of Elasticity.—Love's Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity. Clebsch's Theory of the Elasticity of Solid Bodies (Saint Venant's edition). SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Professor Stone. B. A. General Astronomy.—The primary aim of this course is to give such a knowledge of the facts, principles, and methods of Astronomy as every well-educated person should possess. The preparation required is a good working knowledge of Arithmetic, Algebra through Quadratics, Plane and Solid Synthetic Geometry, and Plane Trigonometry through the Solutions of Triangles. In this preparation thoroughness is of more importance than extent. The instruction is given by oral examinations, by lectures, and by the assignment of problems. The mental discipline of the student is kept constantly in view, and an earnest effort is made to create a habit of clear and logical thinking. Text-Books.—Young's General Astronomy; Berry's A Short History of Astronomy. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. The courses mentioned in the paragraph following this, although primarily designed to meet the wants of candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, are also open to candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, who are required to satisfactorily complete, in addition to the work of the B. A. course, a year's work in the more advanced courses. PH. D. Theoretical Astronomy.—The courses offered vary from year to year. During the year 1899-1900 lectures introductory to Celestial Mechanics will be offered, special attention being given to the Problem of Two Bodies. Practical Astronomy.—Laboratory courses are offered each year, in which systematic training is given in numerical computation, and in the use of Astronomical instruments. Students are also encouraged to engage in such original work as their time and attainments may permit. A Seminar is held twice a week, at which lectures are given on assigned subjects by the more advanced students. Completion of the M. A. course in the School of Mathematics or that of Natural Philosophy may be substituted, if desired, for the equivalent work in Astronomy as a qualification for candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by those who elect Astronomy as one of their subjects. For information in regard to Fellowships in Astronomy, application should be made to the professor in charge of the School. The Astronomical Observatory is situated upon an elevation known as Mount Jefferson which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda forty-five feet in diameter, and contains the great Clark refractor of twenty-six inches aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining, and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a three-inch Fauth transit and a four-inch Kahler equatorial. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Smith, Dr. Humphreys. This School offers the following courses: 1. Experimental Physics.—This course is intended to include Elementary Mechanics, Heat, Electricity, Sound, and Light. Instruction is given by lectures and text-books, with illustrative experiments. The losses of apparatus by the recent fire have been more than repaired, and ample provision is made for experimentation both in the lecture-room and the laboratory. The members of this class are expected to perform a graded set of simple exercises in the Physical Laboratory, the hours for which are accommodated, as far as possible to the convenience of each student. 2. Mathematical Physics.—In this course selected portions of the preceding one are more fully developed by the aid of mathematics. The subjects studied may be changed from session to session, according to the preparation or the needs of the student. The utmost possible freedom, consistent with a proper standard as to amount and quality, is afforded to him. The Laboratory work in this class is more advanced and extensive than in the preceding class, and aims at the more exact measurement of physical quantities. 3. Electricity.—This course is distinguished from the preceding, in being adapted of design to the needs of such as intend to pursue Electrical Engineering. The book work and the Laboratory exercises have therefore a practical character. They are intended to cover the first half of a four years' course of Electrical Engineering. 4. Graduate Work is offered to candidates for the Doctorate of Philosophy and to others who, for special reasons, may wish to do advanced work in Physics along special lines. This work will be mainly experimental and, as far as our resources allow, will be accommodated to the preferences of the student himself. More detailed information respecting the advanced work will be issued in a special circular, and may meanwhile be obtained by correspondence or personal interview. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, electing this School, are only required to pass in the class of Experimental Physics. The course for Master of Arts in this School is that given in the class of Mathematical Physics. THE ROUSS PHYSICAL LABORATORY. This building is now completed, and occupied. Its equipment is such as to offer unusual facilities for both elementary and advanced practical work. The working rooms are remarkable for stability, light and uniformity of temperature. Electricity, gas and water, as well as steam-heat, are supplied to each of them. The structure was specially designed to meet the requirements of Practical Physics, and is convenient within while it is sightly without. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School the following courses are offered: General Chemistry.—This course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws expressing the facts of chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present developed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, the foundations of our knowledge of chemical structure, and a general survey of the Descriptive Chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in the arts and manufactures of the facts mentioned. Text-Books.—Fownes' Chemistry (last edition); syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. Recommended for reference.—Roscoe and Schorlemmer's Elements of Chemistry; Lothar Meyer's Outlines of Theoretical Chemistry (English translation); Bernthsen's Text-Book of Organic Chemistry, translated by McGowan; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. Industrial Chemistry.—This course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, is concerned with the applications of chemistry to the purposes of human life. It examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which the development of the natural resources of the country in large measure depends, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar-refiner, etc. Text-Book.—Wagner's Chemical Technology. Recommended for reference.— Richardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry; Girardin's Leç ons de Chimie Elémentaire appliquée aux Arts Industriels; Percy's Metallurgy; Sadtler's Handbook of Industrial Organic Chemistry, etc. The lectures in both courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good; among the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. Graduate work is offered in either course, and either or both may be taken by the candidate for the Ph. D. degree. Laboratory work will be required on subjects involving original investigation. It is desirable that the student shall, himself, as far as possible, select subjects for investigation, but when he can not do so, suitable questions will be presented to him, and he will be encouraged to work them out for himself, with only such aid and guidance as may prove to be indispensable. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. Graduation in General Chemistry is required for the B. A. degree, graduation in both General and Industrial Chemistry for the M. A. For admission to a graduate course in the School of Chemistry or in the School of Analytical Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. The regular work of this school, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is divided into two courses, as follows: 1. This course consists of three lessons a week throughout the session, on each occasion the student spending three or four hours in practical experiments in the Laboratory. A course in Chemical Manipulation is first given, then Blowpipe Analysis and recognition of ores and a systematic course in inorganic Qualitative Analysis followed by practice in analysis of salts, alloys and ores, determination of minerals and the examination of potable water, coal, clay and so on, together with some simpler quantitative determinations. 2. The work of the second course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session, each being followed by four hours or more of practical laboratory work. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, fire assaying of ores of lead, gold and silver is pursued, then volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, technical products, and so on. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assisted in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. The Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the first course, or for both courses at the same time; candidates for graduation are required to complete both courses. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, Druggists, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (2d ed.); Greville William's Hand-book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-book of Mineralogy; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. PH. D. The graduate course is designed for those seeking the degree of Ph. D., and also for such students as desire to increase the range of their experiments as analysts and to cultivate their powers for original investigation. It is required of those who enter this course that they shall have previously graduated both in this School and in General Chemistry, or that they shall have previously made equivalent attainments elsewhere. Laboratory work will be conducted daily, and suggestions and due assistance will be given in its prosecution. While the work is adapted to the special aims or taste of each student, it will in all cases comprise some practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, ultimate and proximate organic analysis, some study in analytical methods and some original problems, also the reading and the summarizing of extracts from current journals, and for all who are seeking the degree of Ph. D., a dissertation embodying the results of some original research. SPECIAL COURSE. In addition to the foregoing, the following Special Course is given in this School. This course consists of twenty-four lectures on Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life so far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and so on. This course is open without charge to farmers who are not matriculated students. For fees to others, see Expenses. For reference: Johnston's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, 17th Edition; London, 1894. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporating, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. The Museum of Industrial Chemistry contained in the same building, consists of a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country and abroad, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two courses—first, a course embracing the requisites of Geology for the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts; and second, a course covering what is required in Mineralogy and Geology for the degree of Master of Arts. B. A. COURSE. Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.—Dana's Revised Text-Book of Geology and Notes of the Professor's Lectures. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. This course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.—The course in Mineralogy closes with the examination which takes place in December. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Text-Book.—Dana's Manual of Mineralogy and Petrology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. Geology.—This division of the course begins after the completion of Mineralogy in December. Three lectures a week will be given. A knowledge of the principles taught in the B. A. course will be assumed. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Palæontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Ph. D. Text-Book.—Dana's Manual of Geology. For reference: Geikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. PH. D. The course in this school is intended to give the student as large a stock of useful information as possible, to teach him methods of investigation, and to train him in habits of observation. Original research will be insisted on, and opportunity will be given for the student to concentrate his efforts in some line of special study. Topics for study will be taken from both of the subjects taught in this school. The abundant material in the Lewis Brooks Museum, mentioned below, gives unusual facilities for the pursuit of graduate work. Descriptive Mineralogy.—The course in Mineralogy is so selected as to give the student a good knowledge of as wide a range of the principles as possible, and at the same time to cause him to acquire a practical knowledge of the various mineral species. In the practical study, the more common minerals, and those of more importance from an economic and geologic point of view, will have preference. A practical knowledge of the crystal forms and of the characteristic groupings and massive forms of minerals, will be required. Special attention will be paid to the relations of minerals, their association in nature and their geological occurrence. The student will be trained to determine minerals, as far as possible, by their obvious characteristics, without the help of tests, and practical examinations will be held, from time to time, to test his skill. One or more theses will be required. Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy, and Weisbach's Mineral Tables will be used, and topics from various authors will be assigned for study in special cases. Geology.—In Geology the aim will be to fit the student for independent and original research. He will study as thoroughly as possible the broader problems of the science, involving the knowledge of stratigraphical principles. Special attention will be given to imparting a practical knowledge of the various rocks, and of the animal and plant fossils of the different eras, with the view of using them in determining unknown formations. Stress will be laid upon field-work, and the methods of determining and describing the geology of new regions. To impart such knowledge, the student will be required to work up some particular region or formation, and report his results. Topics involving a knowledge of the literature and growth of opinion in relation to particular questions, may be assigned to form the subjects of theses. Dana's Manual of Geology, and Geikie's Text-Book of Geology, will be used as text-books, and selected books of other authors will be used when necessary. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. Zoölogy is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-maché models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.; the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing graduate courses of study in Geology and Mineralogy. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Professor Tuttle, Dr. Skeen, Mr. Van Nüys. The work of this School is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of Biology to Agriculture. B. A. COURSES. Two introductory courses are offered, each of which is intended to serve as a means of rendering the student familiar with the method, the aims, and the fundamental laws of Biology while he is engaged in the one case with the study of plants, in the other with that of a large and important group of animals. Each course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session, the lectures being accompanied in each case with associated laboratory exercises. Graduation in either of these courses may be offered as one of the electives for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. I. Botany.—The course begins with the study of the anatomy, both gross and microscopic, of a series of representative plant forms, beginning with the highest and passing to the lowest plants; this is followed by a discussion of the elements of vegetable physiology. The second portion of the course begins with the consideration of the principles of classification, followed by the study of the characteristics of the leading divisions of the vegetable kingdom, and particularly of those which include the non-vascular plants. The concluding portion is devoted to the more specific study of the classification and distribution of the higher plants and of the local flora. To the student who seeks a knowledge of the principles of Biology as a part of a general education, this course is particularly commended. All the fundamental laws of Biology are well illustrated in the study of the morphology and physiology of plants, and in most instances in such a manner as to cause them to be more readily apprehended by the beginner than is the case in the study of animals. Text-Books.—These will be announced at the beginning of the coming session. II. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology.—This course is devoted to the study of the Anatomy and Histology of Vertebrates, and to the principles of Animal Physiology. During the first part of the session several representative forms are dissected, the relations and functions of their constituent organs being at the same time discussed in the accompanying lectures. This is followed by a study of their histology, particular attention being paid to mammalian histology as understood by the aid of that of the lower vertebrates: the work is done in the laboratory, the associated reading and lectures being accessory thereto. This course is particularly recommended to students who contemplate the study of medicine here or elsewhere. It is included in the required work of the first year of the course in Medicine, and students passing it with the required grade will there be credited with it. Text-Books.—Martin's Human Body (briefer edition); Parker's Zoötomy; the Professor's Elements of Histology. GRADUATE COURSES. M. A. In addition to the introductory or B. A. courses above described, the following advanced courses are offered to students prepared to undertake them. In each the work will be chiefly done in the laboratory, the student being in large measure independent of his associates; such lectures will be given from time to time and such reading indicated as will aid the student in an independent investigation of the subject in hand. The relation of these courses to degrees is indicated below. III. Vertebrate Morphology.—An advanced course based on Course II, the completion of which, or its equivalent, is required as preliminary. The work of the course begins with a study of Vertebrate Embryology: this is followed by the detailed comparative study of the structure and development of one or more systems of organs as existing in the vertebrates and in those forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically related to the vertebrate stock. The library of the department contains a large amount of standard and periodical literature bearing on the subject-matter of this course, and the reading of the student will be directed as far as possible in accordance with his individual needs. IV. Zoölogy.—This course, open to graduate students only, includes the study of Animal Morphology, as illustrated by the anatomy, histology and, as far as possible, the embryology of a series of representative species chosen from the principal divisions of the animal kingdom; the principles of classification; and the arrangement of the various orders and classes of animals in larger groups as indicated by their structural affinities. Text-Book.—Parker and Haswell's Text-Book of Zoölogy. For Reference: Lang's Text-Book of Comparative Anatomy; Korschelt and Heider's Embryology of Invertebrates. The completion of Courses I and II and either III or IV will be required of candidates for a diploma of graduation in the School of Biology, and of those offering Biology as one of their electives for the degree of Master of Arts. Courses III and IV will not both be given the same year at present. PH. D. The more advanced work in Biology will be devoted chiefly to Vertebrate Anatomy and Morphology, each of the systems of organs being in turn critically studied; it will in substance be an extension of the work of Course III. Such lectures will be given and such reading assigned as may be deemed advisable, but the larger part of the work will be done in the laboratory of the University and at such seaside or other laboratories elsewhere as may be designated, the principle object of the course being to train the student in methods of original investigation while he is becoming acquainted with the present state of our knowledge of the vertebrates and their allies. A knowledge of the subject-matter of Course IV will also be required of students who elect Biology as their major subject for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. In addition to the Courses in Biology above described, provision is made in this School for discussion, when called for, of one of the most important of the practical applications of Biological Science. In this connection the following course is offered: V. Practical Biology and Agriculture.—The relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the diseases or the parasites of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic Zoölogy (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). The topics discussed in such a course will be, to some extent, selected in accordance with the objects in view of those electing it in any year. The following suggested course will indicate a possible arrangement of subjects. Text-Books for 1899-1900.—Sorauer's Physiology of Plants (Weiss tr.); Tubeuf's Diseases of Plants induced by Cryptogamic Parasites (Smith tr.); Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals (Fleming tr.). Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete Courses I, II, IV, and V. Substitution of work fully equivalent in amount and character may be made for the subjects published as requirements for either of the graduations in this school from year to year in the case of any students whose previous training or special aptitude give good reasons therefor. The Biological Laboratory, newly domiciled in a convenient suite of rooms in the middle of the new Academic building, is well provided with instruments for the gross and minute dissection of animals and plants; microscopes, microtomes, reagents, and materials for the staining and mounting of preparations; apparatus for photography and microphotography, and other necessary appliances, not only for student work, but for investigation and research as well. In addition to the large and valuable collections of the Brooks Museum, an abundant supply of other necessary specimens and material is furnished. A library of reference is attached to the Laboratory, and students have access to a number of leading biological and agricultural journals, thus acquiring practice in the intelligent use of current literature.

The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed for students who desire to extend their work in certain departments of learning, so as to lay a broader foundation for professional study, to equip themselves for the work of teaching, or to prepare for specialized lines of research in letters or science. It is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has been graduated in each of four Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty. The utmost freedom of election will be encouraged in the arrangement of these courses, subject to the condition that the four lines of advanced work chosen shall be so related as to form a rationally connected whole. It is expressly ordered, however, that none of the work done for the B. A. degree shall be counted again as part of the advanced work required for the M. A. degree, nor shall the advanced work done for the M. A. degree be counted also for the B. A. degree. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the M. A. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree shall be submitted for approval to the Faculty, who have absolute power to accept or reject the degree offered. The candidate must in all cases be graduated in the B. A. course in each school before he is admitted to the M. A. course in that school. But this last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of the candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the M. A. course simultaneously with the B. A. course of the school. A Bachelor of Arts of any other chartered institution of learning who enters this University as a candidate for the M. A. degree, must submit to the Faculty a statement showing the four major studies in which he proposes to pursue the M. A. courses, and five associated minor studies, which would complete the requirements for the B. A. and M. A. degrees. Under the regulations of the Visitors, he will be required to pursue here both the B. A. and M. A. courses in the four major studies. But in any or all of the five minor studies he will be excused from attendance upon the regular B. A. courses upon presenting his diploma and passing a SPECIAL EXAMINATION at this University in such studies. This examination, which shall be held in writing, will, in all cases, be of a practical character, designed to test the permanent acquisition by the student of a sound general knowledge of the several subjects. Bachelors of Arts who are deficient in any of the minor studies may fill out their schemes of study by attending the regular B. A. courses at this University in those subjects and passing the regular examinations. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia is offered to students who propose to devote their energies to special study and research in some of the various departments of letters or the sciences. The candidate for this degree must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, or other degree of like value from this University or from some other college or university of good standing, or must exhibit to the Faculty, by examination if necessary, satisfactory evidences of having a collegiate education equivalent to that represented by the degree of Bachelor of Arts of a college or university of good standing. In the case that the applicant received his collegiate education at an institution other than this, the Faculty will pass, if necessary, upon the standing of the institution in question. The preparation of the candidate for entrance upon Ph. D. courses in the particular subjects selected shall be passed upon by the Academic Faculty on the basis of a report from the professors in charge of the schools involved. These professors may satisfy themselves of such preparation by any test they see fit to apply, including a formal examination if they deem this necessary. The work required for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia shall in all cases embrace three subjects, viz., a major subject, in which a dissertation is to be prepared, a cognate minor, and an independent minor. The election of subjects shall in all cases be submitted to the Academic Faculty for its approval at the beginning of candidacy. No time limit is set for the acquisition of this degree, except a minimum time limit of three years of study therefor, after the acquisition of the B. A. degree. The major subject shall be pursued during the whole time, the first minor during at least two years, and the second minor during at least one year. Each candidate for the degree shall be required to possess a reading knowledge of French and German, and such knowledge of subjects considered fundamental as may be prescribed by the individual departments. Each candidate shall be required to stand a final examination upon the whole course covered in both major and minor studies. Graduate work done in other Universities of high standing shall be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished that such work has been of a similar grade to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed; and provided furthermore, that the last year of graduate work is done here. But a candidate must obtain the special permission of the Faculty to apply for this degree after only one year of resident study. It is also provided that in the case of a professor in a chartered institution of learning whose department embraces the studies elected by him, but one year of residence is required.

HUMPHREYS, B.A., C.E., Ph.D., Assistant Instructor in Physics. This department, constituted from the schools of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, furnishes a complete course of instruction in the principles and practice of Engineering and the sciences upon which it is founded. The general scientific courses have been described in the earlier portion of this catalogue. In each school two courses are offered, a general or B. A. course and an advanced or M. A. course. The first deals with the general principles of the subject and those developments of them which are best adapted for the purposes of a liberal education. The second expands the field by the introduction of the more difficult extensions of the science and such as become necessary in its industrial applications. In addition to these general courses there is offered in the school of Applied Mathematics a complete series of technical courses, covering the various branches of engineering—Civil and Mining, Mechanical and Electrical. In each of these courses three lectures are given weekly, and each course is further divided into sections, terminating at the time of the Midwinter, Spring and Final Examinations respectively. METHOD AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The method of instruction is by systematic lectures, and the study of appropriate text-books, combined with a large amount of practical work in the drawing-room, the laboratories, and the field.

The new Mechanical Laboratory, designed especially for the work of instruction in Engineering, is a handsome building, one hundred and eighty-five feet long and seventy feet deep. The lecture-rooms, the offices for the professors, and the drawing-room are upon the first floor, and the latter is in close contiguity with rooms for blue-printing and other photographic work, which have been conveniently arranged under the roof. The lower floor is devoted to the purposes of laboratory instruction in engineering mechanics. The equipment for engine tests consists of a high-speed Ball automatic engine, arranged so that it can be operated either condensing or non-condensing, a Wheeler condenser, indicators, and friction brakes, thermometers, calorimeters and gauges, the whole constituting a complete outfit for illustrating the best methods of determining the power and efficiency of the steam engine. For work in the strength and elasticity of materials there has been provided a Riehle automatic and autographic testing machine of one hundred thousand pounds capacity, a plain Olsen machine of the same capacity, an Olsen torsional tester for specimens up to five feet in length and one and one-half inches in diameter, an Olsen transverse tester for loads up to eight thousand pounds, and a full outfit of the extensometers, deflection meters, micrometers, and so on, needed with these machines. For testing cements, mortars and concretes, an Olsen lever machine and an automatic Fairbanks machine have been provided, with a proper outfit of accessory apparatus. In addition, a machine for compression tests is now in process of construction in the Laboratory, and will be used later for special researches. For testing lubricants an Olsen machine for journal friction has been secured, an Engler, viscosimeter, apparatus for flash tests and chill tests, thermometers, hydrometers, and so on, and, in addition, a new machine is now under construction in the Laboratory specially designed for experiments on pivot friction. For tests of fuels, furnaces and boilers, the heating plant of the University furnishes an ample basis for experiments. It consists of two large horizontal, return tubular boilers, each with capacity of over one hundred and forty horsepowers. Adequate provision has been made for complete tests of the heating power of the fuels used, the quality of the steam, the temperatures in the furnaces, flues, and chimneys, the constitution of the furnace gases, and the economy and efficiency of the plant. A Favre and Silbermann calorimeter, a Siemens pyrometer, Orsat gas analysis apparatus of an improved type, steam calorimeters, thermometers, gauges, and scales constitute the outfit for this work. Careful attention has been paid to the means for standardizing the apparatus employed. A mercury column for direct measurements of pressure up to two hundred and fifty pounds to the square inch is now under construction, and will provide for the exact calibration of steam and hydraulic gauges, indicators, and so on. An accurately constructed Regnault air thermometer, with the usual apparatus for testing the fundamental points of thermometric graduation will be used to standardize all calorimeters, pyrometers, and thermometers. Standard weights and measures are provided for testing apparatus for measurements of length and mass. The attempt has been made in every particular to provide an equipment which will afford the student of engineering adequate and accurate training in rational and practical methods of test and of research. The investigations and studies of the Testing Laboratory constitute the center towards which all the processes of instruction will converge. Students will be induced, as far as possible, to secure their training in shop-work before entering upon their engineering studies. For those who are unable to secure such training, the time and energy devoted to mere shop-practice will be reduced to a minimum. Each member of the school will be assigned to some special problem; will prepare in the drafting-room the necessary drawings, tracings, and blue-prints for his work, execute the patterns in the wood-shops, make the castings and forgings needed in the foundry and forge room, finish and fit the parts in the metal shop, and finally carry out in detail the experimental investigation contemplated. The object of the course of instruction will be to make engineers rather than machinists, and all details of the work will be organized with that end in view. For the purpose of carrying into effect this programme of instruction all the departments accessory to the Laboratory have been simply, but effectively, fitted up with hand and machine tools of the best modern construction. Needless duplication has been avoided and the various sizes and makes of machine tools have been selected, so as to illustrate the best present practice of American designers. The Wood-shop contains lathes of various sizes, a swing-saw, a saw-table with slitting and cut-off saws, a band-saw, a scroll-saw, a jointer, a planer, a trimmer for pattern work, and a grindstone, with a suffident number of benches for hand work, and a proper outfit of hand tools. The Metal-shop contains Fitchburg and Reed engine lathes of various sizes, a 24-inch Whitcomb planer, a 20-inch Barnes drill-press, a 26-inch Davis and Egan drill-press, a 15-inch crank-shaper of the same make, a Universal milling-machine and a Universal grinder, both from Brown and Sharpe, an emery grinder, a grindstone, a cut-off saw, a gas forge and Reichhelm blower, for forging and tempering tools and other small pieces, with work benches and a full outfit of hand tools. The Foundry is fitted up with a 30-inch Whiting cupola, a brass furnace, and the necessary founders' tools, benches and moulding troughs for sand moulding and core work. The Forge-room is provided with four Sturtevant forges, a smiths' bench, and the necessary outfit of smiths' tools for each forge. Both the Foundry and Forge-room are located in the Boiler House, and the blast and exhaust fans for this work are operated by a small Sturtevant automatic steam engine located in the same building. The equipment of the department in field instruments is modern and complete. It contains a Y level, a dumpy level, a plain transit, a complete transit with vertical arc, stadia wires, and gradienter, a planetable, a sextant, compasses, leveling rods, mercurial and aneroid barometers, tapes, chains, planimeter, protractor, and all needful accessory apparatus for land, city, railway, and hydrographic surveying. Instruction in field engineering as well as in the construction of plans and maps is thorough and practical. GRADUATION AND DEGREES. In each school of this department a special diploma of graduation is awarded to the successful student either in the general or in the advanced courses. In the technical courses similar individual diplomas are awarded. The titled degrees of Civil, Mining, Mechanical, or Electrical Engineer are awarded to students who complete the work as indicated in the following scheme. Civil. Mining. Mechanical. Electrical. A.

TRUSTEES OF THE MILLER FUND. HORACE W. JONES, President. GEORGE W. PALMER, CHARLES E. VAWTER, RANDOLPH HARRISON, JOHN B. MOON, JOHN M. WHITE, GEORGE PERKINS. R. T. W. DUKE, Jr., Secretary. The Department of Agriculture is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va.; this sum having been given to establish a fund, the income of which should be applied, as far as practicable, to the maintenance of experiments in agriculture, training in the art of farming, and instruction in those sciences which underlie that art, as well as in their practical relations thereto. Since the income in question is manifestly inadequate to provide for all these important ends in an efficient manner, it has become necessary for those directly charged with its administration to decide how it can be most usefully applied within the limits indicated. The establishment and maintenance, by the national government, of large and well-equipped experiment stations in each State has made far better and more extensive provision for the first of these interests than could here be afforded were the whole revenue of this Department to be so applied. The work in this direction which was begun here before the establishment of the Virginia Experiment Station at Blacksburg, and for some time maintained, has therefore been discontinued. As regards the second of the objects above named, experience has shown that those who desire training in the details of the various processes involved in the art of farming do not seek it at institutions of learning. Throughout the whole country excellent facilities for such instruction exist, far in excess of the demand. Here, again, the field is now well occupied by a State institution, established, equipped, and maintained for this and kindred purposes. The University has not now, rarely if ever has had in the past, and is no more likely to have in the future, any students pursuing the courses of instruction in the routine work of farming. For these reasons it seems wiser, as well as more consonant with the other functions of the University, to apply the income of this fund to the enlargement, as far as possible, of the opportunities here afforded those who desire to acquire a knowledge of the sciences on which the art of agriculture is based and of which it is the practical application, to understand their theoretical principles as well as their economic relations, and to be capable of following their progress in all its bearings. Young men who desire such a scientific education in order that they may intelligently pursue the vocation of a planter have sought the University for this purpose in the past and will doubtless do so in the future, although at the present time this calling does not loudly invite followers, either educated or uneducated. Instruction is therefore offered in this Department to all who desire such training in the Descriptive and Experimental Sciences as this would imply, together with a knowledge of the closely affiliated Mathematical Sciences, and of the Modern Languages of immediate importance to the scientific student. The degree of Bachelor of Science will be conferred upon compliance with the following conditions: The completion of one B. S. course each in Botany, Physics, General Chemistry, Comparative Anatomy, Geology, and Analytical Chemistry, together with graduation in two of the schools represented by these courses: of one B. S. course, to be selected by the student from the group of Mathematical Sciences, viz, Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Astronomy, and the completion of the courses in Scientific French and Scientific German. The B. S. courses are the same or the equivalent of the B. A. courses, described in a preceding portion of this catalogue; that in Analytical Chemistry is the first course of that School. The conditions of graduation in the scientific Schools have also been previously stated. The hours of lectures will be found in the Academic schedule on page 88; hours for laboratory work, where the course in question calls for them, are adapted to the other work of each student. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Agriculture may be estimated at from $290 a year upwards, according to the mode of living. This is somewhat diminished in the case of Virginia students by the provisions made for their free tuition in certain schools. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia students are entitled to free tuition, may be found in a subsequent section. MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. A scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the candidate who at that time passes the graduating examinations in the B. S. courses of Botany, Chemistry, and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for the following two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department of Agriculture. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure. Candidacy should be announced at the beginning of the session. For information concerning Miller Fellowships in Biology application should be made to the professor in charge of the school of Biology and Agriculture.</field>

Attention is called to the fact that the course has been extended to four years, and provision has been made for the erection and equipment of a Hospital, with extension of clinical instruction in connection therewith. The work of each of the four years of the course in Medicine continues through the full nine months of the University session, beginning on the fifteenth day of September and closing on the Saturday immediately preceding the fifteenth day of the following June. The studies included are arranged as follows: During the first session: Chemistry (with an introductory course upon the principles of Chemical Physics); Biology (Comparative Anatomy and Normal Histology); and Descriptive Anatomy. During the second session: Physiology; Bacteriology; General Pathology; Regional Anatomy; and Hygiene. During the third session: Embryology; Obstetrics; Practice of Medicine; Surgery; Special Pathology and Clinical Diagnosis; and Materia Medica. During the fourth session: Practice of Medicine; Therapeutics; Clinical Surgery; Dermatology; Diseases of the Eye and Ear; Gynecology and Medical Jurisprudence. An examination of this system will show that the work of the first year is given to those sciences which are fundamental to the entire work of the remaining part of the course; that of the second year includes the study of those sciences, more distinctively medical, which are based upon the work of the previous year, while they in turn underlie the more strictly professional subjects of study; these latter are begun in the second year, while the third and fourth years are devoted wholly to them. The larger part of the work of the first year is accompanied by practical work in the laboratory and the dissecting-room; the same is true in great measure of the work of the second year, while in the third, and especially the fourth year, the time of the student is devoted largely to practical clinical instruction. The facilities afforded by the University for such work will be more fully described in the statements which follow concerning the different subjects included in the course. Methods of Instruction.—The instruction is given by systematic lectures and daily oral examinations, with associated practical work in Anatomy, Physics and Chemistry, Histology, Bacteriology, Pathology, and Obstetrics. The daily oral examinations on the subjects of the previous lectures are of great value in stimulating the student to regular and systematic habits of study, and furnishing the professor an opportunity of discovering and removing difficulties met with by the student. Relations of the Student in the Second and Succeeding Years.— Students who pass a satisfactory examination on the subjects studied during the first session are not required to attend the lectures or stand the examinations on these subjects the second year; but if a student fail to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time on one or more of the subjects included in the first year's course, he will be permitted to take such subject or subjects over during the second year, without the payment of any additional fee. Like rules apply to the passage of the student from the second to the third, and from the third to the fourth session. Provided, however, that no student whose failure to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time shall extend to all the subjects of a given year will be permitted to go on to the work of the succeeding year; he will be required to confine himself to a repetition of the work of the year on which he has failed— and no student will be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until he has completed that of the first, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. Students who have taken the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the University of Virginia, on a scheme including such medical subjects as, in connection with other subjects associated therewith, shall be approved by the Medical Faculty, may be admitted to the studies of the second year. Students entering the Medical Department of this University from other medical schools are considered students of the first year until they have passed the examinations hereafter mentioned. Certificates of Attendance.—No one will receive a certificate as a regular student of the Department of Medicine in this University unless he has attended the whole regular course of one or more of the four years. Requirements for Graduation.—No student is permitted to graduate from the University of Virginia with the degree of Doctor of Medicine till he shall have attended the regular course of not less than four years in this institution, and passed a satisfactory examination on all the subjects included in the Medical course, unless, in lieu of either the first or second year's study here, he shall have attended one course of lectures of not less than seven months, or two courses of less than seven months each, in some other reputable medical school, in which case he may apply for graduation at the end of his third or second session in this institution; but in order to obtain the degree he must pass a satisfactory examination at this University on all the subjects heretofore mentioned as included in the medical course. A student who is already a graduate in Medicine of some other reputable medical school may be received as a student in this University of the fourth year. The Graduating Examinations are in writing (accompanied in some subjects by individual practical examinations) and of a rigorous character. Two sets of these are held each year—one near the close of the session, after the completion of the lecture courses; the other at the beginning of the next session. To the latter are admitted— (a) Students of the previous session who from illness or other cause approved by the Faculty were unable to present themselves for examination. These may be examined on any part of the course, and will not be required to matriculate anew. (b) Students who at the close of the preceding session have passed satisfactory examinations on at least one of the studies pursued during that session, and have attained on one or more of the remaining subjects such a grade (but little lower than that required for graduation) as the Faculty may approve. This slightly lower grade must have been reached on the particular subject or subjects on which the student presents himself for re-examination. (c) Students who present certificates of attendance on one or two seven-months' courses or their equivalent at some other reputable medical school. Students falling under classes (b) and (c), after first matriculating and then passing the Fall examinations on the studies of the preceding one or two sessions, may proceed to the work of the second year, or to that of the third year, without attending the lectures on or passing further examinations in, the studies of the preceding session or sessions, except the general examination which immediately precedes graduation. ?These Fall examinations begin within one week from the opening of the session, and are to be completed not later than the first of October. Written notice of intention to stand these examinations must be filed with the Dean of the Medical Faculty on or before the eighteenth of September No special examination will be given in the Department of Medicine except under extraordinary circumstances, to be carefully weighed by the Medical Faculty. Any professor of the Medical Department may exclude from his examination any student whose irregularity of attendance or neglect of practical work warrants, in the professor's judgment, such exclusion. A General Examination is held each year prior to graduation (at the close of the session) on all the different branches on which the candidate for graduation has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet, Mr. Humphreys, Professor Dunnington. In this course the students are taught Chemical Physics and the general principles of Chemistry, and are carried through a course of Descriptive Chemistry, inorganic and organic; their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to Physiology, the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology, and Sanitary Science. Text-Books.—Witthaus' or Fownes' Chemistry; Syllabus of the Professor's lectures. For reference: Charles' Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. A course of laboratory exercises in Practical Physics with especial relation to the needs of the medical student is given by Mr. Humphreys, and a like course in Practical Chemistry is given by Professor Dunnington. These form a part of the prescribed general course in Medicine. MEDICAL BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle, Mr. Powell, Dr. Skeen, Mr. Fox, Mr. Laning, Mr. Livermore. Under this title are grouped, for convenience, the lectures in the courses described below, the whole forming a continuous series of three lectures a week throughout the first year of the Medical course. Each lecture is accompanied by two hours of practical work in the laboratory illustrative of the topics discussed. The laboratory is convenient, well lighted, and amply equipped; forty-eight desks are provided with microscopes, accessory apparatus, and all necessary reagents, and the class is divided into working sections not exceeding that number; desks are assigned by lot at the opening of the session, and apparatus issued as needed from time to time. Each student is required to provide himself with a set of dissecting instruments, and with slides, covers, and labels for microscopical preparations; all other appliances are provided by the laboratory without charge. Comparative Anatomy.—The lectures of the first three months are devoted to the discussion of the comparative anatomy of vertebrates, the thoracic and abdominal viscera being chiefly considered; the student, in the meantime, dissecting and studying a series of animals representative of the principal sub-divisions of the group. The objects of the course are to give such fundamental morphological conceptions and such general anatomical knowledge as shall pave the way for the detailed and specific study of Human Anatomy; to familiarize the student with the normal appearance of healthy organs and tissues as seen immediately after death; and to lay the foundation for the subsequent intelligent study of Histology and of Physiology. The dissections are supplemented by demonstrations and the study of permanent preparations illustrative of features of importance. Text-Book.—None is required at present. Parker's Zoötomy is recommended for laboratory use, and Wiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates (Parker's translation) for collateral reading. Histology.—The lectures of the ensuing months are devoted to the allied subjects of Histology and Histological Anatomy. In the first part of the course the tissues and their component elements are carefully examined, both singly and in their primary aggregates, as are also those organs which consist largely of one form of tissue. The remainder of the course is devoted to an examination of the more complex organs and systems of organs, their constituent tissues and the relations between them being studied. While the primary object of the course is the imparting of clear and accurate knowledge of the minute structure of the body, due attention is paid to the technique which is necessary as a means to that end; students are therefore carefully trained in the use of the microscope and in histological processes, including the selection and preparation of material, the making and mounting of sections, and their subsequent study. Text-Book.—The Professor's Elements of Histology. For reference: Shaefer's Essentials of Histology; Piersol's Normal Histology; Stirling's Outlines of Practical Histology. The attainments of the student in each of the divisions of the course are tested by both written and practical examinations; his standing for the year is determined by an average of all the marks received. Diligent use of the opportunities afforded in the laboratory is essential to the successful completion of the work of the year, and students who are persistently irregular and negligent of their work will not be admitted to the examinations. ANATOMY. Professor Christian, Dr. Bullitt, Dr. Jones, Dr. Sperow. Descriptive Anatomy.—The instruction is given by didactic lectures, combined with the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; no statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection, the effort being to convey knowledge by the so-called natural method—that is, by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the School for this purpose is most ample. Particular attention is called to the fact that in describing the more minute anatomical structures—such as brain, cranial nerves, etc.—cuts and diagrams are not relied upon, as is too often the case, but careful dissections are yearly made and demonstrated to the class. Practical Anatomy.—For this course dissecting material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Attendance in the dissecting room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Every student is required to dissect on all parts of the human body. Two subjects are dissected; the first for muscles and fascias; the second for arteries and nerves. Not more than five dissecting clubs (of eight men each) are admitted to the hall at one time. A Demonstrator for each club superintends the dissections, directing the work of the individual student; and, afterwards, accurately and carefully explaining every dissection to his club. After this careful preparation, besides the ordinary oral and written examinations, each student is required to stand eight practical examinations, one upon osteology, four upon different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, one on the ligaments, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being questioned alone, and required not only to state the origin and insertion of muscles, the beginning, termination and relations of blood vessels, nerves, etc., but to point out or demonstrate each fact. They are thus a perfect test of the student's practical acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body. Regional Anatomy.—This subject is taught to second course students by the same practical methods as are described above. The important bony landmarks, lines of blood vessels, nerves and muscles are carefully described and their positions verified by dissections made before the class. Special attention is paid to the study of the landmarks of the skull, neck, chest, and abdomen, and all the structures in, or bearing relation to, the more important joints. Inguinal and femoral hernia, the perineum and pelvis, are described with special reference to the surgery of these parts. Cross sections of the upper and lower extremities and the neck are made at different levels and described to the students, who are afterwards required to stand practical examinations on these parts. The course, in fact, is a comprehensive review of the facts taught in Descriptive Anatomy, but with special reference to their application to Medicine and Surgery. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Barringer. The study of Physiology is not begun until the student has completed the courses in Chemistry, Anatomy, and Histology, and is hence well prepared to appreciate the broader principles of this subject. The entire work of the school is designed with reference to its practical bearings on the subsequent studies of Pathology and Therapeutics. In the elucidation of this subject the large collection of plates belonging to the Department is supplemented by original preparations and models. Text-Book.—The Professor's Abstract. For reference: Landois's Physiology; Foster's Physiology or Kirke's Physiology. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle, Dr. Graham, Dr. Davis, Dr. Bumgardner, Dr. Skeen, Mr. Laning. Bacteriology is taught by lectures accompanied by practical work in the laboratory. The instruction given at the University in this subject differs from that given in most schools of medicine in several important respects. It is very commonly the case that the student is brought almost at the very outset into relation with the bacteria of disease, the whole or the larger part of the course of instruction being given to their specific study, the technique involved in their culture and determination, and the specific products of their activity. These are all matters of the highest importance, and should by no means be neglected; but exact and extensive knowledge of them may be and too often is associated with entire ignorance of the real nature and affinities of the Bacteria, the general principles of vegetable physiology of which their characteristic activities constitute a special case, and of the essential conditions on which their culture depends. Believing that the educated physician should, as far as possible, know the scientific principles on which his professional knowledge rests, provision has been made for a short course which deals with the Bacteria from the botanical standpoint, discussing the general morphology and physiology of plants to an extent sufficient to give the studentan intelligentidea of the place of these organisms in the vegetable kingdom and of the relation of their life to that of other plants. This knowledge is made the basis of the farther discussion of their economic relations, their action as causes of disease, and of the methods resorted to for their manipulation, the most important processes of bactericultural technique, as far as possible, fully illustrated and demonstrated in the laboratory. The whole course is intended to form a proper preliminary to the specific discussion of the pathogenic bacteria which finds its regular place in the course in Pathology. Text-Book.—The Professor's Introduction to the Bacteria. For reference: Sternberg's or Crookshank's Manual of Bacterology. PATHOLOGY. Adjunct Professor Davis, Mr. Wilson, Dr. Skeen, Mr. Fox. The principles of General and Surgical Pathology are discussed by lectures and illustrated in the laboratory. The processes of disease are studied in detail, with the unaided eye and with the microscope, upon selected specimens. Instruction is given in the method of conducting an Autopsy, in which the object of preserving for future investigation desirable parts is kept particularly in view. This involves pathological technic, in which students receive a thorough drill and are allowed to retain the preparations they make. Practical exercises are given in Clinical Diagnosis, in which examinations of blood, sputum, urine and faeces are required. Each student has also to recognize by the aid of the microscope the nature of tumors submitted to him, as a distinct test in addition to the regular written examination covering the entire work of the course. Fidelity to the laboratory work is an indispensable condition of success. Under the study of Infections the Bacteria concerned are considered in detail and made the subject of investigation in the laboratory, which is equipped with approved modern apparatus. A series of lectures upon the symptoms and therapeutics of Surgical Diseases follows closely the course upon General Pathology. In the third year Special Pathology is taken up and illustrated by appropriate laboratory exercises, in which the lesions of the chief diseases of each system are carefully studied. Text-Books.—The Professor's Syllabus; Stengel's Text-Book of Pathology; Warren's Surgical Pathology and Therapeutics; Abbott's Principles of Bacteriology. EMBRYOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. As a preliminary to the course in Obstetrics there is given a course of lectures upon Embryology in which are discussed the formation and maturation of the reproductive elements; the fertilization of the ovum; the formation of the germ-layers; the embryo and foetal appendages; and the development of the tissues and organs of the body. While the final object sought is a clear conception of these processes as they are known or believed to take place in the formation of the mammalian and especially the human body, the whole subject is treated from the comparative standpoint, as that best adapted to give intelligent and comprehensive ideas thereof; to this end the development of a series of representative vertebrates is discussed and as far as possible made the subject of practical study. Text-Book.—Schaefer's Embryology (Vol. I, Part I of the tenth edition of Quain's Anatomy). For reference: Marshall's Vertebrate Embryology; Hertwig's Embryology of Vertebrates (Mark tr.);Minot's Human Embryology. OBSTETRICS. Professor Buckmaster. In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained by the use of suitable preparations and models. The systematic use of the manikin with the foetus has made it possible for the student to obtain a knowledge of obstetric manipulation which he can acquire in no other way. Special attention is paid to the manikin drill. The course consists of twenty-five demonstrations and is obligatory. A special examination is held and forms a part of the examination for graduation in obstetrics. In order that each student may have ample opportunity to make the demonstrations in the laboratory, the class is divided into sections not exceeding eight men in number. Full information as to the scope of the course will be furnished on application. The number of obstetrical cases applying at the dispensary for treatment at their homes is steadily increasing; the student who is detailed to take charge of such a case is furnished with an outfit containing all the articles necessary for the conduction of an aseptic labor. At the conclusion of each case the student in charge is required to sterilize the towels, sheets, instruments, etc., under the direction of the Assistant in Obstetrics; he must also fill out and sign one of the printed forms furnished by the Department. Such work may count in the class standing. Text-Book.—Practice of Obstetrics, by American authors, by Charles Jewett (Lea Bros &amp; Co., Philadelphia). MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS. Professor Barringer. In Materia Medica particular stress is laid upon the physiological action of drugs as furnishing the only basis for a rational system of therapeutics. The Department is provided with a good collection of drugs, both crude and prepared, which are shown to the student as dealt with in the lectures. Exercises in prescription-writing are given weekly for several months. Text-Book.—White's Materia Medica and Therapeutics. For reference: Brunton's Pharmacology; Wood's Materia Medica. The subject of Therapeutics is taken up among the studies of the fourth year. The range of the work will embrace both general and special therapeutics, whether rational or empirical, but a constant effort will be made throughout to trace those general underlying principles the existence of which alone enables this subject to be called a science. The method pursued will be that of taking up in order the perversions of the various organs and functions rather than the individual forms of disease. Text-Book.—(To be named hereafter). For reference: Bruce's Materia Medica and Therapeutics; Brunton's Pharmacology. SURGERY. Professor Christian. In Operative Surgery the first aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles and technique of modern aseptic surgical procedure. All amputations and ligations, the application of splints, bandages and apparatus for different fractures, are shown upon the cadaver. To insure a practical knowledge of the subject, each student will be required to perform the operations upon the cadaver as a part of his examination for graduation. GYNECOLOGY. Professor Buckmaster. In Gynecology instruction is given by lectures and recitations, and the plastic operations necessary to repair injuries of the pelvic structures are shown during the course. Practical training in the details of gynecological treatment is given at the dispensary. Text-Book.—The Professor's Syllabus. For reference: Principles and Practice of Gynecology, by T. A. Emmet; Treatise on the Diseases of Women. by A. J. C. Skene. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Buckmaster. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching at the Dispensary. In the year 1896-97 over three thousand patients were treated, thus affording ample material for elementary teaching. In the didactic lectures the author's syllabus is used as a guide for the essential points to be considered in a careful study of the textbook. The student is earnestly advised to use the syllabus and textbook before hearing the lecture, as experience has shown this to be the most effective means of obtaining a knowledge of the subject. Text-Books.—A Hand-Book of Physical Diagnosis, etc., by R. C. M. Page; The Principles and Practice of Medicine, by William Osler; a Treatise on Mental and Nervous Diseases, by Landon Carter Gray; The Diseases of Infancy and Childhood, by L. Emmet Holt. HYGIENE. Dr. Lambeth. In this course the chemical and bacterial contamination of food, water, air, and soil first engages the attention of the student. With this preparation he takes up the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, school-houses, etc., with especial reference to modern methods of heating, ventilating, and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in Military and Naval Hygiene. Text-Book.—Rohés Text-Book of Hygiene, or Egbert's Hygiene and Sanitation. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Professor Buckmaster. In this course the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. Text-Book.—Chapman's Medical Jurisprudence. CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. Dr. Barringer, Mr. Furniss, Dr. Buckmaster, Mr. Tucker, Dr. Nelson, Mr. Livermore, Dr. Magruder, Mr. Wilson, Dr. Randolph, Mr. Cocke, Dr. Hedges, Mr. Marxauch, The opportunities for clinical instruction at the University have within the last few years been very greatly increased. The erection and equipment of the University Dispensary and the careful consideration of the needs of the community in this respect have built up an out-patient department vastly in excess of the apparent possibilities of the city, moreover, this material is utilized for purposes of instruction to a much greater extent than is usually done in clinical teaching. The amphitheatre is so arranged that no student is over fifteen feet from the clinical chair or operating table (as the case may be), and each can thus understand and appreciate all that is shown him. For the purpose of still more definite instruction, the whole class is called up in successive small sections to examine special cases and conditions, the students being questioned later on the knowledge so obtained. There is a daily clinic at the Dispensary, in each case occupying the entire afternoon, distributed through the week as follows: Monday, Dr. Buckmaster, Medical. Tuesday, Dr. Nelson, Surgical. Wednesday, Dr. Buckmaster, Medical. Thursday, Dr. Magruder, Physical Diagnosis. Friday, Dr. Hedges, Ophthalmic. Saturday, Dr. Randolph, Genito-urinary. During the past year nearly three thousand distinct cases were treated before the students at the clinical lectures. Of these, about six hundred each were medical, surgical, or eye and ear cases, some five hundred were gynecological cases, and over four hundred were cases of genito-urinary disease. In addition to the work at the Dispensary, the class have seen in sections numerous important surgical operations outside under the care of the clinical teachers, and a large number of the class have been in a similar manner brought into intimate contact with cases of serious illness of various kinds. In obstetrical work, about fifty per cent. of the class have been able to see at least one case each, while some members have had as many as eight or nine cases; it is believed that more systematic arrangements can now be made, and that in the future each member of the class can have one or more cases during the session. Regular attendance upon the daily clinics is required in the last year of the course. There are appointed each year from among the best students of the senior class in medicine a limited number of young men to serve as clinical assistants at the Dispensary. While there is no pecuniary emolument connected with these positions, they afford exceptional opportunities for the acquisition of valuable practical knowledge. It is with great pleasure that the Medical Faculty announce the fact that in the immediate future the means of clinical instruction will be much advanced by the erection and equipment of a permanent Hospital, for which an appropriation has been made by the Visitors of the University. This building will be begun as soon as its structural arrangements can be carefully worked out, and will be completed and brought into use in as short a time as is compatible with good workmanship—in ample time for the instruction of the class entering next session. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of students in the Department of Medicine may be estimated at from $305 upward, according to the mode of living, for the first year; the expenses of succeeding years are somewhat less. A fuller statement of expenses may be found in a subsequent section. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. 9-10 1°—Biol. Lab. A. 3°—Embryol. (1 mo.) 3°—Obstet (1st half) 4°—Pr. Med.

      <field name="fulltext">Department of Law. WM. MINOR LILE, B. L., Professor of Law. * * Died March 12, 1899. WALTER D. DABNEY, B. L., Professor of Law. † † Elected March 28, 1899. CHARLES ALFRED GRAVES, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Law. RALEIGH C. MINOR, M. A., B. L., Adjunct Professor of Law. JAMES B. GREEN, B. L., Licentiate in Law. Among the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia, was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly, the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since, except during the four years of the civil war. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduation— the degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high positions to which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is confidently believed that the enlarged course now offered will enable those who complete it to more surely maintain that rank at the bar which the alma mater has always expected of her sons. Formerly it was possible for the law student to begin and complete his professional studies in the office of some friendly member of the bar—Blackstone's Commentaries and the code of his State forming the main portion of his curriculum. Then the authorities were few, the leading principles alone were settled, and their application was comparatively simple. In more recent times, so widened is the scope of the law, so complex its principles, so nice and yet so important its distinctions, so numerous and conflicting the authorities, that it is scarcely practicable for even the most diligent student to master the subject, in its multiform phases, without the systematic instruction of skilled teachers. Furthermore, the increased and increasing scope and rigor of the examinations for admission to the bar in the several States, call for a more extensive course of study than was afforded in former days by the law school, and a wider and more intimate knowledge of legal principles than can generally be acquired by private study. These considerations have led to a general conviction among the leaders of professional thought throughout the country, that no student should essay the practice of the law who has not spent at least two years in close and attentive study in a law school. Indeed, the tendency is toward requiring even a longer period of study, as essential either to graduation or to admission to the bar. At the annual meeting of the American Bar Association held in August, 1897, the following resolution on this subject was adopted: "Resolved, That the American Bar Association approves the lengthening of the course of instruction in law schools, to a period of three years, and that it expresses the hope that as soon as practicable, a rule may be adopted in each State which will require candidates for admission to the bar to study law for three years before applying for admission." COURSE OF STUDY. The course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures, with careful daily examinations upon both. The daily quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconceptions of legal principles on the part of the student. The course occupies two years. And since future professional success depends upon complete mastery of elementary principles, it is not advisable for the student to devote less time to preparation for practice, even though he be not a candidate for graduation. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough knowledge of the elements of the law, thought as well as reading is requisite; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One can not expect to gorge himself with legal principles and to digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, must accompany the reception of knowledge. ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES. The course of instruction in the Law Department comprises ten separate classes. Five of these classes constitute the first year's studies, and five the studies of the second year. In the first year's course there are seven lectures, and in the second, eight lectures, weekly. The lectures occupy an hour and a half each. The first year's course therefore calls for ten and a half hours of class work a week, and the second twelve hours. In addition, any professor has the privilege of requiring attendance upon one extra lecture each alternate week, in each class, for the purpose of review or such other instruction as does not add new matter to the prescribed course upon which the student is to be examined for graduation. The following table exhibits an outline of the course: First Year. 1. The Law of Persons; Personal Property (including Sales); Wills, Probate and Administration. 2. The Law of Contracts; Torts; Carriers and Bailments. 3. Public International Law; Constitutional Law; Theory of Government. 4. Mercantile Law: Negotiable Paper; Partnership; Insurance. 5. The Law of Crimes and Punishments. Second Year. 1. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. 2. The Law of Evidence; Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases. 3. The Law of Real Estate. 4. The Law of Corporations. 5. Conflict of Laws. FIRST YEAR'S COURSE. 1. Law of Persons; Personal Property; Wills, Probate, and Administration. Professor Lile. The preliminary lectures in this class are devoted to the nature, sources and evidences of the law; the absolute and relative rights, and their constitutional guaranties; citizenship and naturalization; and subordinate magistrates. This is followed by a thorough drill in the subjects of principal and agent; husband and wife, including their common law property rights, with the modern statutory modifications thereof; parent and child; and guardian and ward. Later, the study of the law of personal property (including the law of sales) is pursued in its various phases, followed by that of wills, probate and administration. Under the latter classification are includ the execution and construction of wills; the qualification of personal representatives and the settlement of their accounts; the law of legacies and of distribution; and the complete administration of estates.—September 15 to February 25—Three times a week. Text-Books.—1 Minor's Institutes (4th edition). Benjamin's Principles of Sales. The Professor's Printed Notes. (Others to be announced.) 2. Law of Contracts; Torts; Bailments and Carriers. Professor Dabney. In this class the student is taught the principles underlying the formation, validity, interpretation, and discharge of contracts generally, whatever may be their particular subject matter; the principles of the law of torts, and their application to the subjects of negligence, nuisance, trespass to person and property, fraud and deceit, defamation, and other cases of practical importance; the principles of the law of carriers of persons and property, whether by land or by water, and whether by incorporated companies or individuals, including the transmission of messages by telegraph, and showing in detail the modern application of the law of contract and torts to these great agencies of commercial and of social life.—September 15 to June 1—Twice a week. Text-Books.—Clark on Contracts. Bigelow on Torts. Lawson on Bailments. 3. Public International Law; Constitutional Law; Theory of Government. Professor Minor. The first part of this course is devoted to the study of Public International Law. The various rules which regulate the intercourse of nations amongst themselves are here considered—such as the principles governing the origin, recognition, and equality of states; their rights in time of peace, and the means whereby they peaceably procure the enjoyment of those rights; the laws of war and the rights and duties of belligerents; and finally the rules governing the relations of neutral and belligerent states. Private International Law, or the Conflict of Laws, which is a distinct branch of the law, resting upon altogether different principles, is postponed to the second year. Following the lectures upon Public International Law, a series of lectures will be delivered on the Theory and Practice of Government. It is traced from its generally accepted origin in the family, through its various stages, to the modern forms, and effort is made by reasoning and comparison to show the benefits of good government, the dangers of the bad. In the study of Constitutional Law, close attention is given to the judicial interpretation of the Federal Constitution, and to the great constitutional principles prevailing throughout the Union. As occasion requires, attention is called to the policy of various acts of legislation, and the student is warned against such as tend to exceed the limits of safe and constitutional restrictions. The checks and balances of the constitution are duly noted, and that wherein it is weak alluded to as well as that wherein it is strong. The Federal Constitution is discussed section by section, noting the historical origin of the more important provisions, with a close study of such subjects as ex post facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contracts, trial by jury, due process of law, power of taxation and of eminent domain, the police power, inter-state commerce, etc. These subjects constitute one class, in which one examination only is held. September 15 to January 25—Twice a week. Text-Books.—International Law: Davis. Principles of Constitutional Law: Cooley. The Professor's Notes. 4. Mercantile Law Professor Lile. Under this head are grouped the subjects of Negotiable Instruments, Insurance and Partnership. The instruction is made as practical as possible, by frequent use of the various mercantile instruments, as exhibits, in the course of the lectures. In the study of the law of negotiable paper, constant reference is made to the Negotiable Instruments Law, recently enacted in several States, including Virginia, and likely to be adopted generally, throughout the country. In addition to the study of the general principles of the law of insurance, attention is devoted to particular clauses most useful in life, marine and accident policies, and the New York Standard Fire Policy is studied, clause by clause, in the light of judicial construction.—February 25 to May 15— Three times a week. Text-Books.—Bigelow on Bills and Notes (Student's Series). Richards on Insurance. Mechem on Partnership. The Negotiable Instruments Law. The Professor's Notes. 5. The Law of Crimes and Punishments. Professor Minor. In the study of this subject, which succeeds the course on International and Constitutional Law, the student is made familiar with the general principles enforced by the courts in the administration of criminal justice. He is instructed as to the nature and elements of the more important crimes, both common law and statutory. Attention is given rather to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the leading principles than to the less important details, which, with a knowledge of the former, may readily be acquired. The course of instruction further embraces a study of the forms of procedure, the nature, organization and duties of the courts, and grand and petit juries; arrests and bail; indictments, informations, presentments, and the various defenses, by way of plea or otherwise; together with the ordinary incidents of a criminal trial, such as challenges of jurors, motions for a new trial, bills of exceptions, motions in arrest of judgment, and writs of error.— January 25 to April 25—Twice a week. Text-Book.—Synopsis of Criminal Law: Minor. The Professor's Notes. SECOND YEAR COURSE. 1. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. Professor Lile. After consideration of the origin and rise of the chancery jurisdiction, the student is led carefully through the usual subjects of equitable cognizance, and thence into the methods of procedure, as recognized in the High Court of Chancery in England, and as modified by statute or by rules of court in America. The contrast between legal and equitable principles and procedure is constantly adverted to, and the student is incited to the appreciation and cultivation of the fine sense of moral right underlying the doctrines of technical equity. The procedure in the Federal courts of chancery and in the chancery courts of Virginia (where the distinction between legal and equitable procedure is still maintained) is made the basis of instruction. Practical work is required in draughting the various forms and pleadings, from the subpoena to the final decree. The student will be sufficiently instructed in the law of Bankruptcy to give him a fair working knowledge of its general principles, and effort will be made to secure as great a familiarity as possible with the specific provisions of the National Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and the prescribed rules of procedure thereunder.—September 15 to February 1—Twice a week. Text-Books.—Bispham's Principles of Equity. Text-books on Equity Practice and Bankruptcy: (to be announced). The Professor's Notes. 2. The Law of Evidence; Pleading and Practice. Professor Dabney. In this class are taught: (1) The general principles of the law of Evidence, with explanations of the statutory changes, especially those relating to the competency of witnesses, and the practical application of these principles to the conduct of inquiries in court, or before officers authorized to take testimony. (2) The forms of action, and the forms, principles and rules of pleading, at common law and under the codes; an intimate acquaintance with the common law rules and principles being insisted upon as essential to a proper knowledge of pleading, under any system. (3) The organization and jurisdiction of courts, and the proceedings in a lawsuit from beginning to end, including appellate proceedings and the various special and extraordinary proceedings provided for by common law or by statute. (4) The organization and jurisdiction of the Federal courts, removal of causes from State to Federal courts; the particulars of conformity or nonconformity between the procedure at law in the Federal courts and that in the courts of the State wherein they are held; and appellate proceedings in the Federal courts.—September 15 to May 25— Three times a week. Text-Books.—McKelvey on Evidence. 4 Minor's Institutes (3d edition). Bryant's Code Pleading. Dabney's Federal Jurisdiction and Law Procedure. 3. The Law of Real Estate. Professor Minor. The instruction in this class covers a detailed and careful study of the subject of Real Property Law, in all its branches. The nature and several kinds of real estate, and the various estates therein, with the principles appertaining to each, curtesy and dower, the relations of landlord and tenant, co-tenancies, the feudal tenures and principles, uses and trusts, the far-reaching effects of the Statute of Uses, the conditions, covenants and other qualifications attached to conveyances of land, are reviewed at length. The historical connection between ancient and modern doctrines of conveyancing, with the statutory changes, are carefully traced. Remainders, reversions, and executory limitations, and the principles governing their creation, validity, and effect, together with the sources of title to lands, whether by descent or by the manifold forms of purchase, and the principles controlling each, the subjects of conveyances, contracts to convey, wills of lands, adverse possession, the registry of instruments of title, and the principles regulating the acquisition and validity of tax-titles, are investigated in detail. Throughout this course, emphasis is placed on common law principles, and effort is made to give the student a clear comprehension of these, by tracing them to their feudal or other sources, and by following them into the modern forms they have assumed under the guiding hand of the courts and the legislature.—September 15 to March 9—Three times a week. Text-Books.—2 Minor's Institutes (4th edition). Tax Titles: Minor. The Professor's Notes. 4. The Law of Corporations. Professor Lile. The recent development of the law of corporations, both in extent and importance, has induced special stress to be laid upon this branch of the curriculum. Among other subjects of lesser import, the lectures embrace the promotion, organization and management of business corporations; the formation and enforcement of subscriptions for shares; corporate duties, powers and liabilities; the relations between the corporation and the State, between the corporate body and its shareholders, officers, agents and creditors, and the reciprocal relations of these with each other; the consolidation, dissolution, and winding up of corporations; and the appointment, duties and powers of receivers. The principles applicable to municipal corporations, whether in their public or their proprietary characters, are fully elucidated; the subjects of municipal taxation, municipal bonds, franchises, etc., rights and liabilities in connection with streets, as affecting the municipality, the public generally and the abutting proprietors, are dealt with in detail.—February 1 to June 10—Twice a week. Text-Book.—Taylor on Corporations. The Professor's Printed Notes. 5. The Conflict of Laws. Professor Minor. Since the laws of several States may conflict with respect to any subject, it is fitting that the main principles of law governing every subject should be studied, prior to the consideration of the conflict of these principles. Hence this course is reserved until the last portion of the session, following upon the subject of Real Property Law. As the facility of commerce and intercourse between the various States and countries of the world increases, this subject becomes of graver importance, though as yet it has received rather scanty recognition at the hands of text-writers and law-schools. The course includes a discussion of the nature and various kinds of domicil; the law governing status, and the conveyance of personal property abroad; the execution, construction and effect of foreign wills, successions and administrations; foreign marriages and divorces; and transactions relating to real estate; the execution, interpretation and validity of foreign contracts; the law governing the effect of foreign judgments in rem or in personam; the recovery of damages for foreign torts; the application of the lex fori; and the modes of proving foreign laws.—March 10 to May 5—Three times a week. Text-Book.—Conflict of Laws: Minor. The Professor's Notes. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court, with its accompanying instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the professors, he is required to write opinions upon supposed cases; to draw wills, contracts, conveyances, and other assurances; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct actions at law and suits in equity; to argue questions of law and of fact; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of practising counsel. The conduct of at least one case in the Moot Court is required of every candidate for graduation. The court is presided over by the members of the Law Faculty, and attendance on the part of every student is compulsory. Much interest is added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument of each case, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whose diffidence prompts them to silence. The debating societies, of which there are several, also afford an excellent field for the cultivation of the powers of oratory and debate. Through the liberality of several of the leading law publishers, the department is able to offer a number of valuable prizes for excellence in the work of the Moot Court. During the session of 1897-98 the following prizes were awarded: 1. The WEST PUBLISHING COMPANY Prize—American Annual Digest, 10 volumes—To E. Lee Trinkle, B. L., of Wytheville, Va. 2. The BANCROFT-WHITNEY COMPANY Prize—Rapalje's Digest of the American Decisions and Reports, and Mack's and Church's Digests of the American State Reports, 5 volumes—To James H. Corbitt, M. A., University of Virginia. 3. The BOSTON BOOK COMPANY Prize—The Green Bag (bound) 3 volumes—To Gordon M. Buck, B. A., B. L., of New Orleans, La. 4. The BANKS &amp; BROTHERS Prize—Kerr on Real Property, 3 volumes—To Henry Wise Mayo, B. L., of Richmond, Va. 5.

In addition to the foregoing prizes in connection with the work of the Moot Court, the following prizes were awarded for theses on a subject assigned by the Law Faculty, in a competition open to all members of the Law School. Subject: "The Extraterritorial Effect of Divorce, as Amongst the Several States." 1. The EDWARD THOMPSON CO. Prize—American and English Encyclopedia of Law (2d ed.), 30 volumes—To Brutus J. Clay, A.

LIBRARY—LEGAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. The Law Department is provided with an excellent library, accommodated by its own library room, separate from the general University library, and located with special reference to the convenience of the law students. While the student is not encouraged to venture for himself into either cases or text-books, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, he is incited to familiarize himself not only with the leading cases to which his attention is called, but especially with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To the latter subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are specially devoted. The student is taught that books are the working tools of the lawyer, and that facility in handling them, in the office and in the court-room, is an essential professional requirement. He is instructed how to consult authorities, and to run down cases; to distinguish doctrine from dicta; to analyze, criticise and compare cases; to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; what the leading text-books are on the various subjects taught, with some reference to their comparative merits; to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar. EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREE. The degree of Bachelor of Laws is conferred upon such students as have attended two full sessions (of nine months each) of the law school, and who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing all the written examinations, in each of the classes, and who have satisfactorily performed the Moot Court or other assigned work. Any one of the five classes of the first or second year may be completed separately, and for purposes of examination (only) the subjects of Evidence and of Pleading and Practice are regarded as distinct classes. Upon the satisfactory completion of any class, a certificate is issued to the student, followed by the diploma of graduation when (and not until) all the examinations, fifteen in number, have been successfully passed. Candidates who attain a grade of seventy-five per centum in any class, but who fail to reach the minimum standard required for graduation (eighty-three per centum), are entitled, after matriculation, to stand an examination at the beginning of the following session on the subjects comprised in the class or classes in which they have so failed, and to receive the same credit for the result as if achieved during the previous session. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations, as shall be prescribed. MISCELLANEOUS. Admission to Advanced Standing.—By a recent enactment of the Visitors, the Law Faculty is authorizedo accept certificates of attendance for one full session, of at least eight months, and of work satisfactorily performed, at other approved law schools, in lieu of the whole or any part of the first year's course; provided the applicant shall pass a satisfactory entrance examination before the Law Faculty on such subjects as he desires credit for. These entrance examinations will be held at the beginning of each session, in September. They will not be perfunctory merely, but the examiners will insist upon thorough familiarity with every subject within the scope of the examinations. It is the settled policy of the Law Department that in thus departing from former regulations, there shall be no departure from the traditional high standard uniformly required for graduation. No credit will be given for mere attendance at another law school, nor in any event will the privilege of examination for advanced standing be extended to those who have merely received private instruction. Entrance Examinations.—No other entrance examinations are held than as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Special Students.—Students who can attend but a single session are advised to take special courses, which the arrangement of the classes readily permits. Overzealousness, by which an ambitious student is beguiled into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a single year, leads to cramming and inaccuracy, and often to complete failure. With this admonition, the special student is free to select his own work. The following course is suggested for students who are not candidates for the degree. First year classes 1, 4, and 5, (see page —), and second year classes 2 and 3; or, if the student has already had some legal training, numbers 1 and 4 of the second year may be added. The first course suggested would require 13½ hours, and the second 16½ hours, of class-work a week. Late Entrance.—The work of the Law Department begins promptly September 15, and continues until the middle of June. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress—but the matriculation books are open throughout the session and it is permissible to enter at any time. The course of study is arranged, however, on the theory that it will be taken up at the beginning of the session. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the course has advanced at the time of his entrance, and any material loss of time by late entrance will disqualify him for graduation the next year. Seats in the Law Lecture-rooms are assigned in the order of matriculation. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at from $320 upwards, according to the mode of living, for each session. A fuller statement regarding expenses may be found in the following section. SCHEDULE OF LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. 1898-99. LAW DEPARTMENT. (Subject to change as circumstances may require.)

      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES. A student's expenses consist of the following: (1) University charges which are the same for all students; (2) School Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; (3) Cost of living, board, etc. 1. Under the first head are included the University fee, $40, and the contingent deposit, $10. The University, or Matriculation, Fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the members of the Medical Faculty in case of illness, including, if needed, care and nursing in a well-equipped infirmary maintained on the University grounds for students only. It also covers all diploma fees. The Contingent Deposit is liable for any damage to the University property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library or other University rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is, therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. 2. Under the second head, is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper and, in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials for laboratory work. In the Academic Department the tuition fee for one school is $50; for two, $30 each; for three or more, $25 each; except that in Analytical Chemistry the charge for tuition and materials is $50 and for apparatus about $10 for one course, and for both courses pursued the same year for tuition and materials, $100, and for apparatus, about $15; the charges for a graduate course in Chemistry are, tuition $50, materials about $10, apparatus about $10; the fee for Agricultural Chemistry is $15, but this course is free to students in the Schools of Chemistry and to unmatriculated farmers; and there is a laboratory fee for materials of $10 in the B. A. course and of $20 in the M. A. course in Comparative Anatomy. The tuition fees in the Academic Department are remitted to Virginia students, to public school teachers of the State, and to ministers of the gospel, under conditions which are stated at length at the close of this section. In the Department of Engineering the fee for Applied Mathematics is $50; for other subjects, the same as in the Academic Department. In the Department of Agriculture the fees are the same as in the Academic Department. In the Department of Medicine the fee for the first year is $110; second year, $100; third year, $80; fourth year, $60. The special fees for single subjects are, Medical Chemistry, $30; Biology (including materials), $35; Anatomy (including materials), $45; Regional Anatomy (including materials), $10; General Pathology, $25; Pathogenic Bacteriology and Surgical Diseases, $35; Physiology, $30; Materia Medica, $20; Therapeutics, $10; Embryology, $10; Obstetrics (with manikin work), $20; Gynecology, $20; Surgery, $20; Practice of Medicine, $30; Special Pathology and Clinical Diagnosis, $10; Dermatology and diseases of the Eye and Ear, $15; Hygiene, $10; Medical Jurisprudence, $10; Clinics (collectively), $30. In the Department of Law the fee for each regular year's course or for any five classes is $100; more than five classes (combining first and second year's courses), $115; four classes, $85; three classes, $65; two classes, $40; one class, $25. 3. Under the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take meals with a Mess Club, or in a University Hotel, or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding-house, in which case he pays no room-rent nor servant's hire to the University. The price of University rooms range according to their desirability, from $25 to $40 for the session: the large majority rent for $30; but there are a few single rooms at $25, and a few whose price is above that of the majority. If two students occupy one room each pays half the rent; the University charge for service is $9 per session for each student, whether there be one or two in a room. The minimum cost of furnishing a room may be placed at $20; fuel and lights cost about $25 for the session, and washing from $1.50 upward per month. With the strictest economy the cost of board, fuel, lights, service, and laundry can be brought within $18 a month as an average for the session. Rooms and board may be had in private families or boarding-houses at varying prices, but good accommodations can not be obtained at a cost materially below the estimate just given. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire two years course, it amounts to about $90. But in this Department, as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. The following table will enable the prospective student to form an approximate estimate of the cost of a year at the University. It of course makes no account of clothing and other personal expenses, or of the cost of travel. The contingent fee is omitted, as not necessarily involving expenditure. Univ. Fee. Tuition. Books, etc. Living. Total. Academic: $40 * * The remission of the tuition fee to Virginia students would reduce the estimated total by that amount (i. e., $190 as a probable minimum). $ 75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 *$265 to $400 (for three schools) Engineering: $40 $100 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $290 to $425 Agriculture: $40 $ 75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $265 to $400 Medicine: $40 $110 $20 $135 to $270 $305 to $450 (the first year) Law: $40 $100 $45 $135 to $270 $320 to $455 Matriculation fees, the contingent deposits, rents of rooms in the University buildings, and the service for the same are payable upon entrance. Tuition fees are payable, one-half on entrance, and the remainder the first week in January. Students from Virginia.—In compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, sec. 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction without charge for tuition in all the Schools of the Academic Department (excepting the laboratory courses in Chemistry), subject to the conditions stated below. Such students are required to pay the Matriculation fee and make the usual Contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in courses of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the University grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $60 to $100 according to the number of Schools elected. The Faculty are required by the law above referred to to satisfy themselves in the case of each applicant, either by actual examinations or by a diploma or certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission in accordance with the terms of this law are required as follows. The examinations are held at the beginning of the session; due announcement is made of the hour and place of each: 1. For admission to the School of Latin, on forms, syntax, and Books i, ii of Caesar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Catiline. 2. For admission to the School of Greek, on forms, syntax, and three Books of Xenophon. 3. For admission to the School of Mathematics, Geometry, Algebra, and Plane Trigonometry. For admission to the other Schools, a good English education is alone required. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student it is necessary that the applicant's parents be bona fide residents of the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority it is necessary that he be a bona fide resident. A resident of the State is one who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intentions of removing therefrom in the future. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Privileged Students.—Ministers of the gospel may attend any of the Literary or Scientific Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. White Male Teachers and superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Department of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching Spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission are required to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 5. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarships and Fellowships. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. At their meeting on December 10th, 1897, the following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the University were adopted by the Board of Visitors: A. For every five academic students in any one sessi n sent to the University by any private school from its pupils of the preceding session, said school shall be entitled to a scholarship the next session in the Academical department of the University, eligible to white male students, said scholarship exempting the recipient, if he be a Virginian, from the payment of the matriculation fee, and if he be from any other State, from the payment of tuition fees, but in neither case exempting him from payment of fees for laboratory courses in Chemistry. These scholarships shall be awarded under the following conditions: 1. The recipient must be selected from the pupils of the session preceding that in which they are to enter upon the scholarship. 2. Candidates shall stand examinations on Latin, Mathematics, and the English Language. In Latin and Mathematics the examinations will be on a course equivalent to that of Course A in the University, and in English on a course that shall insure adequate preparation for the B. A. course. The examination questions shall be sent from the University to the head-masters of the schools, who will hold the examinations on certain specified days about the middle of May, and will send the papers to the Secretary of the Faculty, signed with a pledge, the head-master in addition certifying that to the best of his knowledge, the candidates received no assistance in the examinations. The papers will then be read by the professors of the respective subjects, and such of them as reach the standard required by the University will be sent back, with numerical percentage marks attached, to the head-masters, who will then select one of the pupil thus passing the examination to receive the scholarship, but if none of the papers attain the University standard, no scholarship shall be awarded. B. The same privileges under the same conditions and limitations shall be extended to the public schools of the whole country. C. The University offers to the public schools of Virginia six academic scholarships, two of which are to be filled annually (except when the occurrence of vacancies leads to a modificat on), and each is to be held no longer than three years by the incumbent, who shall receive $200 per annum from the University, and shall be exempted from the payment of the matriculation fee. Any scholar holding a scholarship under this provision who does not pass in at least one of his classes for the whole of any year shall forfeit his scholarship thereby. In case of a vacancy occurring during the term of any incumbent at the beginning of the session, it shall be filled by the appointment, for the unexpired term, of the person receiving the next eligible mark, at the preceding examination, to those regularly appointed at that time. Should a vacancy occur during the session, it shall be filled for the remainder of the term, if any, in a similar manner, from the candidates at the following May examination. Each public school shall be allowed to name three, or less, of its white male graduates of the current session or candidates for graduation (who shall not be eligible unless they graduate that session) as candidates for scholarships, and these shall stand examinations in Latin, Mathematics, and English, under the same regulations as stated above. The University professors shall read and value the papers, and the scholarships shall be awarded to the candidates who receive the highest marks, provided these marks reach the University standard, and provided that not more than one candidate from any one school shall receive a scholarship the same year. Each successful candidate must enter upon his University course at the beginning of the session following his last session at the public schools, and if he voluntarily chooses not to avail himself of the privileges of his scholarship before his three years expire, he can not be reinstated. The subjects assigned for the University Scholarship examinations in May, 1898, are as follows: I. Latin: (I) Paradigms; Rules of Gender; Force of Tenses of the Indicative, Subjunctive, and Infinitive; Force of Cases. (II) Translations from Cornelius Nepos, or Cæsar De Bello Gallico, Books I and II; Cicero's I and II Orations against Catiline. (III) Exercises involving the application of the leading principles of Syntax, with questions on the same. For translation two extracts within the limits above given. The student will be expected to know the historical references in extracts given for translation. II. Mathematics: Venable's Geometry; Wells' Plane and Spherical Trigonometry; Charles Smith's Algebra (omitting Interest and Annuities, Continued Fractions, and Probability.) III. English Language: The applicant will be examined as to his knowledge of English Grammar, the elements of Composition, the principles of Rhetoric, and, in general, as to his ability to express his thoughts in writing. In the latter test great weight will be given to spelling, punctuation, legibility of handwriting, neatness of form, etc. In preparation for this examination, the following books are suggested: Baskervill and Sewell's English Grammar; Emerson's History of the English Language; Genung's Outlines of Rhetoric. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. These Scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. The incumbents shall be appointed by the local Alumni Associations now organized throughout the country and appearing in this catalogue; and by such other local Associations as may hereafter be organized, and who, by consent of the Board of Visitors of the University, become entitled to the privilege. Provided that no association shall be entitled to make such appointment, except upon the terms and conditions hereafter mentioned. 3. No incumbent shall hold such scholarship for more than one year: but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the University in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These scholarships shall be confined to those classes in the Academic Departments of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the course in Analytical Chemistry). The scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition and matriculation fees. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the Association making the appointment, be able to attend the University. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the University. 7. These provisions shall be applicable only to such associations as are already organized and appear in this catalogue; and to such of these only as may have twenty or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. But any local Association hereafter organized, having twenty or more such active members, may apply to the Board of Visitors, and upon obtaining the consent of the Board, shall be listed among those entitled to fill the Scholarships hereby created. 8. Every local Alumni Association, as above described, having twenty or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University; if hereafter such Association ceases to have as many as twenty active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 9. Every such local Association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, so long as they shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as they shall reach that number. 10. But no Association shall be entitled to make such appointment for any session, except such as, through their Secretaries, shall have mailed to the General Secretary of the Alumni (at the University), on or before the first day of May preceding the session for which the application is to be made, a complete list of the active members of such Association, with their correct post-office addresses at that time, and the names of the officers of such Association. Provided, however, that for appointments to go into effect on the fifteenth of September, 1899, it will be sufficient if such list is mailed on or before the first day of July, 1899. 11. By "active" members as herein used, is meant Alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the Association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No Alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one Association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an Alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one Association, at the same time. But graduation in any Department or School of the University is not hereby required. 12. Only one Association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the Scholarships hereby created. 13. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole Association, a majority of the active members being present and voting of record for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the Association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the Association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the Association. 14. A copy of the minutes of the meeting, which shall include the final result of the vote of the Association, the candidates who are voted for, with their post-office addresses, and the name of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance with the conditions contained in Sections 5, 6, 10 and 13, must be certified to the Chairman of the Faculty of the University of Virginia, attested by the signatures of the presiding officer and secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the Chairman of the Faculty on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed, and the Chairman of the Faculty is hereby authorized to print forms of such certificate, which may be sent to the officers of any Association desiring the same. 15.

      <field name="fulltext">Regulations. 1. Admission.—The age of the student must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended, or other evidence of general good conduct, is required. The student must matriculate in at least three academic schools, or their equivalent, except by special order of the Faculty. 2. Dormitory.—The occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Proctor before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Proctor on or before September 1, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sub-let or used for other than its proper purpose. 3. Boarding.—Students may board and lodge either in the University precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the Chairman to withdraw the license from any house, in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Chairman's office. 4. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, cannot be made except by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same school with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. 5. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the student's professors and the Chairman, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. 6. Absence from Lecture may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses should be rendered at the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lecture render the student liable to be disciplined by the Faculty. 7. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by the physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. In such cases a special examination will be granted, but in no other. 8. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Chairman. When a permit is granted upon the physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. 9. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault, which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. 10. Conduct.—Drunkenness, gambling and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the Chairman is instructed to dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them. Profane swearing, habits of expense, visiting bar-rooms or gaming tables, the use or possession of fire-arms or other deadly weapons, the unauthorized contraction of debts, and the use by the student in his lodgings or in the University precincts of intoxicating drinks, except on prescription of the University physician, are also violations of University law, and punishable by admonition or suspension. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. 11. Prohibition of Credit.—An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. 12. Athletic Teams and Musical Clubs.—The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical Culture (page 144). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of musical clubs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Physical Culture. WILLIAM A. LAMBETH, M. D., Director of the Gymnasium. The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficacy; for, however valuable any system may be, it can not be maintained in its entirety without a consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical condition and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encouraged in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury or inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the University are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnastics—marching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. The Faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the University athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by making the following strength tests, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletic Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room and the various oflices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the baths—needle, shower, spray, tubs and plunge— supplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The Gymnasium is open from 7 A. M. to 7 P. M. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other University duties. The campus adjacent to the Gymnasium, and the Athletic field on the southern side of the grounds, furnish ample playground for football, baseball, tennis, and track athletics. The former contains a well-drained and ballasted running track, four laps to the mile; on the latter, which is enclosed, the exhibition games of football and baseball are held. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercises only a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or unwise excess in physical exercises, while giving to the student as far as possible entire liberty of management. But a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University. REGULATIONS CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of field and track athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or the morals of the participants. 2. No one shall be a member of any University athletic team, or act as such in any intercollegiate contest, who is not at the time of such contest a regularly matriculated student or an instructor in the University. 3. No student will be permitted to play upon the University football and baseball teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium, and with his approbation. 4. Leave of absence for the purpose of playing intercollegiate match games may be allowed to the baseball and football teams, such leaves not to exceed four days in the session in the case of either team. 5. No student under twenty-one years old will be permitted to play with either team in games away from the University, either as a regular member of the team or as a substitute, except upon written permission from his parent or guardian addressed to the Chairman of the Faculty. 6. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be permitted to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacations and holidays. 7. Special monthly reports will be made to the Faculty with respect to the class standing and progress in study of each player on the athletic teams during the football and baseball seasons, whether such player be a regular or substitute member of either team or an applicant for either position. 8. Any member of an athletic team who is reported for neglect of his studies or non-attendance on lectures may be required by the Faculty to sever his connection with such team. 9. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 10. Experts for purposes of instruction and professional teams for purposes of practice may be employed on the University grounds, but only with written permission from the Chairman of the Faculty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Religious Worship. I.—YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. J. M. BRODNAX, General Secretary. Object.—The Young Men's Christian Association, founded 1858, is the largest student-organization in the University. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.—The distinctive work of the Association consists in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night from 7.15 to 8.00; in conducting, through some of its most active members, several Sunday Schools in the University and vicinity; in arranging various Bible Study Classes under the direction of the most experienced students of the Bible; and in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters. Biblical Instruction.—Under the auspices of the Young Men's Christian Association, and through the generous support of the Christian Woman's Board of Missions, the following courses in the English Bible were given, during the session 1898-99, extending through twelve weeks: 1. The Topography and Geography of the Holy Land, Rev. John R. Sampey, D. D. (of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary). 2. The Acts of the Apostles, Rev. Carl E. Grammer, S. T. D. (late of the Episcopal Theological Seminary, Alexandria, Va.). 3. The Historical Study of the Life of Christ, Rev. Charles A. Young, Chicago, Ill. For the entire session of 1899-1900, attractive courses will be given by the following lecturers: Rev. Charles A. Young, of Chicago, Ill. Rev. W. W. Moore, D. D., of Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Va. Rev. A. Coke Smith, D. D., Lynchburg, Va. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.—The Campus, situated just outside the University grounds, and adjoining the handsome Fayerweather Gymnasium, is fitted up for tennis, baseball, bootball, and with a graded and ballasted running track, and is now opened to the free use of all students. Y. M. C. A. Hall.—The northwest wing of the Rotunda, assigned by the Faculty to the Association for its exclusive use, consists of a spacious and conveniently situated assembly-room, with two offices adjoining. This hall has been handsomely furnished by the Association with carpet and opera chairs, and is now being used for its various purposes in Christian work. Membership.—The membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate members; any member of an evangelical church, who is in good standing, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member upon payment of the annual dues. The sessional fee for membership is $1.50, payable in advance. Indorsement.—The Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care is encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the University. An opportunity to do this is always given at the opening reception for new students. II.—CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the University consist of a daily prayer service of fifteen minutes, just before the supper hour; and the regular preaching services in the Chapel on Sunday morning and evening. The daily prayer services are conducted by students and members of the Faculty. The Sunday services are conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent States. All the details of this plan are entrusted to a committee on Religious Exercises composed of three members of the Faculty and three students selected from the officers of the Young Men's Christian Association. The list of the University preachers for the current session may be found on a previous page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Students' Literary Societies. There are two Literary Societies of long standing—the Jefferson Society and the Washington Society—connected with the University. They hold weekly meetings in their respective halls and give public exhibitions at intervals during the session and at its close. There is an annual contest during the session between the two societies for the Harrison Trophy. The society winning this trophy retains it until it is recaptured by the other society. Each society offers several medals; the one for the best orator is presented by the society, but the medal for the best debater in each society is presented by the Rector and Visitors and is known as the Rector and Visitors' Debating Medal. The two societies jointly maintain the University Magazine. For excellence in composition in this Magazine several prizes are given. First, a medal is awarded for the best contribution to the University Magazine by a member of either society. Second, a prize of twenty dollars in gold for the best orginal poem published in the Magazine during the session of 1897-98. This prize offered by Professor James A. Harrison will be continued if the results are favorable. Third, a twenty dollar gold double-eagle is offered for the best translation in prose or verse from any of the languages taught at this University. This is open to all matriculates of the University, provided the translation appears in the Magazine. This prize, also given by Professor Harrison, is offered for a period of five years beginning with the session of 1895-96. At the close of each session the Societies invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them. MEDALISTS. 1897-98. Jefferson Society, Orator: Joseph C. Taylor, Richmond, Va.

      <field name="fulltext">Society of the Alumni. Alumni Hall.—One of the University buildings has been recently set aside by action of the Board and fitted up for the accommodation of visiting Alumni. Here they will find comfortable lodging and sitting rooms as well as some one ready to show them around the University and introduce them to professors or students. This is merely a temporary provision for the comfort of the Alumni, until the necessary funds can be collected for the erection of a permanent Alumni Hall, subscriptions for which are now being taken. It is hoped that this will form headquarters for those of the Alumni who from time to time visit the alma mater. Many have already taken advantage of it. Alumni Scholarships.—See page 137.
