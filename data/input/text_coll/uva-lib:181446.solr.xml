      <field name="fulltext">Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1936-37 IT HAS been the practice in previous reports of this series to relate archival developments at the University of Virginia and in the Commonwealth to those in other states and in the nation at large, in order to keep abreast with the national movement in this field of scholarship. Events of the past year point to a new era in the science of archives in the United States, to large-scale co-operation in providing guides to archives and manuscript collections of all kinds, and to a journal for discussion of problems and policies. In the care and administration of their archives some states can boast of notable accomplishments reaching back several generations; others have undertaken their responsibility during the present century; and all have had the opportunity of seeking the counsel of the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association.1 1. Cf. American Historical Association, Annual Report for 1922 (Washington, 1926), I, pages 152-60. It was the pioneering of this Commission that led to the founding of the Society of American Archivists during the meeting of the American Historical Association at Providence, R. I., December 29, 1936; and it is also significant that the first annual meeting of the new society, June 18-19, 1937, was held in the National Archives Building, Washington, D. C. With the National Archives in operation in all departments, the time was ripe, beyond a doubt, for the organization of the society. A projected quarterly to be called "The American Archivist" suggests the kind of service which the society plans to render. As for the National Archives with its staff of specialists, it bids fair to become a great clearinghouse of information in all phases of archival science, as well as the repository of official records of the federal government.2 2. Second Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1936 (Washington, 1936). The magnitude of the program and the immense body of material to be handled have moved certain foreign scholars to "admire the courage with which American Archivists are attacking a vast task and the breadth of outlook with which the attack is planned. . . ."3 3. Arundell Esdaile and J. H. P. Pafford, eds., The Year's Work in Librarianship, IX (1936), edited for the Library Association (London, 1937), page 239. The states, in their contribution of ideas based upon long experience with archives and manuscript collections, have demonstrated the kind of co-operation that will doubtless prevail between them and the National Archives. State plans and achievements worthy of special mention are the new Illinois state archives building now nearing completion, plans for a new building in North Carolina, and for a permanent state archives commission in Vermont.4 4. Julian P. Boyd, Recent Activities in Relation to Archives and Historical Manuscripts in the United States, Read at the Conference of Archivists called to found the Society of American Archivists, Providence, R. I., December 29, 1936 (mimeographed). Public support for a new state library in Virginia (to include the state archives) is gaining momentum again, with the prospect that the legislature may take action in 1938. At the University of Virginia the new library under construction is about half completed. One wing of this building, fireproof, with temperature and humidity controlled, and with a vault at one end, will house the manuscript collection which numbers well over half a million pieces. There will be adequate facilities for the expansion of this collection, for the rare books, maps, and microfilm equipment, for the newspaper collection of over five hundred volumes in the adjoining stacks, for exhibition cases, and for ample room for research workers. The appeal made to Virginians in the University's broadside of 19305 5. Reprinted in J. C. Wyllie, "Manuscripts in Virginia," The University of Virginia News Letter, XIII, no. 7, Jan. 1, 1937. for the preservation of manuscripts and historical materials of all kinds in the library, now takes on added significance as the new building offers ideal quarters for them. The inventory of county and city official records throughout Virginia, which was taken over by the Historical Records Survey under the Works Progress Administration early in 1936,6 6. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1935-36 (University, Va., 1936), pages 2-3. is slowly but surely covering all sections of the state. Two new supervisors were appointed in September, 1936, one for southside, the other for southwestern Virginia, to replace two who were released in the tidewater region; and the completion of the work in the latter area has been supervised from the Richmond office. The archivist continued as state director until the summer of 1937, when, owing to a drastic cut in the non-relief quota, his official connection with the project ceased, although he has acted since in an advisory capacity. At present about two-thirds of the counties have been inventoried, but checking the data, which the Washington office has vigorously and wisely insisted upon, has proved to be a slow process and has amounted in some cases to relisting all the records. The most serious problem has been that of personnel for stenographic and research work in compiling and writing the introductory historical and descriptive material, so that the inventories may be prepared in final form for publication. What with Virginia's small urban population, competition among WPA projects for "white collar" workers, and the re-employment of large numbers in private industry, one must conclude that the better qualified worker is not looking for a job but for an advancement from the one he holds. In government relief work all officers and employees must learn to live largely by faith as one emergency succeeds another and "the substance of things hoped for" fades once again into the future. In view of this condition it is a tribute to the well laid plans of the national director, Dr. Luther H. Evans, and their efficient execution by him and his staff of the Historical Records Survey that they have been able to anticipate with a fair degree of certainty its prolongation for another year at least. It has undertaken a stupendous program which only the federal government could carry out on a national scale, and samples of the results which have appeared in some of the states have been commended by historians and other scholars.7 7. Boyd, op. cit., pages 10-15. It is only fair to point out that those states which have issued inventories as approved by the Washington office have aided materially in guaranteeing the life of the national project. In Virginia, where no inventory has been completed yet in final form, the project has the opportunity of profiting by the experience and improving upon the product of those states farther advanced. The work of the survey on church and labor records and on manuscript collections in depositories throughout Virginia has been held in abeyance temporarily in order to concentrate upon the completion of the first county inventories. On March 15, 1937, some of the newspapers in the state carried a story of the survey's first year of operation in Virginia with comments on some of the more interesting records discovered.8 8. Portsmouth Star, Mar. 15; Covington Virginian, Mar. 15; Staunton News Leader, Mar. 19. The work of this project and of the Survey of Federal Archives throughout the South was described by Dr. Philip M. Hamer of the National Archives at a luncheon conference on archives and manuscripts during the annual meeting of the Southern Historical Association at Nashville, November 20, 1936. One of the largest manuscript acquisitions of the University during the past year is the John Warwick Daniel (1842-1910) Collection, covering the period from 1860 to his death. The materials on the eventful career of this soldier, lawyer, and senator are extensive and varied enough for a biographical study.9 9. Cf. J. W. Daniel, Speeches and Orations . . ., comp. by his son, Edward M. Daniel (Lynchburg, 1911). They include about one hundred war letters to his father and family, 1861-65; a few volumes of law notes and quotations written during his reading of the classicsâan "index rerum", to use his own phrase; letter-press books for 1872-73, 1882-84, and 1889-90; pocket diaries for parts of 1901, 1903-05, and 1907; letters of congratulation on his election to the United States Senate in 1885; and many books of clippings on his political activities after he became a national figure. Having served under General Jubal A. Early, Daniel began to write a book on the military exploits of this Confederate leader. Much of Daniel's extensive correspondence with war veterans in preparation for this study and part of his preliminary draft are in the collection. One of the most popular orators of his day, he delivered speeches on a wide variety of subjects and many of the original manuscripts are extantâon the state debt question, monetary problems, the tariff, the Spanish-American War, the railroads, Virginia politics, the race question, etc. The Withrow Family papers, 1880-95, from Waynesboro, Augusta County, are concerned mainly with matters of personal interest from Florida, Virginia, Augusta, Ga. (the Academy of Richmond County), and from M. H. Houston, a missionary in China. Some comments on the Presbyterian Church in Waynesboro will be found, and an interesting letter from Leander McCormick, November 1, 1879. Also from Augusta County comes the four-volume diary of the local historian Joseph A. Waddell (1823-1914) for the years 1855-59 and 1862-65. The author, who appreciated its historical value for the intimate picture it presents of civilian population under war conditions, printed excerpts (with revised phraseology) in his history of the county.10 10. J. A. Waddell, Annals of Augusta County, Virginia, from 1726 to 1871 (2nd edit., revised and enlarged, Staunton, Va., 1902), pages 459-514, excerpts from the diary from July 20, 1861, to Sept. 10, 1865. Fortunately this copy includes part of the record for 1861-62; the original for these years is lost. The library has received a small collection of letters of the 1850's and 1870's to Hugh Blair Grigsby from the Rev. Philip Slaughter, William H. Ruffner, R. A. Brock, and B. Johnson Barbour, and a copy of one of special interest from Grigsby to Lyman C. Draper, June 22, 1875 (11 pages, certified by Draper) on the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. It is appropriate that manuscripts relating to the University of Virginia and its faculty and students should be preserved here, and the transfer of such documents from another institution is especially noteworthy. Three items of 1843-44 pertaining to William Barton Rogers (1804-1882), geologist and educator, while he was professor in the University, were donated by the librarian of Massachusetts Institute of Technology of which Rogers was the first president. Among other manuscripts bearing upon University personalities are seven letters of Schele de Vere, 1878-91, a William H. McGuffey letter, April 19, 1869, and the testimony (typewritten) of John William Mallet as chemical expert in a Maryland case concerning stream pollution some time after 1868. A volume of typewritten annual reports, 1926-36, of the University of Virginia's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences describes its progress and publications from the beginning. As the director of the Institute saw fit to place these official records in the custody of the library, so it is hoped that other departments will do likewise in order better to preserve the archives of the University now generally dispersed.11 11. Cf. W. E. Hemphill, "A Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia," Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, pages 9-27. The Minute Book of the Charlottesville Lyceum, 1845-56, a debating society, contains the signature of John B. Minor as secretary, February to September, 1845, just before he became professor of law in the University. Fragmentary papers and broadsides of T. J. Williams, 1869-84, an official of the public utilities of Charlottesville, afford a glimpse of their status in a period for which there are few town records of this kind. Three other single items may be listed at this point: a J. E. B. Stuart letter, written from Kansas Territory, January 11, 1861, declaring that ". . . right or wrong, alone or otherwise, I go with Virginia"; a typewritten copy of a letter by John Randolph of Roanoke, April 10, 1824, confessing the "pleasures &amp; pains of Opium"; and an autograph of Warren G. Harding in a letter of 1916. The collection of materials on economic history has been augmented by letters and accounts of Daniel Grinnan and John Mundell of the Fredericksburg firm of Grinnan &amp; Mundell, mostly for the period 17901830, direct successors of pre- and post-Revolutionary enterprises operated under the names of Mitchell, Gray, Coates, and Mundell.12 12. Cf. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, page 5. The letters to Grinnan &amp; Mudell from Glasgow merchants and from George Murray &amp; Company of Norfolk, Va., shed light on commercial problems and practices during the Napoleonic wars and are suggestive of conditions set forth in the papers of John Norton &amp; Sons of Virginia and London, recently published.13 13. John Norton &amp; Sons, Merchants of London and Virginia; Being the Papers from Their Counting House for the Years 1750 to 1795, ed. by Frances Norton Mason (Richmond, 1937). From the librarian of Virginia Polytechnic Institute comes a small collection of mercantile accounts of William I. Barriger of Montgomery County with the firm of Poe &amp; Renwick of Lynchburg, 1833-35, and one letter of 1852. The University's accumulation of general country store records, numbering several hundred, has been considerably increased by a long run of ledgers and journals from Hunting Creek, Accomac County, covering the ante bellum decades, and another from Graham's Forge, Wythe County, for the same period, the latter also containing entries regarding the iron works of David Graham, some of whose records were acquired earlier.14 14. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1933-34 (University, Va., 1934), page 5. The mercantile account books of R. Sterrett &amp; Co., Panther Gap, Rockbridge County, 1828-82, were received through the courtesy of the librarian of Cornell University, another instance of interstate library co-operation. The personal account book of one Dr. McCaw of Richmond, 1834-35, was used later to record labor charges in the James River coal pits. Another gift, an unnamed volume of private accounts, contains a list of estrays and marriages of Albemarle County for 1781âan illustration of how a local archive among the papers of a county official reappears years later in private hands. The original records of the State Bank of Pamplin, Va., 1905-31, consist of both bound volumes and loose papers. The accounts of D. L. Eberly of Strasburg, Va., 1895-1915 (as yet unsorted), deal with pottery-making and the transactions of a bicycle distributor. The collection of literary manuscripts has been enriched by the essay of the eminent critic, William Crary Brownell (1851-1928), on "The French Provincial Spirit" (24 pages), which appeared in his volume French Traits.15 15. French Traits; an Essay in Comparative Criticism (New York, 1889). A compilation of interest to genealogists is Mary Willis Minor's "Record of the Champe Family of England, Richmond County, Va., and King George County, Va." A painstaking study by Clifford Lewis, III, of Sir Edmund Plowden (ca. 1590-1659),16 16. "Some Notes on Sir Edmund Plowden and His Province of New Albion" (vi, 75 pages, mimeographed). who is seldom mentioned in works on colonial history, has been presented to the library. Sir Edmund tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony to be called New Albion on the Delaware River, but he got his discontented colonists only so far as Virginia where he lived during 1642-48. A unique treasure from abroad is a manuscript volume containing fifteenth century copies in two distinct handwritings of St. Thomas Aquinas's "Contra Impugnantes Dei Cultum et Religionem" and "De Perfectione Spirituales Vite." They are written on vellum with decorated initials; the binding is of the seventeenth century. Among the manuscripts entrusted to the library on deposit are the papers of William Daniel, Senior and Junior,17 17. The grandfather and father of Senator John Warwick Daniel. See above, pages 3-4. 1816-85. They consist chiefly of Daniel and Warwick family letters written from Lynchburg, Petersburg, Richmond, Nelson County, and Washington, D. C.; they treat of political and social conditions especially before 1860 and of military and domestic incidents during the Civil War. The Edward P. Buford Collection, 1895-1931, affords, through the voluminous correspondence of this prominent lawyer of Lawrenceville, Brunswick County, an opportunity to investigate political and economic conditions in southside Virginia over a long period. The large collection of John B. Minor (1813-1895) Papers, 1800-1917, contains material on the law practice and teaching of this distinguished scholar as well as family letters embracing several generations. The papers are most numerous for the period 1830-1900. They have been deposited with the provision that they be withheld from use for five years. Two pocket diaries of Robert Larimer of the 62nd Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, provide glimpses of the war on the Carolina coast, especially in Charleston harbor during 1863, in the vicinity of Richmond and Appomattox in 1865, and in the environs of the capital during the early months of reconstruction. His discharge papers and copies of a few official orders are deposited with the diaries. The photographing of manuscript and printed materials with the Leica camera has served not only to increase immeasurably the potentialities of the library for research, but also to keep the staff aware of the rapid developments in technique and equipment. Microphotography is perhaps the most "live" subject at library and archive meetings18 18. Cf. M. L. Raney, ed., Microphotography for Libraries. Papers presented at the microphotography symposium at the 1936 conference of the American Library Association (Chicago, 1936). and it is generally agreed that it is already revolutionizing the domain of the keepers of books. The revised edition of Dr. Robert C. Binkley's Manual19 19. Manual on Methods of Reproducing Research Materials. A survey made for the Joint Committee on Materials for Research of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies (Ann Arbor, Mich., Edwards Bros., 1936). provides expert data on technique, materials, and comparative costs; numerous articles are appearing in the Bulletin of the American Library Association and other journals; and a magazine called Microfilm has been launched.20 20. Vol. I, no. 1 (July 1937), W. Wadsworth Wood, pub., Microfilm Publishing Corp., 424 Madison Ave., New York City. During the past year the University of Virginia has acquired a Folmer Graflex Photorecord camera for quantity production of copy on film or paper; an Optigraph projector; and a Fiskeoscope, a hand reading binocular lens device, especially for short lengths of film or paper. Mr. John Cook Wyllie, curator of manuscripts, described and exhibited some of these photographic devices at the Newport News meeting of the Virginia Library Association, and to him goes the major credit for the progress which the University is making in utilizing and enlarging this equipment. Among the manuscript records photographed are the Minutes of the Board of Trustees of the town of Falmouth, 1728-1813, 1828-68 (2 vols.), at the falls of the Rappahannock, a busy port in colonial days. A Military Order Book (some pages missing) recorded by Major Henry Bedinger, U. S. A., of Shepherdstown, Va. (now W. Va.), reveals among its routine entries something of the rough character and harsh discipline of a portion of the first army of the United States which fought in General Arthur St. Clair's disastrous campaign against the Indians in the Northwest Territory, 1791.21 21. A similar and more detailed record of a company which began its march from Philadelphia to Ohio is "The Journal of Captain Samuel Newman," ed. by M. M. Quaife, in The Wisconsin Magazine of History, II, no. 1 (Sept. 1918), pages 40-73. Photostat copies of Arthur Lee letters in the Harvard Library, 1769-76 and especially 177778, have been given to the University of Virginia to improve its Lee Collection; included is a copy of the rare pamphlet, Extracts from a Letter written to the president of Congress by . . . Arthur Lee in answer to a libel published in the Pennsylvania Gazette . . . by Silas Deane . . . (Philadelphia, 1780). The University was one of the original group of institutions which subscribed to the Edwards Brothers' project for making microfilm copies of books printed in English before 1550, estimated to cover about 400,000 pages. The first shipments have arrived and have been eagerly used by some of the faculty. Among the more important Virginia newspaper accessions are bound volumes of the Berryville Clarke Courier, 1895-1901; the Charlottesville Chronicle, 1890-91; the Gordonsville Gazette, 1877-79; the Harrisonburg Daily News, 1903-07, 1910, and Evening News, 1901-03; the Richmond Southern Churchman, 1835-36; the Staunton Vindicator, 1865-66, the Spectator, 1908-09, the Post, 1895, the Dispatch, 1903-04, the News, 1891-1904, 1909-15, and the Dispatch and News, 1904-09. The library is fortunate to have received some scattered issues of the rare Virginische Volksberichter, February 1808 to January 1809, printed on the Henkel press at New Market. This was the first German newspaper in Virginia. The library is filing fifty-five current papers, most of them from Virginia and duplicating in only a few cases those in the Virginia State Library. Among the more rare printed works acquired by the University Library is the John W. Daniel collection of bound pamphlets on leading economic and political questions in the United States during the years 1880-1910, especially on monetary problems in which Daniel, as an advocate of free silver, was keenly interested.22 22. Concerning the Daniel MSS., see above, pages 3-4. A miscellaneous accumulation of catalogues of Virginia and out-of-state colleges from the decades just before and after 1900 was salvaged from an old residence in Nelson County. The Library has in process a separate author catalogue of pamphlets bound and classified under certain general subject headings. A unique collection of Henkel imprints in German and English from the New Market press mentioned above includes theological and educational works by members of the Henkel Family dating from the first half of the nineteenth century and some early minutes of Lutheran conferences of Virginia and North Carolina. The music that was played and sung in Virginia homes during the nineteenth century is typified in a diversified collection of albums and unbound sheets. Among these are a few Stephen Collins Foster numbers and Confederate imprints. Apparently few southern publishers and printers outside New Orleans, Richmond, and Baltimore ventured into the musical field.23 23. A unique example of a soldier's attempt at original song (words only) is the manuscript "Sweet Dixie," "wrote by Wm A. Hill of Co. J, 63d Va. Regt, of Infantry, At Saltville . . . Aug, 6th 1863;" it was found by a New York soldier and was acquired recently by the University Library. The files of official documents have been augmented notably in the field of Virginia municipal and county reports, quite apart from the more concentrated activity along these lines by the staff of the University's Bureau of Public Administration. City maps have been obtained from the engineer departments of Richmond, Lynchburg, Newport News, and Norfolk; a group of maps showing rural delivery routes in the state from the United States Post Office Department; and some fifty maps and leaflets from the Tennessee Department of Highways and Public Works. Another year's work in retrospect reminds the archivist how much he depends upon the generous co-operation of many persons in Virginia and beyond its borders. He takes this opportunity to express his gratitude particularly to Dr. Garnett Ryland of the University of Richmond whose rich fund of information was indispensable in preparing the list of original Baptist records appended to this report; to the state director of the Historical Records Survey, Miss Elizabeth B. Parker, who carries so conscientiously the chief responsibilities of the project; to the district supervisors of the HRS, Miss Katherine Watkins and Mr. John D. Clothier, Jr., for the high calibre of their work; and to Dr. Atcheson L. Hench of the University of Virginia for his genuine interest and aid in the growth of the manuscript collection. Finally, the never failing assistance of the Library staff is gratefully acknowledged and a special word of appreciation expressed to Mr. Harry Clemons and Mr. John Wyllie. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist. 15 September 1937.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ORIGINAL BAPTIST CHURCH RECORDS IN THE VIRGINIA BAPTIST HISTORICAL SOCIETY, UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND Among the fields of American historiography neglected by recent scholars none has been more disregarded than that of church history. Although William H. Allison's valuable Inventory of Unpublished Material for American Religious History in Protestant Church Archives and Other Repositories was published a quarter-century ago, the interest in economic trends and developments has been predominant and only within the past few years have religious factors been studied as a part of the broad sweep of social historians.1 1. Best illustrated in the History of American Life series, ed. by A. M. Schlesinger and D. R. Fox (12 vols., New York, 1927â, in progress). The studies of William W. Sweet and his associates in American church history, however, deserve special mention. Because they have shown that religious events and opinions are part and parcel of the complex social pattern of our civilization, it is to be expected that students will turn increasingly to the abundant source material of churches and other related organizations. In continuing the policy of publishing in the present annual report another list of original Virginia historical materials,2 2. Cf. "Parish Records of the [Protestant Episcopal] Diocese of Virginia, 1653-1900," in Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist . . ., 1933-34, pages 9-19; "Parish Records of the Dioceses of Southern Virginia and Southwestern Virginia, 1648-1900," in Fifth Annual Report . . ., 1934-35, pages 9-20; "A Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia," in Sixth Annual Report . . ., 1935-36; pages 9-27. the archivist has welcomed the opportunity of presenting the following manuscript church books in the Virginia Baptist Historical Society. Founded in 1876, the Society has amassed a valuable collection of books, pamphlets, periodicals, and manuscripts on the Baptists, with emphasis on the Virginia churches; printed works on other denominations are also well represented.3 3. "Report of the Virginia Baptist Historical Society," The Virginia Baptist Annual, 1926 (Richmond, [1926]), pages 92-96. The priceless contents of the library are largely the result of the efforts and enthusiasm of Dr. Charles H. Ryland (1836-1914), founder of the Society, and his son, Dr. Garnett Ryland, of the University of Richmond. The growing collection of more than 350 original church records is unique, for no other repository of Baptist church manuscripts in America contains so many of any one state. The difficulty of obtaining the minute books of Old School ("anti-mission") or of Negro churches and their failure in many cases to preserve them are reflected in the paucity of such records in the library of the Society. Most of the minute books below include registers of members. Other important Baptist collections are to be found in the New England Baptist Library and the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society Archives, in the Ford Building, Boston, Mass.; the former owns the famous Isaac Backus (17241806) Collection. Crozer Theological Seminary, Chester, Pa., houses the valuable library of the American Baptist Historical Society, founded in Philadelphia, 1853; its collection was begun anew after the disastrous fire of 1896 and later moved to Chester.4 4. Cf. The Forty-Fourth Anniversary of the American Baptist Historical Society . . . 1897 (Philadelphia, 1897); see also the Catalogue of the Books and Manuscripts in the Library of the Baptist Historical Society. Philadelphia, June, 1872 (Philadelphia, 1872). The Samuel Colgate Baptist Historical Collection at Colgate University, Hamilton, N. Y., includes among its manuscripts a few church records of Alexandria, Va.5 5. W. H. Allison, Inventory of Unpublished Material for American Religious History in Protestant Church Archives and Other Repositories (Washington, D. C., 1910), page 95. Extensive materials are located in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Ky., and in Brown University Library, Providence, R. I. Smaller collections are those in Tremont Temple, Boston; in Wake Forest College, North Carolina; and in Baylor University Library, Waco, Texas. Since there is no adequate history of Virginia Baptists, it may be well to point out some of the earlier works worth consulting. Morgan Edwards' (17221795) unpublished "Materials towards a History of the Baptists in the Province of Virginia," 1772, is preserved in Crozer Theological Seminary. The Annual Register of the Baptist Denomination in North-America . . . 1790 [Richmond, 1791] by John Asplund (d. 1807) includes a section on Virginia associations and churches; he published two editions in 1794, one in Boston, the other in Hanover, N. H.; and another edition in Hanover, 1796. Two accounts of individual associations are valuable as early imprints as well as for their contents: Lemuel Burkitt and Jesse Read, A Concise History of the Kehukee Baptist Association, from Its Original Rise to the Present Time . . . (Halifax, [N. C.], 1803)âchapters 14-15 on Virginia; and William Fristoe, A Concise History of the Ketocton Baptist Association . . . (Staunton, Va., 1808). In 1810 Robert B. Semple published his authoritative A History of the Rise and Progress of the Baptists in Virginia, . . . revised and extended by Rev. G. W. Beale (Richmond, Va., 1894). The revision, however, consisting chiefly of additional foot-notes, did not bring the work up to that date, but nothing better is yet available. David Benedict's A General History of the Baptist Denomination in America, and Other Parts of the World (2 volumes, Boston, 1813)â volume II, chapters 3-9 on Virginia, has all the shortcomings of an antiquarian work. A valuable biographical contribution is the Virginia Baptist Ministers series, begun by James B. Taylor; he issued the first series in Richmond, 1837, and the second in 1859. The next four were published by George B. Taylor in Lynchburg respectively in 1912, 1913, 1915, and 1935. Finally, A History of the Baptist Churches in the United States, by A. H. Newman (New York, 1894), volume 2 of the American Church History series, with considerable data on Virginia leaves much to be desired throughout.6 6. See also Peter G. Mode, Source Book and Bibliographical Guide for American Church History (Menasha, Wis., [1921]). In the following list the churches are arranged alphabetically by county under each association. The date in parenthesis after the name of each association and church is the year of founding. It has seemed advisable to include references to files of printed association minutes and historical sketches in the library of the Society. All such titles are in italics or within quotation marks preceding italics, to distinguish them from manuscript records. ACCOMAC ASSOCIATION (1809) 1.
