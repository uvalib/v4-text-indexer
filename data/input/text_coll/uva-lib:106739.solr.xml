      <field name="fulltext">PART I. HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION: OFFICERS AND STUDENTS: DEGREES CONFERRED. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of January 12, 1803, of the Legislature of Virginia, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than one-half mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the college consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as a professor's residence. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a pavilion for each individual professorâbuildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a school room and apartments for the accommodation of the professor"; and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged in the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, of date January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an University," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows: "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said college, an University, to be called The University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, sepcifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy, medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetorick; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student, as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property, and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, rules, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings shall be at the University; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business, and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well as from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby required to make report annually to the president and directors of the literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science, there taught, such honorary marks and testimonies of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfil those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90.) The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson Rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. GOVERNMENT AND ORGANIZATION. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is invested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Dr. Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The original organization consisted of eight independent Schoolsâ namely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825,â with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was, of course, gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time, until the University organization arrived at its present condition, as described elsewhere in this catalogue. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's degree, and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university: the result of which was that they soon substituted (in 1831, for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. As at present organized, the University comprises twenty-five distinct and independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional (or technical). The Academic Departments are The College: with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The Department of Graduate Studies: with the degrees of Graduate in the School; Master of Arts; and Doctor of Philosophy. The Professional Departments are The Department of Law: with the degree of Bachelor of Law. The Department of Medicine: with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering: with the degrees of Civil Engineer; Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; and Mining Engineer. The Department of Agriculture: with the degree of Bachelor of Science. THE CORPORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. Legal Title: "THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA."

      <field name="fulltext">PART II. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND REGULATIONS: EXPENSES: SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. ANNOUNCEMENTS. Charlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary Arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete; there are two athletic fields; the Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in all ordinary cases of illness students receive treatment from the University Physician, with skilful nursing, when necessary, in a well equipped hospital. Equipment.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in the Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, the Pathological Laboratory, Physiological Laboratory, and the Hospital and Dispensary. The Engineering Department possesses a well equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. In addition to the Law and other Departmental Libraries the general University Library is common to all Departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present upwards of sixty thousand volumes. These have been arranged and classified by the Dewey system, and are catalogued. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for eight hours daily to attend to their wants. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six Departments, two of which are Academic, and four professional. The former include the College and the Department of Graduate Studies: the latter the Departments of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-five distinct Schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction of professors who are responsible for the systems and methods pursued. The Summer School of the University of Virginia, under the management of the President and Faculty of the University, continues for six weeks each summer. Courses are offered in the following subjects: Agriculture; Anatomy; Art; Botany; Chemistry (Three Courses); Drawing (Three Courses); Education (Four Courses); English (Five Courses); French (Two Courses); German (Two Courses); Geography (Four Courses); History (Five Courses); Latin (Six Courses); Logic; Manual Training (Four Courses); Mathematics (Six Courses); Music (Two Courses); Nature Study; History of Modern Philosophy; Physical Training (Five Courses); Physics (Two Courses); Psychology; Zoology. For catalogue and further information address the Director of Summer School, University of Virginia. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and examinations permits. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has decided advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education throughout the country have adopted methods involving this principle. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September, and continues, with a recess of ten days at Christmas, until the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin upon the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days will be charged a fee for registration. Admission.âThe age of the candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended by him, or other evidence of general good conduct, must be presented by each applicant. Those who satisfy these requirements will be admitted to the University of Virginia by the diploma of a recognized institution of learning, the certificate of an accredited school, or by written examination. Further information concerning Entrance Examinations and admission to advanced standing will be found upon pp. 70-85. Students who are more than twenty years of age are admitted without examination to pursue approved special courses of study under conditions stated on page 84. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the President, upon recommendation of the Faculty, may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. The regulations of the University concerning attendance upon lectures and examinations, absences, withdrawal, etc., will be found upon pages 87-90. Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations; and other religious exercises are directed by the Young Men's Christian Association. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are auxiliary to the written examinations, which, in conjunction with the class standing as determined by the daily work of the student, are the main tests of the student's proficiency. A special examination may be granted upon physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty of the Department in question may accept as adequate ground. See also pp. 87-80. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three professors, one of whom is the professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make report to the Faculty of the results of the examination. The committee, not the professor solely, is responsible throughout. Reports.âReports are sent, at stated intervals, to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports give the number of times the student has been absent from lectures; and indicate, as nearly as is practicable, the nature of the progress made by him in his work at the University. Honor System.âFor eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the Faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of Faculty action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examination-room, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between the student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, nor indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in the presence of a committee of the Faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Certificates are conferred on the satisfactory completion of B. A. courses in the Academic Schools, and the student who completes both the B. A. and M. A. courses in any School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in that School. In each School, major and minor courses are offered candidates for the Ph. D. degree. Each major course requires at least two years of work after the completion of the corresponding M. A. course. Any student completing successfully a major course in a school (with or without thesis) is entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The title degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, p. 145; Master of Arts, p. 155; Doctor of Philosophy, p. 156; Civil Engineer, Mining Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, pp. 197-210; Bachelor of Science, p. 222; Doctor of Medicine, p. 183; and Bachelor of Laws, p. 175. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No merely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such Licentiate are matters of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.âNew students will find it greatly to their advantage if, as soon as possible after reporting to the Dean of the University, they will go to Madison Hall, where a committee of students will be found who will gladly be of any service in assisting them to get settled as quickly as possible. A general information bureau, a complete list of boarding houses with prices of board, a directory of the students with their addresses, a list of all forms of employment open to students, copies of the University Handbook, and other things of interest to the new men will there be accessible to all. The General Secretary of the Association will be pleased to correspond with prospective students during the summer with regard to all such matters, and it is suggested that every man who expects to enter the University inform him of that fact. See p. 235. REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRANCE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. For admission to the University the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the Faculty recommends still greater maturity in ordinary cases. 2. Good Character.âAs attested by a certificate from the school last attended, or other satisfactory proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âAs evinced by entrance examinations or by diploma or certificate from some accredited school. ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. The purpose of these examinations is to secure in the applicant adequate mental maturity for entrance upon a course of University study, as well as the specific training needed to prosecute with success the work of the school or department in which the student is registered. It is not and has never been the policy of the University of Virginia to deny its opportunities and privileges to any young man able to profit by them. The test imposed at entrance is designed as much to protect the candidate as to safeguard the school. As a proof of maturity and fitness, every applicant for admission is required to pass examination in certain selected studies, or to present valid certificates covering courses of instruction equivalent to these. For sessions 1908-1909, the requirements will consist of twelve blocks, elected by the applicant under specified restrictions from the list below. Each block or unit in these requirements is designed to represent the equivalent of one full year if high school work, including five periods a week of not less than forty minutes each. English.âFour blocks of questions will be set as follows: A. English Grammar and Grammatical Analysis:âThe parts of speech with inflections and uses of each; syntax, especially of noun, verb, and conjunctions; detailed study of sentence-structure, including capitalization and punctuation. B. Composition and Rhetoric:âThe choice, arrangement, and connection of words, with exercises on synonyms, antonyms, degrees and shades of meaning; fundamental qualities of style, with selected and original examples; the sentence in detail as to unity, continuity, and proportion, with ample exercise in constructing sentences of varied types and emphasis; the paragraph, with reference to placing of topic, structure for unity, order and emphasis, with constant exercise in composing good paragraphs; the whole composition with abundant exercise in analysis and in construction; much practice in writing simple compositions on familiar subjects under the heads of description, narration, exposition, and argumentation. C. Critical Study of Selected Specimens of Literature:âThe specimens for reading and study suggested for admission to College or the equivalent under the guidance of the instructor; good reading and as much of it as possible, with intelligent conversation about the books read. D. History of English and American Literature:âGeneral divisions into periods, with most significant marks of each period; most important authors of each period, with consideration of the main events of their lives and the leading characteristics of their works; general summary of the leading literary movements. Mathematics.âFour blocks of questions will be set as follows: A. Algebra to Quadratic Equations:âThe four fundamental operations for rational algebraic expression; factoring, determination of highest common factor and lowest common multiple by factoring; fractions, including complex fractions; ratio and proportion; linear equations, both numerical and literal, containing one or more unknown quantities; problems depending on linear equations; radicals, including the extraction of the square root of polynomials and numbers; exponents, including the fractional and negative. B. Quadratic Equations, Progressions, and the Binomial Formula:âQuadratic equations, both numerical and literal; simple cases of equations with one or more unknown quantities, that can be solved by the methods of linear or quadratic equations; problems depending upon quadratic equations; the binomial formula for positive integral exponents; the formulas for the nth term and the sum of the terms of arithmetic and geometric progressions, with applications. C. Plane Geometry, with Original Exercises:âThe usual theorems and constructions of good text-books, including the general properties of plane rectilinear figures; the circle and the measurement of angles; similar polygons; areas; regular polygons and the measurement of the circle. The solution of numerous original exercises, including loci problems. Applications to the mensuration of lines and plane surfaces. D. Solid Geometry, with Original Exercises:âThe usual theorems and constructions of good text-books, including the relations of planes and lines in space; the properties and measurement of prisms, pyramids, cylinders and cones; the sphere and the spherical triangle. The solution of numerous original exercises, including loci problems. Applications to the mensuration of surfaces and solids. The above definitions are those reported by the committee of the American Mathematical Society, September, 1903. All applicants for admission must satisfy the examiners in blocks A, B, and C. For admission to Mathematics 1A, the candidate must answer all four blocks. History.âFour blocks of questions will be set as indicated below. The questions will be such as should be answered by a student, who has devoted one full high school year to energetic study under competent instruction in each one of the four topics.

Applicants for admission to the work of the first year of the Course in Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having at least a three years' course; or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high school course; and in addition to present satisfactory evidence of the completion of college courses in physics, chemistry, and biology equivalent to, but not necessarily identical with those at this institution. In consideration of educational acquirements in other subjects, a student may be conditioned on physics or biology (but not on both), this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. Applicants unable to satisfy these requirements by acceptable certificates, in part or in whole, may remove their deficiencies by satisfactory examinations. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms of certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the University, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. From and after June 1, 1910, the minimum amount of preparation necessary for admission to the Medical Department will be the completion of a four-year High School course or its equivalent, and in addition the completion of college courses in Inorganic Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and one language, preferably German. ADMISSION WITH ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other universities and from colleges affiliated with the University of Virginia will be admitted to advanced standing as candidates for degrees from this University upon presentation of proper certificates, covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. They must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the Professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should in no case fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. Students from training schools, in which the work of the upper classes is approximately of collegiate grade, will be granted advanced standing in Mathematics and the Languages, provided they are officially recommended for such advanced standing by the principal of the school. Such students must, however, in every case, attend the lectures and pass the examinations here in the last year of the undergraduate work of every course elected. High School courses in Science are in no case accepted as grounds for advanced standing. The College.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least one full session to the studies of the College and at least three of his ten electives must be taken here. Department of Graduate Studies.âApplicants for admission to this department as candidates for the degree of Master of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy must present the baccalaureate degree of an affiliated institution of collegiate rank, or in cases of incorporated institutions of learning which confer no such degree, the certificate of graduation on a course fully equivalent to the ordinary collegiate course. No diploma or certificate can be accepted except by vote of the Faculty, based on the recommendation of the Committee on Academic Degrees. Department of Medicine.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this Department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this Department with a grade of at least eighty per cent. in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the preceding paragraph. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. No credit can be allowed for time not spent in a regular school of medicine; except that applicants holding the degree of A. B. or B. S. from a reputable college or university will be admitted to the second year, provided their academic course has included the equivalent of the first-year medical course. A student who is already a graduate of a reputable school of medicine may be received as a student in this Department for the fourth year. Department of Engineering.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for a degree in Engineering must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least two full sessions to engineering studies in this University. SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for registration who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered by the Dean of the University as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students must in all cases meet the specific entrance requirements as prescribed for the courses elected by them. CONDITIONED STUDENTS. A candidate may be admitted in spite of some deficiences, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his academic work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. ANNOUNCEMENTS. From and after June 1st, 1909, the entrance requirements will be still further advanced, as follows: The College.âThe candidate must offer fifteen units for admission, of which at least three must be in English, three in Mathematics, two in History, and three in Latin, and the residue selected at will. In place of the three units of Latin, the candidate may offer four units in Modern Languages (French, German, Spanish), or a total of sixteen units. The Department of Engineering.âThe candidate must offer fifteen units for admission, of which at least three must be in English, four in Mathematics, and two in History. One unit in Mathematics will consist of questions on Trigonometry. The remaining units may be selected at will. Subjects specially recommended for students of Engineering are Mechanical Drawing, Trigonometry, and Surveying, Physical Geography, Physics, and Chemistry. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time are required to present themselves to the Dean of the University at his office in the Administration Building at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years of age. In each instance a certificate of good moral character must be presented, signed by the proper official of the institution attended during the previous session, or by some person of known standing. Each candidate who satisfies these requirements, and also those for admission by diploma, certificate, or examination previously stated, will be directed to the Dean of the Department which he purposes to enter. The Dean in question will, upon being satisfied that the candidate is fitted to enter upon the work of the Department, issue to him a card containing the names of the courses which the candidate proposes to pursue during the session: this card must be presented in turn to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to pursue the course in question with profit, sign the card and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the class. The card must then be returned to the Dean of the University, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid to the Bursar. On payment of these fees the registration (for the session) of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have already been matriculated as members of the University are required to present themselves directly to the Dean of their respective Departments upon one of the first three days of the session, and to conform, as regards their registration in their respective classes and the payment of fees, to the requirements stated in the preceding paragraph. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will (except in the case of an applicant admitted to special examinations, as provided in a previous paragraph) be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the President, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. RESIDENCE. The Academic Year extends from the morning of the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September to the evening of the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. Thanksgiving Day is a holiday, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the morning of the twenty-fourth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of the days above indicated, unless he has received permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before its close. Leave of absence is granted by the Deans for sufficient reasons, and must in every case be obtained in advance. Voluntary withdrawal requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises and all examinations in the courses which he pursues (unless excused for cause) and in every way to conform to the regulations of the University. Students may reside in the University dormitories, in private houses approved by the President, or in their homes. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. Physical Culture.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to do well without detriment to his physical health: and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded upon the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and in other forms; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium, under the advice and instruction of the Director and his assistants. Further information upon this important subject will be found upon a subsequent page. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to skilful nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, chronic cases, or to constitutional disorders of long standing from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right to this exemption. Students residing at their own homes, who waive this right, are entitled to the remission of a portion of the University fee. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. GENERAL REGULATIONS. Dormitory.âThe occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Bursar before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Bursar on or before September 1, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sublet or used for other than its proper purpose. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the University precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the President to withdraw the license from any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Registrar's office. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, cannot be made except by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same School with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined by the Faculty. In case of delayed entrance the student is regarded as having been absent from all lectures or other exercises that have been given, in the courses which he enters, since the beginning of the session. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess every student is required to register with the Dean of his department between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. Any student failing to thus register, will have his name dropped from the rolls of his classes until further order from the Dean, but such student may be registered by the Dean and restored to his position in his classes on payment to the Bursar of the delayed registration fee of $3.00. In case the delay in the student's return is due to illness, or to other like providential cause, the Dean is authorized to remit the fee and excuse the absence; in every other case the absences due to delayed return shall be recorded as unexcused absences; shall be so reported to the parent or guardian of the student; and shall be given serious adverse weight in considering the fitness of the student for graduation. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty of the Department by special order may approve. An unexcused absence, or the presentation of an unpledged paper, is counted as a total failure in the examination in which it occurs. A student whose absence from examination is excused is admitted to the Fall Examination in the subject in question in each of the departments where such examinations are held. Where necessary, he is admitted to a special examination. Class Standing in any course is determined by the regularity of attendance of the student upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises where included) in the course in question, and by the faithful performance of his work as indicated by his answers when questioned, by his written exercises, notebooks, the faithful performance of laboratory (or other similar) work, etc. Students are regarded by the Faculty as under the law of honor in matters affecting class standing as in examinations. The Grade of the Student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by the combined class standing and the result of examination, each being considered in such proportion as the professor in charge may decide for the course in question. Probation.âAny student in the College or the Department of Engineering whose term grade is below forty per cent. at either the December or the March examination in each of two subjects will be put upon probation until the following examination: a like failure at that time will make it necessary for him to withdraw from the University. Any student whose term grade is below forty per cent. in all courses at any examination will be required to withdraw from the University. A student in any Department of the University who is evidently making no real progress in one of his courses of study may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question. A student in the College or the Department of Engineering who falls under this rule will be put upon probation if he fails to attain a grade of forty per cent. in a single one of his remaining courses at a succeeding examination. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also "Probation" above. Conduct.âDrunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The Keeping of Dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. In all cases of Discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. Athletic Teams and other Student Organizations.âThe laws relating to absence from the University of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical Culture (pp. 231-232). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. EXPENSES. A student's expenses consist of the following: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except College and Graduate students from Virginia, as stated in a following paragraph; II. School Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Cost of Living, board, etc. I. Under the first head are included the University fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in Academic Departments), and the contingent deposit, $10; as well as the special Entrance Examination fee of five dollars, the delinquent registration fee of three dollars, and a fee for reÃ¶xamination in any subject, where any of these is incurred. The University Fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in cases of illness, including, if needed, care and nursing in a well-equipped hospital maintained on the University grounds, under the limitations stated in a preceding paragraph. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. The Contingent Deposit is liable for any damage to the University property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library or other University rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is, therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of $2 for the support of the Chapel Services and General Religious Work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this contribution. It will be observed that this amount also (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have given toward the Chapel Fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is left entirely to the option of the students and professors. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the Faculty that the students will thus unite with them in sustaining the religious work of the University. II. Under the second head is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper, and in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials consumed in laboratory work. In the Academic Departments the tuition fee for one School is $50; for two, $30 each; for three or more, $25 each; except that in Analytical Chemistry the charge for tuition and materials for one course is $50 and for apparatus about $10, and for both courses $100, and for apparatus, about $15. In the Chemistry courses for undergraduates, a laboratory fee of $10 is charged, and apparatus and materials are furnished at cost. The charges for a graduate course in Chemistry are: Tuition, $50; laboratory fee, $10; apparatus and material are furnished at cost. The fee for Agricultural Chemistry is $15, but this course is free to students in the Schools of Chemistry, to Virginia students, and to unmatriculated farmers; and in ZoÃ¶logy or Comparative Anatomy there is a laboratory fee, for materials, of $10 in the undergraduate courses and $20 in the graduate courses. The tuition fees in the Academic Departments are remitted to Virginia students, to public school teachers of the State, and to ministers of the Gospel, under conditions which are stated at length at the close of this section. In the Department of Law the fee for each regular year's course, or for any six classes, is $100; more than six classes (combining first and second year's course), $115; five classes, $85; four classes, $75; three classes, $60; two classes, $45; one class, $25. The fees for students who return for a third year are considerably less. In the Department of Medicine the fee for the first year is $110; second year, $100; third year, $80; fourth year, $60. In the Department of Engineering the fee for Applied Mathematics is $25 for one course, $50 for two or more; for other subjects, the same as in the Academic Departmentsâexcept for students who attend the regular course of instruction for a degree in Engineering as laid down in the programme, pp. 197-210. For these students the fee for tuition is $80 for the first year, $70 for the second, $60 for the third, and $50 for the fourth. A laboratory fee of $10 is charged in General Chemistry Course 1; an additional charge of $60 is made for materials and instruction in Analytical Chemistry to students of Mining Engineering. The payment of the Department fee entitles the student not only to attend all the regular courses for one year, but also to take over, without additional charge, such courses of any previous year as he may have failed to complete. Virginians are entitled to a reduction of $45 a year from the charges. (Compare pp. 91-95.) In the Department of Agriculture the fees are the same as in the Academic Departments. III. Under the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take his meals in the University Commons, or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boardinghouse, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant's hire to the University. The price of University rooms ranges, according to their desirability, from $30 to $50 for the session, exclusive of heat and light; the large majority rent for $40; but there are a few single rooms at $30, and a few whose price is above that of the majority. If two students occupy one room, each pays half the rent; the University charge for service is $9 per session for each student, whether there be one or two in a room. The minimum cost of furnishing a room may be placed at $15, fuel and lights combined cost about $25 for the session, and washing from $1.50 upward per month. With strict economy the cost of board, fuel, lights, service, and laundry can be brought within $15 a month as an average for the session. Rooms and board may be had in private families or boarding-houses at varying prices. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire two years' course, it amounts to about $90. But in this department, as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. All tuition fees, University fees, the contingent deposits, rents of rooms in the University buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students from Virginia.âIn compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction, without charge for tuition, in all the Schools of the Academic Departments (excepting the laboratory courses in Chemistry), subject to the conditions stated below. Such students are required to pay the University fee (by the recent action of the legislature, three-fourths of the University fee is also remitted to such students) and make the usual contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in the courses of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the University grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $90 to $130, according to the number of Schools elected. The Faculty are required by the law mentioned above to satisfy themselves in the case of each applicant, either by actual examination or by a diploma or certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission, in accordance with the terms of this law, are, therefore, required as described in a preceding section. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student it is necessary that the applicant's parents be bona fide residents of the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he be a bona fide resident. A resident of the State is one who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intention of removing therefrom in the future. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Privileged Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privileges will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Departments of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expense will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week. Pecuniary Aid to Students.âEffort is now being made to provide a fund, the income of which will be applied in rendering financial aid to deserving students. In the meantime, opportunity is afforded as far as possible to those who are desirous of helping themselves by their own industry, and it may be safely stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session, may be reasonably sure of obtaining work enough to pay his living expenses and university fees for the remainder of the college year. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, correspondence with reference to such employment may be had by addressing the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. The University Commons.âThis building will be ready for occupancy before the opening of the session of 1908-1909. Conveniently situated near the center of the University, it provides an attractive Dining Hall, with accommodations for more than 200 students at once, and will furnish board at such reasonable rates that students in straitened circumstances need not thereby be deprived of daily association with their more fortunate fellows. The Dining Hall will be the means of greatly reducing a student's living expenses. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. The following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the University have been adopted by the Board of Visitors: The Faculty is authorized to prepare a list of such schools and colleges tributary to the University as by the regularity of their patronage, or the success of their graduates, may deserve special recognition. To each one of the schools placed on this list, the Faculty is authorized to award a scholarship in the College; to each of the colleges, a scholarship in the Department of Graduate Studies, these scholarships to be known as the University of Virginia Scholarship in â School or College. The scholarship shall entitle the holder, who must be a graduate of his institution of the preceding session, to the remission of all tuition and University fees, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry, if he be a Virginia; and if he be not a Virginia, to the remission of all tuition fees, except in Analytical Chemistry, and one-half of the University fee. The contingent fee must be deposited in either case. This list of Schools and Colleges may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and pending the consideration of other institutions, invites application for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Atlanta University School, Atlanta, Ga.

VIRGINIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS. The University offers to accredited Public High Schools of Virginia, one scholarship each in the College, on the conditions prescribed below. This scholarship, for one session (that following the incumbent's graduation from the High School), when awarded by the designated High School to a white male graduate, who has pursued and completed with credit the High School course, and who is endorsed by the principal of the High School in question as to both preparation and character, shall entitle the holder to a remission of all fees payable to the University, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry. The holders of these scholarships are required to deposit the contingent fee. Any school accepting this scholarship shall make due announcement of it both to the scholars of the school and through the local papers; and at the end of the session shall, during the graduating exercises and through the public press, announce the award; and these appointments shall be duly certified to the Dean of the University. This list of Virginia Public High Schools may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation of the Board of Visitors, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and, pending the consideration of other institutions, invites applications for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Bedford City High School, Bedford City, Va. Berryville High School, Berryville, Va. Big Stone Gap High School, Big Stone Gap, Va. Bridle Creek High School, Bridle Creek, Va. Cape Charles High School, Cape Charles, Va.

Western Branch High School, Portsmouth, Va. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. The Scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. These incumbents shall be appointed by such local Alumni Association as are members in good standing of the General Alumni Association and are so reported from year to year by its Secretary; and to such of these only as may have ten or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. 3. No incumbent shall hold such Scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the University in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These Scholarships shall be confined to those courses in the Academic Schools of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the course in Analytical Chemistry). The Scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition fees in the Schools referred to, and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, to one-half of the University fee. The Contingent fee must be deposited in all cases. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the Association making the appointment, be able to attend the University: and no student will be permitted to enjoy the privileges of an Alumni Scholarship while holding an endowed Scholarship or Fellowship. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the University. He shall be subject to the same entrance requirements as other students. 7. Every local Alumni Association, as above described, having ten or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University; if hereafter such Association ceases to have as many as ten active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 8. Every such local Association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, as long as it shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as it shall have reached that number. 9. By "active" members as herein used, is meant Alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the Association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No Alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one Association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an Alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one Association, at the same time. But graduation in any Department or School of the University is not hereby required. 10. Only one Association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the Scholarships hereby created. 11. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole Association, a majority of the active members voting for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the Association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the Association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the Association. 12. A statement, which shall include the full name and address of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance of the Association and the candidate in question with conditions above stated, must be certified to the President of the University of Virginia, attested by the signature of the Secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the President on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed. The President will send printed forms of such certificates upon application. 13. The above requirements having been complied with, the person or persons so appointed shall be entitled in each instance to attend the University for the session immediately following the appointment without payment of any tuition fees (save for the course in Analytical Chemistry) and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, of one-half of the University fee: the Contingent fee being deposited in each case; and shall enjoy the same privileges and be subject to the same restrictions as other students. 14. To guard against any possible ill-feeling or sense of injustice on the part of the local Association in respect to the construction of these provisions, all such matters shall be referred to the Executive Committee of the General Alumni Association, the decision of which, when approved by the President of the University, shall be final. SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. One of the Miller Scholarships is awarded, at the close of each session, to the candidate who passes with the highest aggregate of marks, in Physics 1B, Chemistry 1B, and Biology 1B. The tenure is for two years, and the emolument is two hundred and fifty dollars a year, with free tuition in the Scientific Schools. Other conditions are stated in connection with the Department of Agriculture. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the late Leander J. McCormick, the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. Robert Hall McCormick, of Chicago. The emolument is free tuition in any Department of the University, with remission of the University fee. The Isaac Carey Scholarship is awarded by the Carey Trustees. Its value is about three hundred dollars a year. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by its founder. Its value is one hundred and twenty dollars a year. The Birely Scholarship, founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely, in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Maryland, is awarded by the Visitors to some student from the State of Maryland. Its value is about one hundred dollars a year. The Henry Coalter Cabell Scholarship is awarded by the Visitors to a graduate student upon the recommendation of the Committe of the School of English Literature. Its value is fifty dollars a year. FELLOWSHIPS. The Vanderbilt Fellowships are supported out of the working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory. They are assigned to advanced students who take Astronomy as their major subject and occupy a portion of their time in work connected with the Observatory. They are appointed upon the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory, to whom applications for further information should be made. The value of each Fellowship is three hundred and fifty dollars a year, with the remission of all fees. The John Y. Mason Fellowship, founded upon the gift of Archer Anderson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., is awarded by the Visitors to some competent and deserving graduate student, born in Virginia and in need of such assistance. The value is two hundred dollars a year. The William Cabell Rives Fellowship, founded in honor of the distinguished statesman of that name by his grandson, Dr. William Cabell Rives, of Washington, D. C., is awarded by the Board of Visitors, on the nomination of the President of the University, to a graduate student in History. The value of the fellowship is two hundred and fifty dollars, with remission of all fees. The Board of Visitors Fellowships.âThe Board of Visitors makes annual appointment, upon the recommendation of the professors in charge of certain designated Schools, of four graduate students to Fellowships. Each incumbent is required to occupy a portion of his time in work connected with the School from which he is nominated. The value of each Fellowship is two hundred dollars a year, with the remission of all fees.</field>

In the undergraduate courses of these Schools is comprised the work of the College with the degree of Bachelor of Arts; in the graduate courses is comprised the work of the Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of Graduate in a School, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy. The professors and instructors in the Academic Schools compose the Academic Faculty, which deals with questions concerning the work both of the College and of the Department of Graduate Studies. A full statement of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts will be found under the head of the College; of the requirements for the other academic degrees, under the Department of Graduate Studies. In the detailed account of the courses and equipment of the Academic Schools, given in the following pages, the order of the courses in the particular School, and the relation of each course to the academic degrees of the University, is indicated as follows: The numeral placed after each course indicates the order of the course in the particular School; the letter placed after the numeral indicates the value of the course as a part of the work required for an academic degree, viz.: A: the first-year course in a School, in which more than one year's work is required, if the School in question is elected as one of the subjects for the B. A. degree. B: a course that has full value for the B. A. degree, either as a group elective or as an elective-at-large. C: a course of full value, either as an elective-at-large for the B. A. degree, for the M. A. degree, or as a secondary minor for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. D: all graduate courses having full value for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, either as primary minor or major courses for that degree. Courses without any letter following have value only as electives-at-large for the B. A. degree. The Academic Schools are here arranged according to the grouping of subjects for the B. A. degree. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Fitz-Hugh. Mr. Bolling. Mr. Myers. Mr. McLemore. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The four blocks prescribed on page 73 for admission to Latin 1A. Preparation.âThe Latin work of the University finds its logical place in the public school system as the continuation of the Latin work of the High School. It presupposes accordingly four years of competent instruction in Latin, involving the Roman pronunciation, habitual observance of quantity and accent, regular drill in grammar and prose composition through all preparatory years, elementary Reader (Viri Romae), Nepos (Roman Lives), CÃ¦sar's Gallic War, Cicero's easier Orations, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and Vergil's Aeneid. If the preparation of the student justifies it, he will be admitted to advanced standing, with due credit for all work done elsewhere by him. Attention is further called to the importance of beginning Greek for all who wish to reap the full cultural benefit of the University courses in Latin. The study of at least one Romanic language also is very desirable. The Greek illumines incomparably all parts of Latin study, which bears in turn a like relation to the Romanic. General Statement.âThe first three years of University Latin are devoted to the broad cultural study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. In the course of the instruction the effort is made to exhibit, as far as possible, the relation of Roman civilization to the Greek, on the one hand, and to Romanic and modern on the other, and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. The great desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is therefore specially commended to the student of Latin. The work is organized in all years as follows: I. In Language: Systematic study of Latin Grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition. One hour a week. II. In Literature: Reading of authors in culture-historical series.

Course 6D: Cource 4C or Course 5C, or the equivalent of either, prerequisite.âThis course is intended for those who desire to specialize in classical philology, and especially for those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philisophy. Roman civilization is the link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's main subject be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and higher culture of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's main subject be Romanic, the Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman folk speech, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into acquaintance with the authors who illustrate it in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and the resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective) and life of the Romans. The following is therefore an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles, supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin language. II. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of textsâelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnson, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat), numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Mau, Strack, Furtwaengler). III. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâreading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâstudy of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen, Marquardt-Mommsen, Preller-Jordan, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband). Aids.âFor the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is urged to acquire a good reading knowledge of German, French, and Italian. Such a mastery of German and French is imperative. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. Mr. Hays. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination.

Roberts-Austen's Introduction to the Study of Metallurgy; Sadtler's HandBook of Industrial Organic Chemistry, etc. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France, and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good; among the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. Course 3C: Organic Chemistry: Laboratory course. Professor Bird. Three terms; six hours a week. The principal reactions and properties of the different classes of compounds of carbon are studied experimentally and the more important compounds are prepared. Two terms of this course are taken by medical students during their first year. Course 1B or its equivalent is a prerequisite. Text-Book.âRemsen's Organic Chemistry. For Graduates Only. For admission to a Ph. D. course in the School of Chemistry 3C and 4D, the previous completion of Course 1 and Course 2C in Analytical Chemistry, will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainment elsewhere. Laboratory work will be applied to subjects involving original investigation. It is desirable that the student shall, himself, as far as possible, select subjects for investigation, but when he cannot do so, suitable questions will be presented to him, and he will be encouraged to work them out for himself, with only such aid and guidance as may prove to be indispensable. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. Course 4D: Theoretical and Organic Chemistry.âProfessor Mallet. In this course a more advanced study is made of general chemical theory and a detailed discussion of the compounds of carbon.

This is followed by the preparation of a number of inorganic compounds. Course 1B or its equivalent is a prerequisite. Text-Book.âVolhard and Zimmermann's Manual, Renouf's translation. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is divided into two courses, as follows: Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: This course consists of three lessons a week throughout the session, after each of which the students spend three or four hours in practical experiments in the Laboratory. A course in Chemical manipulation is first given, then Blowpipe Analysis, Fire Assaying of Ores of Lead, Gold, and Silver, and a systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis, followed by practice in analysis of salts, alloys, and ores, determination of minerals and the examination of potable water, coal, limestone, clay, and so on, together with some simpler quantitative determinations. Weekly written exercises are required. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2C: The work of the second course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session, each being followed by four hours or more of practical laboratory work. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, the class pursues volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, iron and steel, technical products, and so on. Weekly written exercises are required. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assist in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. The Laboratory is open to students six days in the week, during all the working hours of the day. Students may register either for the first course, or for both courses at the same time; candidates for the M. A. elective are required to complete both courses. Those who accomplish this are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, Druggists, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis, A. I. Cohn; Olsen's Quantitative Chemical Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (3d ed.); Greville William's Hand-Book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's HandBook of Mineralogy. A course of lectures in Agricultural Chemistry is given in this School (see p. 222). For Graduates Only. The graduate course is designed for those seeking the degree of Ph. D., and also for such students as desire to increase the range of their experience as analysts, and to cultivate their powers of original investigation. It is required of those who enter this course that they shall have previously completed Courses 1 and 2C, in this School, and Courses 1B, 2C, 3C, and 4D in that of General Chemistry, or that they shall have previously made equivalent attainments elsewhere. Laboratory work will be conducted daily, and suggestions and due assistance will be given in its prosecution. While the work is adapted to the special aims or tastes of each student, it will in all cases comprise some practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, ultimate and proximate organic analysis, some study in analytical methods and some original problems, also the reading and the summarizing of extracts from current journals, and, for all who are seeking the degree of Ph. D., a dissertation embodying the results of some original research. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and storeroom attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The Analytical Laboratory will accommodate forty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchases and importation. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Mr. Kepner. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The work of this school is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge, or for other professional work therein; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for entrance upon the study of Medicine, or for an intelligent study of the relations of the biological sciences to the art of Agriculture as described in another portion of this catalogue (p. 222). Each student who enters upon the work of either of the courses described below is required to provide himself with a section razor, a good pocket magnifier, a small case of dissecting instruments, and a notebook of approved pattern. All other necessary apparatus, reagents, etc., are furnished by the laboratory. There is a laboratory fee for materials consumed in connection with the work of each of the courses. Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1B: General Biology.âThis course is intended to serve (as far as the work of a single course may) as an introduction to all of the biological sciences, including those fundamental to the profession of Medicine. Its pursuit is intended to make the student familiar with the laboratory method of study, and at the same time to impart to him some direct knowledge of the most readily discernible facts of structure and laws of function in living things, as seen in a series of representative plants and animals. In it he is made acquainted with the use of the microscope, with the simpler and more frequently used processes of biological technic, and with the principles of physiological experimentation; and with these aids is taught to observe, to record the results of his observations, and to draw conclusions therefrom. Through it he is led to discern the fundamental activities and the corresponding essentials of organization characteristic of all living beings, as distinguished from inanimate objects; as well as the important differences which distinguish plants from animals. By it he is thus prepared for the intelligent (and in some measure for the independent) study of either of the great divisions of the organic world; for the consideration of the important economic relations of living organisms, both plant and animal; or for the detailed and specific study of the structure and functions of the human body. This course is offered yearly; it, or an accepted equivalent course successfully pursued elsewhere, is required for admission to the Department of Medicine, or to the pursuit of the courses which follow. The work of the course consists of three lectures and three laboratory exercises a week. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2C: Botany and Plant Morphology: Course 1B prerequisite. âThe course in structural and systematic Botany is largely devoted to the study of the anatomy and histology of representatives of the principal divisions of the vegetable kingdom, and to their comparative morphology, beginning with the lowest and passing to the highest plants; as far as possible, representative life-histories are also studied and discussed. The concluding portion of the course is devoted to the specific study of the classification and distribution of the higher plants; and of the local flora, particularly in its ecological relations. Course 3C: Invertebrate ZoÃ¶logy and Morphology: Course 1B prerequisite.âIn this course a study is made of a series of forms representative of the principal groups of the invertebrate division of the animal kingdom, their anatomy, histology, and, as far as practicable, their embryology being studied. The practical work of the laboratory is supplemented by lectures upon the organization and life-history of the forms examined, and that of allied forms, and upon their relations as thereby indicated. One or more of the leading groups is discussed and studied somewhat in detail in such a manner as to illustrate the principles and the meaning of zoÃ¶logical classification as based upon structure and development. Course 4C: Vertebrate ZoÃ¶logy and Morphology: Courses 1B and 3C prerequisite.âThe work of the course begins with a study of the elements of Vertebrate Embryology: this is followed by the detailed comparative study of the structure and development of one or more systems of organs as existing in the vertebrates and in those forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically most nearly related to the vertebrate stock. The work of the laboratory is accompanied by illustrative lectures, and by a discussion of the classification of the vertebrates and their distribution both in space and in time. The work of each of the three courses just described will consist of two laboratory exercises per week, with the accompanying lectures; and a third lecture period, at a convenient hour, when the three classes will meet in one body: this weekly period will be devoted to the discussion of questions common to all three lines of study. The completion of the work thus outlined will satisfy the requirements for students who offer either of these courses as an elective at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Students who offer either of these courses as an elective for the degree of Master of Arts will be required to perform independently (upon subjects individually assigned) additional work in amount about equal to a third laboratory period per week. Course 2C will be given yearly: Courses 3C and 4C are offered yearly, but either may be withdrawn at the beginning of the session if not elected by at least four students. For Graduates Only. Course 5D: Cytology and Comparative Histology: Course 1B prerequisite: Course 2C, 3C or 4C must also be taken as a preceding course.âThis course begins with a study of the phenomena of cell organization and cell life in both plants and animals: this is followed by a comparative study of the elements of structure and their embryological development in the lower and the higher animals, or in a similar series of plant forms; the work of each student is individually assigned in great measure. It includes practice in the more advanced methods of technic, and a critical discussion of the microscope and its intelligent use, as means to the ends in view. It is accompanied by the consideration of the fundamental laws of General Biology as founded upon cytological study. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two courses, as follows: Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1B: Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology, and Notes of the Professor's lectures. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2C: Course 1B prerequisite.âThis course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.âThe course in Mineralogy closes in February. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Text-Books.âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Petrology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. Geology.âThis division of the course begins after the completion of Mineralogy in February. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Paleontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Text-Book.âChamberlin and Salisbury's Geology in part. For reference: Geikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. For Graduates Only. The advanced course in this School is intended to give the student as large a stock of useful information as possible, to teach him methods of investigation, and to train him in habits of observation. Original research will be insisted on, and opportunity will be given for the student to concentrate his efforts in some line of special study. Topics for study will be taken from both of the subjects taught in this School. The abundant material in the Lewis Brooks Museum, mentioned below, gives unusual facilities for the pursuit of graduate work. Course 3D: Descriptive Mineralogy.âThe course of Mineralogy is so selected as to give the student a good knowledge of as wide a range of the principles as possible, and at the same time to cause him to acquire a practical knowledge of the various mineral species. In the practical study, the more common minerals, and those of more importance from an economic and geologic point of view, will have preference. A practical knowledge of the crystal forms and of the characteristic groupings and massive forms of minerals, will be required. Special attention will be paid to the relations of minerals, their association in nature, and their geological occurrence. The student will be trained to determine minerals, as far as possible, by their obvious characteristics, without the help of tests, and practical examinations will be held, from time to time, to test his skill. One or more theses will be required. Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy, and Weisbach's Mineral Tables will be used; and topics from various authors will be assigned for study in special cases. Course 4D: Geology.âIn Geology the aim will be to fit the student for independent and original research. He will study as thoroughly as possible the broader problems of the science, involving the knowledge of stratigraphical principles. Special attention will be given to imparting a practical knowledge of the various rocks, and of the animal and plant fossils of the different eras, with the view of using them in determining unknown formations. Stress will be laid upon field work, and the methods of determining and describing the geology of new regions. To impart such knowledge, the student will be required to work up some particular region or formation, and report his results. Topics involving a knowledge of the literature and growth of opinion in relation to particular questions may be assigned to form the subject of theses. Chamberlin and Salisbury's Geology will be used as a text-book, and selected books of other authors will be used when necessary. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formation in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. ZoÃ¶logy is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papiermachÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.: the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing advanced work in Geology and Mineralogy. WILLIAM BARTON ROGERS SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. Professor Watson. Mr. Watkins.

The work will be conducted by the study of texts: class discussions; and daily practice in writing, either within or without the class room. The course will cover the general news story; types of journalistic work; the organization of a paper; the historical and social aspects of journalism; and the analysis of standard dailies. The text-books will be assigned. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 5C: Course 2B or 3B (or the equivalent) prerequisite.â This equivalent means that the student must have completed in some recognized college, and with a grade of not less than 75 per cent., a course in advanced Rhetoric, Poetics, History of English and American Literature, and a reasonably wide course in reading. In this course there are occasional lectures, but in general the class exercises will consist of conferences and discussions. Independent investigation will be insisted upon, with reports, either written or oral, from time to time. Much outside reading is necessary. Besides these written exercises and reports, three essays are required, one each term, which must show original research and independent conclusions. The themes of these essays may be assigned, or selected with the Professor's approval. Subjects to be studied in this course for 1907-1908 are: I. Shakespeare. II.

Collateral reading will be prescribed and required. A written record of all the reading done throughout these three years will be preserved, and, with the examination and thesis, will constitute the test of the whole Ph. D. course. Course in Public Speaking.âThe course in public speaking offered by Mr. Charles Wakefield Paul, Instructor in Public Speaking, organizes a new course and modifies an existing course in the School of English Literature, and also trains men from the Literary Societies for several intercollegiate contests. The course deals with the theory and practice of Public Speaking. Its aim is to prepare the student to express his thoughts and feelings clearly and effectively before an audience. No attempt is made to give the more elaborate discipline necessary for the public reader and impersonator. In order that emphasis may fall upon improvement in form, speeches from the great orators are used as material for drill work. At each lesson, every member in the section is called in turn before the class to render his lines and receive suggestions for further progress. The theory is not set forth by lectures, but by comments upon the efforts of the individual student and upon the end sought by the author of the oration under interpretation. The regular English course in Argumentation, if time permit, will be supplemented by practical experience in debating before the class and will deal not only with logical structure and effective tactics but also with manner of delivery. From the Literary Societies, by the sifting process of preliminary trials, candidates for three oratorical and three debating contests are chosen. The successful men will then be eligible to individual instruction in daily rehearsals until the final competition takes place. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY. Professor Lefevre. Professor Payne.

A., Ph D., Dean Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âFor entrance to the College the candidate must either present satisfactory certificates, or pass the entrance examinations described in detail, pp. 70-80. The four "blocks" which the candidate may select at will (pp. 77-78), must be so chosen as to absolve in full the requirements for entrance upon the courses for which he desires to be registered. These are the minimum requirements for admission to the College; and any candidate for admission who has received a preparation more ample than is thus represented will be admitted to advanced standing on satisfactory evidence of his attainments, in accordance with the conditions stated on p. 83. Every first-year student, who desires to be registered as a candidate, in due course, for the B. A. degree, is required (unless admitted to advanced standing) to take English Literature 1A, Mathematics 1A, Latin 1A (or some other foreign language), and a Natural Science (or Greek, if the student wishes to take both Latin and Greek). All other students are required to undertake the work of three courses, each consisting of three or more lectures or exercises a week throughout the year; and only three, unless otherwise authorized by the Faculty. Hence the time necessary for the attainment of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts by a student with the minimum preparation above indicated is four years. All undergraduate students are regarded as members of the College. Full opportunity has in the past been, and will in the future be, given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. Every student is, however, expected to come to the University for a definite purpose: and when no well considered plan, as above indicated, has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student in question will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the College, which leads to the bachelor's degree. BACHELOR OF ARTS. The requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia are such as to permit of the large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student which has characterized the work of the University from the beginning: such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which this degree stands. In order to secure to the recipient of this degree in due measure an acquaintance with the methods of study and of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, as far as possible, his choice of work leading thereto is subject to the following conditions. The candidate for this degree is required to choose ten B. A. electives from the groups given below (save in the cases presently to be mentioned): these electives consist in some cases of a single course, in others of two or more courses. The choice of electives is subject to the following restrictions: two electives (one of which must be either Latin or Greek) must be chosen from the first of the five groups, one from the second group, two from the third, one from the fourth, and one from the fifth. The other three electives are to be taken at large from the courses indicated as open to such election in the brief summary which immediately follows the statement of the groups, or from the graduate courses open to candidates for the Master's degree. But in every case at least two of the electives-at-large must be chosen from a single group, to be known as the candidate's major group. Each elective-at-large consists of a single course. Students who complete the work of the B. A. electives in both Latin and Greek, are required to choose but seven other electives (or two electives-at-large). Students who have completed seven or more B. A. electives, satisfying the requirements of the group system, may offer in lieu of the three electives-at-large the work of the first year in the Department of Law or of Medicine, or three technical courses in the Department of Engineering. Candidates who enter with advanced standing from other colleges must be regularly registered in the College for at least one session, and must complete at least three B. A. electives here, to be admitted to the privilege last stated. Every candidate for the B. A. degree must (unless admitted to advanced standing) complete the work in English Literature 1A and Mathematics 1A. Any student in good standing who satisfies the requirements above stated, under the prescribed conditions, is entitled to the degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia. The groups from which the candidate for the B. A. degree must choose his B. A. electives, in accordance with the regulations detailed in the preceding paragraphs, are as follows: (The courses included in each elective are indicated.) I. LANGUAGES.

A brief summary is here presented of the courses open to election by candidates for the baccalaureate degree under the preceding group system and as electives at large: in addition candidates may offer as electives at large any of the graduate courses open to candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, a summary of which, with a schedule of lecture and examination hours is given on page 154: provided that in each case the undergraduate course or courses prerequisite for the subject in question have been completed. A description of each of these courses will be found in the statements of the Academic Schools upon pages 105-143. Where a course is stated to be prerequisite to a second course, the latter may be taken parallel with the former if, in the judgment of the professor concerned, the circumstances justify such a privilege.

Intermediate Examinations.âIn all the undergraduate courses examinations are held at fixed periods in December and March: the dates of these intermediate examinations are given in the schedule of lectures and examinations upon the following page. All lectures in the College courses are suspended during the periods in which these examinations are held. The examinations begin in each case at 9 a. m., and are limited to six hours. II. Final Examinations.âIn addition to the intermediate examinations, final examinations are held for all college classes during the fortnight immediately before the final week, lectures closing on the Saturday preceding. The dates of these examinations are given in the schedule which follows. They begin in each case at 9 a. m., and are limited to eight hours. III. Fall Examinations.âThe regulations concerning Fall Examinations in the College courses, granted for partially successful work, are as follows: A student of the College who attains in any course a grade below 75 per cent, but not below 65 per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted by the Faculty at their final meeting in June to re-examination upon that course during the Registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination shall be five dollars ($5) payable to the Bursar of the University, and this fee shall be in no case returnable. The Dean of the College will at once notify each student admitted to re-examination, and the fee for the same shall be paid to the Bursar on or before the 15th of July. Should the student fail to deposit this fee with the Bursar in due time, or fail to attend upon the examination, the permit for re-examination is void. A student, who fails to sustain himself either in the original examination or in the re-examination upon any course elected, shall upon readmission be required to attend lectures a second time upon that course and pass the regular examinations thereon, unless excused by a special vote of the Faculty. An official schedule of the September examinations shall be prepared and issued by the Dean to all candidates registered for such examinations, not later than August 1st. The Dean shall furnish to the members of the Academic Faculty concerned, not later than September 1, a list of the candidates entitled to re-examination,âtogether with the official schedule of the examinations. The Fall examinations in the College shall be held (for 1908) between the 7th and the 12th of September, inclusive. Postponement of these examinations is permitted only under such conditions as apply to the regular examinations, p. 67. For the regulations concerning special examinations granted for sickness or a like cause, see p. 88. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the College may be estimated at from $160 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for University and tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pages 91-95. SCHEDULE OF LECTURES. 1908-1909.

Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe possession of a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank: or, in the case of a graduate of an institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. A candidate entering the University under these conditions will be registered as a Graduate Student if he is pursuing one or more graduate courses: he may, however, be permitted, or, if he is a candidate for a degree who enters from another college, be required to take in addition such strictly undergraduate courses as may be desirable or necessary for his purpose. Graduates in Schools. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any Academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School: but a student thus pursuing graduate studies will not be registered as a member of this Department unless he has satisfied the conditions above stated. Masters of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts of this University who has completed the work in four fully organized graduate courses chosen by himself and approved by the Academic Faculty; each of which courses must be one in which the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The four courses must be chosen from at least three distinct subjects distributed among three different Academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty; and at least three of the courses must be cognate. Students who take such graduate courses in some subjects before receiving the B. A. degree will not be granted the M. A. degree unless they take at least two of their graduate courses in the academic year when the latter degree is conferred. A brief summary of the C courses open to candidates for the Master's degree is given upon a following page, together with a schedule of the hours of lectures and examinations: a description of each is given in its proper connection in that portion of the catalogue which treats of the work of the independent Academic Schools. The courses indicated are also, in many cases, included among the advanced courses that may be offered as electives at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: credit can, of course, be obtained for any such course in but one of these capacities by the same candidate; work done for the lower degree being in no case counted again as part of the work required for the attainment of the higher degree. Students holding baccalaureate degrees from other chartered institutions of learning and desiring admission to candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts should write immediately to the Registrar of the University and ask for a blank form of application, to be filled out (partly by the applicant, and partly by the President of the institution from which the applicant has received a degree) and promptly returned to the Registrar. When the Committee on Academic Degrees has duly considered the application and reported to the Academic Faculty, the latter will decide whether the application will be accepted; and, if so, the applicant will then be informed what work he will have to do in order to obtain the M. A. degree. In general, the Faculty will require that, unless the baccalaureate degree of the candidate conforms with reasonable closeness to the B. A. degree of the University in the character of its requirements, the candidate must take such undergraduate courses here as will supplement his deficiencies. In particular, the Faculty will require the candidate to take not only the four graduate courses mentioned above, but also the undergraduate courses in the same subjects, unless convinced by the report of the Committee on Academic Degrees that the candidate's work done elsewhere in one or more of these subjects has been fully equal in quality and quantity to the undergraduate work required in such subject or subjects at the University of Virginia. Nor can the candidate be excused from doing the undergraduate work in any one of these four subjects without the consent of the professor of that subject. Doctors of Philosophy. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts of this University, or (under the regulations mentioned below) upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree from some other chartered institution of learning who possesses a reading knowledge of French and German, and who completes the prescribed graduate work in three cognate subjects, chosen by himself from at least two Academic Schools, and approved by the Academic Faculty; this graduate work to be pursued for at least three years in the major subject, for at least two years in the primary minor, and for at least one year in the secondary minor subject. It is also provided that any student taking the second or third year of graduate work in a subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the Academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. The "reading knowledge" of French and German mentioned above is intended to enable the candidate to pursue his chosen subjects through the medium of books and periodicals in the French and German languages. His ability to do this must be tested at the beginning of the first year of his candidacy by examinations on these languages in the presence of a committee consisting of the professor of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German. In case of failure on either or both of the examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate class or classes in one or both of the languages, and will not be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled the requirements in French and German. It is provided, however, that any student who has already passed on the regular B. A. course in either or both of the languages at this University shall be considered as having the requisite knowledge of either or both of them, as the case may be. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that, while it shall be possible for a candidate to get credit in this way for the whole of his secondary minor subject, every candidate must take here at least one advanced course in his primary minor, and at least one year's work in his major subject. It is also provided that a candidate who is a professor, in charge of the subject selected by him as major, in a chartered college or university, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work at this University. The graduate work of the last year of candidacy shall in all cases be done at this University, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. Upon the completion of the approved courses, the candidate shall submit to the Academic Faculty a Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of his major subject. The Dissertation must be submitted not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the Faculty's approval shall be written (type-written, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size; shall be bound; and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If accepted as satisfactory by the Faculty, this copy shall immediately become the property of the University. If approved, the Dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense before the degree is conferred, and one hundred copies deposited in the Library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the Dissertation printed. The instruction open to candidates for the Doctor's degree in each of the Academic Schools is described in a preceding portion of the catalogue. No graduate course can be counted for the Doctor's degree unless the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The conditions on which students holding baccalaureate degrees from other chartered institutions of learning are admitted to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy are as follows. Each applicant should write to the Registrar of the University and ask for a blank form of application to be filled out (partly by the applicant, and partly by the President of the institution from which the applicant has received a degree) and promptly returned to the Registrar. When the application has been duly considered by the Committee on Academic Degrees and by the Academic Faculty, the applicant will be informed as to the work which he, if accepted as a candidate, will have to do in order to secure the Doctor's degree. The general rule will be that unless his baccalaureate degree conforms with reasonable closeness to the B. A. degree of this University in the nature of its requirements, he must take such undergraduate courses here as will supplement his deficiencies. In particular, he will be required to take not only the graduate work in his three chosen subjects, but the undergraduate courses as well, unless the Faculty is convinced that his work done elsewhere in one or more of these subjects has been fully equal in quality and quantity to the undergraduate work required in such subject or subjects at this University. Moreover, the individual professor of any of these three subjects may require the candidate to take his undergraduate course, should he regard him as insufficiently grounded in the fundamental facts or principles of the subject. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $160 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 91-95. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under conditions above stated, are required to matriculate and to pay the annual University fee of $40 if not Virginians, and $10 if Virginians, during such period of non-residence. COURSES IN THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OPEN TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AS ELECTIVES FOR THE SECOND DEGREE IN ARTS. A brief summary is here presented of the courses open to election by candidates for the Master's degree. A description of each of these courses will be found in the statements of the Academic Schools upon preceding pages (105-143). Where an undergraduate course is stated to be prerequisite to a graduate course, the latter may be taken parallel with the former if, in the judgment of the professor concerned, the circumstances justify such a privilege.

ALEXANDER STUART ROBERTSON, B. A., LL. B., Instructor in Law. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Among the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continous operation since, even during the four years of the civil war. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position to which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is confidently believed that the enlarged course now offered will enable those who complete it more surely to maintain that rank at the bar which the University has always expected of her sons. Formerly it was possible for the law student to begin and complete his professional studies in the office of some friendly member of the barâ Blackstone's Commentaries and the Code of his State forming the main portion of his curriculum. Then the authorities were few, the leading principles alone were settled, and their application was comparatively simple. In more recent times, so widened is the scope of the law, so complex its principles, so nice and yet so important its distinctions, so numerous and conflicting the authorities, that it is scarcely practicable for even the most diligent student to master the subject, in its multiform phases, without the systematic instruction of skilled teachers. Furthermore, the increased and increasing scope and rigor of the examinations for admission to the bar in the several States call for a more extensive course of study than was afforded in former days by the law school, and a wider and more intimate knowledge of legal principles than can generally be acquired by private study. These considerations have led to a general conviction among the leaders of professional thought throughout the country that no student should essay the practice of the law who has not spent at least two years in close and attentive study in a law school. Indeed, the decided tendency is toward requiring even a longer period of study, as essential either to graduation or to admission to the bar. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue, pp. 70-85. For exemption from this rule in the case of Special Students not candidates for the degree in Law, see p. 84. All candidates for the degree must have attained the age of eighteen before entering the Law School. Course of Study.âThe course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than that he should arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures (on some subjects with the addition of illustrative cases), with careful daily examinations upon both. The daily quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconceptions of legal principles on the part of the student. The course occupies two years, and it is not permissible to apply for graduation in less time. Indeed, since future professional success depends upon complete mastery of elementary principles, it is not advisable for the student to devote less time to preparation for practice, even though he be not a candidate for graduation. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough knowledge of the elements of the law, thought as well as reading is requisite; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One cannot gorge himself with legal principles and digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, must accompany the reception of knowledge. Arrangement of Classes.âThe course of instruction in the Department of Law comprises twelve separate classes. Six of these classes constitute the first year's studies, and six the studies of the second year. In the work of each year, there are nine lectures a week. The lectures occupy an hour and a half each, so that each year's course demands thirteen and a half hours of class-work each week, besides the work of the Moot and Practice courts. The following table exhibits an outline of the course: * * The first year Law Course may be substituted for certain electives in the College by candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. First Year 1. The Law of Persons; Personal Property (including Sales); Wills of Personalty, and Administration. 2. The Law of Contracts. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. 4. Mercantile Law: Negotiable Paper; Partnership; Insurance. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Second Year 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. 8. Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases. 9. The Law of Real Property. 10. The Law of Corporations. 11. The Law of Evidence. 12. Conflict of Laws. FIRST YEAR COURSE. 1. Law of Persons; Personal Property; Wills and Administration. Professor Lile. Adj. Prof. Dobie (1907-'08). The preliminary lectures in this class are devoted to the nature, sources and evidences of the law; the absolute and relative rights of persons, and their constitutional guaranties; citizenship and naturalization; and subordinate magistrates. This is followed by a thorough drill in the subjects of principal and agent; husband and wife, including their common law property rights, with the modern statutory modifications; parent and child; and guardian and ward. Later, the study of the law of personal property (including the law of sales) is pursued in its various phases, followed by that of wills, of personalty and administration. Under the latter classification are included the execution of wills; the qualification of personal representatives and the settlement of their accounts; the law of legacies and of distribution; and the complete administration of estates.â September 14 to February 27âThree times a week. Text-Books.âLong's Domestic Relations; Mechem's Principles of Agency; Rood on Wills; R. M. Benjamin's Principles of Sales (2d ed.); The Professor's Printed Notes. 2. The Law of Contracts. Professor Graves. In this class, coming appropriately at the beginning of the Junior year, an effort is made to give a thorough, though elementary, course in the fundamentals of contract lawâthe formation, operation, and discharge of contractsâwith a full discussion of the doctrine of consideration, the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, and the consequences of the various kinds of illegality, whether at common law or by statute. The important subject of Quasi-Contract also receives adequate attention. The textbook on Contracts (Clark, following the analysis of Anson) is accompanied by a volume of Illustrative Cases, and is supplemented by the Professor's Printed Notes, explaining obscurities in the text, and calling attention to the recent cases in Virginia and elsewhere.âSeptember 14 to December 23 âThree times a week. Text-Books.âClark on Contracts (2d ed.); Hopkins's Cases on Contracts; The Professor's Printed Notes. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. Professor Minor. In the study of this subject the student is made familiar with the general principles enforced by the courts in the administration of criminal justice. He is instructed as to the nature and elements of the more important crimes, both common law and statutory. Attention is given rather to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the leading principles than to the less important details, which, with a knowledge of the former, may readily be acquired. The course of instruction further embraces a study of the forms of procedure, the nature, organization and duties of the courts, and of grand and petit juries; arrests and bail; indictments, presentments, informations, and the various defenses, by way of demurrer, plea, or otherwise; together with the ordinary incidents of a criminal trial, such as challenges of jurors, motions for a new trial, bills of exceptions, motions in arrest of judgment, and writs of error. The last lectures of this course are devoted to the practical work of drawing indictments, pleas in abatement and other criminal pleading, and the making of motions for new trial, in arrest of judgment, etc.âSeptember 14 to January 20âThree times a week. Text-Books.âClark's Criminal Law; Beale's Criminal Pleading and Practice; The Professor's Notes. 4. Mercantile Law. Professor Lile. Adj. Prof. Dobie (1907-'08). Under this head are grouped the subjects of Negotiable Instruments, Insurance, and Partnership. The instruction is made as practical as possible, by frequent use of the various mercantile instruments, as exhibits, in the course of the lectures. In the study of the law of negotiable paper, constant reference is made to the Negotiable Instruments Law, recently enacted in many States, including Virginia, and likely to be adopted throughout the country. In addition to the study of the general principles of the law of insurance, attention is devoted to particular clauses most usual in life, marine, and accident policies, and the New York Standard fire policy is studied, clause by clause, in the light of judicial construction.âFebruary 27 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âBigelow on Bills, Notes, and Cheques (Student's Seriesâ2d ed.); Vance on Insurance; Mechem on Partnership; The Negotiable Instruments Law; The Professor's Notes. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. Professor Graves. The Law of Torts (or Non-Contract Law) is first taken up, and after a full discussion of the General Principles underlying the subject, the several classes of Torts are examined separately. Especial attention is given to Personal Injuries by Negligence, Employers' Liability Acts (State and Federal), and statutes concerning Death by Wrongful Act, Neglect, or Default. In connection with the text-book, a volume of cases is used, which serve to illustrate and impress the abstract principles by concrete examples. On the completion of Torts, the subject of bailments is entered upon, and after an outline of the doctrines concerning the several kinds of Bailees (including Innkeepers), the Law of Carriers (of goods and passengers) is begun, and is considered with the fulness and thoroughness due to this important topic. The recent legislation of Congress as to carriers engaged in Inter-State Commerce is carefully considered.â From January 3 to end of the sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âCooley on Torts (Lewis's Students' Ed., 1907); Chase's Cases on Torts (ad ed.); Hutchinson on Carriers (2d ed.); The Professor's Notes. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Professor Minor. The first lectures of this course are devoted to the Theory and Practice of Government. It is traced from its generally accepted originâthe familyâthrough its various stages to the modern forms, and effort is made by reasoning and comparison to point out the benefits of good government, the dangers of the bad. This is followed by Constitutional Law, in the study of which close attention is given to the judicial interpretation of the Federal Constitution, and to the great constitutional principles prevailing throughout the Union. As occasion demands, attention is called to the policy of various acts of legislation, and the student is warned against such as tend to exceed the limits of safe and constitutional restrictions. The checks and balances of the constitution are pointed out, and by comparing it with other constitutions, notably that of England, its weak as well as strong points are developed. Especial attention is given to such important subjects as ex post facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contracts, due process of law, trial by jury, the power of taxation and of eminent domain, the police power, interstate commerce, etc. In the lectures upon Public International Law are considered the various rules which regulate the intercourse of one nation with anotherâ such as the principles governing the origin, recognition, and equality of States; their rights in time of peace, and the means whereby they peaceably procure the enjoyment of those rights; the laws of war, and the rights and duties of belligerents, and the rules regulating the relations of neutral and belligerent States.âJanuary 20 to May 7âThree times a week. Text-Books.âCooley's Principles of Constitutional Law (3d ed.); Davis' International Law (2d ed.); The Professor's Notes. SECOND YEAR COURSE. 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. Professor Lile. Adj. Prof. Dobie (1907-'08). After consideration of the origin and rise of the chancery jurisdiction, the student is led carefully through the usual subjects of equitable cognizance, and thence into the methods of procedure, as recognized in the High Court of Chancery in England, and as modified by statute or by rules of court in America. The contrast between legal and equitable principles and procedure is constantly adverted to, and the student is incited to the appreciation and cultivation of the fine sense of moral right underlying the doctrines of technical equity. The procedure in the Federal courts of chancery and in the Chancery courts of Virginia (where the distinction between legal and equitable procedure is still maintained) is made the basis of instruction. Practical work is required in draughting the various forms and pleadings, from the subpÅna to the final decree. In the law of Bankruptcy, sufficient instruction is given to afford to the student a fair working knowledge of general principles, and effort is made to secure as great familiarity as possible with the specific provisions of the National Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and the prescribed rules of procedure thereunder.âSeptember 14 to February 1âThree times a week. Text-Books.âMerwin's Equity; Text-books on Equity Practice and Bankruptcy (to be announced); The Professor's Notes. 8. Pleading and Practice. Professor Graves. In this class the subjects are Pleading and Practice at common law, and under the Virginia Statutes; and Federal Jurisprudence and Procedure. These are all confined to civil cases at law; criminal procedure and equity jurisdiction and procedure being taught elsewhere in the course. An outline of the instruction in this class may be given as follows: (1) The principles and rules of pleading at common lawâan intimate acquaintance with the common law rules and principles being insisted upon as essential to a proper knowledge of pleading under any system. (2) The organization and jurisdiction of the Virginia courts, and the proceedings in a law suit from beginning to end, including appellate proceedings; and the law of attachments, executions, homestead exemptions, etc. (3) The organization and jurisdiction of the Federal courts; removal of causes from State to Federal courts; the conformity or non-conformity of the procedure at law in the Federal courts with that in the courts of the State wherein they are held; and appellate proceedings in the Federal courts.âSeptember 14 to March 8âThree times a week. Text-Books.âAndrews's Stephen on Pleading; Hughes's Jurisdiction and Procedure of the United States Courts; The Professor's Printed Notes on Pleading, and Printed Questions; Burks's Printed Notes on Pleading. 9. The Law of Real Property. Professor Minor. The instruction in this class covers a detailed and careful study of the subject of Real Property Law, in all its branches. The nature and several kinds of real estate, and the various interests therein, with the principles appertaining to each, curtesy and dower, the relations of landlord and tenant, co-tenancies, the feudal tenures and principles, uses and trusts, the far-reaching effects of the Statute of Uses, the conditions, covenants, and other qualifications attached to conveyances of land, are reviewed at length. The historical connection between ancient and modern doctrines of conveyancing, with the statutory changes, are carefully traced. Remainders, reversions, and executory limitations, and the principles governing their creation, validity, and effect, together with the sources of title to lands, whether by descent or by the manifold forms of purchase, and the principles controlling each, the subjects of conveyances, contracts to convey, wills of lands, adverse possession, the registry of instruments of title, and the principles regulating the acquisition and validity of tax-titles, are investigated in detail. Throughout this course, emphasis is placed on common law principles, and effort is made to give the student a clear comprehension of these, by tracing them to their feudal or other sources, and by following them into the modern forms they have assumed under the guiding hand of courts and legislatures. Several lectures are devoted to the practical drafting of deeds, contracts, and wills, as these subjects are presented.âSeptember 14 to March 25âThree times a week. Text-Books.âTo be announced. 10. The Law of Corporations. Professor Lile. Adj. Prof. Dobie (1907-'08). In view of the modern development of the law of corporations, both in extent and importance, increasing attention is devoted to this branch of the curriculum. Among other subjects of lesser import, the lectures embrace the promotion, organization, and management of business corporations; the formation and enforcement of subscriptions for shares; corporate duties, powers, and liabilities; the relations between the corporation and the State, between the corporate body and its shareholders, officers, agents, and creditors, and the reciprocal relations of these with one another; the consolidation, dissolution, and winding up of corporations; and the appointment, duties, and powers of receivers. The principles applicable to municipal corporations, whether in their public or their proprietary characters, are fully elucidated; the subjects of municipal taxation, municipal bonds, franchises, rights and liabilities in connection with streets, as affecting the municipality, the public generally, and the abutting proprietors, are dealt with in detail.âFebruary 1 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âMarshall on Corporations; Clephane on Business Corporationsâ their Organization and Management; The Professor's Printed Notes on Private Corporations; The Professor's Printed Notes on Municipal Corporations. 11. The Law of Evidence. Professor Graves. The principles of this subject are sought to be elucidated by the aid of the latest and most philosophical expositions of evidence, notably those of the late Professor James B. Thayer, of Harvard University, to whose work, "A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law," constant reference is made. The text-book usedâVolume I of Greenleafâis edited by Professor Wigmore, and in it have been incorporated the results of the historical research and scientific analysis of Professor Thayer and others. But while great attention is paid to the rationale of the law of evidence, as indispensable to a mastery of its principles, the practical character of the rules of evidence is not overlooked, and an earnest effort is made, by careful consideration of the statutes and decisions, and the use of a Volume of Illustrations, to give the student such a working knowledge of the subject as will enable him to apply its principles in the course of judicial investigations.âFrom March 8 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âGreenleaf on Evidence (16th ed., by Wigmore); Hughes's Illustrations of Evidence; The Professor's Printed Questions. 12. The Conflict of Laws. Professor Minor. As the facilities of commerce and intercourse between the various States and countries of the world increase, this subject becomes of graver importance, though as yet it has received rather scanty recognition at the hands of text-writers and law-schools. The course includes a discussion of the nature and various kinds of domicil; the law governing status, and the conveyance of personal property abroad; the validity, construction, and effect of foreign wills, successions, and administrations; foreign marriages and divorces; transactions relating to real estate; the execution, interpretation, and validity of foreign contracts; the law governing the effect of foreign judgments in rem or in personam; the recovery of damages for foreign torts; the situs of crimes; the application of the lex fori; and the modes of pleading and proving foreign laws.âMarch 25 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Book.âMinor on Conflict of Laws; The Professor's Notes. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court is organized by the students in the First Year's course for the discussion of legal questions. Its meetings begin at the opening and continue to the end of the session, with such interruptions only as are incident to the proximity of the examinations. Attendance is voluntary, as presence during the debates is intended to be a privilege and not a burden. But every candidate for the degree is required to argue at least one case in the Moot Court, and to hand in a carefully prepared brief of his argument, with a digest of the authorities relied on. The questions are chosen by the Law Faculty, one of whom presides over the discussions. Interest and life are added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whom diffidence prompts to silence. The following gentlemen served as officers of the Moot Court during the session of 1907-1908: Associate Judges Oscar L. Shewmake, Newport News, Va. Charles T. Jesse, Bowling Green, Va. Clerks John Nash, Portsmouth, Va. Roy H. Pickford, Streets, Va. PRACTICE COURT. The object of the Practice Court is to afford to the student practical facility in the procedure which he will be called on to apply at the bar, and to familiarize him with the whole proceedings in actions at law, and suits in equity. The Practice Court is presided over by members of the Law Faculty, and is organized October 1, two weeks after the beginning of the session. Its sessions are held weekly. Attendance and punctual performance of all assigned work are obligatory on all candidates for graduation in Pleading and Practice at Law, and in Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure.* * Practice Court Hour.âIn Pleading and Practice at Law, the hour will be on Thursday, from 1 to 2 p. m., the term of the court continuing from October 1 to December 23. In Equity Procedure, the hour will be on Thursday, from 10 to 11 a. m., the term of the court continuing from January 3 to March 15. The right is reserved to change the Practice Court Day from Thursday to Saturday, if found necessary. The Final Session of the Practice Court in Pleading and Practice at Law will be held on the day preceding the last scheduled lecture in that subject previous to the Christmas Suspension. In Pleading and Practice at Law the Final Session of the Practice Court (at which motions are made in open court) is treated, as to attendance, as a part of the regular examination held in December. PRIZES. Edward Thompson Company Prize.âThis prize for the best thesis on a subject assigned by the Law Faculty is awarded annually in a competition open to members of the second year class, who are candidates for graduation. It is donated by the Edward Thompson Company, of Northport, N. Y., and consists of a set of the second edition of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law (32 volumes), of the estimated value of $240. The Edward Thompson Company Prize for the session of 1906-'07 was awarded to Samuel Mayner Wallace, of Midway, Ky. The subject for the thesis was: "Contracts by Common Carriers Limiting the Amount of Their Liability for the Loss of Goods by Negligence." LIBRARYâLEGAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. The Law Library is accommodated by its own library rooms, separate from the general University library. The rooms are heated by steam and lighted by electricity, and are located with special reference to the convenience of the law students. A librarian is in attendance during working hours. The library contains complete sets of the decisions of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, United States Supreme Court, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It contains the National Reporter System, complete; the American Decisions; American Reports; American State Reports; Law Reports Annotated; a valuable collection of English Reports; and all the modern search-books, in the form of general digests (including the Century) and Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of text-books. While the student is not encouraged too early to venture for himself into either cases or text-books, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, he is incited to familiarize himself not only with the leading cases to which his attention is called, but especially with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To the latter subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are specially devoted. The student is taught that books are the working tools of the lawyer, and that facility in handling them, in the office and in the court room, is an indispensable professional acquirement. He is instructed how to consult authorities and run down cases; to distinguish doctrine from dicta; to analyze, criticise, and compare cases; to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar. EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREES. The degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B.) is conferred upon such students as have attended two full sessions of nine months each (for provision as to late entrance see page 176) of the law school, and who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing all written examinations, and who have satisfactorily performed the work of the Moot and Practice courts and other assigned work. Any one of the classes of the first or second year may be completed separately. Upon the satisfactory completion of any class, a certificate is issued to the student, followed by the diploma of graduation when (and not until) all the examinations have been successfully passed. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations as shall be prescribed. Fall Examinations.âThe privilege of standing Fall examinations is granted to candidates for graduation who have fallen slightly below the required standard, and who have not more than two classes to complete. These Fall examinations for the session of 1908-1909 will begin September 15, 1908, and will continue from day to day until completed, in the following order: (1) Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; (2) Pleading and Practice; (3) Conflict of Laws; (4) Corporations; (5) Evidence; (6) Real Property. Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend both the Junior and Senior year in residence here. Preliminary Education.* * For entrance requirements see pp. 70-85 âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the Law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether at the Law School or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained intellects, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop after entrance upon practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule, that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of the Law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without it will be seriously handicapped, and are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyânay, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students are, in large measure, in the ratio of their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that ordinarily required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Special Students.âStudents who can attend but a single session are advised to take special courses, which the arrangement of the classes readily permits. Over-zealousness, by which an ambitious student is beguiled into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a single year, leads to cramming and inaccuracy, and often to complete failure. With this admonition, the special student is free to select his own work. The following course is suggested for students who propose to attend for a single session only: First year classes 1, 3, and 4 (see pp. 167-8); second year classes, 8, 9, and 11; or, if the student has already had some legal training, numbers 7 and 10 of the second year may be added. The first course suggested would require 15 hours, and the second 19Â½ hours, of class-work a week. Late Entrance.âRegistration commences Thursday, September 10, and the work of the Law School begins promptly September 14, and continues until the middle of June. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the work has advanced at the time of his entrance, and credit for a full year's attendance cannot be given in case of entrance after November 1. As regards conditions of admission in case of late entrance, reference is made to the General Entrance Requirements, as stated on a preceding page. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at from $330 upwards, according to the mode of living, for each session. A fuller statement regarding expenses may be found on preceding pages of this catalogue. SCHEDULE OF LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. 1908-1909. Law Department.

A., Dispensary Pharmacist Requirements for Admission to the Medical Department.âApplicants for admission to the work of the first year of the Course in Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having at least a three years' course; or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high school course; and, in addition, to present satisfactory evidence of the completion of college courses in physics, chemistry, and biology equivalent to but not necessarily identical with those at this institution. In consideration of educational acquirements in other subjects, a student may be conditioned on physics or biology (but not on both), this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. Applicants unable to satisfy these requirements by acceptable certificates, in part or in whole, may remove their deficiencies by satisfactory examinations. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the University, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. Announcement of Change in Entrance Requirements beginning with 1910.âFrom and after June 1, 1910, the minimum amount of preparation necessary for admission to the Medical Department will be the completion of a four-year high school course or its equivalent, and, in addition, the completion of college courses in Inorganic Chemistry, Physics, Biology and one Language, preferably German. The work of each of the four years of the course in Medicine continues through the nine months of the University session. Studies included are arranged as follows: During the first session: Chemistry; Normal Histology and Embryology; Anatomy and Anatomy of Nervous System; Physiological Chemistry. During the second session: Physiology; Bacteriology; Pathology; Anatomy; Pharmacology and Physical Diagnosis. During the third session: Obstetrics; Materia Medica; Practice of Medicine; Surgery; Gynecology; Clinical Diagnosis; Clinics. During the fourth session: Neurology; Pediatrics; Therapeutics; Hygiene; Surgery; Dermatology; Gynecology; Medical Jurisprudence; Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat; Clinics. An examination of this system will show that the work of the first year is given to those sciences which are fundamental to the entire work of the remaining part of the course; that of the second year includes the study of those sciences, more distinctively medical, which are based upon the work of the previous year, while they in turn underlie the more strictly professional subjects of study; these latter are begun in the second year, while the third and fourth years are devoted wholly to them. The work of the first year is accompanied by extensive practical work in the laboratory; the same is true of the work of the second year, while in the third, and especially the fourth year, the time of the student is devoted largely to practical clinical instruction. The facilities afforded by the University for such work will be more fully described in the statements which follow concerning the different subjects included in the course. Relations of the Student in the Second and Succeeding Years.â For the purposes of this Department the attainment of a grade of eighty per cent. upon a subject is regarded as satisfactory, and students who obtain such grades are excused from further attendance upon the subjects in question. Students who attain a grade less than eighty per cent. but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects are entitled to admission to the Fall Examinations of the following session as explained in a subsequent paragraph, when deficiencies may be removed by satisfactory examinations. Those who receive a grade of less than seventy per cent. on one or more subjects are regarded as having failed thereon, and are required to take such subject or subjects over during the succeeding year, without, however, the payment of any additional fee. In general a student who is repeating a course of a previous year will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or the third year if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this University, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the entire work of the year in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated by points as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Chemistry 4, 7 points; Organic Laboratory, 8 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Physiological Chemistry, 8 points. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology 2, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty based in each case upon a careful examination of the student's real interest. A student may not be examined upon the entire course in any subject more than three times. Failure upon the third trial involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this Department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this Department with a grade of at least eighty per cent. in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the first paragraph of the preceding section. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. No credit can be allowed for time not spent in a regular school of medicine; except that applicants holding the degree of A. B. or B. S. from a reputable college or university will be admitted to the second year, provided their academic course has included the equivalent of the first-year medical course. A student who is already a graduate of a reputable school of medicine may be received as a student in this Department for the fourth year. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this Department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and passed satisfactory examinations upon all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in most subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session, who from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination of the preceding year have attained a grade less than eighty per cent. but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, as explained in the paragraph under that heading. The Fall Examinations for 1908-09 begin September seventh, and close September twelfth. Application for admission to them should be made in writing to Dr. R. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Department of Medicine, not later than September first. A General Oral Examination for Graduation is held at the close of the sess on on all the different branches on which the candidate for the degree of Medicine has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. Expenses.âThe tuition fees are $110 for the first year, $100 for the second year, $80 for the third year, and $60 for the fourth year. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the University fee (which entiles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $200 for living expenses, and $20 for books. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. Professor Bird. Chemistry 4, three hours weekly for the first two terms. Lectures and recitations. In this course theoretical and organic chemistry are taught, with incidental reference to the bearing of the facts brought forward upon physiology, the practice of medicine, therapeutics, and sanitation. Professor Mallet. Organic Laboratory: Laboratory course.âSix hours weekly for the first two terms. The principles of the different classes of compounds of carbon are studied experimentally and the more important compounds are prepared. A grade of 70 per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiological Chemistry (Physiology 1). Professor Bird. ANATOMY. Professor Whitehead. Adjunct Professor Byrnes. Adjunct Professor Jordan. Dr. Norford. The course in this subject extends through the entire first year and the first six months of the second year. It is divided, for the sake of convenience, as follows: Anatomy I.âThis begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a "part" (either the head and neck, upper extremity and thorax, or lower extremity and abdomen) is assigned to each student for dissection and study. Emphasis is placed upon the benefit to be derived by the student who obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. While practical dissection and the consideration of topographical relations make up the essential features of the course, there are occasional lectures and frequent recitations, followed by a final written examination in March. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Whitehead. Anatomy II.âIn this course, given during the last ten weeks of the first year, the central nervous system is studied in some detail. The study begins with the spinal cord, its membranes, circulation, and gross anatomy. One complete spinal cord is given to each two students. This is followed by the microscopic study of sections from the more important spinal segments. The brain is then studied in a similar manner. In the gross study one entire brain is furnished to each two students, supplemented by transverse and sagittal sections. The microscopic sections consist of a transverse series extending from the pyramidal decussation to the head of the caudate nucelus, so arranged that each student will have at least twenty-five sections in series, thus affording sufficient continuity of structure. Great emphasis is attached to laboratory work, and the actual knowledge of the specimens studied. This is supplemented by recitations, lantern demonstrations, and occasional lectures. Dr. Byrnes. Anatomy III.âThis course is a continuation of Anatomy I, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. From October 1st through the second term of the second year. Dr.Byrnes. Histology.âThis course extends through the fall and winter terms. Laboratory work, upon which special stress is laid, occupies nine hours weekly, and is accompanied by a systematic course of lectures, study of a text-book, and frequent recitations. The student's record in the course will depend upon his recitations, laboratory drawing books, and final examination, both written and practical. The course aims to acquaint the student primarily with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied; and the relation of the whole subject of histology to pathology is never lost sight of. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. The laboratory is excellently equipped with microscopes, paraffin baths, microtomes, and various accessories essential to the most favorable presentation of this course. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Norford. Embryology.âThis course is given in the spring term. The laboratory work includes six hours a week, and is accompanied by lectures, recitations and study of models and text-books. It strives to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. The close correlation of obstetrics is recognized, and a correct knowledge of the fetus and its membranes is taught from the embryological approach. The course is made as practical as possible for the student and practitioner of medicine. It begins with a consideration of maturation phenomena, fertilization, segmentation, and the development of the germ-layers. This study is made chiefly upon the ova and early stages of an invertebrate, followed by a comparison in an amphibian. The chick is used for the primary relations of the systems to one another; and this is followed by the study of pig embryos, where each system is taken up separately and the organology and histogenesis of its parts are studied. Finally, the fetal membranes and their relations to the fetus and uterus are studied in their variations among the amniota. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Norford. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Hough. Mr. Purdum. Mr. Setzler. Mr. Vaiden. The course of study in this subject begins with the spring term of the first year and continues throughout the second year. It is divided as follows: Physiology 1: Physiological Chemistry.âGiven in the spring term of the first year. The fundamentals of physiological chemistry; especially the chemical structure, properties, and reactions of the more important compounds with which the student must deal in his subsequent studies of physiology. Instruction is given by lectures, recitations, and extensive laboratory work, for which ample facilities are provided. Practical laboratory tests during the course, as well as a written examination at the end, are required. A grade of 70 per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology 2. Open only to students who have attained a grade of 70 per cent. in Professor Bird's course in Organic Chemistry. Physiology 2.âFour hours weekly of lectures, recitations and demonstrations throughout the second year; six hours weekly of laboratory work throughout the first two terms. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition; excretion; the sense organs, and the central nervous system. The applications of physiology to personal hygiene are discussed in conferences. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work is as necessary to a clear record as the passing of final examinations. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of 70 per cent. in Histology and Physiological Chemistry. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Bunting. Dr. Brown. Bacteriology is taught as a laboratory subject during the fall term of the second year. In it the students are acquainted with the methods of the modern bacteriological laboratory, through their actual employment, and acquire a working knowledge of the more important pathogenic organisms. The laboratory is well equipped with the apparatus necessary for such a course. The practical laboratory work is supplemented by lectures and recitations on the general biology of bacteria, on their relation to infection and disease, and on immunity. PATHOLOGY. Professor Bunting. Dr. Brown. The course in Pathology is a direct continuation of the course in Bacteriology, instruction being given in it from the Christmas recess until the close of the year. Pathological Anatomy and Pathological Histology are taught in the laboratory by the study of gross and miscroscopic specimens following a descriptive lecture, and with personal demonstrations by the instructing staff. The principles of General Pathology which cannot be fully treated in the laboratory are considered in lectures and recitations throughout the course. The conduct of autopsies and the recording of results are taught in the post mortem service at the University Hospital. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of 80 per cent. in Histology. OBSTETRICS. Professor Macon. This subject is presented to the student by lectures, with frequent oral examinations, by a series of manikin demonstrations, by work with the living subject in the wards of the Hospital, and by attendance on patients in the out-patient obstetric service connected with the Dispensary. The manikin course forms an important part of the work not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor, and application of forceps. The class is divided into sections of five each, and a knowledge of the manikin work will form a part of the examination for graduation in this department. After a section has finished the manikin course, it is taken into the wards of the Hospital, where the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practised on the living subject. Each section is required to fill up a carefully prepared form, so that all the details of the case of the patient before labor is made familiar to the student. The number of out-patient cases is increasing year by year and is becoming an important part of the teaching. The clinical assistant in obstetrics is prepared at any time to accompany a student to the home of a patient, and is provided with the necessary armamentarium for conducting a case. The large negro population in the neighborhood of Charlottesville affords a class of patients which presents all the difficulties to clean work that are offered by ignorance and poverty. No better practice can be had for one who is trying to educate an "aseptic center." If asepsis can be secured in a hovel it can be preserved in a palace. The student is thus taught how to manage cases by himself and at the same time avoids falling into the slovenly habits he is sure to form without proper guidance. PHARMACOGNOSY. Professor Lambeth. The Department is provided with a good collection of drugs, both crude and prepared, with which the students are made familiar as dealt with in the lectures. Exercises in prescription-writing are given weekly for several months, these exercises being required both in the ordinary English or apothecary system and the French or metric system. The course is in part a laboratory course, students working in sections which vary in size according to the work in hand. The practical experience given is intended to acquaint the student as thorough with the physical and chemical properties of the materials used in the treatment of disease, to which he will find it much easier to add the physiological action, than if he had approached the subject first from the medical side. SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY. Professor Watts. Adjunct Professor Stone. THIRD YEAR. The course in Surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the class room work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the Principles and Practice of Surgery, Surgical Diseases, Surgical Diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialties, Orthopedics, Genito-urinary Surgery, etc. The laboratory work in the third year consists of a course in Surgical Pathology and another in Operative Surgery. The first deals with the gross and microscopic diagnosis of the more important surgical lesions. The operative work is done upon cadavers and the lower animals. In the case of the latter the operations, performed with all the technical care exercised in human surgery, teach anesthetization, the handling of living tissues, and the various operative procedures. The Dispensary course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia, and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. FOURTH YEAR. In the fourth year the instruction is carried on by clinics and bed-side demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take, make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available, and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offer many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting, witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. The course in Gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. In the third year the general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the dispensary affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. In the fourth year the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and recording of cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Davis. Adjunct Professor Flippin. Dr. Magruder. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching at the Dispensary and Hospital, during the third and fourth years. Nervous Diseases and Insanity are taken up in the fourth year, and in connection with them instruction in electro-therapeutics is given. The graduating class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division under daily instruction. The same plan is pursued with the students of the third year at the Dispensary three times a week. A practical examination in diagnosis and treatment is required of each student at the end of the fourth year. PEDIATRICS. Professor Davis. Dr. Rhea. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to an early age may be best encountered. The student is taught how to prepare food for infants. Instruction in the practical details of the subject will be given as far as possible by work at the Dispensary and in the wards of the Hospital. MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Lambeth. This course embraces not only the most important drugs of the last revision of the U. S. PharmacopÅia, but also such members of the newer materia medica as bid fair to become official. In addition to the physiological action of the drugs, stress is laid upon the chemistry of all active principles that may influence their administration or combination. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS. Adjunct Professor Flippin. The purpose of this course is to familiarize the student with modern laboratory methods as applied to the diagnosis of disease. The systematic examination of blood, sputum, vomitus, urine, fÃ¦ces, exudates, transudates and milk is first practiced; after which, specimens from selected cases in the wards of the Hospital are studied with reference to the application of information thus obtained to the recognition of specific diseases. THERAPEUTICS. Adjunct Professor Flippin. The subject of Therapeutics is taken up among the studies of the fourth year. The range of the work embraces both general and special therapeutics, whether rational or empirical, but a constant effort will be made throughout to trace those general underlying principles, the existence of which alone enables this subject to be called a science. The method pursued will be that of taking up in order the perversions of the various organs and functions rather than the specific forms of disease. DERMATOLOGY. Professor Davis. Dr. Garnett. A brief course of lectures is given on this subject embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical practice. At the Dispensary two clinics a week throughout the year are devoted to the diseases of the skin. The senior class is divided into sections for the work in this branch. After a brief review of the anatomic and histologic structure and of the physiology of the skin, the diseases most commonly met with are discussed. The clinical material available at the University Dispensary will be utilized to the best advantage to give the students a practical working knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of affections of the skin. DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT. Professor Hedges. Dr. Compton. In these subjects two lectures a week for the first half of the year will be given the fourth year class. The aim of the course will be to train the general practitioner in the diagnosis and treatment of such conditions as are met in daily practice,âthat he may not refer to a perhaps distant "specialist" cases which should be treated at home and that he may refer intelligently and promptly such cases as do need the attention of a specially trained worker. Clinics in the Dispensary will be held twice weekly throughout the session. Here students will be taught individually the uses of the ophthalmoscope, head-mirror, etc., and methods of diagnosis and treatment. Cases in the University Hospital will be demonstrated to small sections of the class at a time. HYGIENE. Professor Lambeth. The course begins with an historical sketch of the development of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of Hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air, and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with especial reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE AND TOXICOLOGY. Professor Mallet. In this course the general relations of medicine to law are discussed, and the duties and rights of the medical expert as a witness, with a study of the poisons most commonly needing attention in their chemical and physiological aspects. The other special branches of legal medicine and surgery are taken charge of by the other professors of the Medical Department, to whose chairs the several subjects are naturally most cognate. THE DISPENSARY. CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS. Dr. Davis. Dr. Magruder. Dr. Hedges. Dr. Flippin. Dr. Stone. Dr. Rea. Dr. Nelson. Dr. Garnett. Dr. Compton. Director of Dispensary, Dr. Stone. Resident Physician, Dr. Scott. Resident Pharmacist, Mr. Moore. Head Nurse, Miss Isla Bragg. The Dispensary has been renovated and newly equipped, so that it now affords the necessary facilities for conducting useful and scientific clinics. In the past about fifteen hundred cases have been treated annually, and this number should now increase. The students are divided into small sections, and are required to examine, record, treat, and follow each case that comes to the clinic. The work is done under the close personal supervision of the various instructors, and gives experience in handling patients which can only be obtained from actual practice. The work is divided as follows: General Medicine, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3 to 5 P. M. General Surgery and Gynecology, Genito-Urinary, Tuesday and Thursday, 3 to 5 P. M. Pediatrics; Dermatology; Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat, Tuesday and Saturday, 3 to 5 P. M. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. This Hospital is the property of the University, and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, devoted to the purposes of administration, and two wings. The administration building contains, on the main floor, reception and consultation rooms; an amphitheater and private operating rooms, with sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms attached, and an X-ray room. The upper floors furnish accommodation for the nurses of the training schools, while the basement contains the heating plant, laundry, kitchen, etc. From this building corridors in three stories lead out to the wards. These wards, having a capacity of about eighteen beds each, are beautifully lighted, have direct indirect hot-water radiators, and forced ventilation. Opening from each ward on the east is a large protected porch, of great value to convalescents. The south wing has been in use for several years; the new north wing, completed in 1907, gives the Hospital a capacity of about 120 beds. The equipment throughout is new, and conforms in all respects to the best usage of the day. During the past year the number of patients has steadily increased, and the range of influence of the Hospital has been greatly widened, patients being received from all parts of the State. Attention is particularly called to the fact that this hospital, with its associated dispensary, constitutes a valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Medical School. The variety of cases presented, and more especially the opportunities offered for a thorough study of the individual case, afford unusually satisfactory conditions for clinical instruction. HOSPITAL STAFF. Hospital Board: Drs. Whitehead, Davis, Watts, Hedges, Macon, Bunting, Flippin, Stone. Visiting Staff: The visiting staff consists of the Hospital Board and the Clinical Instructors in the Dispensary. Director of Hospital: Dr. Watts. House Surgeon: Dr. Lind. Assistant House Surgeons: Drs. Henry and Looney. Superintendent of Nurses: Miss Florence Besley. Head Nurse: Miss Isla Bragg. Dietician: Miss Grace Besley. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. This School was established in 1901, and its first class was graduated in June, 1903. Its aim is to give young women, desirous of acquiring the art of nursing, the same care and thorough training in their calling which is now afforded young men studying the science of medicine. Instruction in the primary branches of medicine is given to pupil nurses by the professors in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, while the clinical instructors at the University Hospital give lectures upon their respective courses. Three years is the required time for graduation, and all candidates must enter prepared to go through the full course of instruction and hospital training. Candidates for the school should apply in their own handwriting to the Superintendent of Nurses, University Hospital, Charlottesville, Va. These applications must be accompanied by certificates of good character, good health, and sufficient education to profit by the instruction offered. No candidate under twenty-one years of age, or over thirty-five, will be received. Pupil Nurses: Misses Elizabeth Baker, Caroline Bragg, Evelyn Mackreth, Georgia Nottingham, Caroline Watson, Myrtle Smith, Willie Morrow, Fannie Fry. There are seven probationers in the Fall Class.

It furnishes complete four-year courses leading to degrees in each of the four great divisions of EngineeringâCivil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Mining. Their common basis is the axiom that clear understanding and firm grasp of scientific principles furnish the only sure foundation for the labors of the modern scientific engineer. Their aim is to secure: First, thorough drill in Pure and Applied Mathematics, without which no engineer can justly pretend to a sound knowledge of his profession. Second, broad, accurate and thorough training in those Pure and Applied Sciences, of which rational engineering is simply the concrete expression. Third, adequate knowledge of the Special Elective Topics, which constitute the subject matter of each great division of Engineering Science. The methods of instruction employed to effect this aim are thorough, rational, and modern. The courses are given by the joint use of text-books and lectures. They are made objective by parallel practical courses in the drafting room, the shop, the laboratory and the field. They are enforced by daily oral examinations, by frequent written reviews, by copious exercises in drafting and computation, and by abundant illustration from experiments and specimens. At the end of each term the student's mastery of the course is tested by a rigid written examination, and his fitness for graduation is judged by the combined result of term work and examination grades. The object pursued throughout is to give to the thoughtful student an intelligent mastery of scientific method and with this aim in view certain departures have been made from the more ordinary routine processes of engineering education. The Drafting Exercises are not separated from and independent of the theoretical studies, designed to give merely a technical mastery of the draftman's tools. They run parallel with the lecture course, and are used to illustrate and enforce its lessons. Each problem assigned is made, if possible, an exercise not only in drawing but in design, and serves to cultivate power of analysis as well as manual skill. The Laboratory Exercises begin with the beginning of the Student's work and continue to the end. Like the drafting exercises they run parallel with the lecture course, or are the objective prelude to it. As far as is possible each student verifies for himself by actual tests and measurements the fundamental laws of engineering science. The Field-work is planned to secure in every candidate for a degree in Civil Engineering or in Mining Engineering thorough understanding of the standard field instruments and rapidity and precision in their use. It occupies the afternoon hours of both the Fall and Spring terms of the first two years. Students of Civil Engineering have also extended courses in railway surveying and location as part of their elective work. Students of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering are given a shorter course, occupying the afternoon hours of the Spring Term of the first year. The Shop-work is planned for engineers rather than for artisans. It aims to secure in every candidate for a degree in Mechanical or Electrical Engineering intelligent ideas as to the action of hand tools, the construction and uses of machine tools, and the characteristic properties of constructive materials. In executing the required exercises the student acquires not only a certain manual dexterity but sound conceptions of the meaning and necessity of precision in workmanship. It is deemed unwise, however, to divert the energy and interest of the student from the higher problems of his calling in the vain hope of making him a skilled mechanic. COURSES OF STUDY. The following condensed summary gives by title the various courses of study offered in the Engineering Department, arranged in an orderly curriculum of four years. Those courses, for which no special note is given, must be taken by all candidates for degrees. The special elective courses are in each case followed by a note, showing the degree for which they are required. The name of the professor and the lecture hour follow in brackets after each title; Arabic numbers are for lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; Roman for lectures on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the First Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programmes. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor his preliminary training has fitted him for the successful pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure.

The work of this course is designed for students who have satisfied the standard entrance requirements in Algebra and Geometry. Only students who have accomplished this amount of preparatory work will be admitted to it. Pure Mathematics 1. [Page, IX.] The Fall Term is given to a vigorous review of Solid Geometry, the Winter Term to Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, the Spring Term to Higher Algebra (Series, Determinants, Theory of Equations, and the Solution of Numerical Equations of the higher degrees). Numerous original exercises are set for solution. The class is subdivided into sections, so that every student receives constant and vigorous drill. Those who show defective preparation in the daily orals and monthly written tests are required to take extra review lessons with the instructors. The ordinary High School course in Solid Geometry is not an equivalent for the work of the Fall Term in this class. Students who venture to omit this often fail in Descriptive Geometry. Applied Mathematics 1. [Thornton, 10.] In this class the topics studied are Surveying, Mechanical Drawing, Descriptive Geometry, and Shades and Shadows and Perspective. In the Fall Term Mechanical Drawing and the construction, use and adjustment of the Level, the Transit, and the Compass are taught. In the Winter Term the time is given to Descriptive Geometry and the Theory of Computations of Surveying. In the Spring Term the work is on Shades and Shadows and Perspective, and on the more advanced topics of Stadia Surveying, Mine Surveying, City Surveying, and engineering methods for the determination of Latitude, Azimuth and Time. One lecture a week throughout the year is given to the Surveying. Chemistry 1. [Bird, X.] In this class the topics studied are the fundamental principles and the significant phenomena of Inorganic, Organic, and Physical Chemistry. The foundations of qualitative analysis are taught at appropriate places throughout the course. No previous study of chemistry is demanded; but for students who have received preliminary instruction in a chemical laboratory, exercises of a somewhat more advanced type are assigned. The engineering students are taught in a special section, the work of which has appropriate reference to engineering problems. Drawing 1. [West, 12â2.] In this course the student executes each week under the personal supervision of the instructor a plate 15 by 20 inches, the entire course consisting of thirty such plates. The work is first completely finished in pencil. It is then submitted to the instructor, who notes all errors whether of principle or technique, and returns the plate to the student for correction. After the plate has been corrected by the student and approved by the instructor, it is carefully finished in ink by the student and handed in for grading. The Fall Term is given to Mechanical Drawing, the Winter Term to Topographical Drawing, and the Spring Term to Shades and Shadows and Perspective Drawing. Shop-Work 1. Required for M. E. and E. E. [Instructors; Afternoon Hours.] The Fall Term is given to Wood-work, the Winter Term to Pattern-making. The class is divided into sections, each containing not over sixteen men. These are carefully drilled by competent instructors in the use of hand tools, the accurate execution of the standard joints used in construction, the use of the lathe, and the operation of the simpler machine-tools for wood-working. The principles of moulding are then taught, and the analysis of patterns and core boxes is carefully given. The student is then required to execute for himself a number of simple examples of typical patterns. In the Spring Term the class is broken up into squads of five men and each squad is carefully drilled in the use and adjustments of the most important field instruments and in Plane Surveying. Special attention is given to such exercises as are of peculiar interest and value to Mechanical and Electrical Engineers. Field-Work 1. Required for C. E. and E. M. [Instructors; Afternoon Hours.] The class is divided into squads of five men and each squad is placed in charge of a competent instructor. Careful individual drill is then given first in the setting up of the instruments, next in the use of the instruments for measurement of lengths, elevations, angles and azimuths. All the fundamental problems of Field Engineering are thus solved on the ground and the men are carefully taught the best methods of executing the surveys, keeping the notes, and reducing the observations. In the Fall Term the squads are practised in Leveling, Traversing, and Land Surveying. In the Spring Term they are taught the Location of Simple Curves, Slope-staking for Earthworks, and Topographical Surveying. In the Winter Term the time is given to instruction in Computation, in Platting surveys and profiles, and in the use of the Planimeter and of the Pantograph. At the end of each term a careful practical examination is given to every student on the adjustments and uses of the instruments employed in his work. SECOND YEAR COURSE. The necessary preparation for the successful pursuit of this course is the completion of the First Year Course, or its equivalent, and for students with only this amount of training the diligent study of Mathematics 2 is essential to progress in the other classes. Pure Mathematics 2. [Echols, 11.] The Fall Term is given to the Analytical Geometry of the point, the straight line, the circle, and the conic sections. During the Winter Term the study of the Differential Calculus is taken up with its applications to the geometry of the plane curves. In the Spring Term the Integral Calculus and its geometrical applications are studied. The methods of instruction are the same as in Mathematics 1. Numerous original exercises are set for solution and the progress of the student is constantly tested by oral examinations and by written reviews. Applied Mathematics 2. [Thornton. X.] The studies of this class furnish an introduction to Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The Fall Term is given to a course in General Mechanics, in which the fundamental doctrines of motion, force, and energy are developed and applied to the study of the simpler problems in the Statics and Dynamics of material particles and rigid bodies. In the Winter Term the general method of Graphical Statics is developed and applied to the study of the strength of materials and to the analysis of engineering structures. In the Spring Term a course is given in Hydrostatics in which the fundamental propositions concerning the equilibrium and pressure of fluids are carefully developed and applied to a series of important problems. The elementary principles of Hydraulics are also taught. Physics 1. [Hoxton, XI.] The Fall Term is devoted to the study of Experimental Mechanics and Sound. In the Winter Term the topics followed are Light and Heat. The Spring Term is given to an elementary course in Elec- tricity and Magnetism. The lecture course is paralleled by a carefully planned laboratory course of six hours per week, in which the student is taught the methods and routine of physical measurements and learns to verify for himself the great laws of experimental physics. Drawing 2. [West, XII-II.] The Fall Term in this course is given to Machine Drawing, the Winter Term to Graphical Statics, and the Spring Term to Structural Drawing and Design. The student executes each week under the direction of the instructor a plate 15 by 20 inches, the subjects being as far as possible so chosen as to illustrate and enforce the associated lecture courses. The entire course comprises thirty plates. Shop-Work 2. Required for M. E. and E. E. [Instructors; Afternoon Hours.] The Fall Term is given to the Machine Shop, the Winter Term to the Foundry. The preliminary exercises with hand tools for chipping, filing, and scraping are followed by careful instruction as to the construction of the engine lathe and practice in its use. The other machine tools of fundamental importance are then studied in the same way and practical exercises are given on the shaper, planer, drill press, milling machine, and grinding machine. In the Foundry the methods of tempering the sand, making moulds of green sand and of loam, and moulding and baking cores are then taught. Finally, each squad is practised in the management of the cupola and in taking off a heat. Field-Work 2. Required for C. E. and E. M. [Instructors; Afternoon Hours.] The methods of instruction are the same as these described in detail under Field-work 1. The exercises of the Fall Term include advanced problems in Curve Location, Stadia Surveying, and the Location of the True Meridian. In the Spring Term the squads are taught how to take observations for Latitude, Azimuth, and Time with the Complete Transit and with the Solar Transit, and are practised in the routine of Base Measurements and Triangulation, and in Barometric Leveling. The course terminates with a thorough practical examination on the adjustments and uses of the field instruments of the engineer. Mechanical Laboratory 1. [McKergow and Instructors; Afternoon Hours.] The class is divided into squads so small that each man receives the personal care of an instructor. The work of the Fall Term consists in a careful study of the standard methods for testing Hydraulic Cements. In the Winter Term a similar course is given in Timber Tests, with both small specimens and full sized beams. In the Spring Term the principal Metals used in Construction are taken up and tested for strength, elasticity and other important properties. THIRD YEAR COURSE. Only students who have a good working knowledge of the Calculus and of Mechanics are admitted to the studies of this year, and for these the work of Applied Mathematics 3 is an essential to success in the technical engineering courses. Applied Mathematics 3. [Thornton, IX.] The studies of this class constitute a more advanced course in Applied Mechanics. The Fall Term is given to Strength of Materials, the Winter Term to the Stability of Structures and the Spring Term to Hydraulics and Hydraulic Motors. Associated with the lecture courses are abundant practical exercises in computation and in laboratory measurements and stream gaugings. Economic Geology 1. [Watson, 12.] Required for C. E. and E. M. The studies of this class constitute a course in General Geology designed to meet the especial needs of the Engineering student. The divisions of Dynamical, Structural, and Physiographical Geology are covered in considerable detail. Special emphasis is given to the instruction on the common rock-forming minerals and rocks, building stones and ores. Three lectures are given each week, with nine additional hours for laboratory and field work and private study. To gain the full benefit of this course some preliminary knowledge of Physical Geography is essential. Students of Civil and Mining Engineering are advised to devote the Summer Vacation of the Second Year to a thorough review of this important topic. Physics 2. [Hoxton, 10.] Required for E. E. This course is a more advanced study of Electricity and Magnetism. It is based on the lessons of Physics 1, and requires also such knowledge of the calculus as is given in Pure Mathematics 2. The Fall Term is devoted to the theory and practice of Electrical Measurements, the Winter Term gives a conspectus of the Mathematical Theory of Electricity, and in the Spring Term the work is upon Magnetic Induction and its measurement and applications. The laboratory course runs parallel with the lecture course and is so arranged as to give a good working knowledge of the theoretical problems met in the practice of the Electrical Engineer. Civil Engineering 1. [Newcomb, 11.] Required for C. E. The Fall Term is given to Railway Engineering. The methods of the reconnaissance, preliminary survey, office location, and field location are developed in the lectures and illustrated in the field, a complete series of maps, profiles, plans, and estimates being worked out from the actual surveys. This is followed by a minute study of the construction, maintenance, and operation of a modern railway. In the Winter Term the standard types of Steel and Timber Bridges are analyzed; the rules and formulae for design are developed and applied; and each student makes a complete design for a bridge with all the necessary computations and drawings. In the Spring Term the topics studied are Public Roads, City Streets, and Street Railways. The most improved methods of construction are discussed and the students are drilled in the laboratory on the best tests for road-building materials. Mechanical Engineering 1. [McKergow, XII.] Required for M. E. In the Fall Term the dynamical and thermodynamical problems of the Steam Engine are studied and the results are applied to the detailed design of a projected engine. The Winter Term is devoted to Machine Design; the fundamental principles of the kinematics of machines are established and on these is based a careful study of the design and construction of toothed gearing, pulley gearing, shafting, geared machine parts, and the fastenings for the same. In the Spring Term the topic is Steam Boilers. All standard types are studied in detail and the problems of the operation and management of boiler plants are discussed. Parallel work is required in the drafting room, the laboratories, and the shops. Electrical Engineering 1. [Holladay, 11.] Required for E. E. and M. E. The work of the Fall Term includes the fundamental principles of Electrical Engineering and their application to the theory of Direct Current Machines, with parallel laboratory exercises. The Winter Term is devoted to the design and operation of Direct Current Generators and Motors; the student at the same time determines in the laboratory the characteristics and constants of such machines. The Spring Term is used for a preliminary survey of the principles of Alternating Currents and their chief technical applications, with laboratory studies of Alternating Current apparatus and machines. Analytical Chemistry 1. [Dunnington, X.] Required for E. M. A course in Chemical Manipulation is first given. The class then takes up in order Blowpipe Analysis, the Fire Assaying of Ores of Lead and Gold and Silver, and a systematic study of Inorganic Qualitative Analysis. This is followed by practice in the analysis of salts, alloys, and ores; the determination of minerals; the examination of waters, coals, limestones, clays, and so on; and a few of the simpler quantitative determinations. Weekly written exercises are required. Three lectures are given each week, and after every lecture the student spends about four hours in practical work in the laboratory. Mechanical Laboratory 2. [McKergow and Instructors, 12-2.] As in Mechanical Laboratory 1 the class is divided into squads so small that each man receives the personal care of an instructor. The Fall Term is given to an advanced course in the Strength of Materials, the problems assigned being such as to call for some elementary research work on the part of the student. The Winter Term is devoted to a laboratory course in Hydraulic Measurements, in which tests are made of pressure, buoyancy, efflux and pipe flow with various practical applications. In the Spring Term a field course is given in Hydrographic Surveying, including the measurements of surface grades, cross-sections and velocities in river channels and the determination of discharges, friction factors, and velocity coefficients. FOURTH YEAR COURSE. To the studies of this year only those men are admitted who have completed the required work in Pure Mathematics and have a good knowledge of Mechanics. Courses 2 and 3 in Applied Mathematics are essential for success in the technical engineering courses. Applied Mathematics 4. [Thornton, 9.] This course constitutes a complete survey of Analytical Mechanics. The Fall Term is given to Analytical Statics, the Winter Term to the Dynamics of a Particle, the Spring Term to the Dynamics of a Rigid Body. For illustrative material use is made not only of such classical topics as harmonic motion, projectile motion, planetary motion, meteoric motion, motion in resisting media and so on; but examples are taken also from engineering practice in the Kinematics of Machines, the Dynamics of the Steam Engine, the Balancing of Single and Coupled Engines, and others of the great problems of scientific engineering. Chemistry 2. [Mallet, 3.] This course in Industrial Chemistry is concerned with the application of chemistry to the arts and manufactures. Among the topics discussed are the metallurgy of iron, steel, copper, tin, aluminum, and the precious metals; the manufacture of limes and cements, bricks, artificial stones, and other building materials; the chemistry of explosives, lubricants, paints, and other preservatives. The lectures are copiously illustrated by charts and drawings and by specimens furnished from an extensive and costly Museum of Industrial Chemistry. Economic Geology 2. [Watson, 1.] Required for E. M. This course deals specifically with Economic Geology, the course in Economic Geology 1 or an equivalent being prerequisite. It is designed to give a general but comprehensive account of the origin, distribution and uses of the metallic and non-metallic products of the earth, with especial reference to those of the United States. Three lectures are given each week and nine additional hours are allowed for laboratory work, field surveys, collateral reading, and private study. Civil Engineering 2. [Newcomb, XI.] Required for C. E. Masonry Construction is studied in the Fall Term. The materials used, the methods of inspection and testing, the standard specifications for the work, and the analysis and design of walls, piers and arches are minutely discussed. The methods for the construction of foundations are thoroughly studied; and the design and execution of works in reenforced concrete receive adequate attention. In the Winter Term the topics are Water-works and Sewers. The collection, purification, conveyance, and distribution of city water supplies are discussed. The problems of city sewerage and sewage disposal are also carefully investigated. The Spring Term is given to a study of Long Span Bridges. The more intricate designs of simple trusses are examined and the cantilever bridge, the steel arch, the continuous girder, and the swing bridge are analyzed. Each student is required to work out the stress sheets and the general drawings for some specified type of long span bridge. Mechanical Engineering 2. [McKergow, I.] Required for M. E. The Fall Term begins with a review of the principles of hydraulics and applies them to a thorough study of the design and construction of such Hydraulic Machines as presses, pumps, motors, and hydraulic power transmissions. The subject of the Winter Term is Mechanical Power Plants; the location of such plants, the choice of units, and the lay-out are discussed, and one or more typical plants designed. The Spring Term is given to Locomotive Engineering, and studies the operation, performance, construction, and design of steam locomotives; special attention being given to the balance of the machine and to the valve gears. Electrical Engineering 2. [Holladay, XI.] Required for E. E. The Fall Term is given to a more advanced study of Alternating Current Phenomena as they present themselves in Transformers, Induction Motors, Alternators, Synchronous Motors, and Rotary Converters. In the Winter Term the phenomena of Electric Transmissions for Light and for Power at both high and low voltages are studied, together with electric incandescent and are lamps and their photometry. The Spring Term is devoted to Electric Traction including the study of motor capacity and design, train performance, controllers, brakes, power houses, sub-stations, transmission, rolling stock, roads, and the economics of the electric railway. The laboratory exercises run parallel with the lectures through the entire course. Mining Engineering. [Thornton, I.] Required for E. M. The topics studied are in the Fall Term the Exploitation of Mines; included are the principles to be observed in prospecting; the opening of the mine; the extraction of the mineral; timbering and lighting; mine explosions and other accidents; mine surveys and maps and plans: in the Winter Term Mining Machinery; including the central power plant and power transmission; the machinery for haulage hoisting, drainage, and ventilation; and for hydraulic mining, quarrying and ore dressing: in the Spring Term the uses of Electricity in Mining for power, light, and signaling. Thesis Work. Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the Professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, 8 by 10Â½ inches, bound in a proper cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25th. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. DRAFTING ROOMS, SHOPS, AND FIELD INSTRUMENTS. The material equipment of the University of Virginia for practical instruction in engineering studies is abundant and excellent. The policy, steadily followed in assembling it, has been to purchase only what was of the best quality and best adapted for the purposes of the zealous and intelligent student. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The classes of the First and Second years execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructor in Drawing. The more advanced students have such drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as a powerful and indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. The Shop Equipment is throughout of the best quality, the machines being all from good makers and of sizes ample for the purposes of instruction. A full outfit of hand tools is maintained at all times. Each shop is equipped for the instruction of a squad of sixteen students, this being as large a number as one instructor can properly direct at once. The Machine Shop is provided with four first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal drilling machine (Brown and Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, and so on. The Wood Shop is furnished with several small lathes, a large pattern maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern making. The Foundry has a cupola furnace for working cast iron, a brass furnace, a core oven, and all needful accessories for moulding and casting; the blast for the cupola is furnished by a special blower, driven by a small high-speed steam engine. The Forge Room is equipped with Buffalo down-draft forges; and the necessary smith's tools; the draft is furnished by the same blower, and the exhaust is operated by a fan driven also by the engine. Shop instruction is given for its educational value. The purpose of this Department is to train engineers, not artisans; and the claims of the shops are not permitted to infringe on the truly vital functions of the laboratories, the drafting rooms, and the lectures. The outfit of Field-Instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for railway topography; a plane table; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of levelling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic work and hydrographic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field-instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. A polar planimeter is provided for facilitating such estimates and a pantagraph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. ENGINEERING LABORATORIES. The Sinclair Laboratory for work in Strength of Materials.âThis was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains Riehle and Olsen machines, each of 100,000 pounds capacity, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000 inch pounds capacity; an Olsen compression machine of 40,000 pounds capacity; a Ewing tester for the elasticity of rods; hand machines for testing rods and wires and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads; Fairbanks and Olsen cement testers of 1,000 pounds capacity each; apparatus for torsional tests on both long wires and short wires; together with the necessary accessory apparatus for utilizing these machines. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and all other necessary apparatus for minor tests, it contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Double Bridge, the Magnetic Induction apparatus, the Duddell Oscillograph, the Station Photometer, and so on. It contains also a number of direct current generators and motors, a two-phase alternator, induction motors of two and three phases, several pairs of transformers, and all the apparatus used in testing such machines. The Steam Engine Tests are made on the high-speed Ball engine, which operates the shops. This motor has been specially equipped for the purpose. It receives steam from the main line through a Sweet separator; humidity determinations are thus made twiceâonce by a separating calorimeter before the steam enters the separator, and again by a throttling calorimeter as it enters the cylinder. It is fitted with proper indicators, and permanent indicator rigging so that at any time cards may be taken and the indicated horse-power determined. In like manner a rope friction brake is so arranged that it may be at once applied for the determination of brake horse-power. Connections are so made with a Wheeler surface condenser that the engine may at will be operated either condensing or non-condensing. Provisions are made for measuring the temperatures and the amounts of the condensation water and the condensed steam produced during the run. With these data a complete heat balance of the experimental run is attainable. For Steam Boiler Tests the boilers of the University heating and lighting plant are available. The department is equipped with the necessary apparatusâthermometers, gauges, steam calorimeters, fuel calorimeters, gas analyzers, scales, tanks, and so on. Students of Mechanical Engineering are taught by practical lessons in the boiler room the standard methods for boiler trials, and the class makes each session at least one complete trial. The Gas Engine Tests are made on an Otto machine of 15 I. H. P. and 12 B. H. P. This also is provided with its friction brake, indicator rigging, and indicator. The cooling water is run in from calibrated tanks and provision is made for observing not only its amount but the initial and final temperatures. Gasolene or alcohol is used as fuel, and is run in from a graduated wrought-iron bottle, so that the amount consumed is determined. The heating power is obtained by an independent test with a Rosenhain calorimeter. Samples of the burnt gases are drawn from the exhaust pipe and analyzed in an Orsat gas apparatus. The temperature of the exhaust will be determined by a platinum resistance thermometer inserted close to the exhaust valve. With these data and the observed numbers of revolutions and explosions the heat balance is worked out. The Refrigerating Tests are made on a Remington Ice Machine of one ton capacity. This is an ammonia compression machine driven by an electric motor. Instead of brine, plain water is used, heated by a steam jet to 100Â° and then cooled down to 40Â° by the machine. A run is first made with the pipes empty in order to determine the friction horse power. The ammonia is then turned on and the run is made under load. In both cases the power consumed is measured both by watt-meter and by ammeter and volt-meter readings. The tanks are accurately calibrated and careful measurements of the temperature are made through the run. Indicator cards are also taken from the ammonia cylinders and the number of revolutions is registered by counter. With these data the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the machine are figured out. In the Road Material Tests the machines used are mainly those devised by Dr. Logan Waller Page, director of the United States office of public roads. For measuring the strength of the stone cylindrical samples are cut out with a diamond drill and tested under impact and in the 40,000-pound compression machine. The resistance to abrasion is measured on fragments of the stone, rotated in heavy cast iron cylinders mounted on their diagonals. The binding power of the dust is measured by impact tests on cylindrical briquettes formed under heavy hydraulic pressure. The dust for these briquettes is produced in a ball mill fed with fine stone broken in a small crusher. This part of the testing outfit has been only recently installed, largely by the generous aid of Dr. Page. It is hoped that useful experimental researches on the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia may be carried out with it. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of the three adjunct-professors; the main lecture room; the laboratory of electrical engineering; and the drafting room for the First and Second Year students. Above are a smaller drafting room for advanced students, and blueprint and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are another class room, the testing laboratory, the wood shop, the metal shop, apparatus and store rooms, the tool room, and the students' lavatory. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant this contains the foundry and the forge room. The boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Laboratory of General Chemistry, situated at the southern end of West Range, is one of the older buildings recently remodelled and fitted up for the work of instruction in undergraduate chemistry. It is furnished with all the necessary apparatus and supplies, and is comfortably heated and lighted. The Engineering students, who are taught in a separate section, have three hours in lecture each week and six hours in the laboratory. The work is specially adapted to their needs. The Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry is 150 by 60 feet. It is a single-story building, containing the lecture room, the laboratory of analytical chemistry, the rooms for assaying, the balance rooms, the offices and private laboratories of the professors of Industrial and Analytical Chemistry, and a number of store rooms. These contain not only the usual laboratory supplies, but an extensive collection of specimens, illustrating very completely the processes and products of industrial chemistry, and of especial interest to engineering students. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture rooms and the Botanical and ZoÃ¶logical collections; these are soon to be transferred to another building and the space utilized for the new laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the store room for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and numerous smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The expenses of a student of Engineering will vary slightly with his year of residence, largely with his personal habits. The following estimates presuppose a reasonable economy, equally removed from parsimony on the one hand and from profusion on the other. They may be somewhat reduced by strict economy. They may be largely and disastrously augmented by extravagance. The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course of the Engineering Department will be: University Fee $ 40 Department Fee (average of four years) 70 Living Expenses (for nine months) 225 Books and Drawing Materials 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 Total for outside students $400 Deduction for Virginians 45 Total for Virginians $355 Strict economy may reduce the living expenses from $25 a month, as estimated above, to $18 or $20, and may take off something also from incidental expenses. A more liberal estimate will increase them by about the same amount. We should thus have the following average annual allowances: ANNUAL ALLOWANCES. MIN. MEAN. MAX. Outside students $320 $400 $480 Virginians 275 355 435 These estimates are exclusive of clothing and traveling expenses, items which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The University Fee of $40 is paid by every student. It entitles the student to the free use of the Library, and of the Gymnasium; to the advice and direction of the Instructor in Physical Culture; to free medical advice and attendance by the Health Officers of the University; to the facilities of the University Hospital in case of need; and it covers all fees for examinations, diplomas, and degrees. The Department Fee is $90 for the First Year course, $75 for the Second, $60 for the Third, $55 for the Fourth, and thus averages $70. It covers the tuition and laboratory fees for all the classes (except Analytical Chemistry). It entitles the student also to take over again without additional charge any single course of the previous year which he may have failed to complete. But students, who fail in two or more of the courses of any year, are required to pay the fee of that year and take those courses over. Only students who follow the regular programme of studies are granted the reduced department fee. Virginians are entitled to free tuition in the Academical Schools, and are therefore allowed a deduction of $45 a year. The item of Living Expenses includes board, lodging, fuel, lights, servant, and laundry. A fair average allowance is $25 a month. Severe economy may reduce it to $18. Ample generosity would place it at $32, but no higher. The Books, Drawing Instruments, Drawing Materials and Stationery will cost about $80 for the four-year course, an average of $20 a year. It is wise economy for the young engineer to buy good instruments and to collect during his college life a few good books, as the nucleus of his professional library. The Incidental Expenses of the student ought to be kept within modest bounds. The allowances made above are liberal enough. Large expenditures as a rule promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. The items payable at entrance are the University Fee of $40, the Department Fee, and a Contingent Deposit of $10 to cover library fines and damage to apparatus, if such should occur. The last item is credited in the student's final settlement with the Bursar. The First Year Student of Engineering should bring with him about $200 to meet these charges and cover the initial payments for books, instruments, room, furniture, board, and so on. COURSES AND EXPENSES OF SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for admission to the Engineering Department, who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants are then registered as Special Students, and are admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. The Expenses of special students, and of all students who pursue elective courses, are the same as those of regular students, except as to fees for tuition. The fee for each class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 for each class in Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics; $10 for Inorganic Chemistry. For Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuiton, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. Under the general elective plan of this University, many young men, who cannot afford to take the regular four-year course, qualify themselves by such special elective studies for highly successful professional careers. Any student, who possesses a good working knowledge of Pure Mathematics, including the processes of the Differential and Integral Calculus, and some acquaintance with the Natural Sciences, may attempt with success the following shorter course in Engineering: First Year.âApplied Mathematics 1 and 2. Engineering 1. Second Year.âApplied Mathematics 3 and 4. Engineering 2. Upon its completion he receives a diploma of graduation in Applied Mathematics and Engineering. No student, who is deficient in mathematics, will be allowed to enter upon this special course. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other colleges will be admitted provisionally to advanced standing as candidates for a degree in Engineering upon presentation of proper certificates covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean, and must be acceptable both to him and to the professors in charge of the accredited courses. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should not fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such a certificate is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. No credits will be given for advanced standing based on High School Work in the sciences. Credits on Practical Work will be allowed to applicants, who have accomplished successfully courses in Drawing, Field-work, or Shop-work equivalent to those given in this University, or have acquired in professional practice the training which these courses represent. To secure credit for such work the student must make written application to the Dean of the Department, and with this application must file the certificate of the chief draftsman or other officer under whom the work was done. In default of such a certificate, which must be acceptable both to the Instructor and to the Dean, the student may take and pass a practical examination on each course for which he seeks exemption from regular attendance. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Written Examinations are held at the end of each term covering the work of that term and the results of these examinations, combined with the student's class standing, give his Term Grade. The Regular Reports sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian state for each course followed the term grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the Professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully, and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the Faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. Reexaminations are held during registration week in September. To these reexaminations the Faculty will admit, on the recommendation of his professor, any student of the previous session who in any course fell below the pass mark of seventy-five per cent., but made at least sixty-five per cent. at the regular examination. For every such reexamination the student must pay to the Bursar on or before July 15th a fee of $5, which fee is in no case returnable. The student who fails in any course and does not make up his deficiency on reexamination will be required to register anew for that course and attend the lectures and pass the regular examination, unless relieved by special vote of the Faculty. The Dean will send to every student eligible for reexamination a programme of the dates of the September examinations. PROGRAMME OF EXAMINATIONSâ1908-1909.

The Department of Agriculture is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va.; this sum having been given to establish a fund, the income of which should be applied, as far as practicable, to the maintenance of experiments in agriculture, training in the art of farming, and instruction in those sciences which underlie that art, as well as in their practical relations thereto. Since the income in question is manifestly inadequate to provide for all these important ends in an efficient manner, it has become necessary for those directly charged with its administration to decide how it can be most usefully applied within the limits indicated. Agriculture is the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit; as usually applied, the term implies the successful raising and marketing of crops of plants or of animals, or of their products. Its theory is based directly upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy; and also, but less directly, upon the allied sciences of Physics, Mechanics, and Geology. Education adapted to the prosecution of this vocation calls, therefore, at the outset, for sound and thorough instruction in these sciences; and subsequently for the discussion of its principles and processes as based upon them. The experience of some years has shown conclusively that neither agricultural experimentation nor instruction in the routine of farm work can be profitably conducted here with the means at command; nor is such application of these means in accordance with the needs or expressed desires of students who come to the University for the purpose of entering this Department. It seems wisest, therefore, as well as most consonant with the other functions of the University, to apply the income of this fund to the enlargement, as far as possible, of the opportunities here afforded to those who desire to acquire a knowledge of the sciences on which the art of agriculture is based, and of which it is the practical application; to understand their theoretical principles, as well as their economic relations; and to be capable of following their progress in all its bearings. Instruction is therefore offered in this Department to all who desire such training in the descriptive and experimental sciences as this would imply, together with a knowledge of the closely affiliated mathematical sciences, and of the modern languages of immediate importance to the scientific student; in accordance with the following plan: Required for Entrance Upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue. Based upon this preparation the degree of Bachelor of Science will be conferred upon students who satisfactorily complete one B. S. course each in General Biology, Botany, Physics, General Chemistry, ZoÃ¶logy, Geology, and Analytical Chemistry; together with an advanced course in each of any two of the Schools represented by these courses; of one B. S. course (to be elected by the student) from the group of mathematical sciences, viz., Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Astronomy; and of the B. S. courses in French and German. The B. S. courses are the same as, or the equivalent of, the B. A. courses described in a previous portion of this catalogue; the advanced courses in the various scientific Schools have also been previously described. Agricultural Chemistry.âThere is offered in connection with the graduating course in Analytical Chemistry a course of lectures in Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils, and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life so far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and of fungicides and insecticides. This course is open without charge to students who have registered in Analytical Chemistry, to Virginia students, and to farmers who are not matriculated students. For Reference: Johnston's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, 17th Edition; London, 1894. In addition to the courses in Biology described in a previous portion of this catalogue, there is offered in the School of Biology and Agriculture the following course, which provides for the discussion of the relation of the biological sciences to the art of Agriculture: Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the bacterial and fungous diseases of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic ZoÃ¶logy (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). The topics discussed in such a course will be, to some extent, selected in accordance with the objects in view of those electing it in any year. The following literature will indicate a possible arrangement of subjects. Text-Books for 1907-1908.âSorauer's Physiology of Plants (Weiss tr.); Tubeuf's Diseases of Plants induced by Cryptogamic Parasites (Smith tr.); Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals (Fleming tr.); Vorhee's Principles of Agriculture. Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete the courses in Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, and Comparative Anatomy, and also the course in Practical Biology and Agriculture above described. In this Department, as in the College, the order in which studies shall be taken is left largely to the discretion of the student (subject to the restriction that not more than three classes may be undertaken in any one session without the consent of the Faculty): the following is, however, suggested as a convenient arrangement of a four years' course for this degree; and as one of several combinations of subjects possible under the requirements above stated. First Year: Geology 1B; Physics 1B; Biology 1B; Second Year: French 2B; General Chemistry 1B; Biology 2; Third Year: German 3; Analytical Chemistry 1; Biology 3; Fourth Year: * * Substitution may be made of either Pure Mathematics 2B or Astronomy 1B for Mechanics; each of these three courses requires the previous completion of Mathematics 1A. Mechanics 1B; â  â  Substitution may be made for either of these advanced courses by advanced courses in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Geology. Analyt. and Agri. Chem. 2; â  Agriculture 1. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Agriculture may be estimated at from $290 a year upwards, according to the mode of living. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia students are entitled to free tuition, may be found in a preceding section. (See pp. 91-95.) MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. A scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the candidate who at that time passes the graduation examinations in the B. S. courses of General Biology, Chemistry, and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for the following two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department of Agriculture. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious dilligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure. Candidacy should be announced at the beginning of the session. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. JOHN SHELTON PATTON, Librarian. ANNA SEELEY TUTTLE, B. A., Assistant Librarian. JAMES GIBSON JOHNSON, M. A., Assistant. MARSHALL SCOTT FINK, Assistant. JOHN WALTER WAYLAND, Ph. D., Hertz Librarian. The General Library is open daily from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m., and from 3 to 5 p. m., and 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains more than sixty thousand volumes, and books are available for use by the officers and students and some others under the following regulations: 1. Books of the Reference Collection are not to be removed from the Library, but may be freely consulted at the tables. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. Books in current use in connection with the courses of instruction will be temporarily placed on the shelves of the Reference Collection, and will then be subject to the above rule. Works of special value or specially liable to injury on account of their rarity, illustrations, etc., are not to be removed from the Library, except by permission. New periodicals cannot be borrowed within two weeks after they are placed on the shelves. 2. The Librarian is required to make an entry of every book removed from the Library with the time when the same is to be returned. 3. Students may borrow books upon the following terms: No student can have more than three volumes at the same time. Each book must be returned by the borrower within two weeks from the date of its withdrawal. The loan may be renewed unless another person entitled to the books has signified his need of it. Ten cents a volume will be charged for each day that a volume remains unreturned after the two weeks for which it was withdrawn. 4. Members of the Faculty have at all times free use of the Library within its walls, and borrow books under the following regulations: Each book borrowed is to be presented to the Librarian to be charged to the borrower. Each book borrowed is understood to be taken out for a period not exceeding one month, but this time may be extended unless the Librarian notify the borrower that some one else desires the book. Not more than two volumes at any time may be borrowed for the use of any other person than the professor himself, and the Librarian is always to be notified at the time of borrowing that the book is not for individual use. 5. All books borrowed from the Library must be returned and on the shelves by the fifth day before the close of each session. 6. The Librarian may permit persons residing at the University for the purpose of studying during the vacation to use the Library, with the approval of the President, and under the above general regulations, but at such hours as may be specially arranged for, on condition that each such person pay to the Librarian a fee of $3 and make a contingent deposit of $15, against which may be assessed any charges for loss or injury of books. 7. The Librarian is charged with the general duty of maintaining order in the Library, preserving the room and its contents from damage and reporting to the Bursar any fines and penalties which may have to be enforced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. PHYSICAL CULTURE: RELIGIOUS WORK: LITERARY SOCIETIES: ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS: INDEX. PHYSICAL CULTURE. WILLIAM ALEXANDER LAMBETH, M. D., Ph. D., Director of the Gymnasium. HENRY HADEN LANNIGAN, Associate Director of Athletics. HERBERT MASSEY PECK, Instructor in Physical Training. The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficacy; for, however, valuable any system may be, it cannot be maintained in its entirely without the consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical conditions, and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encouraged in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury or inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the University, are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of the various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. The Faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the University athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical conditions by making the following strength tests when deemed necessary, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletic Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room, and the various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the bathsâneedle, shower, spray, tub, and plungeâsupplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms, and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other University duties. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, a part of which has been laid out into a driving park, set with trees and hedges, containing the site for the proposed Athletic Clubhouse. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained, and fenced for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A grand stand and bleacher have been erected, each seating a thousand persons. The work of turfing, protection, and decoration is going steadily on, and will, it is estimated, cost ten thousand dollars more. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercises, while giving to the student, as far as possible, entire liberty of management: a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the University athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University acting in his stead and by his request) and with the approbation of the Director. 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the Athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacation and holidays. 4. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any minor faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 6. Before any student can become a member or substitute member of any athletic team in the University and take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and secure the endorsed approval of the committee to his application. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is an unconditionally registered student of the University. 7. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, and it shall be the duty of the applicant to appear before the Committee and answer on his honor such questions as the Committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee, before it endorses an application, to require a pledge in writing of the applicant certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who has been a member or a substitute member of a football or baseball team of another college or university shall be permitted to become a member of either team of this University during his first session; but in no case shall such student be eligible for these teams at this University unless he shall have been a student here at least five months. The above provision shall also apply to all students who enter this University without entrance certificate or examination.* * This rule goes into effect September, 1908. It does not, however, apply to such students as entered this University under our previous "five months' residence rule." 10. No person whose name appears in the catalogue list of officers of instruction and administration of the University, and who receives remuneration therefrom shall be a member of any athletic team representing the University. 11. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish, on request, a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 12. No "coach," not an alumnus, and no "trainer," not an officer of the University, shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this University.â  â  The Faculty Committee on Athletics may permit the employment of coaches other than alumni for a period not exceeding two weeks for any one individual during any one season. But in no case shall such coach be in responsible charge of the team. 13. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is authorized and instructed to establish a maximum period after which a player on a team representing any branch of athletic sport at this or any other University or college shall be ineligible to become a member of any athletic team of this University. 14. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible charge of the details of the Athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the Code of Rules adopted by this Faculty. 15. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose. REGULATIONS OF FACULTY COMMITTEE ON ATHLETICS. 1. "Training Tables" for football, baseball and track teams are hereby abolished. 2. No student of this University shall be eligible for any athletic team who shall have played upon, or been a member or substitute member of any of the professional or league teams named in Classes A, B, C, and D, in the publication of the American Sports Company. To the list of professional teams thus proscribed shall be added all league teams in any State or States, which the leading University of such State or States declares professional and from which it debars its own players. 3. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning Athletics is hereby interpreted to mean any college named in Table 28 of the Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education of 1902, which has not less than 150 male students of collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this University. In case such faculty fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the President of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official decision of the members belonging to each head. 4. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 5. The term "general conformity," as used in the Faculty Regulations, is interpreted to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing. 6. The maximum period of eligibility for baseball and football shall be four years. In estimating the period of eligibility the years of baseball and football shall both be taken into account; but in no case shall a player be charged with four years athletic work, unless at least four calendar years have elapsed from the time he entered upon his first intercollegiate contest, omitting from the calculation any sessional intermission by non-attendance. In case the player does not participate in either baseball or football during a college session, such session shall not be counted, but if such player does play on either the baseball or the football team during any intermediate session, this shall count as if the player had played on both teams during such session. College Topics is a weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association, devoted to the interests of Athletics and the University at large. Editor-in-Chief for 1907-1908. William Harris Gaines, Jr. RELIGIOUS WORK. I. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, Incorporated. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association, founded in 1858, is the largest student organization in the University, and is the oldest student Young Men's Christian Association in existence. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.âThe distinctive work of the Association consists in promoting individual study of the Bible and Foreign Missions by means of small classes under student leaders, in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night at seven thirty o'clock, in assisting, through some of its members, the work of the Churches and Sunday Schools in the vicinity of the University, in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters, and in promoting social intercourse among the students by means of lectures, entertainments, and other social events. The English Bible.âThe Young Men's Christian Association offers the following courses in Bible Study, open to all students: Studies in the Life of Christ. Studies in the Acts and the Epistles. Studies in Old Testament characters. Studies in the Teaching of Jesus and His Apostles. These courses, arranged by the International Committee of Young Men's Christian Associations, are intended to form a four years' cycle of study, and are conducted by student leaders. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses one of the handsomest and most conveniently arranged college association buildings in the world, which was recently erected at a cost, including furnishings, etc., of about $75,000. The students, alumni, and friends of the University have subscribed an endowment fund of nearly $20,000 for the maintenance of the property. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. It contains editorial rooms for the college periodicals, game rooms, kitchen, club room, exercise room, elaborate bathing facilities, reception room, reading room, meeting room, parlor, office, writing room, auditorium, guest room, bed rooms for the secretaries, and rooms for the Bible and Missionary departments of the Association. A full equipment of current literature for the reading room, and a library of nearly a thousand volumes of the best religious works and fiction, have been donated by a member of the Dodge family. The tennis courts, nineteen in number, for the use of the students of the University, are on the Association grounds immediately in the rear of the building, and form one of the most beautiful tennis fields in the country. Help for New Students.âThe Association publishes during the last week of August a Handbook of useful information concerning the University and community, and also a detailed report of the religious work of the session. The General Secretary will gladly send either of these publications, or give any further information desired, upon application of any prospective student. New students are requested to come direct from the trains to Madison Hall, where the Association conducts a general Information Bureau, including a complete boarding house register, a directory of the students, and a list of all forms of employment open to students. The boarding house list, with locations and prices, is not made up till the first week in September. It is suggested that new students arrive a day or two before the session opens, so that they may choose a boarding place for themselves and get well settled before their work begins. All correspondence with regard to rooms in the University dormitories should be directed to the Bursar. Membership.âThe membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate; any member of an evangelical church, who wishes to take some part in the work of the Association, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member. The annual fee is $2.00 for all members, an extra charge being made for the use of the baths and tennis courts. Indorsement.âThe Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the University. II. CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the University consist of the regular preaching services in the Chapel on Sunday morning and evening, which are conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent States. The general oversight of the Christian work is entrusted to the Association Secretary. All the details of this plan, which takes the place of the chaplain system used in former years, are entrusted to a Committee on Religious Exercises composed of five members of the Faculty. The list of the University preachers for the year 1907 is given on page 28. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies of long standingâthe Jefferson and the Washington Societyâconnected with the University. They hold weekly meetings in their respective halls and give exhibitions of public speaking at intervals during the session and at its close. There is an annual contest during the session between the two Societies for the Harrison Trophy. The Society winning this trophy retains it until it is re-captured by the other Society. Each Society offers several medals for excellence in debate and oratory. The Debating Union is an organization composed of the Washington and the Jefferson Literary Societies. The purpose of the organization is to conduct at least two debates each session with other colleges or universities situated in the Middle or Southern States. During the session of 1907-1908 debates will be held with Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina. The officers of the Debating Union for 1907-1908 are George Miller, Jr., Manager; John Clarence Hipp, Assistant Manager. MEDALISTS. 1906-1907. Jefferson Society Orator Thomas Vaden McCaul.
