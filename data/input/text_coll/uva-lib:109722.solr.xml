Announcements The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teacher who either have professional or life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. In addition to courses for high school teachers, the demand for courses for primary and grammar grade teachers is fully met. Partial Announcement of Courses Agriculture.â1. General Agriculture. 2.

Under the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. Organ Recitals, Entertainments, and Lectures.âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Coburn Players will present three plays: The Yellow Jacket, an Imaginary Sick Man, and Macbeth. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give three plays: She Stoops to Conquer, As You Like It, and a Modern Drama. The Ernest Gamble Concert Party will give one recital; Jennie Dufau, one recital; and negotiations are pending for a number of other high class attractions. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Besides there will be moving pictures regularly in the New Education Building. Rural Life Week.âThe time between July 5th and 10th will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and the rural church in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of country ministers and laymen, and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. Reduced Railway Rates.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates which have been granted by the Southern Passenger Association on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 cents for the round trip. Tickets will be on sale June 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28, with privilege of extension of final limit to September 30th. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 21nd to July 1st, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. A committee of ladies from the Y. W. C. A. will assist in welcoming teachers attending for the first time. A Young Women's Christian Association Club, open to every woman in the Summer School, is organized for the purpose of promoting a pleasant social atmosphere, giving an opportunity for social service and religious KINDERGARTEN CLASS, ON THE CAMPUS. DORMITORIES ON WEST RANGE. [13] development, and for the study of methods in club work and church work. The activities include "stunt parties," camp breakfasts, Camp Fire Girls demonstrations, weekly meetings on religious and social questions and special lectures on rural life questions. A secretary devotes her entire time to the work and has charge of the club headquarters at Madison Hall. Board and Rooms.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single rooms and one hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $5.00 for the full terms of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 22nd. Each room is lighted by electricity, has stationary wash stand and running water and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Double rooms will be furnished with two single beds complete, unless a double bed is especially desired; one chiffonier, except where there are more than two in room; one rocking chair or one morris chair and two single chairs. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $4.00 a week, $16.50 a month or $25.00 for the session of forty-six days. The University Commons will be managed this year by Mr. Charles Jaimes, a caterer and restaurateur of wide experience. A Restaurant a la Carte and lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee. Fees for Non-Virginia Students.âA single registration fee of twelve dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary HON. CHAMP CLARK AND DIRECTOR MAPHIS, FOURTH JULY, 1913. [15] courses without special permission in writing from the Director. Fees for Virginia Teachers.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee attached to each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. CreditsâVirginia State Certificates Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a certificate issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other States will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. Teachers from other States will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. The Virginia certificates with which the courses of study at the University Summer School are immediately concerned are the following: The Summer School Professional CertificateâCollege Grade. The Summer School Professional Certificate Advanced Grade. The Summer School Professional CertificateâGrammar Grade. The Summer School Professional CertificateâPrimary Grade. College Credit.âQuite a large number of courses are offered for college credit. Students who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer School, but the summer school work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. The Summer School News is a bi-weekly college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the University and of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. Four monthly issues, beginning with February, will be printed and circulated in addition to the twelve regular numbers. The subscription price for the whole sixteen issues is the moderate sum of twenty-five cents. Subscriptions should be sent to the Business Manager, Summer School News, University, Virginia. For complete catalogue and any further information application should be made to the Director of the Summer School. CHARLES G. MAPHIS, Professor of Secondary Education, University, Virginia.
