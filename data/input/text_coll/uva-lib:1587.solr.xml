      <field name="fulltext">v PREFACE The first draft of this translation was made in 1941-42 when I was studying in Peking as a fellow of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. It was revised during my second stay in Peking in 1947. As it now goes to press after a further lapse of three years I am very conscious of the need for another revision. In fact if I were beginning the translation today I would proceed on rather different principles, especially in the annotation. The reader will find much that betrays the novice, as often in what is included as requiring a note as in the significant omissions. The text includes considerable interesting material for studies which I have not undertaken; in publishing it in this form it is with the hope that an English version of the Han shih wai chuan will attract the attention of those more competent than I to deal with its many problems, sociological, institutional and philosophical. I wish to thank Professor Hsü Wei-yü of National Tsing Hua University and Professor Wang Li-ch`i of National Peking University for giving me the benefit of their wide knowledge of the Han shih wai chuan and related texts. Mr. Hsü made some useful suggestions about bibliography, which I have incorporated in my account of the history of the text. My indebtedness to Mr. Wang is acknowledged in the notes to the specific passages about which I consulted him. To Mr. Achilles Fang I owe a debt not so easily discharged. Mr. Fang read the entire manuscript, and nearly every page incorporates corrections which he has suggested. The first two chapters of this translation were presented to the Department of Far Eastern Languages at Harvard University as a doctoral thesis. They were read by Professor J. R. Ware and were much improved by his criticism. I wish here to thank these teachers and friends who have been so generous with their time and knowledge. Without their help this translation would be much poorer than it is. J.R.H. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1950</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1 INTRODUCTION1 1 In a separate article, "The Han-shih wai-chuan and the San chia shih," HJAS 11 (1948) .241-310, I have already given a general account of the HSWC, its sources and imitations, along with a theory about the nature of the work and its relation to the Han School of the Shih. There is no point in repeating the arguments and data presented at length in that article, and I shall confine myself in this introduction to briefly identifying the text and stating my practice in dealing with certain technical terms. Some remarks on editions and the history of the text are appended. For abbreviations and editions of texts cited see the Bibliography. The text here translated is a heterogeneous collection of ethical, ritual, and anecdotal materials not easily characterized. Its title, "Exoteric commentary on the Han school text of the Classic of Songs," claims a relationship with one of the basic works of the Confucian canon that on examination turns out to be tenuous at best. The place of the Han shih wai chuan in Han dynasty Confucian scholarship can be clarified only by briefly describing the activities of the classical schools of the time. The Ch`in dynasty (B. C. 221-206) had placed a ban on the private study of the books particularly venerated by the Confucian school. During the disorders and civil war following the downfall of the Ch`in some of these classics disappeared entirely and had to be recovered wholely or in part from the memories of aged scholars. The Shih ching (Classic of Songs) was one so recovered, and in the second century B. C. it existed in four recensions, each known by the name of either the founder of a school of interpretation of the text or by the name of the locality of which the founder was a native. Only the text of the Mao school survives to the present, but the four texts of the Shih ching were probably essentially the same; the schools owed their identity to their divergent interpretations of the text. Of the nearly thirty exegetical works mentioned in the catalogs and histories as belonging to the four schools during the Han dynasty, there survive only two of the Mao school, and the Han shih wai chuan, attributed to Han Ying (fl. B. C. 150) founder of the Han school. There is no reason to doubt the attribution, but, as it will appear, 2 the HSWC is more an anthology than an original composition, and it certainly is not primarily a work of exegesis on the Shih ching. It was a textbook used by Han Ying's school, not to present his interpretations of the Classic (other works performed that function) but to demonstrate the practical use of the Classic: a tag to clinch an argument, a stanza to sum up a philosophical principle, a punning line to delight or confuse. Quotations from the Shih ching had been so used in pre-Han times and continued in use in Han writings. Han Ying provided his disciples with a convenient handbook from which they could study to perfect their technique of the apt quotation. If my theory of the purpose and use of Han Ying's sole surviving work is correct, it explains though it does not entirely resolve, the difficulty of properly classifying it. Usually it is listed with the commentaries on the Shih ching, for the reason suggested with some annoyance by the Ss?-k`u editors,2 2 Ss?-k`u ch`üan-shu tsung-mu, 16.11a (Ta Tung Shu-chü ed.); see the Appendix for a complete translation. "If you do not put it with the works on the Shih, there is no other place for it." However, a more appropriate category would be that catchall of the Chinese bibliographer, the Section of Philosophical Writings ( ), where one finds the similar collections Shuo yüan and Hsin hsü. One would hesitate to classify the HSWC and its congeners as primarily literary works, though they are of interest as representing an early phase of the development of the anecdote and story form in the literary language. It is in them that the anecdote begins to appear, occasionally at least, as a story for its own sake, not as in the pre-Han philosophers solely to illustrate a point of doctrine, nor as in the romanticized histories (Kuo yü, Chan-kuo ts`ê) as an episode in a historical context intended to account for the motives of a principal actor. By sometimes calling attention to anachronisms and contradictory versions, I may seem to be implying that I attribute to these stories a historical character, to the ones at least where no obvious contradiction occurs. In fact, I regard all these anecdotes as unhistorical, though I do not deny the possibility that many may be based on actual events and deal with historical persons. It is rather that such stories were preserved 3 not as a record of events, but as themes illustrative of ritually prescribed conduct. As such they could be applied to any person, historical or fictional, whose activity fitted a given role. The materials for the HSWC were derived for the most part from pre-Han dynasty sources, sometimes rewritten, more often reproduced without significant change. Only a part of the HSWC is anecdotal; rather more than half is made up of philosophical essays plagiarized with a fine indifference to doctrinal consistency from the writings of several different schools. As Hsün-tz? is the favored source, the book takes on a character strongly reminiscent of the collection Hsün-tz?, where the formula "the Ode says" () is of common occurrence. As a whole the HSWC shows some similarity to the more miscellaneous chapters of the Li chi, and to the Ta-Tai li-chi; but the most closely related works are Shuo yüan, Hsin hsü, and Lieh-nü-chuan, in all three of which occur passages borrowed directly from HSWC. They differ chiefly in having their contents classified in chapters devoted to special topics, such classification being Liu Hsiang's contribution to the development of the form. Technical Terms In a text of this sort technical terms offer a special problem. Technical words, even within the limits of usage of a single school at a given period, seldom have a single equivalent translation word. The HSWC is as heterogeneous as its sources, and it is too much to expect to find terms like jên , li , i used with any consistency. Originally I had planned to leave them untranslated. However, some of them occur in contexts where they may adequately be translated by an English word—li, for example, in 1/12 clearly is "etiquette, courtesy"—and it seems misleading not to translate such occurrences, even though translation involves the sacrifice of consistency. Hence the word will be found as "etiquette," "ritual," "rites"—in each case with the romanized (li) in parentheses after the translation—and also simply as "li." Jên is used with connotations so vague as to defy English rendering, even the most inconsistent, though occasionally I have written "the humane (jên) man," in preference to the awkward 4 circumlocution "the man endowed with jên." The word i used of behavior means the act appropriate to the situation and the individual involved; when it is used to denote an abstract virtue, I have left it untranslated. Other terms, such as hsiao "filial piety," hsin "trustworthiness," chung "loyalty," lien "integrity" (adj. "scrupulous") are used with a narrower range of meanings that correspond to those of their single English equivalents. Wang , except as a title, is used in contrast with pa "hegemon," and I have translated as "the True King." The terms for Confucian adepts are awkward to handle. I use "saint" for shêng , "sage" for hsien (but "worthy" in contrast to ), "superior man" for chün-tz? , and "gentleman" for shih , except where an emphasis on military virtues makes the archaic value "soldier" more appropriate, or where the context calls for "official." In its technical use, the word tao seems to mean the "True Way," "the Kingly Way" to Han Confucians. It occurs with a metaphysical Taoist use a few times in the text, as in 1/23. Where it is used other than technically, I have translated it variously to fit the context. Yin and yang are too well established to require a note. Anatomical and medical terms occur in 3/9 and 10/9; they are dealt with in the notes to those sections. Ch`i seldom occurs simply as "breath," and out of ignorance of its true force I have usually left it untranslated. Hsüeh likewise carries more weight than the English "blood." I have translated tê sometimes in accordance with Waley's note on the use of the word in The Analects of Confucius, p. 33, and sometimes as "virtue" when the context has demanded a vaguer word. It must be remembered that by Han times such words had already a long history and were seldom used in a strictly technical or etymological sense. An expression that occurs very frequently in HSWC is . It cannot be taken as referring to HSWC itself in the way is sometimes used to introduce a passage in that work, since HSWC is not a "commentary" following a line of the Shih; instead the quotation normally follows the passage which illustrates it. Nor can it be referred to a single specific source. In 5 1/5, 2/6, 3/5, 22, 32, 7/23, and 10/4, the quotation is from Hsün-tz? (where is lacking), in 9/24 it is from Han-fei tz?; 7/9 is from either YTCC or Han-fei tz?; 3/27 is from LSCC. The great majority of occurrences introduce no identifiable quotation, though at least one half are again reproduced in Hsin hsü, SY, or other later compilations, with or without the introductory . A study of the passages so introduced for which a source cannot be found in the extant early literature discloses three types: (1) A general disquisition on moral conduct, such as 1/20, 2/30, 4/24, 7/19. These are very similar to 2/6, where Hsün-tz? seems to be the source, and may well be quotations from philosophical works now lost. (2) An aphorism (3/11, 5/15, 20, 7/5). These passages are either short or the force of the may be restricted to the opening sentence. Of the same sort are those occurrences of the expression within a given paragraph, as 1/1. (3) A story or anecdote that is common to a number of pre-Han works (2/1, 3/10, 4/7, 7/13, 15). I believe the basic and most general rendering of the phrase would be "There is a tradition that . . . ." In some cases a written text is being referred to; but there would be no reason always to expect to find the source in a text, even if all the texts to which a Han writer had access were still available. Oral tradition undoubtedly played an important part in the teachings of the schools attached to the Classics, and any saying or dictum an author considered worth emphasizing might rate a "tradition has it." In translating the expression I have varied the English phraseology to fit the line or passage introduced by it. History of the Text and Editions The Han shu "Essay on Literature"3 3 Han shu 30.4b. lists a HSWC in six chüan and a Han-shih nei-chuan in four chüan. The Sui shu "Essay"4 4 Sui shu 32.12a. has only the HSWC in ten chüan; likewise the "Essays" in the T`ang shu,5 5 T`ang shu 46.6a. Hsin T`ang-shu,6 6 Hsin T`ang-shu 57.4a. and Sung shih.7 7 Sung shih 202.10b. That 6 the ten-chüan text is essentially a combination of the HSWC and the Han-shih nei-chuan listed in the Han shu is a hypothesis proposed by Yang Shu-ta8 8 Han shu pu-chu pu-chêng 1.28 (Commercial Press, 1925). and further developed in my article "The Han-shih wai-chuan and the San chia shih." This amalgamation must be supposed to have occurred during the biggest lacuna in the record of the text's history: between the Han shu entry, valid for the first century A.D. and the Sui shu entry, based on sixth century catalogues. The Han school of the Shih was no longer active after the third century,9 9 At least none of the works belonging to that school in the Sui shu "Essay" are attributed to authors living after the San-kuo period. but a copy of the Han shih was still known to the compilers of the Sui shu "Essay," which lists numerous other works of the school, now all lost.10 10 Sui shu, loc. cit. In the absence of contemporary Han citations from the HSWC by name, there is no certainty that our ten-chüan edition is at all the same work. On the other hand, the numerous parallels in Hsin hsü, SY and LNC, some of them demonstrably filiated with the HSWC version, furnish good grounds for assuming that a part at least of the present text represents the Han dynasty HSWC. Furthermore there is no apparent motive for a hypothetical forger to compile an obscure work belonging to a defunct school of classical exegesis when the resulting book provides no excuse for a new departure in either exegesis or doctrine. The case for the Han-shih nei-chuan is more tenuous. None of the three lines quoted in Po-hu-t`ung as from Han-shih nei-chuan occurs in the present text, and the question must be dealt with chiefly from internal evidence. I refer again to my earlier article for the reasons which make it likely that we now possess a fragmentary text of Han-shih nei-chuan imbedded in the present HSWC. There are many obviously defective passages in the text of HSWC which is here translated. Not all of these imperfections can be laid to the hypothetical pre-T`ang editor who established the ten-chüan text. There are over two hundred citations of HSWC in the T`ang encyclopedias and collections of excerpts,11 11 Pei-t`ang shu-ch`ao (Yü Shih-nan 558-638) 15 times; I-wên lei-chü (Ou-yang Hsün 557-641) 28 times; Ch`ün-shu chih-yao (Wei Chêng 580-643) 19 times; Ch`u hsüeh chi (Hsü Chien 659-729) 15 times; Po-shih lui-t`ieh shih-lei-chi (Po Chü-i 772846) 13 times. 7 and in the commentators on the Classics, Histories, and other works,12 12 K`ung Ying-ta (574-648) in his commentary on Li chi (4 times), Tso chuan (2 times); Yen Shih-ku (581-645) in his commentary on Han shu (3 times); Li Hsien (651-684) in his commentary on Hou-Han shu (4 times); and especially Li Shan (?-689) in his commentary on Wên hsüan (115 times). of which nearly ten per cent are not to be found in the present text. There was apparently a certain amount of doubt in the minds of some of those commentators as to just what text they were quoting; Chia Kung-yen thrice attributes a line to HSWC in his commentary on I li,13 13 I li 2.3a, 4.5a, 18.4a. only to repeat it in his commentary on Chou li14 14 Chou li 41.7b. as from the Han shih shuo. A Han shih chuan is cited four times;15 15 Ibid. 14.6b, 32.7b; Kung-yang chuan 12.9b (Ho Hsiu); Han shu 29.11a (Yen Shih-ku). none of the lines cited appears in the present text. Chang Shou-chieh quotes seven times from HSWC;16 16 Shih chi 2.5b, 28.5a-b, 42.12a, 44.20b, 67.14b, 83.2b-3a, 117.9b. only three of his quotations are in our text, and of them one was used by Hsü Kuang in an earlier passage.17 17 Ibid. 5.33a quotes from HSWC, likewise Chang Shou-chieh's commentary on 44.20b, but not the same line. Of four quotations by Ss?-ma Chên , one is no longer in the HSWC.18 18 Ibid. 46.11a, 55.7a, 117.7b. 126.12a is missing. Li Shan provides the best testimony that one T`ang text at least was essentially the same as the one we have, since only nine19 19 *Wên hsüan 4.2b (35.19a), 9.27a, 13.20a (31.7b), 26.13b, 29.1b (29.20b, 36.3b), 29.10b, 40.34a, 55.22b, 59.27b. of his 115 citations are missing, and of them one20 20 Ibid. 16.26b. is a lexical gloss unlike anything in our text (I suspect they are from one of the other works of the school), whereas the only long quotation turns up twice in the same commentary as being from Han-shih nei-chuan.21 21 Ibid. 12.28b, 19.18a. It is worth pointing out also that in his commentary three passages from HSWC are introduced by .22 22 Ibid. 3.1b, 17.19a, 60.14a. 8 The Sung bibliographers23 23 Ch`ung-wên tsung-mu (Wang Yao-ch`ên 1001-1056); Yüehya-t`ang ts`ung-shu vol. 166, 1.9b; Chün-chai tu-shu-chih (Ch`ao Kung-wu ); Chih-chai shu-lu chieh-t`i (Ch`ên Chên-sun , fl. 1235); Wang Ying-lin, K`un hsüeh chi-wên. knew the HSWC, and it is quoted 157 times by the TPYL, of which twenty-three quotations are not in the present text. The oldest published text is the (?) Sung edition reprinted by Mao Chin (1599-1659),24 24 Vols. 3-4 of Chin-tai pi-shu ; cf. his postface . an edition he believes to be the same as that described by Hung Mai (1123-1202), who says,25 25 *Jung-chai sui-pi II 8.4a. "During the Ch`ing-li period (1041-1048) the Chung-chiang tso-chien-chu-pu Li Yung-chang 26 26 I have not been able to identify him further. edited [the HSWC] and ordered workmen to cut [blocks for its publication] in Hang[-chou]. There is also a postface which says, `Over 3,000 characters have been rectified by Minister Wên.'27 27 . There was a Wên Yen-po (1006-1097) who was a Minister of State. I have a [copy of] this book in my house." Three thousand emendations in a text of approximately 50,000 words—say six per cent —is admittedly high. That there are nothing like so many discrepancies between Mao's text and the other available editions28 28 A Yüan text reprinted by Shên Pien-chih in the Yeh-chu-chai with a preface by Ch`ien Wei-shan dated 1356. For this edition see Bibliography under HSWC, B. Of the four Ming editions listed in the Catalogue of the Kiangsu Province Sinological Library 3.23b, the Chint`ung-ts`ao-t`ang is reprinted in the Ku-ching-chieh hui-han and in the Han-Wei ts`ung-shu (Commercial Press photographic reprint of the original Ming edition). may mean that they too are derived from the one published by Li Yung-chang. No modern catalog lists a Sung edition, and the only Yüan edition seems to be the one from which Ch`ü Chung-jung (1769-1842) made notes.29 29 Ch`ü Chung-jung's notes are printed in the Yao-pu ts`ang-shu t`i-shih hsü-lu 1.2a-4a (cf. Chao, Introduction 1-2). By T`ang times isolated passages in the HSWC had attracted the attention of commentators on early philosophical and historical texts.30 30 Yang Liang's commentary on Hsün-tz? (Preface dated 818), and see note 11 above. Wang Ying-lin deals incidentally with a 92 few lines,31 31 *K`un-hsüeh chi-wên 2.15b, 3.4b and passim. but it was not until early in the Ch`ing dynasty that a critical edition of HSWC was published with a full-dress commentary. Two Ch`ing scholars brought out their HSWC commentaries in successive years, each apparently unaware that the other was engaged in the same task. The earlier of the two, by Chao Huai-yü (1747-1823),32 32 Cf. Hummel, Eminent Chinese of the Ch`ing Period 71-72. Abbreviated as CHy. bears a preface dated the fifth moon, 1790, and was printed by the author in his own establishment, the I-yu-shêng-chai .33 33 The original print is quite rare; however, there is a reprint in the Lung-ch`i-chingshê ts`ung-shu; cf. Bibliography s. v. Chao Huai-yü. He mentioned in his collation notes eight editions which he made use of, including a Yüan edition (cited once);34 34 Cf. Chao, Introduction, p. 1. in addition he gleaned many citations from the encyclopedias and the T`ang commentators. On the basis of such citations and parallel passages in pre-Han and Han works he did not hesitate to make extensive emendations in the HSWC text. It is easy to share Liu Shih-p`ei's enthusiasm for the result,35 35 Tso-an chi 1.14b-15b vol. 27 in Liu Shên-shu hsien-shêng i-shu . Mo Yu-chih (1811-1871) also rates CHy's edition above that of Chou T`ing-ts`ai; cf. Lü-t`ing chih chien ch`uan-pen shu-mu 2.6b , Hsi-lêng yin-shê ed. . Cf. Chao, Introduction, p. 1. as many difficult passages are simplified by his changes or additions; however, it is questionable how much reliance can be put on the encyclopedias and commentators, given their predilection for abridgment and paraphrase. Chou T`ing-ts`ai, whose HSWC chiao-chu appeared with a preface dated the sixth moon, 1791, using essentially the same materials, produced a more conservative text. Chou usually limited himself to suggesting in his notes emendations he thought desirable. It is interesting that the two scholars, working independently, are more frequently than not in agreement about doubtful points. It is not surprising, however, that Wu T`ang in bringing out a combined edition of the two commentaries, reproduced Chou's text, relegating Chao's variants to the notes.36 36 It is this combined edition, generally acknowledged to be the best available, which is the basis for my translation. Throughout, I have had access to the original as printed in the Wang-san-i-chai, but folio and line references in the Finding List are to the re-edition easily accessible in the Chi-fu ts`ung-shu. 10 Under the ambitious title of HSWC su-chêng Ch`ên Shih-k`o published in 1818 an edition (provenance not specified) of the HSWC in which are included most of the parallel passages, whether earlier or later than Han Ying. These are printed in full after each paragraph of HSWC. The usefulness of this compilation is somewhat impaired by the fact that his HSWC text is defective, while the parallels contain many misprints. Despite the title, no commentary is supplied. This work has been the point of departure for locating most of the parallels cited in the notes to my translation; it is not there acknowledged, as the same parallels are nearly always indicated in Chou, CHy, or Chao; it was simply easier to locate them from a page of text than from a single line or phrase. In the appended bibliography will be found listed the notes by Sun I-jang and Yü Yüeh on the HSWC. They are useful, but deal with only a dozen or so passages. So far the best single work devoted exclusively to the HSWC is Chao's Shan-i's HSWC pu-chêng, to which I am greatly indebted, especially for the rich documentation which it brings together for the consideration of doubtful passages. Sources are given with reasonably exact references (not, of course, page references), and citations are usually in full. The Kuan-hai-t`ang shu mu 1.6b lists a MS. HSWC k`ao in ten chüan by Okamoto H?k? , with appendix and collation notes , each 1 vol. This work is also mentioned by Chao, Introduction, p. 3, as a work he was unable to get; I have never seen a copy. A new edition of HSWC has been prepared by Professor Hsü Wei-yü of National Tsing Hua University, but the MS. still awaits publication. I regret not having had the use of it in preparing my translation, though Professor Hsü kindly offered to put at my disposal his materials, unfortunately just before my departure from Peiping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11 CHAPTER I 11 1 This paragraph is translated by Legge in Shih, Prolegomena 87. Tsêng-tz? held office in Chü,2 2 For , Tsêng Tsao's Lei shuo (Ssu-k`u ch`üan-shu MS. copy deposited in the Wen Yüan Ko ), ch. 36, quotes this passage with "was born in the State of Lu." is certainly a mistake, but may well be the correct reading. (I owe this reference to Mr. Wang Li-ch`i.) receiving as salary three ping3 3 : a grain measure containing 16 hu . In Han times a hu was equivalent to about 20 liters. Cf. Dubs, History of the Former Han Dynasty 1.279. of grain. At that time Tsêng-tz? valued his pay but held lightly his person. After his parents had died, Ch`i invited him to be minister, and Ch`u and Chin each invited him to be prime minister. At that time Tsêng-tz? valued his person but held lightly to his pay. With one who "keeping his jewel in his bosom, leaves his country to confusion,"4 4 Analects 317-8 (17/1.2). it is not possible to speak of jên; with one who, distressing his person, stints his parents [by not holding office], it is not possible to discuss filial duty. One whose "burden is heavy and whose course is long"5 5 Ibid. 210 (8/7.1). is not particular about the place where he rests; one whose family is poor and whose parents are old is not particular about the office he will fill. Truly, the superior man will anxiously6 6 : for CHy has "bridge," which makes no sense. Chou suggests in the meaning of "straw sandals." Yü Yüeh, CYTT 17.1a, objects to this and says that both readings are phonetic equivalents (phonetic group ). He identifies (*g'ât) with (*g'i?at), and quotes the binom from Wên hsüan 9.12b, where Hsü Yüan's com. explains it as "the mind given free rein," and also mentions a variant in the Ch`u-tz`?. Yü Yüeh interprets the phrase as "being anxious to go to a place" , treating as an inversion of chieh-chiao. Chao (1-2) adds an example from Chuang-tz? 4.27b: , where Ts`ui Chuan's com. says means "unquiet in mind" ( *k'i?êt). I have followed Yü Yüeh, although Chao Yu-wen prefers Chou's emendation as continuing the theme of poverty. hasten after the 12 opportunity, considering the present business to be urgent.7 7 I. e., the support of his parents; cf. Mencius 476 (7A/46.1). As the saying goes, if a man takes office without meeting with the proper time, or is overconscientious in discharging his duties, or serves another without entering into his schemes,8 8 PWYF quotes only this example of , which should mean "burdened by his cares." The whole passage is probably corrupt; one would expect a negative before this phrase to balance , with the meaning "takes office without assuming its cares." (I am indebted to Mr. Wang Li-ch`i for this suggestion.) Chao Yu-wen proposes to suppress the by treating it as a "particle" () with the same purpose of making the two phases parallel. This is certainly a more drastic and less likely emendation. My translation of the text as it stands is forced. the reason is poverty. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 31 No. 21/1. [Only until] the early dawn10 10 : here as in Shih 22 No. 13/3 and 26 No. 17/1. Cf. K`ung Ying-ta's com. on Shih ching 2.32b. But cf.

Legge translates this paragraph, Shih, Proleg. 87. Tradition tells about the woman in the "hsing-lu" [Ode].2 2 Shih 27 No. 17. She had been promised in marriage, but as yet had not gone [to her husband's house]. Seeing one present missing, one rite not perfect, she preserved her chastity and kept her principles pure, and would sooner have died3 3 LNC has for , which latter is unusual, and Chou would change to . The may have come from the preceding phrase . than go. The superior man regards her as having attained that which is fitting to a woman's duty,4 4 , lit., "the proper way of a woman." and so he uses her as an exemplar and makes a song to disseminate it. Thereby he does away with improper seeking and prevents immoral acts. The Ode says, Though you have forced me to trial, I will still not follow you.5 5 HSWC has for the of Shih and LNC.

As Lei-chü 9.10a and TPYL 74.5a, 826.8b, write , it would seem to be a scribal emendation. (Chao 2.) Wang Chao-yüan (LNC pu chu 6.9a) defines as "path." of A-ku, where a maiden who wore a semi-circle of jade3 3 is defined by Shuo wên 151 as a jade ear plug; likewise Mao's com. on Shih ching 4.7b. Lei-chü, loc. cit., TPYL 819.10b, 577.8a, 826.8b have for . Shuo wên 136 defines as "a semicircle of jade," and Mao's com. on Shih ching 7.19a includes it in a list of other girdle ornaments. I take as the better reading, but Shu-ch`ao, loc. cit., TPYL, 74.5a, and Jung-chai sui-pi, II 8.4a, all write . (Chao 3.) at her belt was washing clothes. Confucius said, "No doubt yonder woman can be approached?" He drew out a cup4 4 CHy says the ordinary editions of his time omitted the remainder of this story. However, it is not omitted in the Yüan edition. and handed it to Tz?-kung saying, "Address her politely,5 5 : cf. Analects 187 (6/7). : LNC has . Wang Chao-yüan, loc. cit., thinks both are phonetic borrowings for "fiery." Chao (3) agrees. that we may see what she says." Tz?-kung said to the woman, "I, a humble northerner on my way south to Ch`u, find the weather hot. Ardently6 I think of you; I wish to beg a drink to demonstrate my feelings." The woman replied, "This declivity of A-ku [holds] a winding stream, whose water is alternately clear and turbid as it flows on its way to the sea. If you wish to drink, then drink. Why ask a woman?" She took Tz?-kung's cup, went to the stream and dipped it in against the current; then she threw out the water with a splash and dipped it in again with a splash, following the current,7 7 Read for with LNC to complete the parallel with the preceding phrase. (CHy). and filled it to overflowing. Kneeling she placed it on the sand and said, "According to etiquette (li) it must not be handed over directly."8 8 Cf. Li ki 1.29 (1A/3.31), also Mencius 307 (4A/17.1). Tz?-kung reported this, and Confucius said, "I knew it." Drawing out a lute, he removed its pegs and handed it to Tz?-kung saying, "Address her politely, that we may see what she says." 14 Tz?-kung said, "The words you have just spoken are soothing as a pure breeze,9 9 Cf. Shih 545 No. 260/8. not contradicting what I said; they have harmonized and made easy my mind. Here is a lute without pegs; I would like you to tune it for me. The woman replied, "I am a rustic person, uncultivated and ignorant.10 10 : not in its usual (later) meaning of "irresponsible, unconscious." Not knowing the five tones,11 11 Cf. Mém. hist. 3.240-1 for a discussion of their symbolism. Erh ya 5.19b gives an alternative list. how could I tune your lute?" Tz?-kung reported this, and Confucius said, "I knew it."

A liang was equal to about 15 g. in Han times; cf. Dubs, op. cit. 280. which he handed to Tz?-kung, saying, "Address her politely, that we may see what she says." Tz?-kung said, "I am a man from a northern rustic town on my way south to Ch`u. Here I have five liang of hemp. Though I dare not consider it worthy of yourself, I shall venture to place it by the bank of the stream." The woman replied, "Your behavior is wrong . . .13 13 . The text is corrupt. (CHy).

If you do not take it away immediately. . . ."15 15 : The text seems to be corrupt. LNC is also unintelligible: probably would be a humble term for husband as in LNC 6.10a: , and by emending as in LNC the whole passage might be construed, "You did not come soon enough, and now I have a husband who looks after me." (Wang Li-ch`i.) The Ode says,16 16 Shih 15. No. 9. Chou and CHy quote K`ung-ts`ung-tz? 1.79b-80a: "The Prince of P`ing-yüan asked Tz?-kao, `I have heard that when your late master . . . traveled south to A-ku, he exchanged words with a washerwoman. Could it have been really so?' He replied, `. . . the A-ku story is of recent origin, probably concocted by those who use that sort of thing to give currency to their ideas.' " 15 In the south rise the trees without branches, Affording no shelter. By the Han are girls rambling about, But it is vain to solicit them. This is illustrated in the above [story]. 41 1 Cf. SY 17.9b-10a; Chia-yü 1.28b; Wên-tz? 4.3b. Duke Ai asked Confucius, "Does the possessor of knowledge live out his span?" Confucius said, "Certainly. There are three ways in which a man dies that are not determined by fate, but are of his own choosing. Those whose residence is not taken care of, those who are immoderate in eating and drinking, those who in toil and idleness go to excess2 2 : I follow KTCY A.3a: ; SY interchanges and , and Chia-yü has . CHy thinks HSWC should be expanded to one of these readings, and Chao (6) agrees. will all of them be killed off by sickness. Those who, occupying an inferior position, like to oppose their superiors; those whose desires are insatiable; and those who seek incessantly will all of them be killed by the law. Those who with a few oppose the many, who with weakness insult the strong, who in anger do not take stock of their strength will all of them be killed in war. Thus there are three ways in which a man dies that are not determined by fate, but are of his own choosing." The Ode says, 3 3 Shih 84 No. 52/1. If a man have no moderation in his behavior, What should he do but die? 51 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 11.18b-19a. There is a traditional saying: "In the heavens nothing is brighter than sun and moon; on earth nothing is brighter than water and fire; in man nothing is brighter than li and i." Now when the sun or moon is not high it does not illuminate what is distant; and when fire or water is not brought together in a mass, its rays are not extensive; and when li and i are not used in a 16 state, then its fame is not clear. Just as human fate depends on heaven, the destiny of a state depends on li. If a ruler esteems2 2 Hsün-tz? has for , and both Chou and CHy would follow Hsün-tz?. Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.1b) thinks *kông (?klông) is a phonetic borrowing for , *gliong, as Shuo-wên 2692 puts them in the same phonetic group, and they also occur as alternative readings in CKT 4.32a: , and Fêng-su t`ung-i 8.6a, where the same line occurs with . li and honors sages, he will reign as a True King. If he lays emphasis on law and loves the people, he will rule as a hegemon. If he loves profit and practices many deceits, he will be in danger. If he plots in an opportunist manner to overthrow [other states], he will perish. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 85 No. 52/3. If a man observes no li, Why does he not quickly die? 61 1 Cf. Hsün-tzû 1.14b-15a. The superior man has the capacity of universal2 2 : Hsün-tz? has , and the commentators have taken it as meaning "to make a distinction." Wang Nien-sun, however, equates it with , of which is an old form; and so in my translation. (Chao 8.) aptitude. If he uses it to regulate breathing and nourish his vitality,3 3 : both CHy and Chou would follow Hsün-tz? and read . Chao (8) says the emendation is unnecessary, as the two words are interchangeable and quotes as evidence LSCC 1.4a: , where Kao Yu's com. says means .

The meaning is: although he would properly dwell in success, he also profits from dwelling in poverty. . . . The HSWC . . . not understanding the meaning of , has expanded and changed the text.

"Fall into a snare" does not make good sense. If in appearance and behavior, in activity and movements,10 10 : CHy writes "rapid steps." Chao (10) supports this emendation. a person follows li he will be courteous; if he does not follow li, he will be rude and vulgar.11 11 : Hsün-tz? has , where Yang Liang defines as "rude," and as "vulgar." Chou thinks the characters have dropped out of the text. In the translation I follow CHy and Hsün-tz? taking as a mistake for . Government without li will not be effective; royal affairs without li will not be complete; a state without li will not be peaceful, and a king without li is not far removed from the day of his destruction.12 12 In the Yüan ed. the words are printed in small type, making a gloss on . The result is a smoother reading. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 85 No. 52/3. If a man observes no li Why does he not quickly die? 71 1 Legge translates this paragraph in Shih, Proleg. 88. Cf. also Mencius 469 (7A/34). There is a traditional saying: "The extreme of a lack of jên is to neglect2 2 : Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.1b) thinks this is a mistake for , "be cruel to," but Chao Yu-wen, ibid. 105 quotes evidence to the contrary. one's parents. The extreme of disloyalty is to rebel 18 against one's prince. The extreme of untrustworthiness is to cheat one's friends." Those guilty of these three [crimes] are the ones a saintly ruler puts to death without mercy. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 84 No. 52/1. If a man has no moderation in his behavior,4 4 B, C, D incorrectly have for ; likewise the Yüan ed. What should he do but die? 81 1 Cf. SY 4.1b-2b. The Prince Pi-kan sacrificed himself and thus completed his loyalty. Liu-hsia Hui sacrificed himself and thus completed his trustworthiness.2 2 SY has Wei Shêng for Liu-hsia Hui, for whom there seems to be no tradition of self-immolation. But from the point of view of a Ch`ing Confucian such as CHy, Wei Shêng died under such questionable circumstances (cf. CKT 9.5a; Yen Shih-ku's com. on Han shu 65.1b) that he ought not to be included in a list of Confucian worthies. Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.2a-b) however, defends the SY reading on the basis of numerous texts that associate Wei Shêng with Po-i, Shu-ch`i, et al. (Cf. Shih chi 69.19a, 56.3b; Han shu 65.1b-2a; Chung-tz? 9.39a.) Po-i and Shu-ch'i sacrificed themselves and thus completed their integrity. These four3 3 For read with the Yüan ed. and SY. sages were all of them the empire's gentlemen of understanding.4 4 : cf. Hsün-tz? 2.9a: "If above one can honor his prince and below can love the people; if when things come to hand he can adapt himself to them, and when situations arise he can discriminate, in that case he can be termed a gentleman of understanding." Nor is there any question of their not valuing their persons. If i is not established and his fame not apparent, a gentleman is ashamed; this is why they sacrificed themselves and so brought to perfection their [ideal of] conduct. Viewed in this light, it is not low condition or poverty that a gentleman is ashamed of. [What a gentleman should be ashamed of is]5 5 SY interpolates . (Chao 12.) that when the world holds up loyalty he does not partake of it, and when it honors trustworthiness he does not partake of it, and when it honors integrity he does not partake of it. If these three [qualities] are preserved in a person, his fame is transmitted to [later] generations;6 6 SY reads for . he ranks together with sun 19 and moon, [un]resting.7 7 Chou and CHy follow SY to read for . Heaven cannot kill him, nor can earth bury him;8 8 "earth is unable to give him life" is possible but does not make very good sense. I follow Chao Yu-wen, op. cit., 105 and emend to after the otherwise identical pair of phrases in Hsün-tz?. in the time of a Chieh or a Chou, he cannot be sullied. So it is not that, hating life, he rejoices in death, or9 9 CHy follows SY and prefixes . Chao also puts after to balance the phrase. hating riches and honor, he loves poverty and low condition. Through the true principle, when honor comes to him, he serves in office without refusing. Confucious said, "If the search for riches is sure to be successful, though I should become a groom with whip in hand to get them, I will do so."10 10 Analects 198 (7/11). Truly, "though harassed to extremity, they were not downcast"; and though toiling to degradation, they did not act improperly. Only then was there perfection.11 11 This sentence, with for , occurs in LNC 4.5a. The phrase is from Mencius 207 (2A/9.2), 371 (5B/1.3). The Ode says,12 12 Shih 39 No. 26/3. My mind is not a stone;— It cannot be rolled about. My mind is not a mat;— It cannot be rolled up. This is illustrated above. 91 1 Cf. Chuang-tz? 8.4b; Hsin hsü 7.8b-9a. R. H. van Gulik, The Lore of the Chinese Lute 155, translates a version of this story taken from an encyclopedia, where it is attributed to Chia yü. The citation does not give the ch. number, and I am unable to locate the story in my edition of Chia yü. Shih chi 67.16a briefly describes the encounter between Yüan Hsien and Tz?-kung. Yüan Hsien dwelt in Lu in a house only one tu on a side;2 2 : cf. Li Ki 2.608. it was thatched with grasses; the door was a mat, and the window the mouth of a broken pot;3 3 : Li Ki, loc. cit. K`ung Ying-ta (Li chi 59.6b) says means a door made of woven p`êng; also a door stopped up with p`êng is called a . a bent mulberry tree served as door 20 support;4 4 : The Yüan ed. has for . Mr. Wang Li-ch`i suggests "pull over" for . The sense would then be close to the reading in Hsin-hsü 7.8b: . above, [the roof] leaked, and below [the floor] was wet. After seating himself correctly, he would play the lute and sing. Tz?-kung came to see him, with fat horses to his carriage and wearing light furs,5 5 Cf. Analects 185 (6/3.2). For Tz?-kung as the prosperous disciple of Confucius cf. Shih chi 129.5a and Han shu 91.4b (N. L. Swann, Food and Money in Ancient China, pp. 427-8). deep purple inside6 6 Cf. ibid. 230 (10/6.1): "The superior man does not use a deep purple." and undyed outside. Since his high chariot could not get into the lane, he walked up to call upon him. Yüan Hsien answered the door, [wearing] a cap of ch`u7 7 : a tree related to the mulberry. bark and carrying a wooden staff. He straightened his cap and the string broke; he adjusted the lapel of his gown and his elbows came out; he put on his shoes and the heels burst. Tz?-kung said, "Eh, sir, what ails you?" Yüan Hsien looking up answered, "I have heard that to be without property is termed poverty, and that to be unable to put into practice what one has studied is termed ailing. I am poor; I am not ailing. Now acting with an eye to public opinion, making friends on a partisan basis, studying for the sake of others8 8 I. e., for show and not for self-improvement; cf. Analects 285 (14/25), "In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Now-a-days men learn with a view to the approbation of others." and teaching for one's own sake,9 9 I. e., for the salary. so that jên and i are concealed, so that horse and carriage are ostentatious, so that clothes and furs are elegant—I cannot bear to practice the like." Tz?-kung drew back, his face colored with shame, and he left without saying farewell. Whereupon Yüan Hsien returned with slow steps, trailing his stick and singing the Sacrificial Odes of Shang.10 10 Cf. Shih 631-46 Nos. 301-5 for the . The sound merged with Heaven and Earth, as though it issued from metal and stone [musical instruments]. The emperor had no way of getting him as minister and the feudal lords had no way of getting him for a friend. Truly he who is cultivating his person forgets his family, and he who cultivates his will forgets 21 his person. Since he does not love even his person, who can dishonor him? The Ode says,11 11 Shih 39 No. 26/3. My mind is not a stone;— It cannot be rolled about. My mind is not a mat;— It cannot be rolled up. 101 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 20.14b-15a; TTLC 1.5b-6a; Chia-yü 1.23b-24a. Traditionally, as for one who is termed a gentleman, though he may not be able to perfect himself in the methods of right conduct, certainly there is that which he follows, and though he may be unable to complete himself in the good,2 2 I follow CHy and emend to , after Hsün-tz?; Chao (15) agrees. certainly there is that wherein he abides. He does not try to say a great deal, he is simply careful about what he does. Having done a thing, he holds to it,3 3 For read with Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.2a). (Chao 15.) and having promised a thing, he fulfills his words, no more able to change in that than in the flesh of his body or his life. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 39 No. 26/3. My mind is not a stone;— It cannot be rolled about. My mind is not a mat;— It cannot be rolled up. 111 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 2.6a-b. According to tradition, when the superior man purifies himself, his peers associate with him. When he refines his speech,2 2 For read with Hsün-tz?. (Chao 16.) those of his class respond to him. When horses neigh, [other] horses respond; when cattle low, [other] cattle respond; this is not the result of knowledge, but it is their nature makes it thus. Truly, "one who has newly washed his hair will dust off his cap, and one who has newly bathed will shake out his clothing." No one3 3 : Hsün-tz? has , Ch`u-tz`? 7.2a ("Yü fü") has ; both easier readings. (Chao.) 22 would subject his own cleanliness to another's filthiness.4 4 : Chao emends to to parallel the above. Hsün-tz? has (which Wang Hsien-ch`ien makes = or ), and Ch`u-tz`? 7.2a has . This whole passage occurs in Ch`ü Yüan's reply to the fisherman, Shih chi 84.4b, and is probably a proverbial expression; cf. K`un-hsüeh chi-wên 10.9a. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 38 No. 26/2. For the reading of the 2nd line cf. Karlgren, Book of Odes 1.79. My mind is not a mirror;— You cannot scrutinize it. 121 1 Cf. SY 4.2b-3a. Legge translates this passage in Shih, Proleg. 88. When Ching attacked Ch`ên, the western gate of [the capital of] Ch`ên was broken down. Afterwards the people who had surrendered were sent to repair it. Confucius passed by without bowing.2 2 used for . Literally, to bow forward to the crossbar of the chariot. Tz?-kung, who was holding the reins, asked, "According to etiquette (li), on passing three persons one descends [from the chariot], and on passing two persons one bows. Now there is a crowd of Ch`ên natives repairing the gate; why is it you did not bow?" Confucius said, "Not to know when a state is perishing is not to be wise. To know it but not fight is not to be loyal. To fight3 3 I follow Chao (17) and emend to , as better fitting the development of the argument. Chao suggests the may have come from the above. but not die is not to be brave. Although there is a crowd of those repairing the gate, they are unable to put into practice a single one of these [precepts]. That is why I did not bow." The Ode says,4 4 Shih 40 No. 26/4. My anxious heart is full of trouble, And I am hated by the crowd of mean creatures. Mean men, however many, are not worth treating with etiquette (li). 131 1 Cf. Huai-nan tz? 14.9a; Wên-tz? 4.9a. There is a traditional saying: "Those who like getting2 2 Huai-nan tz? has for . Chao (18) thinks this should be adopted here, in the meaning of "take," so as to bring out the parallel with the below. I also emend to as in Huai-nan tz?. must 23 be subject to many resentments, and those who love giving must steal much." Only by obliterating one's traces among men can one conform to the naturalness of Heaven and Earth; only3 3 for as in Huai-nan tz?. by being able to rise above desire4 4 : translated after Hsü Shên's comment. will one not have a love for fame. If fame rise up, then the Way is not being used. If the Way is in operation, then for men there is no rank. Now profit is the root of injury; and prosperity is the precursor of calamity. Only he who does not seek profit will escape injury, and he who does not seek prosperity will escape calamity. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 52 No. 33/4. He hates none; he covets nothing;— What does he which is not good? 141 1 Cf. SY 17.8b-9a. There is a traditional saying: "The man with good hearing hears for himself, and the one with good sight observes for himself."2 2 Cf. Chuang-tz? 4.9b (Wang Yu-wên 106). If hearing and sight are good, then jên and love will be manifest, and integrity and shame will be distinguished. Thus if a thing is done that is not in conformity with the right way, it will not succeed, even with great efforts. If a thing to which one has no right3 3 : cf. Mencius 468 (7A/33). is sought after, if will not be got, even though strength be employed. For this reason the wise person does not do a thing not appropriate to himself, and the man of integrity does not seek that to which he has no right. In this way harm is kept away and fame is exhibited. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 52 No. 33/4. He hates none; he covets nothing;— What does he which is not good? 15 There is a traditional saying: "He who is content with his lot 24 and nourishes his vitality need not wait to collect and garner to be rich." He whose name is spread in the world is eminent not only after he has a position of power. As moral power and i permeate him inside, there is nothing he need seek outside. How true it is that the sage does not try to get fame and profit from the world. The Ode says,1 1 Shih 52 No. 33/4. He hates none; he covets nothing;— What does he which is not good? 161 1 Cf. SSTC 2.4a-5a. In antiquity the Son of Heaven had five gongs on his left [and right]2 2 Add after as in Shu-ch`ao 108.4a, Ch`u hsüeh chi 16.13a, TPYL 565.2a. SSTC reads . (Chao 19.) sides. When he was about to go out, the huang-chung3 3 : the first of the six , listed in SSTC. Cf. Mém. hist. 3.314-5; Po hu t`ung 3.12a-15a. was struck, and the five gongs on the right echoed to it. The horses' neigh fit the pitch [of the huang chung]. The chariots were in the pattern [of the music]; the drivers were in the number [of the music]. [The officials] stood up and then bowed respectfully.4 4 : to bend the body to the angle made by the musical stone ch`ing; cf. Li Ki 1.70. They folded their hands and then [held their arms as though] grasping drums. When they walked, they went exactly; when they turned back, they went correctly.5 5 : cf. Li Ki 1.707: "When turning round, he made a complete circle; when turning in another direction, he did so at a right angle." (Legge 2.18), where the emperor seems to be the topic. That here it refers to the officers is clear in SSTC, which reads , and above has . These lines also occur in SY 19.3b. After that the Grand Music Master6 6 : cf. Analects 163 (3/23). offered up the music of mounting the chariot, thereby announcing that [the Son of Heaven] was going out. When he [was about to] re-enter the palace, the jui pin was struck7 7 SSTC adds "and the five gongs on the left echoed to it." Chao (19) thinks this should be added to the HSWC text, but as he remarks, TPYL 565.2a also omits it. to [let him] prepare his bearing. When he had achieved 253 [the proper] bearing, his countenance was in harmony. When his countenance was in harmony, his features8 8 : lit., "flesh." were in repose. When the jui pin sounded, herons flapped their wings, horses neighed, and even of creatures of the lower order none but stretched out their necks to listen. All the inmates of the palace had the color of jade;9 9 : cf. Li Ki 1.722, said of the warrior. outside all had voices of metal. After that the Inferior Music Master10 10 : cf. Analects 338 (18/9.5). offered up the music of ascending the hall and went to his seat, thereby announcing that [the Son of Heaven] was returning. This expresses the idea of music being harmonious, of things being moved, and of [objects with] similar tones responding.11 11 : cf. Po-hu t'ung 2.14a. The Ode says,12 12 Shih 4 No. 1/3. With bells and drums13 13 : Mao shih has ; cf. Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 1.5a). we show our delight in him. This is illustrated in the above. 171 1 Cf. HSWC 1/1, 7/8, where Tsêng-tz? is the person involved. Shuo yüan 3.3b-4a and Chia-yü 2.8a-b both attribute it to Tz?-lu. When a fish out of water2 2 . The context requires a dry fish rather than a dried one. Cf. Hsün-tz? 1. [is hung up by] a thread in its mouth, it is not long before it is worm-eaten. The term of life of [a man's] two parents is brief as [a galloping horse] passing a crack.3 3 : an ellipsis for the cliché or one of its several variants (cf. TT 2587-8). A tree wishes to grow luxuriant, but frost and dew do not allow it,4 4 : I follow Chou and CHy in deleting the , which makes no sense here. SY also lacks it. and the worthy gentleman wishes to make his name, but his two parents will not tarry. [Truly]5 5 From HSWC 7/7 I insert . SY has . (Chao 21.) "one whose family is poor and whose parents are old is not particular about the office he will fill." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 18 No. 10/3. 26 Though it be like a blazing fire,7 7 "The royal House is like a blazing fire," demanding service. Shih-k`ao 4a-b would have Han shih read as quoted by a Hou-Han shu commentary instead of as in Mao shih and present texts of HSWC. The two characters are only variants, and both occur in Han dynasty texts when quoting Mao shih. Your parents are very near. The above is a development of this. 181 1 Cf. Li chi 43.6b (Legge 2.166). Confucius said,2 2 Not in Analects. "The superior man has three worries: That he does not know—can he not but worry? That he knows but does not study3 3 is inadequately rendered by "study"; it is the process that, applied to knowledge as well as experience and instruction, results in understanding. Cf. Hsin hsü 5.1b-2a: ; also Po hu t`ung 4.16b. [what he knows]—can he not but worry? That he studies but does not practice what he has studied—can he not but worry? The Ode says,4 4 Shih 23 No. 14/2. The quotation is connected with the preceding through the words and . When I have not yet seen the superior man, My sorrowful heart is very sad. 191 1 Cf. Li chi 9.24b-25a (Legge 1.176); Kuo yü 5.13a-b; CKT 6.59a; KTT 1.18b-19a. When Kung-fu Wên-po of Lu died, his mother did not weep. Chi-sun, hearing of this, said, "Kung-fu Wên-po`s mother is a virtuous woman. If she does not weep at her son's death, there must be a reason." He sent a man to make inquiries. [The mother] replied, "Formerly I had this son of mine serve Chung-ni. When Chung-ni left Lu, in sending him off [my son] did not go beyond the suburbs of the capital of Lu; in making him presents, he did not give him the family's precious objects.2 2 TPYL 441.5b adds "Moreover I have heard that the superior man values what is right and despises profit." (CHy.) When [my son] was sick I did not see any gentleman come to visit him,3 3 Read before : with TPYL, loc. cit. and when he 27 died I did not see any shed tears for him. But on the day of his death there were ten of his female attendants who, putting on sackcloth and white mourning clothes, followed him [to the grave.]4 4 Or "followed him [in death]." CKT reads (for ) "When he died of illness, two women committed suicide for him in their apartments." KTT says, "Two women from the inner apartments followed him in death." But Li chi says merely that "those of the inner apartments all wept until they lost their voices." Likewise Chia-yü. Kuo yü gives a quite different interpretation: "When Kung-fu Wên-po died, his mother cautioned his concubines, `I have heard that women die for the man who loves his household, and that gentlemen die for the one who cares for outside affairs. Now my son has died before his time, and I would dislike him to have the reputation of loving his household, to the shame of you women. As you go out together to sacrifice to him, please do not have a careworn appearance, or weep, or beat your breast, or show grief. Wear diminished mourning rather than extra mourning. Follow the rites but be quiet. Thus you will glorify my son.' " CHy thinks that in HSWC at least there is no question of their dying for him. This shows that toward gentlemen he was lacking, and toward women too generous. This is why I did not weep," The Ode says:5 5 Shih 45 No. 29/3. Here is this man, With virtuous words, but really not good. 201 1 Cf. SY 18.9a-10a; Chia-yü 6.11a-b; TTLC 13.3a-6b. Ma Kuo-han (Mu kêng t`ieh 14.9a) says, "Liu Hsiang's SY . . . also records this passage with minor variants in wording. The Chuan quoted by Han Ying should be the com. on the Lu shih. In the refinement of its discussion it resembles a passage in the TTLC." There is a traditional saying: "When Heaven and Earth are united, the generative force achieves its quintessence; when yin and yang wane and wax, [respectively], transformations are seasonable." If the time is right, the result is order; if the time is wrong, the result is confusion. Now man at birth is incomplete in five respects: his eyes are without sight, he cannot eat, or walk, or speak, or reproduce. By three months he can focus his eyes,2 2 . SY has ; Chia-yü has ; TTLC has . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 674) reduces these all to the meaning of "turn the eyes." (Chao 22-3.) and then he can see; by eight3 3 Following CHy, who emends to to agree with the text below: . TTLC, SY, Chia-yü, all have . CHy also deletes after , to balance with the phrases immediately preceding and following. months he grows teeth, and then he can 28 eat; by one year his kneecap is formed,4 4 : "the skull is formed." SY, TTLC have "grows a kneecap." I follow Chou and emend to , a variant of . and then he can walk; by three years his skull has grown together,5 5 : I follow Chao (23) and emend to . Shuo wên 4639 defines as "the suture in the head that covers the brain." and then he can speak; by sixteen the semen passes and then he can reproduce. Yin and yang revert from one to the other.6 6 : SY is clear: . Yin is linked in its transformations to yang, and yang is linked to yin. Now a boy grows teeth at eight months; he loses his milk teeth at eight years; at sixteen the semen develops and to some extent passes. A girl grows teeth at seven months; she loses her milk teeth at seven years, and at fourteen her fluids develop and to some extent flow. Thus in their transformations yang is linked to yin and yin is linked to yang.7 7 This phrase is not repeated in SY. The above passage is translated by M. Granet, with interesting remarks on the significance of the ages mentioned, in "Le dépôt de l'enfant sur le sol," Rev. Arch. 14.339 (note 1) and 340. Now when in an unworthy person sexual change is complete, the generative force is stimulated; his sexual feelings are excited, and he gives free rein to his desires, going against and upsetting his reproductive activities,8 8 Chou, CHy add the from SY. and so dying prematurely, fails to enjoy long life. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 84 No. 51/3. That person Has his heart only on being married. Greatly is he untrue to himself, And does not recognize [the law of] his lot. It is not thus with the sage. When his sexual vitality is overflowing, he thinks of getting posterity. He regrets that the occation cannot be taken advantage of,10 10 For read with SY. but if he has no regular way out, he then gives vent to his feelings and desires in singing of the Way and of i. The Ode says,11 11 Shih 68 No. 42/1. How lovely is the retiring girl! She has to await me at a corner of the wall. 29 Loving and not seeing her, I scratch my head, and am in perplexity. Look at that sun and moon!12 12 Shih 52 No. 33/3. Long, long do I think. The way is distant; How can he come to me? These are words referring to an urgent occasion. This is why it speaks of the sun and moon. 211 1 Cf. Hsin hsü 8.4a-b. When the Governor of Po, of Ch`u, was in difficulty,2 2 For this event cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist. 4.381-2. For the use of as a title in Ch`u, see ibid. 2.335, note 1. there was a certain Chuang Chih-shan,3 3 : Hsin-hsü has . CHy follows this and emends to . Chao (26) approves and quotes Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I shuo k`ao 2.12a): "The ku-chin-jên-piao in the Han shu lists a Yen Shan in the second middle fifth rank, who is the same as the Chuang Chih-shan in [HS]WC. To avoid the tabooed name of Han Ming Ti, has been changed to . Hsin hsü . . . correctly writes Chuang Shan, but without the . That common editions of [HS]WC write is because formerly and were used interchangeably, and is a corruption of . CHy . . . is right in correcting it from Hsin hsü." TPYL 429.6a has . Lei-chü 22.2a has ; TPYL 299.6a has ; both and seem to be misprints for . (Chao 26.) who took leave of his mother to go die for his prince.4 4 TPYL 429.6b and Lei-chü, loc. cit., have after . Chao thinks this gives a better reading: "because his prince was in trouble." His mother said, "Is it right to leave your mother to die for your prince?" He said, "I have heard that in serving his prince, a man takes pay for his own family but devotes his person to someone outside his family. Now what I use to support my mother is the salary I get from my prince. I beg to go die for him." On the way to the court he thrice fell down in his chariot. His servant said, "If you are afraid, why not turn back?" He said, "Fear is my personal feeling. To die for my prince is my public duty. I have heard that the superior man does not let 30 personal feelings interfere with his public duty." Then he went and died for him.5 5 : TPYL, loc. cit., has after , and Chao thinks it should be added here. CKCS 2.11a also has , but Lei-chü, loc. cit., lacks it. (Chao 26.) When the superior man hears of this he says, "Who really loves his duty (i) must, alas, carry it out." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 53 No. 34/1. If deep, I will go through with my clothes on; If shallow, I will do so, holding them up. This is illustrated in the above [story]. 221 1 Cf. Kuo yü 11.3a-b. At the time of Duke Ling of Chin the people of Sung killed [their] Duke Chao.2 2 For this event cf. Tso chuan 275 (Wên 16). Chao Hsüan-tz? asked Duke Ling for an army to aid [those loyal to] the Duke. Duke Ling said, "This is not the concern of the state of Chin." Hsüan-tz? said, "That is not so. The most important thing is [the relation between] Heaven and Earth; next comes [that between] prince and subject. [These relations] are the means whereby accord is brought about. Now they have killed their prince, and in so doing have turned against [the relation between] Heaven and Earth and have acted contrary to the Way of man. Certainly Heaven will visit them with calamity. If Chin, as Executor of the Covenant, does not go to the rescue, it is to be feared that Heaven's punishment will come to us. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 57 No. 35/4. When among common people there was a death, I crawled on my knees to help them. How much the more should one do so when it is the ruler of a state]!" Thereupon Duke Ling followed his advice by raising an army. When the people of Sung heard of it they gravely rejoiced, and the state of Chin daily became more prosperous. How was this? It came from their punishing the rebellious and preserving the accordant. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 57 No. 35/4. 31 When among common people there was a death, I crawled on my knees to help them. Chao Hsüan-tz? is an example of this. 231 1 Cf. SY 7.2b; Huai-nan tz? 10.12a. There is a traditional saying: "When the water is muddy the fish come to the surface for air; when orders are harsh, the people fall into disorder; if the city walls are [too] steep, they will [be sure to]2 2 SY and Huai-nan tz? both have , and Chao (28) thinks it should be added here to make a five-character phrase to balance the first two. collapse; if the bank is [too] steep it is [sure to] cave in." Hence Wu Ch`i, who made harsh criminal law, was torn to pieces between chariots;3 3 CKT ascribes this end to Shang Yang. For Wu Ch`i cf. Shih chi 65, where it says he was shot by rebels as he took refuge behind the corpse of the late king. Shang Yang, who made the laws severe, was torn limb from limb.4 4 Cf. Shih chi 79.19b, where Ts`ai Tsê says of Wu Ch`i, "His merit was established, and yet he ended by being torn limb from limb." There is the same confusion of the traditional deaths of the two men in Huai-nan tz?. SY omits these two sentences. The governing of a state may be compared to tuning a lute. When the large strings are too tight, the small strings break. Truly, "he who tightens bridle and bit is not a thousand-li charioteer." The sound that has sound does not go beyond a hundred li; the sound without sound spreads to the ends of the world.5 5 Cf. Li Ki 2.393 ff. on , of which this is reminiscent. Thus one whose pay exceeds his services is pared down, and one whose reputation exceeds the reality suffers loss. When feelings and actions are in accord with reputation, disaster and prosperity do not arrive without cause. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 60 No. 37/2. Why does he rest without stirring? It must be he has someone to be with. Why does he prolong the time? There must be a reason for his conduct. Truly, only when there is inaction is one no longer hampered by the external world,7 7 Cf. Tao tê ching 2.11b. even though he prolongs his life. 32 241 1 Cf. SY 19.4a-b. There is a traditional saying: "Clothes and appearance are what delight the eyes; repartee and speech are what delight the ears; likes and dislikes, rejection and retention are what delight the mind." Thus the superior man is moderate in dress and correct in appearance, so that the eyes of the people are delighted. His speech is humble and his repartee apt, so that the ears of the people are delighted. He retains jên and rejects what is not jên, so that the people's minds are delighted. With these three [faculties] preserved in himself, even if he does not take office, his will be called fitting conduct.2 2 For cf. Li Ki 2.438. , where is explained as . Thus if [a man] preserves the good in his heart and daily renews it, then dwelling alone he is happy, and replete with virtue he acts.3 3 : Cf. Lieh-tz? 5.3a: , where Chang Chan's com. says . The Ode says,4 4 Shih 60 No. 37/2. Why does he rest without stirring? It must be he has someone to be with. Why does he prolong the time? There must be a reason for his conduct. 25 The types of jên are four, the least of which is that of scrupulousness. There is the jên of the saint, of the wise man, of the virtuous man, and of the scrupulous man. Above, he knows Heaven and is able to use its proper seasons;1 1 For cf. Mencius 208 (2/1.1). below, he knows Earth and is able to use its produce; in the middle he knows man, and is able to make him happy and at his ease: this is the jên of the saint. Above, he likewise knows Heaven and is able to use its seasons; below, he knows Earth and is able to use its produce; in the middle he knows man, and is able to cause others to let him do as he likes: this is the jên2 2 Chao (28) would add after to keep the phrases parallel. (CCSI 2b.) of the wise man. Being broad-minded, 33 he is tolerant of the masses3 3 : cf. HSWC 2/31, note 6. and [so inspires] the trust of the people; the way he achieves this end is not to hamper them in their seasons: this is the jên of the virtuous man. He is scrupulous, clean, upright, and correct. He hates disorder, but will not put it to rights; he loathes depravity, but he does not rectify it. Though he may live in a village, [for him] it is like sitting in dirt and ashes.4 4 Cf. Mencius 369 (5B/1.1): "He considered his being in the same place with a villager, as if he were to sit amid mud and coals with his court robes and court cap." He may be ordered to enter the court, but to him it is like going through hot water and fire. He will not command a people whom he does not esteem5 5 Ibid. or taste food of which he does not approve. Although he hates a time of disorder he thinks nothing of dying. Paying no attention to family ties, he reduces things to rule to an inauspicious degree. Such is the jên of the scrupulous man. There is a traditional saying:6 6 CHy says that old editions began a new section here. For the following saying cf. HSWC 1/27 and Hsin hsü 7.15a. "If the mountain is [merely] a pinnacle, it cannot be high, and if the water flows straight, then it cannot be deep." [In the same way,] if jên is scrupulous, then its efficacy is not great. One who aspires to rank with Heaven and Earth—that person's case is not auspicious. Such was the conduct of Po-i, Shu-ch`i, Pien-sui, Chieh Tz?-t`ui, Yüan Hsien, Pao Chiao, Yüan Ching-mu,7 7 : Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 2204) lists variants of this name from Lieh-tz? 8.6a; LSCC 12.5b, Hsin hsü 7.14a, and Hou-Han shu 59.5b. (Chao 29.) and Shên-t`u Ti. The measure of Heavenly Mandate which they received brought them only so far.8 8 : Emend to with Chou. Chao disagrees and proposes , quoting a similar passage from HSWC 1/27: as evidence. But the parallel passage from Hsin hsü 7.15a has , which supports Chou's emendation. They were unable to change it.9 9 I suspect the protasis for this phrase that paralleled the following has dropped out of the text. Even though they should wither away, they did not rid themselves of it. The Ode says:10 10 Shih 65 No. 40/1. 34 So it is!11 11 : Mao shih lacks . (CCSI 2b.) Heaven has done it;— What then shall I say? Although the jên of the scrupulous man is inferior, still the Saint does not despise it, because the means of rectifying the people lies therein. 261 1 Cf. Hsin hsü 7.13b-14a. Shên-t`u Ti2 2 Po t`ieh 2.40a, Ch`u hsüeh chi 6.13a have for . Both are read t`u.

Ts`ui Chia learning of this stopped him, saying, "I have heard that [the function of] the saintly man and the humane gentleman between Heaven and Earth4 4 I. e., in the world. is to be father and mother to the people. Now is it right not to come to the rescue of a drowning man by reason of [fearing] wet feet?"5 5 Emend to as in Hsin hsü and TPYL 61.3b (CHy); Ch`u hsüeh chi, loc. cit., likewise, with for before . Chou and Chao agree. In discussing this passage, Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 2271) mentions another quotation (Lei-chü 8.11b) which has . (Chao.) Shên-t`u said, "Not so. [Of old]6 6 CHy adds from TPYL, Ch`u hsüeh chi, loc. cit. Lei-chü, loc. cit., also has , and Hsin hsü has . Chieh by putting Kuan Lung-fêng to death, and Chou by killing the Prince Pi-kan, lost their empires. Wu by killing Tz?-hsü, and Ch`ên by killing Hsieh Yeh, had their states destroyed. Therefore the loss of a state or the destruction of a family is not [caused by] a lack of saints and sages, but it is the result of not using them." Whereupon embracing a stone, he sank into the River. When the superior man hears of this he says, "He was scrupulous indeed, but as to his being jên, this I have yet to see."7 7 Cf. Analects 276 (14/2.2). The Ode says,8 8 Shih 65 No. 40/1. 35 So it is! Heaven has done it;— What then shall I say? 271 1 Cf. Hsin hsü 7.14b-15a. Pao Chiao's clothes were so worn his skin showed through; he was holding a basket and gathering vegetables2 2 Following Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.3b), I emend to . TPYL 426.3a has . Chao (31-2) agrees it should be . when he met Tz?-kung on the road. Tz?-kung said, "My dear sir, what has brought you to this?" Pao Chiao said, "In the empire there are a host of teachers who have abandoned virtue. How could I not have come to this? I have heard that the man who keeps on acting when the world does not know him is acting wrongly,3 3 Before add from TPYL 426.3b and Hsin hsü. (CHy, Chao.) and he who persists in taking part when his superiors do not use him is spoiling his integrity. If his conduct is wrong and his integrity spoiled, and even so he does not desist, it is because he is deluded by profit." Tz?-kung said, "I have heard that one who finds fault with the time should not make his living on profit derived therefrom, and one who thinks his prince is impure should not walk in his territory.4 4 Chang Shou-chieh's com. on Shih chi 83.2b-3a quotes as "I have heard that one who disapproves of a government should not walk in its territory; and one who thinks his prince is impure should not accept any advantage from him." (Chao 32.) [Now you, sir, thinking your prince impure, still walk in his territory],5 5 : CHy and Chou add this phrase from Hsin hsü. TPYL 746.3a has , and the com. on Shih chi, loc. cit., quotes as "Now is it right that you should walk on his land and eat what is produced from it?" Chao thinks the sentence makes better sense ending with the interrogative "is it proper?" and finding fault with the times, you still gather vegetables produced therein. The Ode says.6 6 Shih 360 No. 205/2. Under the wide heaven, All is the king's land. Whose are these?"7 7 : CHy inverts to . Chao (33) cites TPYL 426.3a, which has . 36 Pao Chiao said, "Alas, I have heard that the sage is reluctant to take office but quick to withdraw, and that the scrupulous man is easily ashamed but thinks lightly of dying." Whereupon, casting away his vegetables, he forthwith stiffened in death on the bank of the Lo River.8 8 The com. on Shih chi, loc. cit., quotes as . Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 52.8a has in place of . (Chao.) occurs in a similar context in HSWC 9/3. The more usual expression is , for which cf. HSWC 1/25 and TT 1455, where 15 examples are collected. It shows a range of meanings, from "withered, dry" as applied to vegetation (Han shu 8.22a: ) through "wrinkled, dried up" of a person's appearance (Ch`u-tz`? 7.1b: ) to the present idea of "stiff [in death]" (Chuang-tz? 6.1a: "This is what gentlemen who betake themselves to the hills and valleys, who are always blaming the world, and who wither [by starvation] or throw themselves into deep pools, are fond of." [Legge 1.363]). can hardly be "stand until withered," especially in its occurrence in HSWC 9.3: . I am here supplying as necessary to the sense after Hsin hsü and the line just quoted. When the superior man hears of this he says, "He was scrupulous indeed and unyielding." Now "if a mountain is [merely] a pinnacle, it cannot be high, and if the water flows straight, it cannot be deep"; if one's conduct is scrupulous, its efficacy is not great. One who aspires to rank with Heaven and Earth—that person's case is not auspicious.9 9 Cf. HSWC 1/25. It may be said of Pao Chiao's case that it was inauspicious. His limitations and endowments were just enough to bring him to this [end].10 10 Hsin hsü adds . (Chou.) The Ode says,11 11 Shih 65 No. 40/1. So it is! Heaven has done it;— What then shall I say? 281 1 Cf. SY 5.1a-b. Formerly when the [Kingly] Way of the Chou was flourishing, the Chief of Shao was at court. The officials asked permission to summon the people of Shao.2 2 For "asked to build [a palace] in Shao where he might live," read as in the quotation in Liu Hsiao-piao's com. on Shih-shu hsin-yü 2B.45b and Lei chü 87.13a, TPYL 973.4a. (Wang Li-ch`i.) The Chief of Shao said, "Alas, for 37 me alone to put the people to toil—this was not the intention of our former ruler, King Wên." Whereupon he came out and betook himself to the people, hearing cases and giving out judgments between the paths and dikes of the fields.3 3 Liu Hsiao-piao's com., loc. cit., quotes as "Then he dwelt exposed under a t`ang tree and heard lawsuits." (Chao.) This is similar to Chêng Hsüan's com. on Mao shih: "The Chief of Shao heard lawsuits of men and women. Without adding to the labors of the common people, he resided under a small t`ang tree and heard cases there. The people of the country enjoyed his influence and rejoiced in his benefits; they thought of the man and payed respect to the tree." (Chou.) The Chief of Shao made his dwelling under a tree in an exposed place in far-off fields, and the people greatly rejoiced. The tillers of the fields and those who tended the silkworms doubled their strength to encourage him. Whereupon the harvest was great, so that the people had enough and each family had plenty. Later on there were arrogant, extravagant officials in power who did not sympathize with the masses. Taxes and levies became frequent and numerous. The people were in distress. The seasons for plowing and caring for the silkworms were missed. At that time a poet saw the tree under which the Chief of Shao used to rest and sang in his praise, as the Ode says,4 4 Shih 26 No. 16. [This] umbrageous5 5 : Mao shih has . sweet pear tree;— Clip6 6 : Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 1.18a) thinks an original in Han shih has been changed to agree with Mao shih. The quotation by Liu Hsiao-piao, loc. cit., agrees with present texts. (Chao 34.) it not, hew it not down. Under it the Chief of Shao rested. This is illustrated above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">38 CHAPTER II 11 1 Kung-yang chuan 16.10b-12b. King Chuang of Ch`u was besieging [the capital of] Sung. When he had rations for [only] seven days, he said, "If we exhaust these [supplies] without conquering, then we are going to withdraw and go back home." Whereupon he had the Ss?-ma Tz?-fan climb up on the mound built by the besiegers2 2 For "gate" CHy writes , which Shuo wên 5313a defines as "a wall that turns around a gate." Kuei Fu's commentary: "When a mound is erected for attacking a wall, it resembles a , and so the latter means a wall scaler." Kung-yang has , defined by Ho Hsiu as "a device for scaling a wall" . Sun-tz? 3.7b says "[Among the] methods for attacking a city wall, . . . that of building a mound takes three months to complete" . . . (cf. L. Giles, Sun Tz? on the Art of War 18-19). The com. says of : "Earth is piled up gradually higher and brought forward until it rests against the wall." (Chao 35). to spy on the town of Sung. [The Prince of] Sung sent Hua Yüan to climb up on the mound to intercept him. Tz?-fan said, "How are things with your state?" Hua Yüan said, "We are exhausted! We exchange our children3 3 To avoid eating one's own children. and eat them, splitting and cooking the bones." Tz?-fan said, "Alas! Extreme straits indeed! However, I have heard that in besieged states they gag their horses when they give them grain4 4 To keep them from whinnying? and send out the fat ones to meet the enemy. Now, how is it that you, sir, are so frank?" Hua Yüan said, "I have heard that the superior man, seeing another's distress, has compassion on him; while the mean man, seeing another's distress, rejoices in it. I saw that you seemed to be a superior man, and that is why I was so frank." Tz?-fan said, "It is so. May you exert yourself. Our army has only seven days' rations." Bowing, he left. 39 Tz?-fan reported to King Chuang. King Chuang said, "How are they?" Tz?-fan said, "They are exhausted. They exchange children and eat them, splitting and cooking the bones." King Chuang said, "Alas! Extreme straits indeed. Now all we have to do is take them and return." Tz?-fan said, "We cannot do it. I have already told them that our army for its part has only seven days' rations." King Chuang was angry and said, "I sent you to observe them. Why did you tell them?" Tz?-fan said, "If a state as small as Sung still has a subject who does not practice deceit, how can Ch`u lack them? This is why I told him." King Chuang said, "Nevertheless we5 5 I follow Chou and CHy and delete the after to agree with Kung-yang. The refers to the fact that Sung now knew of Ch`u's limited supplies. shall presently just take them and return." Tz?-fan said, "Let Your Highness stay here; I will just go home, if I may." The king said, "If you return, leaving me, with whom should I stay here? I shall return as you wish." Whereupon he went back with his army. The superior man approves their making peace themselves. Hua Yüan told Tz?-fan the truth and succeeded thereby in raising the seige and keeping intact the fortune of the two states. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 86 No. 53/3. That admirable gentleman What will he tell him? The superior man approves their telling one another the truth. 21 1 LNC 3.21a-b. Ying, the daughter of a gatekeeper of Lu was weaving with another [girl]. At midnight she cried. Her companion said, "Why are you weeping?" 40 Ying said, "I have heard that the Heir Apparent of Wei is unworthy; therefore2 2 . CHy cites TPYL 469.1a, which has ; likewise Lei-chü 83.12b. (Chao 36.) I weep." Her companion said, "That the Heir Apparent of Wei is unworthy is the worry of the feudal lords. Why should you weep because of it?" Ying said, "What I have heard is at variance with what you say. Formerly the ss?-ma Huan of Sung fell into disfavor with the Prince of Sung and left the country for Lu.3 3 : Chao remarks that this is not clear and cites Lei-chü, loc. cit., which has , and TPYL 979.4a, which has for . He suggests adding . His horse got loose and rolled in my garden and ate the mallows there. For that year I have heard that the gardener lost half his harvest. When the king of Yüeh, Kou-chien, raised troops to attack Wu, the feudal lords feared his power, and Lu sent him a present of girls, among them my sister. My elder brother went to see her and succumbed to the perils of the road. Now it was Wu who was overawed by Yüeh's army, but it was I who lost a brother. Viewed in this light, disaster and prosperity come one after the other.4 4 I follow CHy and read for , which does not fit the context. Lei-chü, loc. cit., lacks and has ; TPYL, loc. cit., likewise. Chao Yu-wen (107) would emend to : "One man's misfortune becomes another's misfortune." This certainly fits the context, but is unsupported by any text. Now the Heir Apparent of Wei is most unworthy and loves war. Can I, with three younger brothers, be anything but worried?" The Ode says,5 5 Shih 87 No. 54/1. A great officer has gone, over the hills and through the rivers; And my heart is full of sorrow. Is this not the same sort of thing? 31 1 LNC 3.4b-5a. D mistakenly quotes LNC 4.5a as a parallel, which begins, "The daughter of the marquis of Ch`i. . . ." CHy cites a parallel from Mêng-tz? wai-shu 4.1b. Kao-tz? asked Mencius, "Now marriage is not a matter managed 414 by individuals, so how is it that the woman of Wei got a section in the Odes?"2 2 The commentators are not in agreement as to the identity of this "woman of Wei"; however it seems reasonable to connect her with the woman mentioned in Shih 88 No. 54/2 quoted at the end. Cf. LNC for a setting. Mencius said, "With the intentions of the woman of Wei it is all right; without such intentions it would be carelessness. Like I-yin's behavior toward T`ai-chia:3 3 KTT 2.17b: "When T`ai-chia was in mourning, without understanding the way [to be followed by] a filial son, he still wished to take charge of the government. Thereupon I-yin sent him to live in T`ung, near to the grave of T`ang. He made him dwell in a place of mourning, banishing him and not permitting him to have charge of the government. After the three year's mourning was finished he brought him back. It was by these means that he raised up li and held fast to his duty in serving T`ai-chia. He led his prince to i and forced him to be filial. The true way is such that none practicing it meet with resentment." with the intentions of I-yin it was all right; without such intentions it would have been usurpation.4 4 Cf. Mencius 467 (7A/31.3). Now there are two [aspects] of the Way: the unvarying aspect which is called constancy, and the changing aspect called adaptation.5 5 For and cf. Legge's note in Analects 226: is "that which is always and everywhere right," and is "a deviation from that in particular circumstances, to bring things right." The one who, cherishing this unvarying way, holds ready this [capacity for] change and adaptability will succeed in becoming a sage. Now the woman of Wei in conduct succeeded in being filial and in her solicitude became a saint. If she was adaptable, what then?" The Ode says,6 6 Shih 88 No. 54/2. You disapproved of my [proposal], And I cannot return [to Wei]; But I regard you as in the wrong, And cannot forget my purpose. 41 1 Hsin hsü 1.2a-b; LNC 1.8a-b. This passage is translated by Legge, Shih, Proleg. 88-9. King Chuang of Ch`u-held morning audience until late. Fan-chi went down the hall to meet him, saying, "How late you have dismissed court! Are you not hungry and tired?" 42 King Chuang said, "Today I was listening to loyal and worthwhile discourse, so that I felt neither hunger nor fatigue." Fan-chi said, "This person Your Highness speaks of as loyal and worthy, is he a guest from one of the other feudal lords, or is he an officer of the Middle Kingdom?"2 2 : Ch`u was formerly considered not one of the states of the "Middle Kingdom." Cf. Mencius 254 (3A/4.12): "Ch`ên Liang was a native of Ch`u . . . he came northwards to the Middle Kingdom and studied . . ." However, Chao Yu-wen (107) may be correct in taking it here as "of our own state." King Chuang said, "Why it is my Prime Minister Shên."3 3 : Hsin hsü and LNC both make it Yü Ch`iu-tz?, who actually was minister to Duke Chuang. I cannot locate Shên. Fan-chi covered her mouth and laughed. The king said, "What are you laughing at?" [Fan-] chi said, "For eleven years I have been privileged to wait on4 4 : CHy would add after : "it was my good fortune." Chih-yao 8.20b has , and Chao (30) thinks it should be added here. your Highness when you were bathing and washing your hair by holding your towel and comb and by spreading your coverlet and mat. But there was never a time I was not sending men into Liang and Chêng to seek out beautiful women whom I could bring into Your Highness's presence. There are ten of the same rank as myself, and two who are superior to me. Not that I did not wish to monopolize your affection,5 5 Chao thinks this sentence has been shortened from the Chih-yao reading : "Not that I did not wish to monopolize your love and have your affection for myself." but I would not dare for private motives to keep other beauties in obscurity, and I want you to see more of them that you may be happy. Now Prime Minister Shên has been minister in Ch`u for several years, and I have never seen him advance a worthy man or retire an undeserving one. So how does he come to be taken for loyal and worthy?" At court next morning the King told Prime Minister Shên what Fan-chi had said. Prime Minister Shên withdrew from his place and put forward Sun-shu Ao. After [Sun-]shu Ao had governed Ch`u for three years, the state of Ch`u became hegemon. The historiographer of Ch`u, taking brush in hand, wrote in the records, "The hegemony of Ch`u was due to Fan-chi's efforts." 43 The Ode says,6 6 Shih 89 No. 54/4. Cf. Proleg. 89 for this variant. The hundred plans you think of Are not equal to the course I was going to take. Fan-chi is an example of this. 51 1 Shih-tz? (quoted in TPYL 378.7b); HFT 7.4b-5a, where the dialogue is attributed to Tz?-kung and Tsêng-tz?. When Min Tz?-ch`ien first appeared before the Master, he had a hungry look.2 2 : defined as the appearance of one living on a vegetable diet. Cf. Li Ki 1.286. Later on he had a well-fed look.3 3 : animals fed on grass and grain. Cf. Mencius 407 (6A/8.8). Tz?-kung asked him, "At first you had a hungry look, while now you have a well-fed look. Why is this?" Min-tz? said, "I had come out from the `reeds and rushes'4 4 : cf. Shih 195 No. 129, of which these characters form the title. The Ode tells of a difficult search. and entered the Master's gate.

I went out and saw plumed chariot canopies and dragon flags,6 6 : cf. Shih 591 No. 283. silken banners and fur garments following one another, and in my heart I rejoiced also at these. When the two [feelings]7 7 With B and the Yuan ed. supply , likewise TPYL 388.4b. Shih-tz? has and HFT has . (Chao 40.) were mutually opposed in my breast, I was not able to bear it. This is why I had a hungry look. By now I have become deeply imbued with the Master's culture,8 8 I follow B and the Yüan ed. to read for . TPYL, loc. cit., has , but lacks the characters . and, thanks to you gentlemen, I have been `cut and polished' and brought forward. Inside, I am clear about what is proper to leave and what to take up. Outside, the sight of plumed chariot canopies and dragon flags, fur garments and silken banners following one another is in my 44 eyes no more than excrement or dirt.9 9 For "a mound of pounded earth," I read with TPYL, loc. cit. This is why I have a well-fed look." The Ode says,10 10 Shih 91 No. 55/1. As from the knife and the file, As from the chisel and the polisher!11 11 Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 3.15a) thinks the Han shih reading was (as in B) for , and that the second line should be as quoted in TPYL 764.2a instead of , which is the Mao shih reading. 61 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 11.18b, 16b-18b. The chuan says: "How about rain coming after sacrifices for rain?" "There is no connection. It is like rain when there have been no sacrifices."2 2 This line in Hsün-tz? begins a new paragraph, after what here is the bulk of the section. "When stars fall and trees give out sounds, the people of a state are all afraid. How about that?" "These are the changes of heaven and earth, the transformations of yin and yang, and things that occur but seldom. It is all right to be astonished at them; to fear them is wrong. Now the pseudo-eclipse3 3 Cf. TT 2668 for other examples. Chu Ch`i-fêng thinks HSWC has copied Hsün-tz? wrongly. But is a technical term, explained as a "veiling" of the sun due to an excessive yin-emanation from the moon which, however, is not near enough to the sun to cause a genuine eclipse. Not being predictable, it is a serious omen. Cf. H. Maspero, "L'astronomie chinoise avant les Han," TP 26 (1929) .293-4. of the sun and of the moon, the unexpected4 4 I follow the Yuan ed., CHy, and B, and for "in the daytime" read as in Hsün-tz?, where it stands for (cf. Wang Nien-sun's commentary). C has . (Chao 41.) appearance of strange stars, wind, and rain out of season—there is no generation that does not at some time have [one of] them. If those in charge are enlightened and the government is equitable, though all should occur at once, there would be no harm in it. If those in charge are ignorant and the government is harsh, should they all be lacking, still there would be no benefit in it. 45 Now in regard to disasters in the world, it is evil portents among men that are most to be feared." "What do you mean by evil portents among men?" "Bad plowing harms the crop; bad hoeing harms the harvest. If the government is harsh,5 5 ; Yang Liang defines it as "authority is ruthless." it loses [the support of] the people. When the fields are overgrown with weeds and the crop is poor, when grain sells dear and the people are hungry, when there are dead men in the roads, when bandits and rebels rise up together, when superior and inferior are at odds, when neighbors treat each other with violence and those whose gates are on opposite sides of the street steal from each other, when li and i are not cultivated,6 6 I follow the Yüan ed., B, CHy, and Hsün-tz? to read for . when cattle and horses interbreed and the six domestic animals7 7 , namely, ox, horse, sheep, dog, chicken, and pig. produce prodigies, when servants and inferiors slay8 8 CHy says is to be read "assassinate." their masters, when father and son are suspicious of one another— these I call evil human portents: they are the products of disorder." There is a traditional saying: "The calamities of heaven and earth are hidden in their [time of] coming9 9 This phrase is lacking in Hsün-tz?, where the following is introduced by , "the saying has it." and the classical books10 10 So Yang Liang: . do not speak of the prodigies of nature." Transformations that have no use and calamities that are not impending should be left alone.11 11 Hsün-tz?, with for and for , gives this line quite a different meaning: "There is not need to argue about them, no urgency about looking into them." But the duties (i) of prince and minister, the relationship of father and son, and the distinctions between man and woman12 12 This line also occurs in HSWC 5/14. —these are to be "cut and polished"13 13 CHy and B have for . Cf. HSWC 2/5, note 11. and not neglected. The Ode says,14 14 Shih 91 No. 55/1. As from the knife and the file, As from the chisel and the polisher! 46 7 Confucius said, "If a person's mouth craves flavors and his heart desires idleness, I would teach him jên. If his heart desires repose1 1 The Yüan ed., CHy, and B have "war." Chou emends to . Chao Yu-wen (107) suggests as the expected anthesis to below. It gives the same sense as . and his body hates exertion, I would teach him respect. If he is fond of discussion but fears danger, I would teach him courage. If his eyes like colors and his ears like sounds, I would teach him i." The I [ching] says,2 2 Legge, Yi King 176. I have changed the phraseology slightly. "He keeps his loins at rest and separates his ribs3 3 The Yüan ed., CHy, and B have for . The latter is the reading of the modern texts of the I ching. CHy says they have the same meaning.

The Ode says,5 5 Shih 99 No. 58/3. Ah! thou young lady, Seek no licentious pleasures with a gentleman. These both prohibit license and forbid indulgence; they harmonize impulse and will.6 6 . Chao (42) thinks this does not conform to the usual style of the conclusions in HSWC and would emend to , and add at the end, as in 9/1-2: . The variation can be explained, I think, by the double quotation, which occurs in two other places in HSWC: 3/31, 6/13. 81 1 SY 3.13a-b.

But if rainfall comes, and the overflowing stream reaches it, then it is sure to collapse the first thing. Plants whose roots are shallow do not necessarily become uprooted. But if a gust of wind arises and heavy rain falls, then they are sure to be uprooted the first thing. If the 47 prince3 3 here can only mean "ruler." dwelling in a state4 4 : cf.

But one day there will be some unusual development: the feudal lords fight among themselves; men rush past, and chariots hasten forward. Suddenly disaster occurs, and only then for the first time does he experience anxiety. With parched throat and burning lips he looks up to Heaven and sighs. Does this help?5 5 , lit., "is he any closer [to what he desires]?" Though he hope for peace, is it not indeed too late? Confucius said, "Not to be careful before the event and afterwards to repent—alas! even though he repent, it is not enough." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 117 No. 69/3. Ever flow7 7 For Mao shih has . his tears, But of what avail is his lament? 91 1 Hsün-tz? 20.10b-11a; SY 10.19b-20a, Chia-yü 3.14a have a similar conclusion but are not otherwise parallel. Tsêng-tz? said, "The superior man has three sayings worth being strung together and hung on the belt. The first is, `Do not by taking in strangers exclude your relatives.' The second is, `[Do not]2 2 Before these two phrases Hsün-tz? has . Chao (44) thinks it should be added to balance the first phrase. blame others for your personal defects.' The third is, `[Do not]2 2 Before these two phrases Hsün-tz? has . Chao (44) thinks it should be added to balance the first phrase. call on Heaven after grief has come.' " Tz?-kung3 3 Tz?-kung does not figure in the passage from Hsün-tz?. said, "How is that?" Tsêng-tz? said, "By taking in strangers to exclude relatives— is this not reversing what should be? Blaming others for personal defects—is this not going wide of the mark? Calling on Heaven after grief has come—is this not too late?" The Ode says,4 4 Shih 117 No. 69/3. 48 Ever flow his tears, But of what avail is his lament? 101 1 Huai-nan tz? 14.3a-b. Now frost and snow, rain and dew are the agents that kill and give life to living things. Heaven has nothing to do with it, yet we honor Heaven. It is the officials who uphold the law and are responsible for civil functions who control the offices and the people. The prince has nothing to do with it, but still we honor the prince. The one who broke the ground and planted the [five] cereals was Hou-chi; he who opened [a way for] the Chiang and caused the River to flow was Yü; the one who heard trials and kept a mean was Kao-yao. But the one with the reputation of being a saint2 2 : read for with TPYL 401.5a, Lei chü 20.2b; likewise Huai-nan tz?. (Chao 45.) is Yao. Thus if one is possessed of the True Way of ruling, though he himself lack ability, he will certainly have those with ability to work for him. If one lacks the True Way of ruling, though he have a great deal of ability, still it will not help to preserve him. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 129 No. 78/1. The reins are in his grasp like ribbons, While the two outside horses move like dancers. The ability to control is honored. 11 According to tradition, Confucius said, "How admirable was Yen Wu-fu's charioteering! The horse knew that behind there was a chariot and thought nothing of it; he knew that there was a man in it, and him he loved. He was attracted by his uprightness and loved being employed by him. If the horse could speak, he would certainly have said, `What a pleasure today's gallop is!' "When we come to Yen Lun there has been a slight decline. The horse knew that behind there was a chariot and thought 49 nothing of it; he knew that there was a man in it and him he respected. The horse was attracted by his uprightness and accepted respectfully being employed by him. If the horse could speak, he would certainly have said, `Going and coming, may this man make use of me.' "When we come to Yen I the decline is complete. The horse knew that behind there was a chariot and thought it heavy; he knew that there was a man in it and him he feared. The horse was attracted by his uprightness but feared being employed by him. If the horse could speak, he certainly would have said, `Go and come, go and come: if you do not go, that man will kill you.' "Thus in driving horses there is method, and in governing people there is a right way. If the method is attained to, then the horse is contented and happy; if the right way is attained to, then the people are peaceful and tranquil." The Ode says,1 1 Shih 129 No. 78/1. The reins are in his grasp like ribbons, While the two outside horses move like dancers. This is illustrated in the above. 121 1 Chuang-tz? 5.11b-12a; Hsün-tz? 20.18b-19b; LSCC 19.13a-b; Hsin hsü 5.7b-8a; Chia-yü 5.1a-2a. Two versions are represented, one derived from Chuang-tz? and amplified by LSCC, and one from Hsün-tz?. Hsin hsü seems to derive from HSWC, while Chia-yü goes back directly to Hsün-tz?; see note 4. Yen Yüan was sitting by Duke Ting of Lu2 2 Chuang-tz? and LSCC have Yen Ho and Duke Chuang (of Wei?). on a raised platform, when Tung-yeh Pi3 3 For Chuang-tz? and LSCC have Ch`i . (Chou.) drove his horse [and chariot] past. Duke Ting said, "How well Tung-yeh Pi drives!" Yen Yüan said, "He is all right, but his horses are going to run away." Duke Ting was not pleased and said to his retainers, "I had heard that a superior man does not slander people; does he then really engage in slander?" Yen Yüan withdrew. 50 Suddenly a man from the Imperial Stables [came and] announced that Tung-yeh Pi's horses had run away.4 4 : B, C have as above and below. Chao (46) prefers on the ground that is a corruption from the Chuang-tz?-LSCC version. Hsin hsü with , has presumably copied from HSWC, as Chia-yü has and Hsün-tz? has . HSWC omits the following phrase from Hsün-tz?, which Chia-yü has (with two variants). Hsin hsü here too follows HSWC, omitting the phrase. Duke Ting . . . (?)5 5 "to lift" makes no sense. Hsin hsü has "to step across," and CHy thinks is a corruption of ?a a For this character, see table on page 358. , a vulgar form of . There may be a reflection here of Li chi 1.5b: "Do not step across the mat, [but] hold up your gown and hasten to your corner [of the mat]," where Lu Tê-ming glosses with and with . "He rose lifting his gown" makes sense, but the emendation is drastic. the mat and got up, saying, "Quickly send a chariot to call back Yen Yüan." When Yen Yüan arrived, Duke Ting said, "A little while ago I said, `How well Tung-yeh Pi drives,' and you said, `He is all right, but his horses are going to run away.' How did you know it?" Yen Yüan said, "From [principles of] government I knew it. In olden times Shun was expert in handling people and Tsao-fu was expert in handling horses. Shun did not wear out his people and Tsao-fu did not drive his horses to the limit. Hence, under Shun the people did not break down, and under Tsao-fu, horses did not run away. Now as to Tung-yeh Pi's driving,6 6 Chou has added here from Hs?n-tz?. Hsin hsü also has it. in mounting the chariot and holding the bridle, his style of managing was correct. In his evolutions and rushes, he was in complete accord with court ceremony (li).7 7 Likewise Hsün-tz?, but with for and for . Yang Liang seems to take in its literal meaning of "bit": "The bits and the horses' bodies [are straight]" (). he expands to "court ceremony." Hao I-hsing disagrees, making , as in Shih 17 No. 101, where Mao explains as . Hao paraphrases "the horses in their rushes were invariably well trained," and insists that the text should be punctuated to show that and are connected. His interpretation remains ambiguous, and does not seem to take account of the further parallel in . But from going through danger and traveling far he had exhausted the horses' strength; yet still he beat them without cease. Therefore I knew they would run away." 51 Duke Ting said, "Good. Can you drive the point a little further?"8 8 Supply with Hsün-tz? and Chia-yü (Chao), or with Hsin hsü, as the most closely related text. Yen Yüan said, "If an animal is pushed to extremity, he will bite; in the same circumstances a bird will peck,9 9 For "beak" read "to peck," with B, C and Hsin hsü. (Chou.) and a man will practice treachery. Since antiquity to the present day it has never happened that reducing the people to extremity has not been dangerous. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 129 No. 78/1. The reins are in his grasp like ribbons, While the two outside horses move like dancers. Good driving is illustrative of this." Duke Ting said, "I was at fault." 131 1 YTCC 5.5b-7a; LSCC 20.7a-8a; Hsin hsü 8.2a-b. After Ts`ui Chu had assassinated Duke Chuang,2 2 For the details of this incident cf. Tso chuan 514 (Hsiang 25). he ordered3 3 I follow Chou and emend to as in Hsin hsü. the nobles and Great Officers to make a covenant with him. The covenanters all had laid aside their swords before entering. Those who did not speak quickly or who did not touch the blood with their fingers were put to death.4 4 : the text is corrupt. B, C have in place of . CHy follows YTCC and Hsin hsü: . Chao (48) approves, and so in my translation. For the use of blood in formal oaths cf. Maspero, "Le mot ming," JA (1933) 287-8; also, "Le serment dans la procédure judiciare de la Chine antique," MCB 3.281-2. Over ten men had been killed when it came to Yen-tz?'s turn. He raised up the cup of blood, and, facing Heaven, said with a sign, "Alas! that Ts`ui Chu has been so unrighteous as to slay his prince!" Whereupon the covenanters all looked at him.5 5 For CHy insists on , "looked at their (?) feet." Ts`ui Chu said to Yen-tz?, "If you help me, I will share the state with you. If you do not help me, I will kill you: A straight 52 sword will pierce you, and a curved one will hook you. I hope you will think about it." Yen-tz? said, "I have heard6 6 is lacking in B, C. that he who, being deterred by profit, is unfaithful to his prince lacks jên, and he who permits himself to be forced by weapons to abandon his determination lacks courage. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 446 No. 239/6. Luxuriant are the dolichos and other creepers, Clinging8 8 : Mao shih has , and Chou remarks that some editions of HSWC write . to the branches and stems; Easy and self-possessed is the superior man, Seeking for happiness by no crooked ways. Can I be crooked, then? Straight swords may pierce me and curved ones may hook me, but I will not change." Ts`ui Chu said, "Let Yen-tz? go." Yen-tz? got up and went out. Taking the traces of the carriage harness, he mounted the chariot. His servant wanted to drive fast, but Yen-tz? clapped his hands and said, "The deer in the mountain forest—his fate is in the kitchen. Our fates are dependent on something, but how on hasty driving?" He proceeded peacefully, with calm demeanor, and so left. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 132 No. 80/1. His lamb's fur is glossy, Truly smooth and beautiful. That gentleman Rests in his lot and will not change. Yen-tz? is an example of this. 141 1 LSCC 19.6a-b; Shih chi 119. 3a-b; Hsin hsü 7.11a-b; CKCS 2.6a-b. King Chao of Ch`u had an officer named Shih Shê,2 2 : LSCC and CKCS write Chu. who was characterized by his impartiality and love of the right, and the king made him a judge.3 3 : cf. Li Ki 1.375, where it is explained by Chêng Hsüan as "the official who takes care of criminal cases." At this time someone killed a man on 53 the highway. When Shih Shê went in pursuit of him, it turned out to be his father. He returned to the court and said, "The person who killed the man was my father. To sacrifice one's father to perfect one's administration is not filial; not to put in operation the laws of one's prince is not loyal. My duty is to submit to punishment for having overlooked his crime and disregarded the law." He prostrated himself before the axe and execution block saying, "My life is in your hands." The prince said, "You pursued him without catching him; how can there be any blame? May you go on with your work." Shih Shê said, "Not so. Not to be partial to one's father is not filial; not to carry out the laws of one's prince is not loyal. To go on living when guilty of a crime deserving death is not honest. If Your Highness wishes to grant a pardon, it is the grace of a superior; but I cannot neglect the laws: such is the duty (i) of an inferior." Whereupon he would not leave the axe and execution block, but cutting his throat, died in the court. When the superior man hears of this, he says, "Pure and lawabiding—such was Master Shih." Confucius said,4 4 Analects 270 (13/18.2). "The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 133 No. 80/2. That officer In the country will ever hold to the right. Master Shih is an example of this. 151 1 Cf. TTLC 6.9a; Chia-yü 3.10b. With others generous and within himself strict; putting himself in harmony with the right,2 2 Wang Yin-chih (Ching i shu wên sec. 6b) would emend to in the meaning of "be at rest in," since that is the reading in Ss?-ma Chên's quotation in his com. on Shih chi 67.1b. Yü Yüeh (Ch`ün-ching p`ing-i 17.22a) believes that is a corruption of , which occurs in Shang shu 9.14b interchanged with , defined in Êrh ya 1.14b as "in harmony." I have followed Yü Yüeh. (Chao 51.) he was strict with himself without 54 being strict with others; not uneasy though [his] good qualities were not appreciated: such was the conduct of Ch`ü Po-yü. Hence those who were fathers wanted him for a son, and those who were sons wanted him for a father; princes wanted him for a subject, and subjects wanted him for a prince. His fame was bright among the feudal lords, and the empire longed for him. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 133 No. 80/3. That officer Is the ornament of the country. Such is the conduct of the superior man. 161 1 SY 8.20b-21a; Chia-yü 2.8b-9a. There is the following traditional story. When Confucius met Ch`êng Pên-tz? of Ch`i in the region of Yen, they put down the canopies [of their chariots] and talked for the rest of the day. After some time2 2 For Ch`u hsüeh chi 17.6b has "very much pleased." (CHy.) [Confucius] turned to Tzu-l? and said, "Yu, [bring]3 3 CHy adds from Ch`u hsüeh chi, loc. cit., and Chao (52) approves, as TPYL 818.8b also has . The would be construed with as in HSWC 2/26. ten rolls of silk4 4 : Ch`u-hsüeh chi 17.6b, followed by CHy, omits . TPYL has it, and Chao would not accept CHy's reading. Silk one ch`ang eight ch`ih in length rolled from both ends to form a double roll makes one p`i. Five p`i constitutes a shu-po, a bundle of standard size used as a formal gift. (Cf. I li 2.16a and Cho li 18.23b, Chia Kung-yen's subcom. on .) SY writes , and Chia-yü has . HSWC's reading could mean either ten p`i, i.e., two shu-po; or taking loosely as a classifier, ten shu-po. Possibly shu-po here is not to be defined so exactly and was felt to be merely "rolled silk," and so in my translation. I suspect is a mistake. and present them to this gentleman." Tzu-l? did not reply. After some time he again turned and said, "Yu, [bring] ten rolls of silk and present them to this gentleman." Tz?-lu replied abruptly,5 5 Cf. Analects 247 (11/25.4). KTCY has for , likewise SY and Chia-yü. (Chao.) "I once heard you say, Master, that 55 the superior man does not approve of gentlemen's meeting without introduction,6 6 . CHy prefers the quotation in TPYL 402.8a: ; but the passage is clearly attributed to SY; Chia-yä is the same but omits , and Wang Su's commentary explains as "introduction" , a definition apparently invented for the context. One would like to do the same for . Chao Yu-wen (107) says that alone has this meaning, but cites no textual support. nor of a woman's marrying without an intermediary." Confucius said, "Does not the Ode say,7 7 Shih 147 No. 94. On the moor is the creeping grass, And how heavily is it loaded with dew!8 8 CHy has for , following Shih k`ao. There was a beautiful man, Lovely, with clear eyes and fine forehead! We met together accidentally, And so my desire was satisfied. What is more, Ch`êng Pên-tz? of Ch`i is one of the sages of the empire. If on this occasion I do not make him a present, to the end of my life I will never [dare to] see him [again]. When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass and repass it in the small virtues."9 9 Cf. Analects 342 (19/11). 171 1 Cf. Yi King 304 (31 ). The superior man has a mind devoted to the good, but he has not the air of [striving to] surpass other men. His moral power is sufficient for him to rule over the empire, but he lacks an overbearing demeanor. His conduct is sufficient to reach to later generations, but not with a single word does he find fault with another man for not being good. Truly it is said, "The superior man is filled with moral power but is humble. He empties himself to receive [the influences of] others; he acts according to the exigency of circumstances without being carried away by their current;2 2 . There should be an after as in Yi King 354 ( 4) so as to balance with the next phrase. (Chao Yu-wen 107.) he adapts himself to things but is never exhausted. Though he may occupy a lowly position, 56 the people will want to hold him up; though he may wish to be without honors, can he do it? The Ode says,3 3 Shih 164-65 No. 108/2. That officer Is elegant as a flower. He is elegant as a flower; He is very different from the prince's escort.4 4 Legge translates, "But, perhaps, he is not what the marshaller of the carriages ought to be." Certainly this is not what it meant to Han Ying. Waley, The Book of Songs 24, has "More splendid than any that attend the duke in his coach," which makes good sense but is a little loose. I have used Karlgren's version (BMFEA 16.205). 181 1 Hsün-tz? 2.2b-3a. The superior man makes acquaintances easily, but it is difficult to be familiar with him. He is easily alarmed, but he cannot be forced. He fears suffering, but he would not avoid dying for the right (i). He desires what is advantageous, but he would not do what he considers wrong. In his relations he is friendly but not disrespectful;2 2 Of and , Yang Liang says . in speech he makes clear distinctions, but not so as to confuse the issue. How great! His i3 3 The Yüan ed., B, C have for . cannot be surpassed.4 4 For "lost" read with the Yüan ed. How satisfying!5 5 : CHy, B, C have , which could only mean "how sharp!" He is scrupulous and yet causes no harm. How mild! The brilliance6 6 I follow the Yüan ed., CHy, B, C and read for , "scope." of his jên and generosity is great. How he excels! He has that which distinguishes him from other men. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 165 No. 108/3. He is elegant as a gem. He is elegant as a gem. Very much he differs from the prince's followers.8 8 Cf. HSWC 2/17, note 4. 575 19 Shang Jung1 1 Shu ching 315-6: "[King Wu] bowed in his carriage at the gate of Shang Jung's village." Kung Ying-ta's subcommentary on Shang shu 11.15a quotes a legend from Ti-wang shih-chi about Shang Jung, but it has no connection with the present account. He is also mentioned by Wang Ying-lin in K`un-hsüeh chi-wên 2.34b (Shih chi 80.7b) and by Ch`üan Tsu-wang (Ching-shih wên-ta 2.3b). had once held the feather and flute.2 2 Cf. Li Ki 1.468: "In autumn and winter they were taught the use of the feather and flute." (Legge 1.345.) Cf. also Shih 62 No. 38/3: "In my left hand I grasp a flute; In my right I hold a pheasant's feather." The commentators both here and in the Li chi passage interpret the flute and feather as civil implements supplanting weapons, and so used in a dance in a time of peace. I understand it to mean here that he was a civil functionary and not qualified to employ military means to gain his ends. Relying on horse and foot soldiers, he wished to attack3 3 Ss?-ma Chên's subcommentary on Shih chi 55.7a in quoting this passage has "reform" for . Chao remarks that it makes good sense with what follows, but is not to be reconciled with the first phrase. [the tyrant] Chou, but was unable to do so. As a result he went into hiding in T`aihsing. When King Wu conquered Yin and set himself up as Son of Heaven, he wished to make [him] a san-kung.4 4 . Cf. HSWC 8/19. Shang Jung refused, saying, "I once relied on horse and foot soldiers, wishing to attack [the tyrant] Chou, but was unable to do so. That was stupidity. That I went into hiding without fighting was due to a lack of courage. Stupidity and a lack of courage are not sufficient qualifications for a san-kung." He persisted in his refusal to the end and would not accept the king's command. On hearing of this, the superior man says, "Of Shang Jung it can be said that having examined himself5 5 Cf. Analects 252 (12/4.3). he did not falsely represent his abilities. He was a superior man indeed. He put away from himself unearned food." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 170 No. 112/1/2/3. O that superior man! He would not eat unearned food! Master Shang is an example of this. 58 201 1 Shih chi 119.3b-4a; Hsin hsü 7.11b-12b. Duke2 2 CHy writes for ; likewise Shu-ch`ao 53-13b, TPYL 231.1b, Shih chi, and Hsin hsü. (Chao 54.) Wên of Chin had appointed Li Li to be chief judge.3 3 . Cf. HSWC 2/14, note 3. CHy follows TPYL, loc. cit., and omits the . As Shu-ch`ao also omits it, Chao agrees with CHy. Hsin hsü has , which further occurs in HSWC 10/20, and I retain it. For having wrongly permitted a man to be killed4 4 Hsin hsü: . (Chou.) he put himself under arrest in the court and asked for death from the prince. The prince said, "Just as there are high and low officials, so there are light and severe punishments. The inferior officer is guilty; it is not your guilt." Li Li replied, "In occupying my office as chief, I did not make way for inferior officers; in receiving a greater salary5 5 Chou, CHy both follow Shih chi and Hsin hsü to write for , and so in my translation. I did not share the profit with the inferior officers. Now when I have wrongly permitted a man to be put to death, that an inferior officer should be responsible for his death is unheard of." He [refused6 6 Supply from Shih chi. (Chao.) and] did not accept the command. The prince said, "If you insist on7 7 are added from Hsin hsü by Chou. CHy adds alone, while B, C, and the Yüan ed. lack both characters. considering yourself guilty, then I likewise am guilty." Li Li said, "When the laws are violated, punishment should follow:8 8 : TPYL, loc. cit., adds : "then punishments are neglected." (CHy.) when punishments are misapplied, death should be the result. Your Highness thought me able to judge obscure cases and to decide doubtful ones, and so you made me a judge. Now I have wrongly permitted a man to be killed; my crime merits death."9 9 : I follow CHy who emends to after ; TPYL, loc. cit., has "putting to death the guiltless," which also makes sense (Chao 55), but I prefer to avoid the awkwardly repeated . The prince said, "That you should leave your position, abandon your rank, suffer the working of the law, and be lost to the state10 10 ; a peculiar construction. CHy suggests , which is hardly an improvement. is not what I had wished for. Go quickly and do not bother me." 59 Li Li replied, "Your Highness' worries are disorder in government and danger to the state. When his army is defeated and his troops are in confusion, the general is worried. Now to serve one's prince when one lacks ability, or to hold an office through shady actions is to receive one's salary without deserving it. I am not one to deceive myself with my worthlessness." Whereupon he fell upon his sword and died. When the superior man hears of this he says, "Indeed he was loyal." The Ode says,11 11 Shih 170 No. 112/1/2/3. O that superior man! He would not eat unearned food! Master Li is an example of this. 211 1 LNC 2.21a-b, CKCS 2.6b. Chieh-yü, the madman of Ch`u, tilled the fields with his own hands for food. [One day] his wife had gone to the market and had not yet returned. The King of Ch`u sent a messenger with a present of one hundred i2 2 One equals 24 or about 240 g. Some commentators make it equal 20 or 22 ; cf. Mêng-tz? chêng-i 5.7a-9a for a discussion of these variations. of gold to his gate. [The messenger] said, "The great king has sent me to offer one hundred i of gold and wishes to request you, sir, to administer Huai-nan."3 3 I follow CHy and LNC to read for . CKCS has . Chieh-yü laughed but would not assent. The messenger in the end left without a definite answer from him. When Chieh-yü's wife came back from the market, she said, "When you were young, you practiced your principles (i); why do you abandon them as you grow older? How is it that the carriage tracks4 4 : Chou says it is used interchangeably with and CHy gives examples from Chuang-tz? 3.21a, and CKT 4.6b, where Pao Piao's commentary says is the same as , meaning "carriage tracks." outside the gate are so deep?" Chieh-yü said, "Today the king sent a messenger to offer me one hundred i of gold, wishing to have me administer Huai-nan."3 3 I follow CHy and LNC to read for . CKCS has . 60 His wife said, "You did not consent?" He said, "I did not!" His wife said, "When the prince wants to employ you, not to obey is disloyal, while to obey is to abandon your principles (i). It is best we go away." Whereupon the husband shouldered the boilers and pots, and the wife carried the loom5 5 : B, C, D have . CHy follows LNC and emends to , and Chao agrees, as CKCS also has . Any reading gives "instrument for weaving." on her head. They changed their names so that no one knew where they went. The Lun yü says,6 6 Analects 236 (10/18.1). "seeing the countenance, she instantly rises. She flies round, and by and by settles." Chieh-yü's wife was like this. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 172 No. 113/1. We will leave you, And go to that happy land; Go to that happy land,8 8 Instead of repeating , Mao shih writes , likewise B, C, D. Hsin hsü 6.14a quotes this ode as in A. (Chao 56). Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 5.12b) quotes Lu Wên-ch`ao as saying that the repetition was probably the old reading also of Mao shih. Yü Yüeh (Ch`ün-ching p`ing-i 5.9a-b) is of the same opinion, quoting several examples of repeated lines from Mao shih. He accounts for the corruption here by citing the method formerly used to indicate repetition whereby each word to be repeated was twice underlined, and surmises that in this case only the last two () got repeated. (Chao.) This is ingenious but I think hardly likely where all three stanzas present the same construction. I should suspect that it represents a variant in the Han and Mao versions of the Shih. There we shall find our place. 221 1 Hsin hsü 6.1a-b, SSTC 2.12b. Of old Chieh made a wine pond with dikes made of the dregs while he gave free rein to lascivious music.2 2 Shih chi 3.10b (Mém. hist. 1.200) attributes these acts to Chou of the Shang. There can be no question but that Chieh is meant here, for the remarks of I-yin and his reply about the sun are part of his legend, which seems to have acquired in addition something from that of the tyrant Chou.

They also said, Rejoice! Rejoice! Strong the four stallions5 5 Cf. Shih 96 No. 57/3. Chou and CHy are wrong in wanting to emend to (Chao Yu-wen 108.) Shining the six reins.6 6 Cf.

Chieh clapped his hands with a smack and noisily laughed, saying, "So you too speak of evil omens. My possessing the empire is like the sky's having a sun; is the sun [ever] destroyed? When the sun is destroyed, then I shall be destroyed too."10 10 Cf. Shu ching 175. Thereupon I-yin made haste without stopping until he came to T`ang, who made him his minister. It can be said that he "went to that happy land and there found his place." The Ode says,11 11 Shih 172 No. 113/1. We will leave you, And go to that happy land; Go to that happy land—12 12 Cf. HSWC 2/21, note 8. There we shall find our place. 62 231 1 Hsin hsü 5.13b-14a. I-yin left Hsia and joined Yin. T`ien Jao left Lu and went to Yen. Chieh Tz?-t`ui left Chin and retired to the mountains.2 2 Chao (59) says, "These three sentences summarize three episodes that have no connection with the following text, and it is to be suspected that they represent a commentary written at the side that has been wrongly entered into the text, or perhaps they were the beginning of the preceding section about I-yin's leaving Hsia, in which case it is the more certain that there has been something omitted after them. If we look for system in the structure of the text, the preceding section deals with I-yin's leaving Hsia and going to Yin, and quotes from the first stanza of Shih 172 No. 113; this section deals with T`ien Jao's leaving Lu and going to Yen, and quotes from the second stanza of the same poem; so the following section should have the story of Chieh Tz?-t`ui's leaving Chin and retiring to the mountains, and quote from the third stanza of the same poem. That our text lacks it should mean it has been lost. Hsin hsü 7.13a-b has the episode . . . and actually does quote stanza three of the same poem. This supports the supposition. Another possibility is that HSWC 2/21 mistakenly writes `Chieh-yü, the madman of Ch`u, left Ch`u and retired to the mountains' for `Chieh Tz?-t`ui left Chin and retired to the mountains.' In that case it should quote the third stanza and not the first." T`ien Jao served Duke Ai of Lu, but was not noticed. He3 3 is here repeated. Lei-chü 91.6a, TPYL 916.7b, Chih-yao 8.21a, Li Shan's commentary on Wên hsüan 28.28b all omit the two characters. TPYL 204.1a and Hsin hsü have them, but omitting them gives a smoother reading. (Chao 59-60.) said to Duke Ai, "I am going to leave Your Highness for a heron flight." Duke Ai said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Has Your Highness never seen the cock? On his head he wears a cap: he has civil culture. To his legs are attached spurs: he is possessed of martial qualities. Faced with an enemy, he dares fight: he has courage. When he gets4 4 Lei-chü, Chih-yao, TPYL, loc. cit., and Hsin hsü all have for . Po t`ieh 29.47a has and Li Shan's commentary, loc. cit., has .

When he keeps watch at night, he does not miss the time: he is trustworthy. The cock is possessed of these five virtues, [yet] Your Highness still has him boiled and eats him every day. Why is this? It is because the place he has come from is near at hand. Now take the heron: he goes a thousand li at a flight and stops 63 at the pond in Your Highness' garden. He eats your fish and turtles and pecks up your wheat and millet.5 5 : Lei-chü, Li Shan's commentary, loc. cit., TPYL 918.6a have "rice and millet." (Chao 61.) He lacks these five [virtues], yet Your Highness honors him6 6 Chih-yao, loc. cit., has "Why is it Your Highness still honors him?" This parallels the sentence above, and Chao thinks it should be added here. because the place he has come from is far away. I am going to leave Your Highness for a heron flight." Duke Ai said, "Wait while I write down your words." T`ien Jao said, "I have heard that one who eats another's food should not damage the vessels it is served in, and that one taking shelter under a tree should not break off its branches. Why then write down the words of a minister of whom you have made no use?" In the end he left and went to Yen. Yen made him minister, and within three years the government of Yen was in order and the country was without thieves or bandits. Duke Ai heaved a great sigh, and because of that occurrence kept away from the inner rooms for three months. He abolished the punishment of branding and cutting off the nose, saying, "If care were not exercised before, and there was [reason] for regret afterwards, how could replacement be made?" The Ode says,7 7 Shih 172 No. 113/2. We will leave you And go to that happy state; Go to that happy state—8 8 Cf. HSWC 2/21, note 8.

Day and night he gave himself no rest, taking care of everything in person, and Shan-fu likewise was in order.

While he rested his four limbs, preserved his sight and hearing, kept his mind and spirit quiet, the various officers still were in order. All he did was to make use of their numbers.5 5 Haloun, ibid., note 5, takes in the meaning of as in Hsün-tz? 1.7b, Kao Yu's commentary, and translates "er verliess sich ausschliesslich auf sein Verfahren."

Formerly Shên Pao-hsü stood seven days and nights in the court at Ch`in weeping without once stopping, and so preserved Ch`u. 65 Had he not been able to be assiduous and work hard, how could he have brought this about? Pi-kan in the face of death remonstrated the more loyally. Although Po-i and Shu-ch`i starved in Shou-yang, their determination showed but the stronger. Had they not been able to think lightly of death, how could they have acted thus? Tsêng-tz?, whose coarse clothes and worn hempen garments3 3 : Chou says the phrase is unintelligible. CHy equates with . Chao mentions in HSWC 9/27. Li Shan's commentary on Wên hsüan 60.14a quotes this as .

Had he not been able to endure poverty, how could he have acted thus? Now if a gentleman wishes to establish himself and practice the True Way, he will be able to do it only if he pays no regard to the difficulties involved. If he wishes to fulfill his duty (i) and make his name known, he will be able to do it only if he pays no attention to profit or loss." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 179 No. 117/2. That gentleman there Is large and generous Except for a superior man of fine generosity and self-cultivation,6 6 : B, C have , wrongly, as CHy remarks. Chou thinks the is an extra character, and I have omitted it in my translation.

Yün. Among the rich men of Ch`ên there was one named 66 Ch`u-shih with a hundred decorated chariots, who gave himself up to feasting on [Mt.] Yün.1 1 For TPYL 472.6a writes . Mr. Wang Li-ch`i has collected many examples of "ornamented chariots" (as Ch`ien-fu lun 3.7b, Fo kuo chi , passim), and it is best to accept that reading here in preference to the rather far fetched explanation advanced by Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.4b-5a). Tz?-lu said to Wu-ma Ch`i, "If, without forgetting what you [now] know, but also without advancing any in what you [now] are capable of, you attained to such wealth as this, provided you would never get to go back and see the Master again, would you do it?" Wu-ma Ch`i, looking toward Heaven with a deep sigh, stopped2 2 : Chou defines it as in my translation: . and threw his sickle to the ground saying, "I have heard from the Master that a brave gentleman never forgets that he may lose his head, while the determined gentleman or the man endowed with jên never forgets [that his end may be] in a ditch or a stream.3 3 Mencius 261-2 (3B/1.2), where the order is slightly different and is lacking. The remark is there also attributed to Confucius. Is it that you do not know me? Or are you trying me? Or is it perhaps your own intention?" Tz?-lu was mortally ashamed and,4 4 CHy correctly expunges , which probably was inserted here from its legitimate occurrence in the same phrase below. shouldering his firewood, went home first. Confucius said, "Well, Yu,5 5 as a form of address in familiar discourse also occurs in HSWC 7/6. why do you come back first when you went out in company?" Tz?-lu said, "A while ago I was gathering firewood with Wu-ma Ch`i at the foot of Mt. Yün. Among the rich men of Ch`ên there is one named Ch`u-shih with a hundred decorated chariots, who has given himself up to feasting on Mt. Yün. I said to Wu-ma Ch`i, `If, without forgetting what you [now] know, but also without advancing any in what you [now] are capable of, you attained to such wealth as this, provided you would never get to go back and see the Master again, would you do it?' And Wu-ma Ch`i, looking toward Heaven with a deep sigh, stopped and threw his sickle to the ground, saying, `I have heard from the Master that a brave gentleman never forgets that he may lose his head, while 67 the determined gentleman or the man endowed with jên never forgets [that his end may be] in a ditch or a stream. Is it that you do not know me? Or are you trying me? Or is it perhaps your own intention?' I was mortally ashamed, and so it was that I shouldered my firewood and came back first." Confucius took up his lute and played on it, singing the Ode,6 6 Shih 183 No. 121/1. Su-su go the feathers of the wild geese, As they settle on the bushy oaks. The king's affairs must not be slackly discharged, And [so] we cannot plant our millets; What will our parents have to rely on? O thou distant and azure7 7 For as in Mao shih, CHy writes .

If you are willing. . . ."8 8 : the text is defective. (Chou.) 27 Confucius said, "There are five [kinds of] gentlemen. There are those whose power is honored, those whose families are wealthy, those whose disposition is bold, those whose minds are keen,1 1 Chou thinks should be . Chih-yao 8.22a and KTCY both have , and I have so emended; likewise below. (Chao 65.) and those whose appearance is handsome.

(Chao.) on account of it. Those whose families are wealthy do not use [their wealth] to help the poor and aid the destitute, but on the contrary use it to be wasteful and extravagant without measure. Those whose disposition is bold do not make use of it to guard their prince and attack in battle, but on the contrary they make use of it for usurpation and private quarrels. Those whose minds are keen1 1 Chou thinks should be . Chih-yao 8.22a and KTCY both have , and I have so emended; likewise below. (Chao 65.) 68 do not use them to rectify calculations, but on the contrary they use them to practise deceit and gloss over dishonesty. Those whose appearance is handsome do not use it in unifying the court and managing the people, but on the contrary use it to bewitch women and make them accede to their desire. These five types of so-called gentlemen are neglecting their fine qualities." The Ode says,4 4 Shih 193 No. 128/1. Looking bland and soft as a piece of jade; Living there in his plank house; It sends confusion into all the corners of my heart. 28 In meeting someone of superior qualities, his appearance is what one first notices;1 1 : the context seems to force the punctuation after .

His conduct is refined and worth observing.3 3 : CHy, B, C, D have for : "[Even] after a long time his conduct is worth observing." Lei-shuo has , also for . (Chao.) Hence as for the external appearance of the superior man, the empire takes it as a model and looks up to it, [considering] that he is recognizable as a ruler of men without having recourse to his language.4 4 : B, C, D have for and for and Chou says of this that it is superfluous. CHy emends to , which makes the best sense, but is unsupported by any citation. (Chao 67.) I follow B. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 197 No. 130/1.

When Tz?-hsia had completed his reading of the Odes,2 2 SSTC, KTT both have , also in the following, and the former specifically mentions sections of the Shu ching. CHy thinks is an ill-considered change by someone to familiar with Analects 157 (3.8), and he writes throughout. I think it likely that Han Ying himself deliberately adapted the material to his own purposes. The text offers several other divergencies from the other two accounts. the Master asked him, "What can you say about the Odes?"3 3 : B, C, D have "What have you found to appreciate in the Odes? SSTC and KTT have . From the preceding , an interrogative seems likely, and so in my translation.

Analects 144-5 (1/15.3). CHy would change to to agree with SSTC and KTT, and also would omit for the same reason. I prefer to keep the Analects reading. But as yet12 12 CHy says should be . you have seen only the externals and not what is within." Yen Yüan said, "Having finished with the externals, what more is there to see within?" Confucius said, "If you peep through the door without entering, how can you know where its hidden treasures are? But that they are hidden is not what is difficult.

One who does not see what lies within cannot be called refined or profound [in his understanding of the Odes]." 30 According to tradition, in a state that is without the True Way there will be whirlwinds and pestilence; torrential rains will break down the trees. Yin and yang will emit a perverted emanation; summer will be cold and winter warm; ripening1 1 For I read ; Chung-hua ta tz?-tien gives an examples of used for also Chao Yu-wen (109). will be in spring and growth in autumn; sun and moon will have no brightness; stars and constellations will go astray;2 2 Cf.

Here must have the meaning given in the translation. the people will suffer from many diseases; the state will endure many inauspicious things; human beings will not live out their span, and the five grains will not ripen.3 3 Cf. Mencius 250 (3A/4.7) and Li Ki 1.106. In the time of Ch`êng-chou, yin and yang 71 were adjusted, cold and heat were regulated, manking was perfect and all things were tranquil. Truly it is said that their customs were ordered, their joy was continuous, their driving of horses was humane.4 4 None of these phrases occurs verbatim in the Shih. Cf. Shih No. 167/6 .

Hsün-tz? writes , and Yang Liang paraphrases, "illuminate him with disaster to let him know fear." . him with disaster. If good and upright, integrate him with ritual (li) and music. 72 In general the most direct way to control the breath and nourish the mind is to follow ritual (li); the most important thing is to get a teacher; the most prudent thing is to love but one thing. From loving one thing comes breadth, from breadth essence, from essence spirituality, from spirituality transformation. It is for this reason the superior man devotes himself to binding his mind to the one. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 222-3 No. 152/1. The virtuous man, the princely one, His deportment is one, His deportment is one, His mind is as though bound [to what is correct]. 321 1 Li chi 36.1b-2a. If jade is not polished, it will not be a perfect vessel; if a man is not taught, his will not be perfect conduct. Though you have in your house jade worth a thousand [pieces of] gold, you still will be poor unless you know how to handle it. If a good craftsman works on it, then it will be valued and handed down to posterity. When a superior man studies,2 2 For B, C, D and the Yüan ed. have "plan." Chao Yu-wen (109) thinks the text is defective before this phrase. then he is of use to the state. Truly in his movements he makes the people easy, and his deliberations result in an extension of human life. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 224 No. 152/4. The virtuous man, the princely one, Rectifies the people of the state. He rectifies the people of the state:— May he continue for ten thousand years! 331 1 Li chi 18.16b-17b; 26.20a; 61.7a-b. The family of a woman who has been given in marriage does 736 not extinguish the light for three nights: [this is because] they are thinking of the separation. The family [whose son] has taken a wife does not make music for three days: [this is because] they are thinking that he [soon] will succeed his father. For this reason in the ceremony (li) of marriage, congratulations are not offered, since the generation of men [is about to change]. After three months [the bride] is presented in the ancestral temple and announced as the [newly] arrived wife [of the son]. On the following day she is presented to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, who descend from the steps on the west; the bride descends2 2 Both Chou and CHy would emend to as in Li chi. from the steps on the east and is led into her own apartments. Sad thoughts for three days and abstinence from killing for three months are due to the feelings of the filial son. Truly ceremony (li) is ordered after men's feelings. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 238 No. 156/4. Their mothers have tied their sashes; Ninety is the number of her ceremonials.4 4 The unual interpretation is "complete" or "practically complete." Karlgren (BMFEA 16.220) ". . . are both 9 and 10." Han Ying's interpretation can be inferred from the concluding line. It speaks of the many ceremonials. 341 1 Wên-tz? 4.4b; Huai-nan tz? 14.2a. By investigating the will of Heaven and controlling the workings of the mind, by putting in order likes and dislikes and making emotions and one's own nature agree, control of the True Way is achieved. By investigating the Will of Heaven, one avoids being confused about disaster and good fortune. When one is not confused about disaster and good fortune, activity accords with reason.2 2 : Chih-yao 8.22a has after . Huai-nan tz? has , and Wên-tz? Chao (66) thinks is a mistake for (cf. HSWC 2/6, note 6), and should be added from Chih-yao to complete the sense. When one controls the workings of the mind, one is not happy or angry without cause. When one is not happy or 74 angry without cause, in rewards and punishments there is no favoritism. When likes and dislikes are put in order, one does not covet what is useless. When what is useless is not coveted, one does not do violence to one's nature through attachment to things.3 3 "the nature of things is not injured." Chao would follow Chih-yao 8.22b: , and so in my translation. Huai-nan tz? has (Wên-tz? omits ). When the emotions and one's own nature are made to agree, desires do not exceed proper limits. When desires do not exceed proper limits,4 4 . . . "there are no excessive desires; when there are no excessive desires. . . ." In the translation I follow Chih-yao, loc. cit.: . . . . Huai-nan tz? is the same; likewise Wên-tz?, except for . (Chao 70.) one's own nature is nourished and one knows enough to be content. These four are not to be sought outside, nor are they to be derived from another. Turn to yourself for them and there they are. Such a man is one to delight others (?).5 5 : this is not clear.

Shun is not mentioned, and the whole is condensed, though SY also has the quotation at the end. Lu shih () 12.26b is based on HSWC. Tradition tells us that, of old, because Shun's pots and pans did not smell of cooking,2 2 Meaning that Shun gave an example of frugality by not leaving food on his plate. CHy says is a vulgar form of , which is the reading in Ch`u-hsüeh chi 1.15a; TPYL 757.8b likewise. (Chao 71.) those below him did not offend by leaving [food uneaten].3 3 : Ch`u-hsüeh chi, loc cit., has , wrongly, CHy thinks; see note 5. TPYL 81.3a is the same, with for . (Chao.) Because he ate from earthen dishes4 4 : CHy quotes Lü Ching as cited by Pei Yin, "a vessel for food is called ." Its usual meaning is "sacrificial vessel." HFT 3.5b applies the line to Yao. and drank from earthen vessels, craftsmen did not offend by exercising skill.5 5 "and farmers did not offend by being strong"; this makes no sense with the preceding. Chao thinks that the sentence , which in Ch`u-hsüeh chi and TPYL follows (see note 3 above), should be here. Lu shih has this reading. Because [he wore] deerskin garments with coarse cloth collars,6 6 ?d d For this character see the table on p. 358. : B, C have ?e e For this character see the table on p. 358. "vase." Chou suggests that ?d d For this character see the table on p. 358. may be an error for , used for , and so in the translation. CHy quotes the expressions and from SSTC and YTCC respectively, and accordingly would make ?d d For this character see the table on p. 358. or , giving the meaning of "crooked collars." women did not offend by being extravagant.7 7 For I follow Chao and read as in Lu shih. Since his regulations for [the masses] below were easy to follow, services being few and easy to perform successfully,8 8 : CHy suspects that should be omitted, but Chao cites Lu shih, which has without , and so in the translation. the people did not offend by being [too much] governed. Truly the Great Way is greatly tolerant, great virtue is greatly humble,9 9 For I follow CHy, B, C to read . and the Saintly Ruler is sparing of action. Hence things used by him always prosper. 76 There is the traditional saying:10 10 Yi King 349. "With the attainment of such ease and such freedom from laborious effort, the mastery is got of all principles under the sky."11 11 B, C, and the Yüan ed. insert the quotation from Shih 574 No. 270 here and also repeat it at the end. For a sincere person it is easy to perform li; for an honest one it is easy to speak. For the sage it is easy to govern the people; for the craftsman it is easy to handle materials. The Ode says,12 12 Shih 574 No. 270. Ch`i13 13 B, C have for . Legge punctuates after , making it the name of a mountain: see his note in loc. had level roads And their descendants have preserved them. 21 1 Parallel accounts occur in LSCC 6.7a-7b (Wilhelm 74); SSTC 2.15a-b; Shih chi 3.7a (Mém. hist. 1.190); SY 10.7b-8a, 1.15b-16a-b. HSWC is based directly on LSCC; see note 2. During the Yin dynasty a ku started to grow in T`ang's courtyard.2 2 There are three rulers variously associated with this incident, and Chao (72-3) has assembled the citations for each: LSCC agrees with HSWC in making it T`ang; Shih chi, Ti-wang shih-chi 29b, Shu ching (preface) 6, SY 1.16a-b, 10.7b-8a, and Chia-yü 1.27b-28a have T`ai-mou ; SSTC, SY 1.15b-16a, Lun hêng 5.1a, 2.11a, and Hsin lun 9.5b, have Wu-ting . Chao remarks that such accounts as this were valued for the virtuous conduct depicted, and no effort was made to attach them always to the same sage. is defined by Yen Shih-ku (Han shu 25.3a) as a kind of mulberry. In three days3 3 The other versions are divided between one and seven days. (Chao 74.) it had become as large around as a man could embrace. T`ang inquired of I-yin, "What is this thing?" I-yin answered, "It is a ku tree." T'ang asked, "Why does it grow here?" I-yin said, "The ku is a wild plant that grows in marshes.4 4 : Chao thinks should follow . That it is now growing in Your Majesty's courtyard is not very auspicious." T'ang said, "What is to be done?" I-yin said, "I have heard that evil omens come before disaster, and auspicious signs precede good fortune. If on observing an 77 evil omen, one practices good acts, the disaster will not materialize; if on seeing an auspicious sign, one does not perform good acts, the good fortune will not come." T'ang thereupon fasted and lived quietly, rising early of a morning and retiring [late] at night. He mourned the dead and made polite inquiries after those who were ill.5 5 This description of the conscientious ruler appears again in HSWC 3/17. It is a stock formula for the accumulation of moral power (tê). He pardoned crimes and gave alms to the poor. After seven days the ku died. The predicted misfortune6 6 : here not "unlucky omens" as in DM 417 (24). never appeared, and the state prospered. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 576 No. 272. Revere the majesty of Heaven, Thus to preserve [its favor]. 31 1 This passage is from LSCC 6.7b-8a (Wilhelm 74-5), following almost immediately on the section above (3/2). In each case the quotation of the Ode is Han Ying's addition. Of old, in the time of King Wên of Chou, when he had ruled the country for eight years, in summer, the sixth month,2 2 For "in the sixth month of the year," I follow B, C and read . he took to his bed with illness. After five days there was an earthquake, which, to the east, west, south, and north, did not extend beyond the outskirts of the capital. The functionaries all said, "We have heard that earthquakes occur because of the ruler. Now Your Majesty has been sick in bed for five days, and there has been an earthquake that did not extend beyond the outskirts of the capital in any direction. Your subjects are all frightened and we request that it may be averted." King Wên said, "How are we going to avert it?" They replied, "Undertake a [public] work and put the masses in motion so as to add to the city's walls: perhaps we can thereby avert it." King Wên said, "It will not do. The Way of Heaven, in causing an evil omen to appear, is thereby to punish the guilty.3 3 Chou prefers the easier reading in LSCC: "Heaven lets evil omens appear to punish the guilty." I must 78 be guilty, and hence this is to punish me. Now to go out of my way to undertake a [public] work and to put the masses in motion so as to add to the city's walls, would be to double my guilt. It cannot be done.4 4 : both Chou and CHy agree that should be expunged. LSCC has , where looks like a contamination from a commentary. Han Ying's version certainly lacked the words, but the resulting text made the insertion of an attractive emendation to someone who did not recognize the following as King Wên's name, and wanted the line to read "We cannot prosper by such means." I wish to reform my conduct and multiply good acts to avert it; I believe it can be avoided." Thereupon he took pains with li and [rules of] precedence,5 5 : both Chou and CHy would expunge . CHy has for . LSCC has . and with [gifts of] furs made friends with the feudal lords.6 6 : likewise LSCC. I do not understand what is implied by . The phrase occurs in Mencius 176 (1B/15.1) meaning gifts of skins and silks, and presumably that is the meaning required here. He made his speech elegant and presented capable officers with gifts of silk. He apportioned titles and rank; he measured out fields to confer on those who were deserving. Not long after he and his ministers had put these into practice, his illness was cured.7 7 . LSCC after reads , etc. Accordingly Chou would delete and punctuate after : ". . . to confer on those who were deserving and on the several ministers. When he had put these into practice, it was not long before his illness was cured." King Wên had been on the throne for eight years when the earthquake occurred. After [the earthquake]8 8 Both Chou and CHy would supply from LSCC before , which otherwise makes an awkward beginning for a sentence. he ruled for forty-three years [longer]; altogether he governed the country for fifty-one years before his death. This was how King Wên dealt with an evil omen. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 576 No. 272. Revere the majesty of Heaven Thus to preserve [its favor]. 79 41 1 Based on Hsün-tz? 5.8b-9a (Dubs 131-2) with considerable rephrasing in the first part. The True King, in establishing degrees of virtue2 2 . . . I follow CHy and omit . Hsün-tz? has simply , where Wang Hsien-ch`ien takes to be the same as "rank, degree." HSWC, by adding , makes it necessary to take transitively. does not pay honor to those without merit, or give office to those who lack virtue, or punish those not guilty of crime. He has no worthless officers at court,3 3 : CHy B, C, D, Hsün-tz? have for . Yang Liang (Hsün-tz? 6.3b) defines as "those who draw a salary though they are worthless" . and no parasites4 4 : Yang Liang, ibid.: "those who eat though idle." among the people. Thus it is possible for him to elevate the worthy and employ the able without over-stepping precedence, as well as to eliminate the cruel and exclude the overbearing without going to excess in punishments. The people are understanding, and all know that those who do good at home are rewarded in court, and those who do evil in secret are punished in public. Now this is what may be called establishing degrees; this [makes manifest] the inner power of the True King. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 578 No. 273. Brilliant and illustrious is the House of Chou; He has regulated the positions of the princes. 51 1 Adapted from Hsün-tz? 4.11a-12b (Dubs 102-3). A tradition states:2 2 here refers to Hsün-tz?, where the words are lacking. To think conformity with the world good, to consider material wealth precious, and to take self-cultivation as the highest3 3 B, C have for . conduct for the individual—such is the popular idea of virtue, but it is insufficient for the gentleman. His conduct is upright, his will inflexible, nor does he allow his personal desires to warp what he hears:4 4 I. e., from his teacher. thus the correct gentleman, but it is insufficient for the superior man. His conduct is upright, his will 80 inflexible; he likes to cultivate what he hears to stabilize his character.5 5 : Hsün-tz? has . His speech and conduct for the most part are appropriate, but still the latter is not [wholly] natural, nor is the former [wholly] lucid.6 6 ? : Hsün-tz? is more definite: . . His intelligence for the most part is apt, but it is not perfectly subtle. If in a high position, he is able to make those whom he considers outstanding great; in a low position, he opens the true way to those inferior to himself:7 7 : grammatically it is interesting that Han Ying has changed the inverted form (), normal to the style of Mencius and Hsün-tz?. thus the sincere and generous superior man, but it is insufficient for the saint. When he goes [to rectify]8 8 Add before as in Hsün-tz?. (Chou.) the methods of the Hundred Kings, it is as easy as distinguishing black and white. He accommodates himself to his time as easily as one enumerates the Three Rules.9 9 : the relations between prince and minister, father and son, husband and wife. Cf. Po-hu t`ung 7.15a. Hsün-tz? simply has . Practicing li and adhering to limits is as natural to him as his having four limbs.10 10 : for CHy, B, C have "move." Hsün-tz? has , a word frequently written in HSWC; cf. the opening sentence above. He adapts himself to change and establishes his merit11 11 : Hsün-tz? has , and the similarity of and may have caused the substitution of for . Chou also would emend to . as [inevitably as] the four seasons succeed one another. [Through him] the empire achieves order and all things dwell at peace: thus the saint. The Ode says,12 12 Shih 578 No. 273. Brilliant and illustrious is the House of Chou; He has regulated the positions of the princes. 61 1 Cf. Shih chi 44.44a-5b (Mém. hist. 5. 143-7); SY 2.5b-7a. The Shih chi version is very close to HSWC, while SY, with many variants in wording, seems to represent another source, or more likely a free rewriting of the story of Liu Hsiang. Marquis Wên of Wei wished to appoint a prime minister. Summoning Li K`o, he inquired saying, "I wish to appoint a prime 81 minister, and it is to be either Chai Huang, or Wei Ch`êng-tz?.2 2 : SY has , and LSCC 19.19a mentions a younger brother of Marquis Wên of Wei named . (Chou and CHy.) Chao (76) agrees with Liu T`ai-kung (in Ching-chuan hsiao-chi 27b) in preferring , but Shih-chi has . I wish to take your advice in this matter."3 3 Lit., is "consult you as an oracle." Li K`o, withdrawing from the mat, declined, saying, "I have heard that a person of mean rank does not dispose of one who is of honorable rank, nor does a stranger come between relatives.4 4 Wei Ch`êng-tz? is the younger brother of Marquis Wên; see note 2. I dwell outside [the palace], and so dare not accept your command." Marquis Wên said, "Sir, feel yourself free to manage this affair." Li K`o said, "Now if you would investigate a man, when he is living at home, see what he loves; when he is rich, see what he gives away; when he is successful, see whom he recommends; when he is in extremity, see what he will not do; when he is poor, see what he will not take. These five situations suffice for an investigation." Marquis Wên said, "You may go home, sir. My prime minister has been decided upon." Li K`o went out and met Chai Huang, who said, "Today I hear the prince summoned you to advise about a prime minister. Who is it to be?" Li K`o said, "It will be Wei Ch`êng-tz?." Chai Huang, taken aback, colored up and said, "How am I inferior to Wei Ch`êng-tz?? The governor of Hsi-ho5 5 Namely Wu Ch`i , according to SY 2.8a (Mém. hist. 145, note 1). was put forward by me. When the Prince was worried by [the district of] Yeh, I put in Hsi-mên Pao. When the Prince wished to attack Chung-shan, I brought forward Yo Yang. After Chung-shan had been captured and there was no governor [for the district], I got you the appointment. When our Prince wished to appoint a tutor for the Heir Apparent, I got the place for Chao Ts`ang[-t`ang].6 6 CHy adds from HSWC 8/9, where the name occurs in that form. All of these [men] were perfectly deserving and served faithfully. How am I inferior to Wei Ch`êng-tz??" Li K`o said, "When you mentioned me to your Prince, surely 82 it could not have been with the idea of using the connection to seek high office? Our Prince asked me about the appointment of a prime minister, [saying], `It is to be either Ch`êng or Huang, [one of] the two. How about it?' And I replied, `[If Your Highness is undecided,] it is because he has not made a careful examination [of the men]. When they are living at home, see what they love; when they are rich, see what they give away, when they are successful, see whom they recommend; when they are in extremity, see what they will not do; when they are poor, see what they will not take. These five determine it; what is the use of waiting for [advice from] me?' This is how I know that Wei Ch'êng-tz? is to be the prime minister. For how can you be compared with Wei Ch`êng-tz??7 7 Chao would add as in Shih chi and in the same sentence below. He has an allowance of a thousand chung [of grain],8 8 CHy, B, C have for , likewise Shih chi and SY, which last two lack , and Chao thinks is should be omitted. The number seems high indeed for a daily allowance, a chung being approximately 280 liters in Han times. (Cf. Dubs, op. cit.) and uses [only] one tenth for himself. [The other nine tenths] he uses for gifts to attract the empire's [worthy] gentlemen.9 9 : after CHy adds and Chao agrees that it is necessary to make the meaning clear. Shih chi has In this way he got Pu Tz?-hsia, T`ien Tz?-fang, and Tuan-kan Mu. All these three men our Prince treats as teachers and friends. All those whom you brought forward he treats as subjects. How then can you be compared with Wei Ch`êng-tz??" Chai Huang drew back, bowed twice to the ground, and said, "This uncouth person is truly inferior, and has replied improperly to his master." The Ode says,10 10 Shih 578 No. 273. Brilliant and illustrious is the House of Chou; He has regulated the positions of the princes. 71 1 Condensed from two separate passages in Hsün-tz?: 5.4b-5a (Dubs 126-7) and 4.5a (Dubs 95). Marquis Ch`êng and Duke Ss? were princes who collected imposts and made surveys;2 2 I.e., as a preliminary to taxation. , lit. "to enumerate, calculate"; cf. HSWC 2/27: , and especially Kuan-tz? 2.4b: . "Do not neglect the yield of the land. In reckoning the amount, the important part must be derived from [previous] estimates. they did not get so far as to attract 83 the people.3 3 . I follow Yang Liang, who says it means "to get the people's hearts" . Yü Yüeh (Chu-tz? p`ing-i 3.1b) disagrees and thinks "govern," but such an interpretation destroys the distinction made in the next sentence. Tz?-ch`an was one who attracted the people, but he did not get so far as to govern them.4 4 Cf. Mencius 317 (4B/2.2). Kuan Chung governed them, but he did not get so far as to regulate li. Truly he who regulates li is a true king; he who governs is strong; he who attracts the people is at ease; he who collects imposts is lost. Hence collecting imposts is to summon bandits,5 5 : both Chou and CHy would emend to as in Hsün-tz?. Several lines from Hsün-tz? have been omitted before this sentence. and accumulating property is to enrich one's enemies. This is the way to endanger one's self and lose one's state: the intelligent ruler does not follow it. If [the prince] will reform ritual (li) to regulate the court, rectify the laws to regulate the officials, and stabilize the government to regulate the lower classes,6 6 For D has , and for . Hsün-tz? 4.5a begins with this sentence. then after that the rhythm [of li and i]7 7 With Chao Yu-wen (109) supply before as in the similar line in HSWC 6/23. will be adjusted in the court, the rules and regulations will be rectified among the officials; while loyalty, honesty, love, and gain will appear8 8 Yang Liang defines as hsien "to appear." among the lower classes. In this way the people [come to] love him as their father and mother and to be in awe of him as they are of spiritual beings.9 9 Cf. Tso chuan 466 (Hsiang 14): "Then the people will maintain their ruler, love him as a parent, look up to him as the sun and moon, revere him as they do spiritual Beings, and stand in awe of him as of thunder." By these means his transforming virtue fills the world, and prosperity and happiness revert to the nobles. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 579 No. 274/4. Blessing is sent down in large measure; Careful and exact11 11 : Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 15.9a) gives as the Han shih reading. (Chao.) is all our deportment; We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the full; Our happiness and dignity will be prolonged. 84 81 1 Tso chuan 58.3b-4a (Legge 810) has been the source for Chia-yü 9.24b-25a and SY 1.17b, though the later has also used HSWC, which deviates considerably from Tso chuan; however, the texts are connected, perhaps by a common source. King Chuang2 2 Tso chuan, SY, and Chia-yü all write King Chao. of Ch`u took to his bed with illness. The oracle read, "The River is the evil influence." The Great Officers said, "We beg you to make use of sacrificial animals." King Chuang said, "Stop! In antiquity, according to the sacrifices instituted by the saintly kings,3 3 : B, C and the Yüan ed. have for , and both Chou and CHy think the line should read . [a ruler] did not go beyond [those within his own borders] in sacrificing to the spirits of hills and streams. The Sui, Chang, Chiang, and Han are the rivers Ch`u sacrifices to. Though I am devoid of virtue, it is not the River I have transgressed against." He never did perform the sacrifice, and in three days his disease was cured. Confucius heard of this and said, "It was right that King Chuang of Ch`u should be overlord. He kept within limits and held to his duties, reflecting within himself4 4 : as in Mencius 303 (4A/12.1): : "if one, on turning his thoughts inwards, finds a want of sincerity . . . ." and acting consistently. Was it not indeed fitting he should be overlord?" The Ode says,5 5 Shih 582 No. 276. Ah! Ah! He keeps within his boundaries.6 6 Legge translates, "Ah! Ah! Ye assistants," and in a note says "the meaning of is quite undetermined." In the context of the Ode my version is impossible, but here we have a good example of the way Han Ying takes isolated lines out of context and puts them to use because of some fancied connection with the preceding composition. Possibly a pun is intended. King Chuang is an example of this. 9 There are twelve symptoms of disease in rulers that, without a sage-physician, cannot be cured. What are the twelve symptoms?1 1 After Chih-yao 8.28b, TPYL 738.8a have , which Chao (78) would add here. 85 Paralysis,2 2 : cf. HTNCSW 12.8b-10b, sec. , where Wang Ping's com. says it means "weak and without the power of movement" . vertigo,3 3 : Chou identifies it with , for which cf. ibid. 11a-14b, sec. . persistent cough,4 4 : Chou says it is "to cough"; cf. ibid. 21.8b, and passim. dropsy,5 5 : Chou says, "A swelling due to poison. When the belly and limbs both swell up it is shui. If only the belly is swollen, and the limbs not much so, it is chang" ? ? surfeit,6 6 : Chou says, "The inside is filled up. It is a disease of fullness produced by stored-up cold" ? . Shih chi 105.14b: Pien-ch`iao has diagnosed an illness as . His explanation: ". . . the yang ch`i is exhausted and the yin ch`i enters. When the yin ch`i enters the belly, the cold ch`i rises and the hot ch`i descends; that is why his chest filled up" . lameness,7 7 : Chou says it means "the four limbs cramped and not capable of being bent or straightened" . obstruction,8 8 : CHy follows TPYL, loc. cit., and writes . Chou says it is the same as , which he defines as "vomit and nausea, so that both upper and lower parts become diseased." . As the basic meaning is "diaphragm" or "partition" and the text below puns on it (), I translate "obstruction." blindness, fever,9 9 : Wang Ping's com. on HTNCSW 1.16a defines it as "fever" . Chou specifies that internal heat is and external is . shortness of breath,10 10 : Yü Shu's com. on Nan ching 5.12b says, "Now when a disorder has its seat in the blood vessels, the lungs will be diseased. A chill will result in a cough, while heat (fever?) will give rise to ch`uan" . numbness,11 11 : cf. HTNCSW 12.4b-8a, sec. . "Pi is produced from the haphazard combination of the three ch`i, [namely] fêng, han, and shih. If the fêng ch`i is in ascendancy, it produces a pi affecting the gait. If the han ch`i is in ascendancy, it produces a painful pi. If the shih ch`i is in ascendancy, the pi produced is apparent to the sight" ? . and fêng:12 12 : cf. ibid. 12. 1a-4a, sec. . There are several varieties, and Chou says this is li fêng : "When the cold [principle] of fêng takes up its residence in the blood vessels and does not depart, it is termed li fêng, or `chills and fever.' " (ibid. 12.2a). Wang Ping says, "First there are chills and fever. When the fever reaches its height it is called li fêng" ? . Further on the text says, "Hence fêng is the most lasting of all diseases. When it comes to the point of changing, it turns into another disease" ? (2b). The term occurs in Tso chuan 581 (Chao 1): "An excess of fêng [produces] diseases of the extremities." these are the twelve symptoms. 86 How is it that a sage-physician cures them? He economizes in affairs and lightens punishments, and as a result paralysis does not attack.13 13 Preventing an excess of activity in governing. He does not cause the common people to suffer from hunger or cold, and as a result vertigo does not appear.14 14 The ruler suffers from the symptoms he is responsible for inducing. He does not order property transferred to himself, and as a result a persistent cough15 15 also means "to receive." does not appear. He does not let [grain] collected in the public granaries spoil, and as a result dropsy does not appear.14 14 The ruler suffers from the symptoms he is responsible for inducing. He does not have the treasury too full, and as a result surfeit does not appear.14 14 The ruler suffers from the symptoms he is responsible for inducing. He does not let the ministers have free license, and as a result lameness does not occur.16 16 To exercise a restraining effect; see note 13. He does not prevent the lower classes from expressing their feelings to their superiors, and as a result obstruction does not occur.14 14 The ruler suffers from the symptoms he is responsible for inducing. He gives talent precedence over his sympathies,17 17 : Chao thinks it is better to read for with Chih-yao, loc. cit.: "superiors aid and commiserate inferiors." and as a result blindness does not occur.14 14 The ruler suffers from the symptoms he is responsible for inducing. Laws and commands he puts into practice, and as a result fever18 18 also means "trouble, annoyance." does not occur. He gives his inferiors no cause for resentment, and as a result shortness of breath does not occur.19 19 Anger produces analagous symptoms. He does not cause the sages to go into hiding, and as a result numbness does not occur.20 20 The connection is not immediately apparent. He does not give the people an excuse to sing abusive songs, and as a result fêng does not occur.21 21 A pun on "satire." Now the chief ministers and the various lesser officers are the heart and bowels, the limbs and the body of a ruler. If the heart and bowels, the limbs and body are without disease, then the ruler is without disease. Truly, [if they are diseased], unless he have a sage-physician, he cannot be cured. Whatever [ruler]22 22 Chih-yao, loc. cit., has after . (Chao.) has [one of] these twelve ailments without making use of a sage-physician, that ruler's state is not a real state. The Ode says,23 23 Shih 501 No. 254/4. 87 But the troubles will multiply like flames, Till they are beyond help or remedy.24 24 "medicine," perhaps the associated word responsible for making this the line quoted. In the end failure is simply inevitable. Truly, if use is made of a sage-physician, the masses will be without ailment—how much the more does this apply to their ruler! 101 1 D correctly makes this part of sec. 9; the number sequence of the Ode quoted should be 276-280. The introduction of No. 254 from Paragraph 9 spoils the sequence. Traditionally, in a time of Great Peace there are no persons dumb, deaf, lame, one-eyed, feeble, dwarfed, or mutilated.2 2 Cf. Li Ki 1.319: "The dumb, the deaf, the lame, such as had lost a member, pigmies, and mechanics, were all fed according to what work they were able to do." (Legge 1.244.) Chou equates and , as meaning "those with a limb amputated" , and so in the translation, but Chao (79-80) makes in the sense of "short," so the compound for him would mean "stunted." Fathers do not [have reason to] weep for their sons, nor elder brothers to weep for their younger brothers. On the roads there are no infants abandoned to be reared [by others]; and everyone ends his life in his own station—such is the result of the employment of a sage-physician. Truly there is no other way of pacifying, putting in order, and expelling disease than precisely that of employing the sages. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 587 No. 280. There are blind men, there are blind men,4 4 : Legge has "blind musicians," as of course they were. In the court of Chou. These were the people who survived the cruelties of [the tyrant] Chou. 88 11-121 1 Li chi 50.5b-6a (Legge 2.259) and TTLC 2.1a-b both include this passage in a longer argument: "Thus if the ritual of marriage were discontinued, the path of husband and wife would be embittered, and there would be many offences of licentiousness and depravity. If the ritual of drinking ceremonies at country feasts were discontinued, the order between old and young would be neglected, and quarrelsome litigations would be numerous.... If the ritual of friendly messages and court attendances were discontinued, the positions of ruler and subject would fall into disuse, the conduct of the feudal princes would be evil, and the ruin wrought by rebellion, encroachment, and oppression would ensue." HSWC varies slightly by repeating Since this represents a clarification of the text, I would assume the version represented in the two Li collections to be the older. Tradition tells us that, if the rites (li) of mourning and sacrificing are neglected, then subjects and sons will be lacking in gratitude. If subjects and sons are lacking in gratitude, then those who repudiate the dead and forget the living2 2 Chao Yu-wen (110) would emend to "forget their ancestors," as suggested by Wang Nien-sun. will be many. The "Hsiao-ya" says,3 3 Shih 373 No. 209/6. May your sons and your grandsons Never fail to perpetuate these services! If human affairs are well ordered,4 4 That this does not properly begin a new paragraph is apparent from the atypical quotation from the "Hsiao-ya," and the fact that the Ode quoted below is a non sequitur if limited to these lines. Note also the numerical sequence from § 10: 280-291. I have kept the usual number of paragraphs to facilitate reference to the various editions and to Chao. then they are in conformity with the spirits. When they are in conformity with the spirits, then blessings sent down [by Heaven] reach elsewhere.5 5 Cf. Shih 586 No. 279. B, C follow Mao shih and write for . The Ode says,6 6 Shih 588 No. 281 (382 No. 212/4, 445 No. 239/4). Thus offering, thus sacrificing, Thus increasing our bright happiness 897 131 1 This section is a collection of three anecdotes about King Wu's conquest of the Shang. The first, concerning inauspicious omens, is roughly paralleled in SY 13.17a-b, where first the wind breaks King Wu's flag, then a flood occurs, and finally the tortoise shell used for divination is consumed by fire. Master San-i objects each time, and always King Wu has a favorable interpretation. The next deals with the advice proffered King Wu by his ministers. SSTC 3.3a-4a seems to be the source here for SY 5.4a-b, which agrees in having the Duke of Shao among the advisers. HSWC varies considerably from both of them. The last account is of King Wu's acts after his conquest. It occurs in an abbreviated form in the SSTC version with some verbal identity. Li chi 39.11b-14a (Legge 2.123-5) is very close to HSWC, but contains lines lacking in the latter. Shu ching 315-6 contains a few lines of this passage, but the section in question () belongs to the `old text.' Shih chi 4.12a, 14b (Mém.hist. 1.239, 243-4) reproduces some of this, but the order is quite different. When King Wu attacked [the tyrant] Chou, as he came to Hsing-ch`iu, the yoke [on his chariot horses]2 2 All texts have "shields." With CHy I follow TPYL 776.4a to emend to . Lei-chü 59.5a, Shu ch`ao 141.5b, TPYL 328.4a likewise. (Chao 80.) I emend also the occurrence of below. broke into three pieces, and rain fell for three days without stopping. King Wu was afraid3 3 : TPYL 328.4a, Lei-chü, loc. cit., lack , and Chao thinks it is better omitted. and summoned T`ai-kung, to whom he said, "It seems to me that the time has not yet come when Chou can be attacked." T`ai-kung replied, "Not so. That the carriage yoke broke into three pieces means our army should be divided into three. The three days' rain without a stop4 4 Lei-chü, loc. cit., TPYL 328.4a, 776.4a lack ; the first two citations have . and Chao (81) prefers this as balancing above. was intended to wash our weapons." King Wu said, "In that case, what shall we do?" T`ai-kung said, "Love for a person reaches to the crows on his roof;5 5 : SSTC is less terse: . hate for a person includes the very walls of his village.6 6 is a variant of . B, C mistakenly write . Chêng Hsüan's com. on SSTC explains it as "village walls." Sun Chih-tz? (quoted by Chao as from Tu-shu ts`o lu, but not in the HCCC ed.) equates it with as in Li Shang-yin's poem (Li I-shan shih chi 5.4b) , where it means "bamboo fence." He disagrees with those who (like Chu Ch`i-fêng, TT 262-3) would make this and its variants mean "servants." SY 5.4a writes . (Chao.) 90 Let us slay all our enemies,7 7 Cf. Shu ching 482 (5/16.15). so that none will be left over." King Wu said, "Ah, the empire is not yet established!" The Duke of Chou hastened forward and said, "Not so. Let each regulate his own home and till his own fields. Without [regard for] old or new, [befriend only good men].8 8 : SSTC has , and SY . Ss?-k`u ch`üan-shu k`ao-chêng suggests for , and Chao agrees, as the meaning would then be near to that of SSTC. CHy thinks the text is defective, and I have added the phrase from SSTC and SY to complete the sentence. If the people commit a fault, let it be my sole responsibility." King Wu said, "Ah, the empire has been established." Thereupon he put his troops in order9 9 : hence the new name (Hsiu-wu) for Ning below. and checked their advance at Ning. He changed the name of Hsing-ch`iu to Huai; Ning he called Hsiu-wu.9 9 : hence the new name (Hsiu-wu) for Ning below. He marched to defeat [the tyrant] Chou in the Plain of Mu. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 436 No. 236/8. The wilderness of Mu spread out extensive; Bright shone the chariots of sandal; The teams of bays, black-maned and white-bellied, galloped along; The grand-master Shang-fu Was like an eagle on the wing. Bright was11 11 All texts have as in Mao shih, but Ching-tien shih-wên ( B. 2a) gives as the Han shih reading, and Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 11.9b-10a) agrees. (Chao 82.) Karlgren, BMFEA 17.66 seems to have followed the Han shih reading. King Wu, Who at one onset smote the great Shang. The morning of the encounter was clear and bright. After he had gone to [the capital of] Shang,12 12 For "return to" read with Chêng Hsüan's com. on Li chi, loc. cit. (Chou.) before descending from his chariot he enfeoffed the descendants of Huang-ti in Chi, the descendants of the Emperor Yao in Chu, and the descendants of Shun in Ch`ên. After descending from his chariot, he enfeoffed the descendants of the Hsia imperial family in Ch`i, and the descendants of Yin in Sung. He raised a mound over the grave of Pi-kan, released Chi-tz? from prison, and marked out the village gate of Shang-jung.13 13 For Shang Jung cf. HSWC 2/19. 91 Crossing the River, he went to the west and released the [war]horses south of Mt. Hua to show that they would not again be mounted. The oxen he turned loose in the plain around T`ao-lin to show that they would not again be yoked to carts. War chariots and armor he had consecrated with blood and stored away in depots to show they would not again be used. After that he disbanded his army and held archery practice in the suburbs. On the left they shot their arrows to the [song] li-shou,14 14 According to Chêng Hsüan's com., loc. cit., a lost song. and on the right to the [song] tsou-yü.15 15 Shih 36 No. 25. Thereafter the empire knew that King Wu would not again employ troops. When he sacrificed in the ancestral temple,16 16 : only the central part of the Ming-t`ang, called the , was used for sacrifices. Cf. Legge, Li Ki 1.29 for a note on it, and Couvreur, Li Ki 1.332 for a diagram. the people learned about filial piety. He held open court and from that the feudal lords learned about respect.17 17 For CHy, following Li chi, writes "learned to be subjects," and continues from Li chi, "He plowed in the field set apart for that purpose and thereafter the feudal lords learned about respect." He seated the three [outstanding] old men in the Great School,18 18 For cf. TTLC 3.8b and §16 below. The ceremony referred to here is mentioned in Li Ki 1.313 (3/5.2): "Those of 50 years received their nourishment in the [schools of the] districts; those of 60, theirs in the [smaller school of the] state, and those of 70, theirs in the college." (Legge 1.240.) and he, the Son of Heaven, respectfully served them with sauce and gave them cups to rinse out their mouths. In this manner he taught the feudal lords the behavior proper to a younger brother. These four [acts] constitute the great teachings of the empire. Now was it not fitting that King Wu was long [on the throne]? The Ode says,19 19 Shih 594 No. 285. You vanquished Yin, put a stop to its cruelties, And effected the firm establishment of your merit. It says that when Wu attacked [the tyrant] Chou, Yin was lost.20 20 : I follow Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.5a) and emend to . (Chao 82.) 92 141 1 This paragraph is translated from an inferior text by Legge, Shih, Proleg. 89. Mêng, Prince of Ch`ang, wishing to study under Min-tz?,2 2 Shên Hsiang (in Ch'un-shu tsa-i 1.1a) remarks that they were not contemporaries, and that Han Ying must have been ignorant of the fact. Chao (82) suggests that there may have been another Min-tz?. sent his carriage to go meet him. Min-tz? said, "Etiquette (li) demands that [the pupil] come to study, not that [the master] go to teach.3 3 Cf. Li Ki 1.4: "I have heard in accordance with etiquette of [scholars] coming to learn; I have not heard of [the master] going to teach." (Legge 1.63.) If you study by having your teacher come to you, you will be unable to learn.4 4 For D has ; so Legge, who punctuates before . If I go to teach you, I will be unable to influence you. Where you would say you were unable to learn [if I do not go], I would say I would be unable to influence you [if I did go]." Mêng Prince of Ch`ang then said, "I respectfully obey your command." Next day, lifting up his robe [and hastily taking a low seat],5 5 : Chou says should be read like as in (Li Ki 1.17): "holding up your robe, go quickly to a corner [of the mat]." he asked to receive instruction. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 599 No. 288. By daily progress and monthly advance. 151 1 Cf. Li chi 36.2a-b (Legge 2.82-3), where the first two sentences and the conclusion, beginning with are lacking. Legge, Shih, Proleg. 89-90 translates this passage. Though a sword may be edged, if it is not sharpened, it will not cut. A man may be able, but if he does not study, he will not excel. There may be fine wine and superior delicacies, but without tasting them their excellence will not be known. There may be an excellent Way, but without study it will not be understood. Thus after study one realizes his shortcomings, and after teaching he realizes his shallowness. Because he falls short, he is ashamed of himself and makes an effort; because he is shallow, he gives himself over to a teacher2 2 . (?) and becomes familiar [with his subject]. 93 Viewed in the light of this, teaching and learning complement one another. When Tz?-hsia inquired about the Odes, he knew two parts from having studied one. Confucius said, "It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the Odes with him."3 3 Analects 157 (3/8.3). When Confucius gave distinction to that noble character, his own saintly virtue was completed. When the disciple received his influence, his own4 4 I. e., Tz?-hsia. virtue was manifested. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 599 No. 288. By daily progress and monthly advance. 161 1 Cf. Li chi 36.14a (Legge 2.88). Now in the conduct of studies it is making the teacher respected that is difficult. If the teacher is respected, then the Way is honored. If the Way is honored, then the people know that learning is to be revered.2 2 Li chi follows this with "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating [his ancestor], he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Hence, by the ceremony (li) of the Great School, even though he address the Son of Heaven, [the teacher] does not have to face the north; this is out of honor for the teacher and esteem for the Way. Truly, "one who is given credence without having to speak, and who inspires awe without making a display of anger"—this may be said of a teacher.3 3 This sentence does not occur in Li chi. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 599 No. 288. By daily progress and monthly advance, I will learn from those who are continuously bright in their enlightenment.5 5 I have used Karlgren's translation of this line (BMFEA 17.92). 94 171 1 Cf. Tso chuan 9.3a-b (Legge 88, Chuang 11), where occasional identity of phrase betrays a connection with the present text; however the variations are too considerable for either to be considered the direct source of the other. SY 1.16b-17a seems to be taken from HSWC; it includes the Ode quoted at the end. There is the following traditional story: In Sung there was a great flood.2 2 The Tso chuan dates it in the 11th year of Duke Chuang of Lu (B.C. 682). A man from Lu condoled with [the Prince of Sung] saying, "Heaven has sent down excessive rains, injuring the millet for sacrifices and spreading over your land, to the grief of those in charge of the government. I have been sent respectfully to condole with you." The Prince of Sung replied,3 3 : through an intermediary, who speaks for the prince in the first person. "I have not practiced jên. Fasts and prohibitions have not been regulated, nor, in employing the people, has the proper time been chosen; [hence] Heaven has visited us with disaster. Having in addition caused you concern, I beg to acknowledge the condescension of your message." Confucius heard of this and said,4 4 CHy says, "This event appears in the Ch`un-ch`iu under the 11th year of [Duke] Chuang, at which time Confucius was not yet born. Tso chuan writes Tsang Wên-chung and below attributes a speech to his father Tsang Sun-ta. It seems that Wên-chung is also a mistaken entry. Most appropriate is SY's `A superior man heard of it.' " Chou makes substantially the same comment. It is noteworthy that Han Ying has not dated the event, so that as the story occurs in HSWC there is no apparant anachronism, yet Liu Hsiang has changed his text—but not to the Tso chuan reading. "Sung is almost ready [for enlightened government]." A disciple said, "What do you mean?" Confucius said, "Of old Chieh and Chou did not admit their faults, and their destruction was swift indeed. Ch`êng-t`ang and King Wên knew enough to recognize their faults, and their rise was sudden indeed. To reform after having committed faults is not to be at fault." After the Prince of Sung heard of this remark, he rose early and retired late. He mourned for the dead, made polite enquiries after those who were ill,5 5 This expression occurs in HSWC 3/2. and greatly exerted himself inside the country. After three years the harvests were abundant and the 95 government was tranquil. If previously the Prince of Sung had not heard of Confucius' words, the grain harvested would not have been abundant, nor would the state have been at peace. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 599 No. 288. He assists me to bear the burden [of my position],7 7 B. C follow Mao shih to write for . And shows me how to display a virtuous conduct. 181 1 SY 8.12b-13a is identical, with a few minor variants. Duke Huan of Ch`i set up torches in the courtyard2 2 is the title of Shih No. 182. for the sake of gentlemen who might want to come to see him.3 3 "to make people want to come and see him." B, C have for . CHy follows the quotation in Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 47.3b-4a, , which is also the reading of SY. Because of the repeated occurrence of in the text below, I have followed CHy. For a full year no one came. Then [a rustic] from the eastern fields4 4 After CHy adds from SY. The Wên hsüan com. has , and Chao (82) agrees with CHy. There is still a difficulty with the . . . in the following phrase, which I should take as "there was one who," etc. came to see him because of his skill in arithmetic. Duke Huan joked with him, saying, "Is arithmetic sufficient [reason] for an interview?" The villager said, "[I had not thought arithmetic to be sufficient reason for an interview.]5 5 : CHy adds this sentence from the Wên hsüan com., loc. cit., and SY. I had heard that Your Highness set up torches in his courtyard so as to await gentlemen, and that for a full year not one came. Now the reason that no gentlemen came was that Your Highness is the sage ruler in the empire, and everywhere gentlemen feel they are not adequate to Your Highness. Therefore they do not come. Now arithmetic is but a wretched accomplishment, yet if Your Highness treats me with courtesy, how much the more could those with worthier accomplishments than arithmetic expect! Now Mt. T`ai does not decline pebbles 96 and stones, nor do rivers and oceans refuse small streams—thus have they accomplished their magnitude. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 501 No. 254/3. The ancients had a saying: Consult the grass and firewood gatherers. It [speaks of]7 7 CHy prefixes from SY. a great plan." Duke Huan approved, and the man was accordingly8 8 I follow CHy and SY to read for . Chao Yu-wen maintains that can mean "richly," and would retain that reading. entertained formally for a full month. From all over gentlemen came leading one another to him. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 605 No. 292. From the hall they go to the base of the gate house, And from the sheep to10 10 For B, C have as in Mao shih. I have followed Karlgren, (BMFEA 17.93) in translating . the oxen. [It speaks of proceeding from the inside to the outside and of]11 11 CHy would add from SY. It requires another interpretation of than the traditional "foot of the stairs." achieving great things from small ones. 19 In an age of Great Peace the people, in supplying forced labor, do not go beyond the time [fixed]; men and women do not neglect the time [proper for] mating; filial sons do not neglect the time for nourishing [their parents].1 1 Cf. HSWC 7/7: "Though the filial son may wish to support them [indefinitely], his parents cannot tarry [forever]." Abroad there are no unmarried men, and in the seclusion of the house there are no dissatisfied women.2 2 Cf. Mencius 164 (1B/5.5), where the order of the phrases is reversed. On the one hand there are no heartless fathers, and on the other no unfilial sons. Father and son complete one another; husband and wife protect one another. The empire is at peace, the state is tranquil. Human affairs are complete here below; the Heavenly Way responds there above. Truly, 97 Heaven does not change its course, Earth does not alter its form; Sun and moon shine bright, The ranked stars are constant. Heaven emanates and Earth produces.3 3 : the expression has sexual connotations; cf. HSWC 1/20. The following deals with cosmogony. Yin and yang come together in equilibrium. Their motion produces thunder and lightning, their damp [emanation] is wind and rain, their periodicity shows in hills and streams, their balance produces [alterations of] heat and cold. All people maintain life; each on getting his place is employed by the ruler of the state. Hence there is someone to keep the state at peace, and there is someone to own the land. The sages split trees to make boats and shaped wood to make paddles;4 4 Cf. Yi King 384, which continues, "Thus arose the benefit of canoes and oars for the help of those who had no means of intercourse with others. They could now reach the most distant parts, and all under heaven were benefited." they used these to put products from all over into circulation, thus providing the people by the sea with plenty of wood and the people of the mountains with plenty of fish.5 5 This sentence occurs in Hsün-tz? 5.11a. (Chou.) Excess materials were assigned to definite places. Therefore those with fertile fields did not enjoy them alone, and those with stony fields were not left to suffer alone. Even if there were a bad year and a time of famine, or a flood like Yü's or a drought like T`ang's, still the people showed no signs of being cold or hungry. Thus the living were not made to work to the point of fatigue, and the dead did not lie in the ditches.6 6 Cf. Mencius 217 (2B/4.2): "the old and feeble lying in the ditches and water channels." CHy, B, C have for : "the corpses of the dead are not cast away." Now this is to be called happiness. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 606 No. 293. Legge translates as "Oh! Powerful was the king's army"; likewise Karlgren (BMFEA 17.93). I suspect that Han Ying's text read for Mao's , so that the quotation aptly follows his last sentence, . See note 6, § 20 below for my version of the second line. Oh! happy was the king's leadership: He followed the principle of nourishment in times of darkness. 98 20 To be capable of ruling the empire, one must be able to nourish its people. He who is able to nourish the people practices self-nourishment. His drinking and eating conform to [the needs of] his viscera; his use of spices conforms to [the demands of] his ch`i;1 1 "breath," but used technically here as in HSWC 3/9, note 11. his toil and rest conform to [the capacity of] his muscles and bones; his [adjustments to] heat and cold conform to his skin. Thereafter his ch`i and viscera are equitable, the working of his mind is controlled, his worries and cares achieve [a mean], his joy and anger are seasonable. In activity and repose he enjoys himself. By taking the opportunity he has enough for his needs. Now this is what is meant by one able to nourish himself. Therefore, that the saints did not practice lascivious indulgence or wasteful extravagance is not because they despised sex or were miserly with their property. If in supplying one's needs, one goes to excess, the result is not pleasurable, and so they did not do so. It is for the same reason that in winter they did not bathe frequently—it was not that they grudged the water; and in summer they did not heat—it was not that they grudged the fire.2 2 CHy interchanges and from TPYL 59.1b; likewise D. Chao also cites Po-t`ich 2.37a and TPYL 26.8b, which are the same, though the latter has , a contamination from LSCC. Certainly the passage makes sense only by the interchange. Chou quotes LSCC 25.5a: ?g g For this character, see the table on p. 358. , ?g g For this character, see the table on p. 358. "In summer they did not wear furs; not that they grudged the furs, but there was [already] warmth enough. In winter they did not use fans; not that they grudged the fans, but there was [already] enough of freshness." (Wilhelm 437.) That they did not make their towers and pavilions high was not due to a lack of earth and timber; that they did not make their bells3 3 : D has . The words are also confused in HSWC 7/7. and tripods large was not due to a lack of copper and tin. That they did not drink deeply of wine or lust after women was not because they shunned them as repulsive. When they did in a straightforward manner what was restful to their feelings and dispositions, their practice was worth taking as a model for the empire. Thus in consuming they did not waste materials and so 99 could support [the people's] life, so that the empire praised their jên. In supplying their wants they did not injure their nature and provided thereby an example, so that the empire praised their sense of fitness (i). They conformed to their feelings, avoided excess, and did not seek what they had no right to, so that the empire praised their integrity. Their conduct was perfect and could not be concealed; . . . punishment could not make them false [to their principles].4 4 : I do not know what means here. PWYF lists only this passage. Holding fast to the One Way, they despised all material things, and as a result the empire praised their bravery. If these four are practiced among the people, when at rest they are kindly and happy; aroused they overcome their enemies. Thus when we examine the means they employed in nourishing the people, [we find] a complete method for ruling. When the method of ruling is complete, near and far get sustenance. The Ode says, Oh! happy was the king's leadership: He followed the principle of nourishment in times of darkness.6 6 . No dictionary meaning of fits the present context. I suppose some extention of meaning—dark times = bad times—might answer, but the grammar of the line remains peculiar; cf. HSWC 5/23. It says he nourished them even in the darkness. 5Shih 606 No. 293. Cf. HSWC 3/19, note 7. 211 1 HFT 14.4b is the oldest extant parallel to this anecdote, which HSWC has adapted with some modifications. Huai-nan tz? 12.11b follows HSWC, including the quotation from Lao-tz?, which is lacking in HFT. Shih chi 119.3a has the same story, but entirely rewriten. Hsin hsü 7.8a likewise shows no direct filiation with the other accounts. Kung-i Hsiu, minister of Lu,2 2 Hsin hsü has "a minister of Chêng." was fond of fish. A native of the state made him a present of fish, but he would not accept it. His younger brother objected, saying, "You are fond of fish; why do you not accept it?" He said, "It is [precisely] because I am so fond of fish that I 100 do not accept it. If I accept the fish and lose my place as minister,3 3 HFT has, "To receive the fish would certainly give the appearance of condescending to others. With the appearance of condescending to others, I would be misusing the law, and by misusing the law, I would lose my place as minister" . I will then be unable to supply myself with fish. By not accepting and not losing my place as minister, I will long be able to supply myself with fish.4 4 : Chao (85) would precede this with to balance the sentence before (), and also would expunge the . Huai-nan tz? has . In this matter I understand how to take care of myself."5 5 : "From this it is clear that, in so far as fish is concerned, [it is best to be] independent." I follow CHy and omit the . Huai-nan tz? has "This shows clearly what is done for others and what is done for oneself." HFT has : "This shows clearly that it is better to depend on oneself than to depend on others, that it is better to act for oneself than to have others act on one's behalf." Truly, as Lao-tz? said,6 6 Cf. Tao tê ching 1.3b-4a. "Make yourself last and you will be first; put yourself outside, and you will be preserved. Is it not that he had no eye to personal advantage, and was just in this way able to accomplish his personal advantage?" The Ode says,7 7 Shih 613 No. 297/4. His thoughts are without depravity. This is illustrated in the above. 221 1 Hsün-tz? 20.2a-3b furnishes the basis of this story, and is followed by Chia-yü 1.5b-7a practically verbatim. HSWC makes considerable changes in the wording and order of the sentences, which for the most part are followed by SY 7.6a-b. There is the following traditional story: In Lu there was a dispute at law between father and son. K`ang-tz? wished to have them put to death, but Confucius said,2 2 According to Hsün-tz? this was at the time when he was in charge of punishments in Lu. (Chou.) "It would not be right to put them to death. Now the people have long [been ignorant that] lawsuits between father and son are improper.3 3 . This might be forced to mean "Among the people the impropriety of lawsuits between fathers and sons has been going on for a long time," but I prefer the SY reading, which adds after . This case 101 is the result of those in responsible positions neglecting true principles. If superiors were possessed of the proper principles, such people as these would not be." The litigants, hearing of this remark, asked that the case be dropped. K`ang-tz? said, "The people are governed through filial piety. Surely it would be proper to put to death one who behaves thus unfittingly as a censure for the unfilial?"4 4 CHy emends to the SY reading: (SY has ) "put to death one man as a censure for the unfilial." As Hsün-tz? also has , Chao (86) agrees. I regard the HSWC reading as a deliberate modification. Confucius said, "Not at all. Having left them without instruction, to judge their suits is to put to death the guiltless. Though the armies of a great state suffer a severe defeat, they should not be punished. If lawsuits and judgments are not supervised, it is not right to inflict punishments. If superiors, having made manifest their teachings, themselves submit to them first, then the people will readily fall into line. Only if they conduct themselves improperly and are not obedient are they punished, since then the people will recognize their guilt. Now take a wall eight feet high—the people cannot cross over it. But a mountain eight hundred feet high—small boys climb and play on it. It is because of the [gradual] decline.5 5 : B, C, D mistakenly write for . Yang Liang explains it as a "gentle slope" , which fits here, but is hard to reconcile with in the next line. Lu Wên-ch`ao quotes Huai-nan tz? 20.7b "A mountain is able to achieve its height through successive ridges," and says means "successive ridges" . The usual meaning of "degeneration" makes the best sense, if it is understood to mean something like "erosion" when applied to the mountain. Jên and i have long been in a decline— can we say the people do not cross them? The Ode says,6 6 Shih 311 No. 191/3. So as to preserve the people from going astray. The superior men of antiquity taught the people and did not lead them astray. Thus authority was strict [but not made use of],7 7 Hsün-tz? and Chia-yü have after ; likewise SY, but with for . Hsün-tz? 10.14b repeats the line, introducing it with "the traditional saying." I have followed Hsün-tz?. Yang Liang says means "hold up" , and paraphrases, "He merely holds up his authority without making use of it." Wang Nien-sun objects to Yang's equating with as unsupported and prefers the usual meaning of "severe." 102 and punishments were set up but not employed. In this way they embodied jên and i and took pains in teaching the True Way. They caused the people to see it clearly with their eyes and to hear it clearly with their ears and to know it clearly with their minds. As a result, since the True Way was not obscured, the aims of the people were not confused. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 599 No. 288. Show me how to display a virtuous conduct. "Truly, unless the True Way and i are made simple, the people will not follow them; unless rites (li) and music are made clear, the people will not perceive them. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 353 No. 203/1. The Way of Chou was like a whetstone, And straight as an arrow. This says how simple it was. So the officers trod it, And the common people looked on it. This says how clear it was. When I look back and think of it, My tears run down in streams. He is sorrowing because he did not pay attention to instruction in rites (li) and so is suffering punishment.10 10 B begins a new section here. Now having dispensed with this fundamental instruction, to visit them with punishment is like breaking down the pen and shooting [at the cattle] with poisoned arrows. It is not indeed reason for grief?11 11 : I follow CHy to read . The parallel texts all stop with this line. That is why I said it would not be right to put them to death. "The former kings' use of rites (li) in employing the people in olden times may be compared to driving a chariot. Punishments were the whip and stick. At the present day it is like driving 103 with whip and stick, but without having reins and bit. When you wish the horse to advance, you beat him behind; when you wish him to retreat, you beat him in front. The driver has much trouble doing it, and the horse in turn suffers greatly.12 12 Chou quotes KTT 2.1b-2a: "Confucius said, `If you compare controlling the people through rites (li) with driving a chariot, they are the reins. By the same metaphor punishments are the whip. Grasping the reins here and allowing movement there is good driving. But if you apply a stick without using the reins, your horses will go off the road.' " ? ? . So it is today. Superiors are anxious and put to trouble, while the people are greatly grieved and suffer punishment. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 85 No. 52/3. If a man observes no rites (li), Why does he not quickly die? For one in a superior position who does not observe the rites (li), misfortune is inevitable. For one in an inferior position who does not observe the rites (li), punishment is inevitable. If superior and inferior [alike] do not observe the rites (li), `why do they not quickly die?' " K`ang-tz? withdrew from the mat, bowed twice and said, "Although I am not intelligent, I wish to receive these words." When Confucius withdrew from court, his disciple Tz?-lu objected saying, "A lawsuit between father and son, is it in accordance with the True Way?" Confucius said, "It is not." Tz?-lu said, "In that case, how could you, Master, as a superior man, excuse it?" Confucius said, "Without warning, to hold [the people] responsible for the completion of a task is injurious. To insist on a definite period [for the execution of] offhand orders is oppressive. To inflict punishment without having instructed them is harmful.14 14 Cf. Analects 353 (23/3.3): "To put the people to death without having instructed them;—this is called cruelty. To require from them, [suddenly], the full tale of work, without having given them warning,—this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, [at first], and, when the time comes, [to insist on them with severity]; —this is called injury." Hsün-tz? has ? , ? ? "To punish with rigor [the neglect of] offhand orders is injurious. Now when living things have their seasons, to make unseasonable exactions is oppressive. Without instruction to hold [the people] to the completion of a task is cruel." Chia-yü, ? ? is clearly derived from Hsün-tz?. The saying was a traditional one, and HSWC has probably not taken it directly from either Analects or Hsün-tz?; cf. also HSWC 3/24: . 104 A superior man in governing avoids these three [evils]. Moreover the Ode says,15 15 Shih 617 No. 299/2. Blandly he looks and smiles, Without any impatience he delivers his instruction. 231 1 SY 1.4a-b includes this story, minus the moral (from ), in a paragraph beginning with the praise of Yao by Prince Hsien of Ho-chien. In the time of Shun the state of Miao did not submit. They did not submit [because they had] the Hêng mountains on their southern [border], the Min mountains2 2 : I follow CHy and emend to . CKT 7.4a has . CHy says , , and are variants. on their northern [border], the waves3 3 Read for with CHy, B, C. of Tung-t`ing [lake] to their left, and the waters of P`êng-li4 4 : Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 1331) says that should be , since P`êng-tsê is the name of a district, not of a lake. SY and CKT have . [lake] to their right; through these they were protected. Because they would not submit, Yü asked to attack them, but Shun would not agree. He said, "I have not as yet exhausted my teachings." For a long time he gave out his teachings,5 5 For Chou would follow SY, "He completed his teachings." and the ruler of the Miao6 6 Read for with Chou. [finally] asked to submit. When the people of the empire heard of this, they all rated Yü low in i and praised Shun's transforming virtue. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 617 No. 299/2. Blandly he looks and smiles, Without any impatience he delivers his instruction. This could be said of Shun. If you ask, "In that case, Yü's transforming virtue did not come up to Shun's?" I would say, 1058 "Not at all. Yü asked to attack them because of his desire to show off Shun's transforming virtue. Truly, `credit the good to your prince and take the blame on yourself'; this is the proper act (i) of a subject. Let us suppose Yü to have been the ruler and Shun his subject: it would have simply been the same as in this case. Yü may be said to be the great figure of one who succeeded in being a subject." 24 In his administration of Lu, Chi-sun-tz? had people put to death on a large scale, as their crimes strictly merited, and frequently inflicted punishments on people, as their faults strictly deserved. Tz?-kung said, "A cruel government!" When he heard of this remark, Chi-sun said, "I put the people to death when their crimes strictly merit it, and I punish them when their faults strictly deserve it. How is it that you, sir, find it cruel?" Tz?-kung said, "How unlike Tz?-ch`an's administration of Chêng! In one year [the number of] faults requiring punishment diminished; in two years crimes requiring capital punishment disappeared. In three years the prisons had no prisoners. As a result the people turned to him as water flows downhill, and loved him as a filial son respects his father and mother. When Tz?-ch`an was sick and on the point of death, the citizens all lamented, saying, `Is there not someone else who could die in the place of Tz?-ch`an?' When he finally did die, the nobles and great officers wept for him in the court, the merchants wept for him in the market, and the farmers wept for him in the fields. For all of them weeping for Tz?-ch`an was like mourning for father and mother. Now I heard that when you were sick, our citizens were happy, and when you recovered they all were frightened. When they take your death [as reason] for congratulation and your living [as reason] for fear, if this is not [the fruit of] cruelty, what is it?1 1 Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 76.6a-b attributes the following to Hsin hsü: "When Tz?-ch`an died the people of the state all beat their breasts and wept. For three months the sound of organ and lute was not heard. Alive he was loved, and dead it was fitting he should be mourned. Truly it is said, `There is no greater virtue than jên and no greater evil than severity.' Now when you, Sir, are ill, people congratulate [one another], and when you recover they are afraid and say, `Alas! How evil is our fate!' Tsang-sun was ashamed and resigned his place, not going out [to take office] again for the rest of his life." D: ? ? ? . I have heard that to govern by relying on laws is 106 called cruel; that to insist on a definite period [for the completion of a task] without having given warning is called tyranny; that to punish [people] without having instructed them is called oppression;2 2 Analects 353 (20/2.3); cf. HSWC 3/22, note 14. that to impose oneself on others is called exaction. He who makes exactions will lose his life; the oppressor will lose his subjects; the tyrant will lose the government; the cruel ruler will lose the people. Furthermore I have heard that there has never been one who occupied the highest place and practiced these four who did not perish." Whereupon Chi-sun bowed his head gratefully and said, "I listen with respect to your command." The Ode says,3 3 Shih 617 No. 299/2. Blandly he looks and smiles; Without any impatience he delivers his instruction. 251 1 This section and the next (§26) seem to be inspired by an enigmatic statement in Analects 192 (6/21): "The Master said, `The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous () find pleasure in hills.' " Mencius 324 (4B/18) elucidates: "The disciple Hsü said, `Chung-ni often praised water, saying, "O water! O water!" What did he find in water [to praise]?' Mencius replied, `There is a spring of water, how it gushes out! It rests not day nor night. It fills up every hole, and then advances, flowing on to the four seas. Such is water having a spring! It was this which he found in it to praise.' " No trace of this appears in the HSWC account, nor in SY 17.22b-23a, except the phrase . While SY is not closely parallel with HSWC, it must be directly based on it, for it ends by quoting the same lines from the Shih and makes the succeeding section (HSWC 3/26) part of the same paragraph. Ch`unch`iu fan-lu 16.2b is similar and ends by quoting Analects 222 (9/16): "The Master standing by a stream, said, `It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!' " Should someone ask, "Just what does a wise man find in water to give him pleasure?" I would answer, "Now water moves in accordance with principle, not losing one little moment. In 107 this it resembles the wise man. In moving it descends,2 2 For read with CHy after TPYL 59.1a; likewise SY. and in this it resembles one who observes li. It follows along a deep gorge without any uncertainty: in this it resembles the brave man. It keeps itself pure through protective embankments,3 3 : with CHy, B, C, SY and TPYL, loc. cit., read . and in this resembles the man who knows the mandate [of Heaven]. Passing through defiles, it goes far, and achieves its destination without diminution:4 4 : this phrase is omitted in TPYL, loc. cit., and Lei chü 8.10b; likewise SY. in this it resembles the virtuous man. Through it Heaven and Earth are completed, through it all living beings are produced and the state is at peace; through it all affairs are settled and material things are rectified. For these reasons the sage take pleasure in water." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 617 No. 299/3. Pleasant is the semicircular water, And we will gather the mallows about it. The marquis of Lu has come to it, And in the college he is drinking. This speaks of taking pleasure in water.6 6 Read before with all other texts; cf. the parallel phrase at the end of §26 below. 261 1 Cf. SY 17.23a-b and HSWC 3/25, note 1. KTT 1.14b-15a and SSTC 5.11b-12a are very close and seem to represent another version. Ch`un-ch`iu fan-lu 16.2a-b ( ) expresses the same idea in different language. Should someone ask, "Just what does the man possessed of jên find in mountains to give him pleasure?" I would answer, "It is mountains to which all people raise their eyes and look. Grass and trees grow there; all living things flourish there; the birds that fly assemble there; the beasts that walk take their repose there; and while all [alike] take from them, they show [favoritism to none].2 2 : SY has . Lei-chü 7.2b has . KTT: . SSTC: . Chao (88) thinks the HSWC text is defective. As it stands it might mean "from all over there flourishes taking and giving—i. e., exchange." I suggest it be emended to read on the basis of SY, the Lei-chü citation, and SSTC. [Mountains] put forth clouds and make the wind circulate; 108 they soar up between heaven and earth.3 3 I follow CHy, B, C to read ? h h For this character, see the table on p. 358. for . Lei-chü has ? . SY: . KTT: SSTC likewise, with for . I follow Chao and take as a graphic error for . Through them heaven and earth are completed, and the state is at peace. These are the reasons why the man of jên takes pleasure in mountains."4 4 TPYL 38.2b varies considerably, and is close enough to SY to have been taken from it: "Useful materials grow there, precious things which men treasure up are planted there, the birds that fly assemble there, the beasts that walk hide there. [Mountains] nourish all living things untiringly; they resemble the man characterized by jên, and this is why those characterized by jên take pleasure in mountains." With the exception of the first phrase and the one next to last, this is the same as SY. Cf. also DM 421 (26/9): "The mountain now before us appears only a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size, we see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts dwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on it." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 627 No. 300/6. The mountain of T`ai6 6 For Mao shih has . is lofty, Looked up to7 7 : Mao shih has . by the state of Lu. This speaks of taking pleasure in a mountain. 271 1 This section seems to have been adapted from LSCC 24.6b-7a (Wilhelm 424-5), where "Uncle Fan" however is not mentioned. SY 6.2b-3b follows HSWC closely, but unless HSWC is defective, has also used LSCC; see note 7. Shih chi 39.20b-21a (Mém. hist. 4.296-7) applies the anecdote to a Hu-shu , with slight similarity in wording. There is the following traditional story: When Duke Wên of Chin had returned to his state from exile, he thrice gave out rewards, but none reached T`ao Shu-hu.2 2 LSCC omits the which indicates that he was a second son. 109 T`ao Shu-hu said to Uncle Fan,3 3 Yang Liang (Hsün-tz? 9.2b) says is the same as . "I followed [our prince]4 4 CHy adds after as in SY. into exile for eleven years until my complexion was burnt black and my hands and feet were [covered with] calluses. Now he has returned to his state and thrice has given out rewards, but nothing to me. Is it that the prince has forgotten me? Or am I greatly to blame? Would you try speaking on my behalf?" Uncle Fan spoke about it to Duke Wên, who said, "Eh, how could it be that I have forgotten this man? Those who were greatly enlightened and most worthy, whose minds and conduct were perfect,5 5 SY has for and for . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 2134) says, "The old script form of was , which in form is similar to ; hence Han mistakenly wrote ." (Chao 89.) To change requires recasting the sentence and reading also with SY: "who were virtuous in conduct and completely sincere." who soothed me with the True Way and persuaded me with jên, who changed my conduct and made bright my [fame],6 6 I add with CHy from SY. making me an accomplished person, to these I gave the highest reward. Those who treated me with respect according to the rites (li), who protected me with i, who guarded and assisted me so that I did not commit faults, to these I gave the next highest [reward]. Those who were brave, strong, and martial, who were forward and self-reliant, who, when there was trouble in front, placed themselves in front, and when the trouble was in the rear, placed themselves in the rear, rescuing me out of danger and difficulty, to these I gave the next highest [reward]. After them I put the gentlemen who [merely] endured hardship."7 7 LSCC and SY continue with minor variants, " `When it comes to those who endured hardship, this gentleman will certainly be the first. How would I dare forget him?' Shu-hsing, the Chou Historiographer of the Interior, said on hearing of this, `Duke Wên will be hegemon! Of old the saintly kings put virtue to the fore and kept back force. Duke Wên has conducted himself in such a manner.' " SY goes on to quote from the same Ode as HSWC, and it may be that HSWC originally had something corresponding to these lines. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 639 No. 304/2. I have followed Karlgren (BMFEA 17.98). He [himself] followed the rules of conduct without error; And then he saw that they were put into practice. 110 Now if one does not internally reflect on his own faults, he will not please the people; so what reward will there be for him?9 9 : this is not clear. 281 1 From Hsün-tz? 3.7a-8b (Dubs 73-75) with considerable variation in wording. Those who deceive the people say, "The circumstances of ancient and modern times are different; hence methods for governing are different." Since the people are all stupid and without knowledge, mean and lacking in discrimination, they can even be deceived about that which they have seen [with their own eyes]; how much the more [may they be deceived about events] after a thousand years! Those who deceive the people foster deceit inside their very courtyards; how much the easier [to foster it] in regard to [events of] a thousand years ago! In that case how does the saint manage not to be deceived? The saint measures others by himself. He measures [men's] hearts by his heart; he measures their feelings by his feelings; he measures each kind of thing by its own kind. [To him] ancient and modern are one. Categories do not become confused; even though the time has been long, the principle [governing them] is the same. Truly human nature conforms to [the same] principle and does not go astray. That before the Five Emperors there is no record of individuals is not because there were no sages; it is because it was so long ago. That during the [time of the] Five Emperors there is no record of government is not because there was no good government; it is because it was so long ago. That for the time of the Yü2 2 I. e., of the Emperor Shun. and the Hsia the records of government are not so detailed as those of the Yin and the Chou is not because the government was not good; it is because it was so long ago. Now the greater the antiquity from which a record is transmitted, the more abridged it is, and the more recent the times, [relatively] the more detailed it is. If abridged, great events are mentioned; if detailed, small events are mentioned. As a result, stupid men hearing of the great events are ignorant of the small ones, and hearing of the small events are ignorant of the great ones. They are mistaken 111 because it has been so long ago. The Three Kings and the Five Emperors represent the acme of government. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 640 No. 304/3. I have used Karlgren's translation, ibid. God's commands were never disobeyed; Down to T`ang they were all alike [in this].4 4 Legge translates, "And in T`ang was found the subject for its display." Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 18.5a) says, "HSWC quotes the ode and says `ancient and modern are identical,' so it is quoting it to witness that `the early saints and the later saints are to be reckoned as one.' This shows that is to be taken as meaning `on the same level.' " It speaks of the identity of ancient and modern. 291 1 This is taken verbatim from Mencius 316 (4B/1). Shun was born in Chu-fêng. He moved to Fu-hsia, and died in Ming-t`iao. He was a man [who lived near to] the Eastern Barbarians. King Wên was born in Chou by [Mount] Ch`i and died in Pi-ying. He was a man [who lived near to] the Western Barbarians. In space they were separated by more than a thousand li; in time they were more than a thousand years apart, but their success in imposing their wills on the Middle Kingdom was like the two parts of a tally that fit perfectly together. Confucius said,2 2 is lacking in Mencius. "In their principles the earlier saints and the later saints are the same." The Ode says,3 3 Shih 640 No. 304/3; cf. HSWC 3/28, notes 3 and 4. God's commands were never disobeyed; Down to T`ang they were all alike [in this]. 301 1 Hsün-tz? 20.1a-b is the source for HSWC, which is followed by SY 10.3b-4a with variants not due to any of the other versions. Chia-yü 2.13a-b has copied from Hsün-tz? with only minor variants. Huai-nan tz? 12.19a-b and Wên-tz? 3.13b are very similar, but where the former is related to the Hsün-tz? series by making Confucius the chief figure, the latter does not mention him but begins, "Hence the Three August Ones and the Five Emperors had warning vessels." Legge, Shih, Proleg. 90 translates this passage. Confucius paid a visit to the ancestral temple of Chou,2 2 : likewise SY. Hsün-tz?, Chia-yü, and Huai-nan tz? all write also KTCY 1.7a, quoting HSWC. (Chao 91.) where 112 they had a vessel that leaned at an angle. Confucius asked the caretaker of the temple, "What vessel is that?" The caretaker replied, "Why that, I believe, is a Warning Vessel."3 3 Yang Liang says, " is the same as `right.' It means a ruler should put it to the right of his seat as a warning. . . . Some say it is the same as , meaning `to urge.' Wên-tz? . . . has ." Legge's "a vessel of the festive board" is not very exact. For CHy writes as in Hsün-tz?, likewise below. Confucius said, "I have heard that a Warning Vessel,4 4 KTCY A.4b has before and before . Likewise SY. (Chao 91.) when full, turns over, when empty it leans at an angle, and when half full it stands straight.5 5 KTCY, loc. cit., has changed the order to agree with Hsün-tz? and Chia-yü, adding (for ) "The enlightened prince considers it as conveying a warning," presumably from the latter. Is this true?" "It is." Confucius had Tz?-lu bring water to try it. Full, it turned over; half full, it stood straight; empty, it leaned at an angle. Confucius heaved a sigh and said, "Ah, does it ever happen that those who are full do not turn over!"6 6 KTCY, loc. cit., adds "When things reach fullness they decline; when joy reaches its extreme it becomes grief; when the sun reaches the center [of the sky] it begins to descend; when the moon is full it begins to wane." Huai-nan tz? seems to have been the source for this. Wên-tz? is similar. (Chao 92.) Tz?-lu said, "I should like to ask whether there is a method for controlling fullness?" Confucius said, "The method of controlling fullness is to repress and diminish it." Tz?-lu said, "Is there a method for diminishing it?" Confucius said, "Let those whose virtuous conduct is ample preserve it by being reverent. Let those whose territory is extensive preserve it by economy. Let those whose pay is rich and whose rank is elevated7 7 : HSWC 8/31 has and Chao would change this to agree; but 3/31 is the same as the present passage. preserve them by humility. Let those whose people are many and whose weapons are strong preserve them by fear. Let those possessed of intelligence and knowledge preserve them through [an air of] stupidity. Let those with great 113 learning and strong memories preserve them through [an air of] shallowness.8 8 This list varies in each of the other versions. It is repeated in nearly the same form in HSWC 3/31, 8/31. Now this is what I mean by repressing and diminishing." The Ode says,9 9 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 311 1 This section falls into two parts, both of which appear to be a development of Hsün-tz? 20.20b-22b, though the parallel is not close. In Hsün-tz? the whole is presented in the form of admonitions to the tutor of Po-ch`in, son of the Duke of Chou, on his being given the fief of Lu. In HSWC the first part describes the Duke of Chou's career; it occurs also in HSWC 8/32, and is followed by SY 8.12a-b, where some material is added, reminiscent of one line in SSTC 4.9a-b, which parallels Hsün-tz?. The second part, beginning "King Ch`êng enfeoffed Po-ch`in in Lu," is closely paralleled by SY 10.1a-2b, even to the Ode quoted at the end; the first few lines appear in Shih chi 33.3a (Mém. hist. 4.92-3). During the seven years that the Duke of Chou occupied the place of the Son of Heaven,2 2 : SY has "assisted." TPYL 474.8a has , but Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 27.24a writes (Chao 93), and Shih chi has . HSWC 8/31 has . That does not necessarily imply a temporary succession is apparent from Mencius 357 (5A/5.7), where the above phrase is used of Shun; likewise Lu shih () 11.13b. there were ten por gentlemen to whom he gave presents and whom he treated as teachers.3 3 : TPYL, loc. cit., has (CHy), likewise SY and HSWC 8/31. SSTC is the same, with for ; Hsün-tz? omits . Chao would emend to the TPYL reading. There were thirteen men to whom he [made return presents and]4 4 For CHy, B, C, D have . Chou has followed HSWC 8/32 in writing , but thinks it should be turned around to to agree with Hsün-tz? and SSTC. The sentence is lacking in SY. Hsün-tz? has ; SSTC: ; HSWC 8/31: . Chao would add here. regarded as friends, and forty-nine from poor dwellings in mean quarters to whom he gave precedence in interviews.5 5 CHy follows TPYL, loc. cit., and puts before . HSWC 8/31 has after . LSCC 15.9a (Wilhelm 215) makes the number 70. There were a hundred good men whom he advanced at regular times; there were a thousand teachers, and ten thousand officials.6 6 TPYL, loc. cit., writes for as in SY. (CHy.) From TPYL CHy here adds "At this time had the Duke of Chou been proud and miserly, there would have been few worthy gentlemen of the empire who came to see him." This sentence occurs also in SY (with for ), where it is followed by "If there had been any who did come, they would necessarily have been avaricious or not worth their pay. Ministers not worth their pay are not able to preserve a prince." 114 King Ch`êng enfeoffed Po-ch`in in Lu, [and before his departure for Lu] the Duke of Chou admonished him saying, "You are going now. Do not treat ordinary gentlemen with disrespect because of [your position in] the state of Lu. I am the son of King Wên, younger brother of King Wu, and uncle of King Ch`êng.7 7 Yang Liang points out that, having died before King Ch`êng, the Duke of Chou could hardly have known his posthumous title. In addition I am minister of the empire.8 8 CHy follows SY and writes for . Certainly my position in the empire is not to be despised. Yet in washing my hair once, I must catch it up [all wet as it is] three times; and in eating one meal I must thrice spit out [my food], and still I fear to lose [an interview with] one of the empire's gentlemen. "I have heard that9 9 For the following cf. HSWC 3/29, 8/31. one whose virtuous conduct is ample and who preserves it by reverence will prosper; that one whose territory is extensive and who preserves it by economy will find security; that one whose pay is rich and whose rank is elevated and who preserves them by humility will be honored; that one whose people are many and whose weapons are strong and who preserves them by fear will be victorious; that one who has intelligence and knowledge and who preserves them by [an air of] stupidity will excel;10 10 : HSWC 8/31 has . that one whose learning is extensive and whose memory is strong and who preserves them by [an air of] shallowness will have wisdom.11 11 : TPYL, loc. cit., has "breadth." (CHy.) Now these six are all of them `humbled virtues.' To have the rank of emperor and the wealth of the whole land12 12 Cf. DM 399. and then to lose the empire and forfeit their own lives from not humbling these virtues—such was the lot of Chieh and Chou. Can you not but take [them as a] warning? 115 "Truly, the I [ching] has the One Way whereby, on a large scale, one may preserve an empire, or on a medium scale, one may preserve a state, or more immediately one may preserve his person, and it is called humility. Now `it is the Way of Heaven to diminish the full and to augment the humble. It is the Way of Earth to overthrow the full and to replenish the humble. Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble. It is the Way of Man to hate the full and love the humble.'13 13 Cf. Yi King 226 (15. t`uan). By this principle the completed garment must have a gap at the lapel; the finished dwelling must have a break at a corner; the finished room must have a defect added. This shows that incompleteness is in accordance with the Way of Heaven. The I [ching] says,14 14 Yi King 89 (15) lacks the final , possibly introduced from the , which has . `Chien indicates progress and success. The superior man will maintain his success to the end, and have good fortune.' The Ode says,15 15 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. Take heed! and do not treat ordinary gentlemen with disrespect because of [your position in] the state of Lu." 321 1 This is based on Hsün-tz? 20.9a-10a. SY 17.16b-17a shows traces of influence by both HSWC and the original Hsün-tz? version, while Chia-yü 2.16a-b follows only Hsün-tz?. There is the following traditional story: Tz?-lu appeared before Confucius in full dress. Confucius said, "Yu, why so dressed up?2 2 : Hsün-tz? has ; Chia-yü: ; SY: . Chu Ch`i-fêng is probably right in making (anc. siwo) a phonetic borrowing for (anc. kiwo) Yang Liang defines the latter as "descriptive of richness in clothing" . Back where the Chiang comes out from under [Mt.] Min, at the beginning it is large enough [only] to fill up a beaker.3 3 : C has for . SY has . Huai-nan tz? 18.14a: . Kuo P`u's "Chiang fu" (Wên hsüan 12.11b) has the line . Chou would bring the up after , and omit to agree with Hsün-tz?, Chia-yü, and SY. I follow SY and read for . But by the 116 time it reaches the river ford, except by putting boats together and going when there is no wind,4 4 : lit., "avoiding the wind." it is impossible to cross. Is this not because the accumulated waters are so great?5 5 Yang Liang says, "Is it not because the water flowing down is in such great quantity that people are in awe of it? It means that it is the same with full dress and a severe expression." Now overdressed as you are6 6 With Chou, CHy emend to as in SY. (Chao.) and with so severe an expression,7 7 For Hsün-tz? has , which Yang Liang defines as "severe" . is there anyone in the empire to improve on you?" Tz?-lu hastily went out, changed his clothes, and came back humbly.8 8 For B, C have "bowing," which Chou says is wrong. Confucius said, "Yu, mark well what I am going to tell you. He who is cautious about his speech is not loud. He who is cautious about his conduct does not show off. The man who shows his knowledge and his skills in his face is a mean fellow. Truly, `when the superior man knows a thing, he holds that he knows it, and when he does not know a thing, he admits that he does not know it.'9 9 From Analects 151 (2/17). This is the important thing in speech. When he can do a thing, he holds that he can do it, and when he cannot do a thing he admits that he cannot do it: this is the important thing in action. In speech the important thing is knowledge; in action it is jên. The possession of both knowledge and jên—what more can you add to that?" The Ode says,10 10 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 331 1 This is copied almost verbatim from Hsün-tz? 2.1a-2b. The superior man does not respect foolhardiness in conduct; in explanations he does not respect sophistry; and in fame he does not respect notoriety. He respects only what is fitting. Now to carry a stone and throw yourself into the river is hard to do, but Shên-t`u Ti was capable of it.2 2 Cf. HSWC 1/26. The superior man does not respect 117 him,3 3 This sentence, from to occurs in SY 16.15a. because it was not according to the mean of li and i. That mountains and streams are level, that heaven and earth are equal,4 4 Yang Liang says means "on the same level" . Chuang-tz? 10.38b has . that Ch`i and Ch`in are contiguous, that `it goes in the ear and comes out the mouth,'5 5 : Yang Liang says this has not been satisfactorily explained and gives two possibilities: "[The mouth] is the pass through a mountain, meaning a mountain has ears and mouth. `When you shout at one mountain, the whole range answers.' (Chuang-tz? 10.41a, Ss?-ma Piao's com.) This is [the idea of] a mountain hearing a man's voice and answering it, and so [the text] says `it goes in the ear and comes out the mouth.' Some say that what is meant by a mountain's having a mouth is that it spits out and draws in clouds and mist." that a barb has whiskers,6 6 Yü Yüeh (Chu-tz? p`ing-i 12.6b) says, "I suspect is a phonetic borrowing for , which is defined in Shuo wên as `an old woman' . To say that old women have beards when they have not is characterized as a hard theory to uphold." and an egg has hair:7 7 For cf. Chuang-tz? 10.40a. these theories are difficult to uphold, but Têng Hsi and Hui Shih were equal to it. The superior man does not respect them, because [such paradoxes] are not in accord with the mean of li and i. The notoriety of Tao-chih is in everyone's mouth;8 8 : Yang Liang says, "His praises have long been sung in the mouths of men." As SY, loc. cit., has , Hao I-hsing would here emend to . Yü Yüeh (op. cit. 2.9a-b) makes a phonetic borrowing for , and says the expression is like "black-mouthed" beasts of prey, which comes to the same general meaning as in SY. Wang Hsien-ch`ien rejects these explanations and makes mean something like "stammer," but does not specify how it is to be fitted into the context. I follow Yang. his fame is [glaring as] the sun and moon, and is transmitted without interruption [to later generations] together with the fame of Shun and Yü. The superior man does not respect him, as [such notoriety] is not in accord with mean of li and i. Thus the superior man does not respect foolhardiness in conduct; in explanations he does not respect sophistry; and in fame he does not respect notoriety. He respects only what is fitting. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 641 No. 304/4. Hsün-tz? quotes 240 No. 170/6. Neither violent nor remiss, Neither hard nor soft.10 10 CHy adds "It says what is fitting is to be valued." 118 341 1 This is taken from Mêng-tz? 10A.1a-b (Mencius 369-72) with omissions and slight changes in wording. I have followed Legge's translation. Po-i and Shu-ch`i2 2 Mencius does not mention . would not allow their eyes to look on a bad sight, or their ears to listen to a bad sound. They would not serve a prince of whom they did not approve, or command a people whom they did not esteem. They could not bear to dwell either in [a court] from which a lawless government emanated, or among lawless people. They considered living with commoners as equivalent to sitting in dirt and charcoal while wearing court robes and court cap. Therefore when men [now] hear the character of Po-i, the avaricious3 3 For Mencius has "the corrupt." Chao (95-6) quotes evidence showing that was probably also the original reading in Mencius. become pure and the weak acquire determination. When we come to Liu-hsia Hui,4 4 Mencius has only the name. HSWC has omitted a paragraph on I-yin. it is not thus. He was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor would he refuse an inferior office. When advanced to employment he did not conceal his worth, [but] made it a point to follow5 5 For Mencius has . the True Way. When straitened by poverty he did not grieve; when dismissed and left without office he did not murmur. Living with commoners he was happy6 6 For ibid. has . and would not leave. [He would say,] "Although he stand by my side with breast and arms bare, or with his body naked, how can another person7 7 For ibid. has . defile me?" Therefore when men [now] hear the character of Liu-hsia Hui, the mean become generous and the niggardly become liberal. When we come to Confucius' leaving Lu and delaying his departure,8 8 The words are ascribed to Confucius, ibid., which has for . "when it was proper to go, he went,9 9 For Mencius has "go quickly." and when it was proper to stay, he stayed": this is the way to leave the country of one's father and mother.10 10 Mencius transposes this phrase before . . . . 119 Po-i among the saints was the pure one; Liu-hsia Hui was the accommodating one; and Confucius was the temperate one.11 11 For Mencius has . The Ode says,12 12 Shih 641 No. 304/4. Neither violent nor remiss, Neither hard nor soft. This speaks of moderation and harmony. 351 1 Condensed from Hsün-tz? 5.9a-10a (Dubs 132-3). In scaling taxes and rectifying affairs the king levies a tithe on fields; at the customs barriers and markets he has inspections, but no duties; the use of mountains and forests, of lakes and weirs is limited to certain seasons, but it is not prohibited [entirely];2 2 Cf. Mencius 162 (1B/5.3), "The husbandmen [cultivated for the government] one-ninth of the land; . . . at the passes and in the markets, [strangers] were inspected, but [goods] were not taxed; there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs." Also Li Ki 1.293 (3/3.11), "Anciently the public fields were cultivated by the united labors of the farmers around them, from the produce of whose private fields nothing was levied. A rent was charged for the stances in the market-places, but wares were not taxed. Travellers were examined at the different passes, but no duties were levied from them. Into the forests and plains at the foot of mountains the people went without hindrance at the proper seasons." (Legge 1.227.) he inspects3 3 Yang Liang says means "look at" . the land, and taxes4 4 For read . (Chou.) [on the basis of] the quality of the soil. He has tribute sent according to [the length of]5 5 Hsün-tz? has after is "to measure the distance." (Wang Nien-sun.) the way it must come. All produce comes without interference in circulation, so that it may be freely distributed. Those near [the imperial domain] do not hide their ability, and those far away are not dissatisfied with their labor. Though a state be secluded and backward, there is none [of its inhabitants] but will hasten to serve him and rejoice [in his government]. This is what is 120 meant by a king's scaling taxes and rectifying affairs. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 641 No. 304/4. Gently he spreads his instructions abroad And all dignities and riches are concentrated in him. 361 1 From Hsün-tz? 10.1a-4a (Dubs 157-161.) Hsin hsü 3.2a-4a is much closer to Hsün-tz?. Sun Ch`ing2 2 All texts have ; Hsün-tz? adds . That Hsün-tz?'s name was written with to avoid the taboo name of the Emperor Hsüan of the Han has been generally accepted since Ss?-ma Chên and Yen Shih-ku. However, Wang Hsiench`ien (in Hsün-tz? k`ao-chêng 14b) demonstrates that this could not be true, and explains the use of the two characters by their similarity in sound. and the Prince of Lin-wu3 3 : CHy, D write . were discussing military affairs before King Hsiao-ch`êng of Chao. The king said, "I venture to ask what is [most] important in military operations." The Prince of Lin-wu said, "Well, in military operations the important thing is on the one hand to take advantage of the opportunities given by Heaven and on the other to take advantage of the terrain. Mobilize last but get there first. This is what is important in military operations." Sun Ch`ing said, "Not so. Now the one important thing in military operations consists in gaining the support of officers and people. If the six [chariot] horses are not in accord, Ts`ao-fu [himself] could not drive them far. If bow and arrow do not match, [even] Yi could not hit a small mark with them. Without the support of officers and people, T`ang or Wu would not have been able to win victories with them. Seen in this light, the important thing is simply to gain the support of officers and people." The Prince of Lin-wu said, "Not so. What is employed in military tactics is [the element of] surprise; what is valued are stratagems and guile. Those skilled in the use [of such elements] may be compared with an escaping hare—no one knows where they are going to pop out. Sun [Wu] and Wu [Ch`i] used them, and were without opponents in the empire. Seen in this light, why 1219 is it necessary to wait for the support of officers and people before you can do anything?" Sun Ch`ing said, "Not so. What you3 3 : CHy, D write . speak of are the military operations of a feudal lord, the affairs of a scheming minister. What I am talking about are the military methods of the man characterized by jên, and the undertakings of a Saintly King. It is possible to practice guile only against those who are lazy or where there is a marked estrangement between prince and subjects, between superior and inferior. Now if a Chih [tries to] deceive a Chieh, there is still [the chance of] skill and awkwardness involved; but if a Chieh [tries to] deceive a Yao, it is like stirring up boiling water with the finger, or dashing an egg against a rock. If you run into a raging fire while carrying feathers and fur, you will be burnt. So how can you use guile? Furthermore, who is going to succeed with an oppressive state? Any who succeed with such [a state] must needs cheat the people.4 4 Hsün-tz? has "Then with whom is the prince of an oppressive state going to achieve his success? Those with whom he achieves his success must be the people of that state." But the people's love for me is like the pleasure they take in the chiao and the lan plants for their fragrance; it is joyous as [the love between] father and son.5 5 Hsün-tz? has "The people's love for me is comparable to that felt for their fathers and mothers as regards the pleasure it affords them. Their liking for me is comparable to their liking chiao and lan plants for their fragrance." This sentence appears toward the end in the Hsün-tz? and Hsin hsü versions. They regard their superiors as men with poisonous beestingers.6 6 Chou thinks there should be before and before : "Their resentful glances at their superiors are like poisonous bee-stings." Though there be a Chieh or a Chih, is [anyone] going to be willing on the behalf of those he most hates to injure those whom he most loves? This is like [trying to] make a man's sons and grandsons injure their own parents; the former will notify them in advance,7 7 : "They (the people) will realize in advance their mistake" (??) This is evidently a corruption of Hsün-tz?, . . . . I suspect that was miswritten , necessitating the emendation of to . so how can you use guile? "Furthermore, the troops of the man characterized by jên form companies when together, and when separated they form ranks. 122 Extended, they are like the long sword Mo-yeh:8 8 Wu ti chi 4b-5a says that Kan-chiang had been commissioned by King Ho-lü of Wu to cast a sword. When the finest materials had been assembled, despite sacrifices to the God of the Furnace by three hundred women, the gold and silver failed to fuse with the iron. Kan-chiang told his wife, Mo-yeh, that according to his master, in such cases a visit to the God of the Furnace by a woman would be efficacious. Mo-yeh cast herself into the furnace and the molten metals at once flowed out. Kan-chiang then made two swords, calling the male blade Kan-chiang and the female one Mo-yeh. From the remaining metal he fashioned 3000 swords. He presented the sword Kan-chiang to King Ho-lü and hid the female sword, which continually cried and sobbed for her mate. Another version of this legend appears in Wu-Yüeh ch`unch`iu (followed by Giles, BD 934), whereby Mo-yeh merely cuts off her hair and finger nails to cast them in the furnace. those running up against them are cut in two. In a salient they are like the sharp point of Mo-yeh: those who oppose them are destroyed. In surrounding [operations] they are immovable as hills and mountains. In square formations they are like a great boulder that cannot be disloged; those that butt against them retreat with broken horns and cracked joints. So how can you use guile? The Ode says,9 9 Shih 642 No. 304/6. The Martial King displayed his banner,10 10 : CHy follows Hsün-tz? and Shih k`ao 2.46a to write . Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 18.10a) also has . (Chao.) And with reverence grasped his axe. It was like [the case of] a blazing fire, Which no one can repress.11 11 : Hsün-tz? writes , and Ch`ên (loc. cit.) thinks that was the Han shih reading. (Chao.) This is said of the military tactics of T`ang and Wu." King Hsiao-ch`êng withdrew from the mat, clasped his hands12 12 : "raised his head." CHy thinks it should be , "bent his head." Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.5a-b) compares HSWC 6/20 , and thinks this also should be . (Chao 98.) and said, "Though I am not intelligent, I ask to rely on the Master's military tactics." 37 The ruler1 1 Chao (98) correctly prefers TPYL 430.1a to . who has received the heavenly mandate adjusts his clothes and cap and puts on a dignified attitude, and the people, 123 regarding him from afar, trust him.2 2 Cf. Analects 353 (20/2.2): "The ruler adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe." Next to him is the one whom they trust from having heard him speak. Next is the one whom they trust after viewing his conduct. But he is lowest of all3 3 TPYL, loc. cit., has . Cf. HSWC 2/28 for a similar paragraph. whom everyone mistrusts after seeing his conduct. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 347 No. 200/3. Be careful of your words: [People] will say that you are untruthful. 38 In antiquity they understood the empire without going out of doors. They perceived1 1 Chih-yao 8.23b-24a has for and after . (Chao 98.) the Way of Heaven without looking out of their windows. This was not because their eyes could see a thousand li ahead, nor because their ears could hear [sounds] a thousand2 2 : Chih-yao, loc. cit., has . (Chao 99.) li away, but because they measured others by their own feelings.3 3 Chih-yao adds "By their own capacity they measured it." (Chao.) From their own dislike of hunger and cold they understood the empire's desire for food and clothing; from their own dislike of toil and suffering they understood the empire's desire for peace and ease; from their own dislike of decay and poverty they understood the empire's desire for riches and abundance.4 4 Chih-yao reads "Desiring clothing and food themselves, they understood the empire's desire for clothing and food. Desiring peace and ease themselves, they understood the empire's desire for peace and ease. Having likes and dislikes themselves, they understood the likes and dislikes of the empire." (Chao.) Understanding these things was how the sage-kings put the empire in order without descending from the mats [on which they were sitting]. Hence the way of the superior man rests [solely] on sincereity and compassion.5 5 Cf. Analects 170 (4/15.2), with "the master" for . Now, hunger and thirst 124 troubling blood and ch`i, cold and heat acting on the skin,6 6 . The text is corrupt; I have followed Chih-yao, which omits and . these four are the great misfortunes of the people. It is impossible to teach or control them unless these misfortunes are removed.7 7 : Chih-yao has before , and Chao (100) would add it here to recapitulate the just above. If the four limbs are not covered, there will be few persons practicing jên. If the five viscera are empty, there will be no gentlemen established [in the way of virtue].8 8 Chao would follow Chih-yao and add "When within the people do not lack food, and without they do not suffer from cold, then they can be controlled by li." Therefore, after the method of the former kings, the Son of Heaven personally tilled the soil, and the Empress and Imperial Concubines tended the silkworms, making themselves the first in the Empire to care for food and clothing. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 184 No. 121/3; 106 No. 63. How shall our parents get food? My heart is sad:10 That man has no longer garment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">125 CHAPTER IV 11 1 Hsin hsü 7.1b-2a is nearly identical. After the quotation from the Ode it adds, "Is it not indeed pathetic that the innocent should die?" . [The tyrant] Chou invented the punishment of the fiery [pit] and the pillar.2 2 For read as in HFT 7.3a and 17.1b (Chao 101.) Cf. Shih chi 3.11a (Mém. hist. 1.201, note 1) for a description. The Prince Pi-kan said, "If, when his master is outrageous, [the minister]3 3 Hsin hsü adds after . does not remonstrate, he is not loyal. If from fear of death he does not speak, he is not brave. If he sees a fault, he objects, and if [his objections] go unheeded, he dies: this is the height of loyalty." Whereupon he remonstrated for three days without leaving the court. Chou accordingly4 4 Read with Hsin hsü for "imprisoned him." As there is elsewhere no such tradition concerning Pi-kan, must be right. Possibly is a contamination from the next section. put him to death. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 340 No. 198/1. [The terrors of] Great Heaven are very excessive; I shall take care6 6 is generally taken as ; Legge translates, "But indeed I have committed no offence"; likewise Karlgren. Han Ying has put the line in a context requiring the more usual meaning of . to commit no offence. 21 1 Hsin hsü 7.1b is very similar, but lacks the quotation at the end. Legge, Shih, Proleg. 91, translates this paragraph. Chieh made a wine lake in which a boat could move about, and the [resulting] mound of dregs was so [high] that from it one could see for a distance of ten li. There were three thousand men who drank [from the lake] like cattle.2 2 Cf. Shih chi 3.10b (Mém. hist. 1.201); HSWC 2/22. Kuan Lung-fêng proffered a remonstrance:3 3 : cf. *Shên chien 5.2a: "Should someone ask whether it was more difficult to offer a remonstrance than to receive one. . ." I take to be the equivalent of , and not "came to remonstrate with him" as Legge does. "In antiquity 126 rulers themselves practiced li and i. They loved the people and were sparing of property. As a result their states were at peace and they themselves lived out their span of life. But your Highness now is using up property as though it could not be exhausted and is putting people to death as though he were afraid he would not be able to kill them all.4 4 Hsin hsü has "using the people as though he thought they could not die." If Your Highness does not reform, the retribution of Heaven will certainly descend on him and punishment will inevitably come to him. May Your Highness reform!" He stood at his post without leaving the court until Chieh imprisoned him and put him to death. On hearing of this the superior man says, "It was the will of Heaven." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 340 No. 198/1. [The terrors of] Great Heaven are very excessive; I shall take care6 6 Cf. HSWC 4/1 note 6. to commit no offence. 31 1 From Hsün-tz? 9.6a-b, with minor verbal changes and the addition of the conclusion and quotation from the Ode. There is great loyalty, secondary loyalty, inferior loyalty, and there is treason to the state.2 2 Ch`u-hsüeh chi 17.8b-9a begins with "There are three ways of loyalty." (Chao 102.) Enveloping a prince with the True Way so as to reform him constitutes great loyalty. Stirring up a prince with virtue so as to assist him constitutes secondary loyalty. Holding up the right to censure the wrong so as to provoke the prince3 3 B, C, D lack , which Chou and CHy add from Hsün-tz?. CHy follows TPYL 418.2a and writes "dies for it" for . Ch`u-hsüeh chi, loc. cit., has , and Hsün-tz? has . (Chao 103.) Yang Liang explains, "Because he gives his prince the reputation of harming sages, it constitutes inferior loyalty." constitutes inferior loyalty. To be without consideration for the public or for duty (i),4 4 : delete with Chou. to be weakly complaisant and 127 grossly lax5 5 Read for as in Hsün-tz?. (Chao.) so as to assure one's salary and to support one's friends6 6 Chou adds , which is lacking in the other texts, from Hsün-tz?; CHy and Chao would also add it. —this constitutes treason to the state. Such a relation as that of the Duke of Chou to King Ch`êng can be called one of great loyalty. That of Kuan Chung to Duke Huan can be called one of secondary loyalty. That of [Wu] Tz?-hsü to Fu-ch`ai can be called one of inferior loyalty. That of Ts`ao Ch`u-lung to [the tyrant] Chou7 7 Chou quotes SY 10.16a (after Yang Liang), where a Ch`u-lung is mentioned as tso-shih to Chieh, and on the basis of which would emend to . Wang Hsien-ch`ien, however, points out that Hsün-tz? 10.10b mentions Ts`ao Ch`u-lung as belonging to the Shang, and so discredits the SY version. (Chao.) can be called traitorous. These all are ways of acting of ministers. Good or ill fortune comes accordingly as they are worthy or unworthy. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 341 No. 198/3. He does not discharge his duties,9 9 For B, C have as in Mao shih. (CHy.) But only creates distress to the king. 41 1 Hsün-tz? 20.18a-b is the source for this paragraph. Chia-yü 1.26a modifies Hsün-tz?; SY 8.11b-12a shows some relation to both Hsün-tz? and HSWC, but is considerably amplified. Duke Ai asked about choosing men. Confucius said, "Do not choose the physically strong,2 2 : Yang Liang glosses: "a covetous person." Hao I-hsing says, " has not the meaning `to covet' . . . I do not know what character it is a mistake for, but Yang's commentary is very wrong." The usual meaning of the word makes excellent sense. SY has ? "The physically strong will certainly wish to encroach upon others, and cannot be taken as a model." or the eloquent, or the sharp-tongued.3 3 With Hao I-hsing I emend to to agree with SY "sharp-tongued." (Chao 104.) The physically strong are proud; the eloquent flatter; the sharp-tongued4 4 Read before as in Yang Liang's quotation of HSWC. (CHy.) are unreliable. Just as you string a bow before you look to its strength, and break a horse before you look for its good points, [even so] you see that a gentleman is honest and without guile before you look to him for knowledge. For a gentleman 128 who is not honest and yet has great knowledge may be compared with a wolf: it is difficult to approach him. The Chou shu says,5 5 * I-Chou-shu 3.14a has . Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 48.8b quotes HSWC as the same, with after and continues: . " `Do not add wings to a tiger, lest he fly into the city, seize men and eat them.' Now putting an unworthy man in power is adding wings to a tiger." Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.1a) thinks this is the proper reading, and Chao agrees. HFT 17.1b also quotes the line from I-Chou-shu. (CHy.) `To add wings to a tiger'—is this not indeed dangerous?" 6 Shih 341 No. 198/3. The Ode says, He does not discharge his duties,7 7 This should probably be as in 4/3. But only creates distress to the king. It speaks of his not attending to his duties and being dissatisfied with his master. 51 1 This varies somewhat from both Kuan-tz? 16.10b-11a and LSCC 18.5a-6b (Wilhelm 295-7); SY 13.3b-5a is based on the latter. Duke Huan of Ch`i planned in private with Kuan Chung to attack Chü, and yet the people knew of it. Duke Huan said to Kuan Chung, "I spoke to you2 2 "second father" was the title bestowed on Kuan Chung by Duke Huan; cf. Pelliot, TP 27 (1930) .71-2, note 2. alone, and yet the people know. Why is this?" Kuan Chung said, "It seems to me3 3 For read after . (CHy.) that there is a sage in the country. Where is Tung-kuo Ya?"4 4 : Kuan-tz? has Yu; SY has Ch`ui. Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.5b) says is a mistake for ?i i For this character, see the table on p. 358. , the old form of . As LSCC and Lun hêng 26.17a both agree with HSWC and write , Chao thinks Yü is wrong. Wang Yin-chin (Ching-i shu-wên 23.16a) says his name was , and was his tz?. (Chao 105.) Duke Huan looked around and said, "Here he is." Kuan Chung said, "Did you tell it?" Tung-kuo Ya said, "I did." Kuan Chung said, "How did you know it?" 129 He said, "I have heard that the superior man has three aspects. From this I knew it." Kuan Chung said, "What do you mean by three aspects?" He said, "Pleased and happy5 5 D has for . B, C have . —this is the musical6 6 , lit., "bells and drums." aspect. Anxious and grieved—this is the aspect of mourning. Fierce and replete—this is the military7 7 , lit., "weapons and armor." aspect. From this I knew." Kuan Chung said, "How did you know it was to be Chü?" He replied, "His Highness pointed to the southeast.8 8 For I follow B, C and read as more accurate geographically. His mouth opened and did not close. His tongue was raised and did not fall. That is how I knew it was to be Chü." Duke Huan approved.9 9 B, C here insert the Ode quoted at the end. CHy says it should either be omitted here or the paragraph should be divided into two. Master Tung-kuo said that the eyes are representative of the mind, and that words are the indicators of action. Now knowledge of men is not to be had for the asking. By regarding a man's demeanor, investigating his motives, and determining his choice, you will get to the bottom of his nature. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 342 No. 198/4. What other men have in their minds, I can measure by reflection. 6 Now you may have strong armor and sharp weapons,1 1 Cf. Mencius 135 (1A/5.3): "The strong mail and sharp weapons of the troops of Ch`in and Ch`u." but if they are not sufficient to undertake an expedition against the enemy or to defeat the foe,2 2 usually is applied to a specific enemy in a pejorative sense. [it is just the same as not having weapons at all].3 3 This phrase has become displaced to a position after the next sentence, the conclusion to which I have supplied in brackets. Your bow may be good and the arrows may match, but if they are not sufficient to shoot far and to hit a small mark, [it is just the same as having no bow and arrows]. If the 130 people are not equal to being put to hard service against a formidable enemy, it is just the same as not having the people at all. Just as a thousand li of boulders does not mean you have any [real] territory, even so a million4 4 For TPYL 499.1a has "a billion," or "a hundred billion," depending on the definition of . ignorant citizens does not mean you have the people. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 356 No. 203/7. In the south is the Sieve, But it is of no use to sift. In the north is the Ladle, But it lades out no liquor. 71 1 Huai-nan tz? 14.10a-b seems to be derived from a common source. According to tradition, Shun played on the five-string lute, singing the "Nan-fêng" to it,2 2 This sentence, introduced by , occurs in several places: Li Ki 2.67 (17/2.1) has "invented" for ; likewise Shih chi 24.16a (Mém. hist. 3.254 and note 6); both however omit . Hsin yü 1.96 (von Gabain 32) has . Chia yü 8.7a is the same with for and for , and follows with four lines which are attributed to the "Nan-fêng" (translated by Chavannes, op. cit.). Chêng Hsüan's com. on Li chi says he has not seen it, and the quotation in Chia-yü may be from the hand of Wang Su. and yet the empire was in order. Duke P`ing of Chou3 3 : Huai-nan tz? has , and it is certainly he who is meant. always had wine within reach, while the bells and musical stones were not loosened from their support, and yet the world was likewise in order. But a commoner with only a hundred mou of land and a single house "has no leisure to rest,"4 4 Cf. Shih 260 No. 167, 248 No. 162. nor is there any way for him to change [his condition]. Now the way in which one man keeps in touch with the whole empire and still has leisure while [the masses] below are under control, is by getting others to work for him. But when a man arrogates to himself the authority of ordering others around without being able to control the masses below, then the person on the throne is not a man worthy of his position. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 356 No. 203/7. 131 In the south is the Sieve, But it is of no use to sift. In the north is the Ladle, But it lades out no liquor. It speaks of having the position but not fulfilling its duties. 81 1 SY 5.6a follows this closely, quoting from the same poem. When Duke Huan of Ch`i went to attack the Shan-jung, his route passed through Yen, and the Prince of Yen escorted him beyond the borders [of his own state].2 2 Shih chi 34.3a (Mém. hist. 4.136): "In the 27th year [of Duke Chuang of Yen] (B.C. 674) the Shan-jung invaded our territory. Duke Huan of Ch`i came to the aid of Yen, passing to the north to attack the Shan-jung and then returning [through Yen]. The Prince of Yen accompanied Duke Huan of Ch`i past his own borders, and Duke Huan accordingly cut off the land as far as the Prince of Yen had gone and gave it to Yen." Chou suggests that the entry in Ch`un ch`iu (Tso chuan 100, Chuang 20) refers to this incident: "In winter, (B.C. 673) a body of men from Ch`i smote the Jung." Duke Huan asked Kuan Chung, "When one feudal lord escorts another, is it right that he should go beyond his own borders?" Kuan Chung said, "Unless it is the Son of Heaven [whom he is escorting], he does not go beyond his own borders." Duke Huan said, "Then it was out of fear of me that he violated ritual usage (li). It is not right that I should be the cause of [the Prince of] Yen's violating ritual (li)." Whereupon he cut off his territory as far as the Prince of Yen had gone and presented it to Yen. When the feudal lords heard of this, they all payed their respects in the court of Ch`i. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 366 No. 207/5. Quietly4 4 : Mao shih and SY have . fulfill the duties5 5 : Mao shih has . of your offices, Loving the correct and the upright. So shall the Spirits hearken to you, And give you large measures of bright happiness. 132 9 The music of Shun1 1 is so defined in Analects 164 (3/25); see note 3 below. in using shield and battle-axe2 2 Cf. Li Ki 2.46 (17/1.1): "The combination of those modulated sounds, so as to give pleasure, and the [direction in harmony with them of the] shields and axes, and of the plumes and ox-tails, constitutes what we call music." (Legge 2.92.) The shields and axes were used in mimes of war; the plumes and ox-tails in those of peace. Cf. ibid. 1.469 (6/1.7): "The Grand director of Music taught how to brandish the shield and axe." (Legge 1.347.) was not perfect music3 3 Cf. Li Ki 2.62 (17/1.26): "The dances with shields and axes did not belong to the most excellent music." (Legge 2.102.) But Analects 164 (3/25): "The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good." ; his marriage with his two wives was not in complete accord with ritual (li)4 4 Mencius 345 (5A/2.1): "Wang Chang asked [Mencius], saying, `The Ode says, In marrying a wife, how ought a man to proceed? He must inform his parents. If the rule be indeed as here expressed, no man ought to have illustrated it so well as Shun. How was it that Shun's marriage took place without his informing [his parents]?' " ; his enfeoffing the nineteen sons of Huang-ti5 5 Cf. Lu shih () 11.15a: "[Shun] enfeoffed nineteen grandsons of Huang Ti as marquises and earls." was not based on justice (i); his going in the fields weeping and wailing6 6 Cf. Mencius 342 (5A/1.1): "When Shun went into the fields, he cried out and wept towards the pitying heavens," whence probably Shu ching 65-6 (2B/3.21): "In the early time of the emperor, when he was living by mount Li, he went into the fields, and daily cried out and wept toward the pitying heavens." (This belongs to the "old text.") was not living up to his fate. From the human point of view, he [acted] correctly, but judged from the legal point of view, he did not. The Li says,7 7 DM 422 (27/3); Li Ki 2.467 (28/2.38). ["The Way of the Sages includes] the three hundred ways of acting according to ritual (li), and the three thousand rules of demeanor." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 366 No. 207/4. Quietly fulfill the duties of your offices, Associating with the correct and upright So shall the Spirits hearken to you, And give you good. 133 101 1 This is taken from Hsün-tz? 10.12a-14b. It occurs also in Shih chi 23.6a-8a (Mém. hist. 3.216-20). Li is the ultimate in establishing distinctions2 2 : Hsün-tz? has , defined by Yang Liang as "distinguish." ; it is the foundation for strengthening a state; it constitutes the channel for the spread of royal prestige; it represents the basis for merit and fame. The king and nobles unify the empire by following it, or they fail to follow it, and as a result the state falls. Hence it is not enough to have strong arms and sharp weapons to engage in military operations3 3 Cf. HSWC 4/6. ; high walls and deep moats do not insure security; harsh commands and a multiplicity of punishments are inadequate for the establishment of majesty. Success accompanies the Way of li, while neglect of the Way of li results in ruin. Of old the people of Ch`u made shields of scaly dragon skin and rhinocerous hide that were stout as metal or stone, and lances of steel like [that from] Yüan.4 4 : Hsün-tz? has . Shih chi: ? .j j For this character, see the table on p. 358. Yang Liang says Yüan is a place name. Hsü Kuang says steel is called . is a variant of , a lance ; cf. *Fang yen 9.1b. They were cruel as [the sting of] wasp or scorpion. Light and edged, hard and sharp, they were quick as a whirlwind. Yet the army [of Ch`u] was endangered in Ch`iusha, and T`ang-tz?5 5 Shih chi writes ; Hsün-tz? has . He was Ch`u's general. perished. Chuang Ch`iao rose up,6 6 : B, C incorrectly have . and Ch`u was divided into three or four [parts].7 7 For the dismemberment of Ch`u, cf. Mém. hist. loc. cit. (note 6). In what way was this due to a lack of stout armor and sharp weapons? It was a result of employing means in governing that were not [in accord with] the Way of li. [Ch`u] had the Ju and Huai [Rivers] as obstacles, and the Han and Chiang [Rivers] for moats; it was encircled by the Fang-chêng [mountains], and cut off by the forests of Têng; yet Ch`in's army came to Yen and Ying and captured them as [easily as] one shakes off dry [leaves]. In what way was this due to a lack of 134 strong defenses and barriers? It was a result of employing means in governing that were not [in accord with] the Way of li. [The tyrant] Chou put Pi-kan to death and imprisoned the viscount of Chi, he devised the punishment of the fiery [pit] and the pillar, and executions went on continually. Subordinates were anxious and resentful, while none of them had any hope for his own life. Yet when the army of Chou arrived, his orders were not carried out by his attendants. In what way was this8 8 For read with Shih chi and Hsün-tz?. due to any lack of harsh commands or of a multiplicity of punishments? It was the result of employing in government means that were not [in accord with] the Way of li. If the Way is made clear, then [the people] are treated equitably and distinctions are established for them; if they are truly loved and employed in season, then inferiors will respond to superiors like shadow or echo. Only when a person fails to obey orders is he punished. One man is punished and the empire submits. The [guilty] inferior9 9 For Hsün-tz? has ; Shih chi, . does not blame his superior, but realizes that the fault lies with himself. In this way punishments and crimes10 10 For D has "rewards." will both be diminished, and royal prestige will spread like water flowing. This results from nothing else than following this way. The Ode says,11 11 Shih 463 No. 244/6. From the east to the west12 12 Mao shih interchanges and . From the south to the north, There was not a thought but did him homage. Thus those nearby make him the subject of songs and ballads, and those far away come in haste to him, [while those from] secluded and backward states without exception rush to be in his employment, making him their refuge and their pleasure, even as an infant turns to its mother. Why is this? It is because jên is the pattern, i is established, teaching is sincere, love is deep, and li and music are everywhere prevalent. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 371 No. 209/3. 135 Li and i14 14 Shih k`ao 17b has for (I-shuo k`ao 9.13b). are according to rule; Every smile and word are as they should be. 111 1 This is based on Hsün-tz? 8.2b-4a, where the whole is cast in the form of a supposititious dialogue. The prince2 2 : I follow CHy, B, C and read for . Hsün-tz? has . Chou would omit . is one who distributes largesse according to li; he is just to all [in his gifts] and without prejudice. The subject is one who serves his prince according to li; being loyal and obedient, he is never lax.3 3 : Hsün-tz? has . Since the father is generous and kind, he observes li. Since the son is respectful and loving, he practices respect. Since the elder brother is kind and loving, he shows fraternal affection. Since the younger brother is reverent and submissive, he is not remiss.4 4 : I follow B, C and read . (Chao.) The husband, being an enlightened supervisor,5 5 : B, C have ; cf. Shih 44 No. 29/1: "enlighten this lower earth." Chêng Hsüan's commentary: "It is a metaphor for the ruler overseeing the affairs of the empire." observes the distinction [between husband and wife].6 6 : Hao I-hsing says . The wife, being pliant and submissive, is obedient. If her husband acts [in a manner] not in accordance with the proper way, though frightened, she herself urges him [to be good]. Such is the complete way.7 7 . B, C, D have for , and so in my translation. CHy follows Hsün-tz?: , and says, "The text above speaks of prince and minister, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, all together; so this should not be connected with the way of a wife alone." He takes the reading in the edition to be an editor's emendation and restores the Hsün-tz? reading. Disorder comes with partiality; with completeness comes order. It may be asked8 8 In Hsün-tz? has introduced each of the foregoing statements. how all may be accomplished together. The answer is, pay attention to li. Of old the Former Kings, by attending to li, made the empire obedient, and hence their virtue extended to Heaven and Earth. Nothing they did but was proper. Now the superior man is reverent but not fearful,9 9 Wang Yin-chin reads as in (Shih 642 No. 304/5) "Unterrified, unscared." respectful but 136 not anxious.10 10 : Wang Yin-chih says it should in the sense of "frightened." This sentence is reminiscent of Analects 253 (12/5): . In poverty and want he is not straitened, with riches and honors he is not proud, but by responding to changing circumstances he is not reduced to extremity. This constitutes paying attention to li.11 11 : likewise Hsün-tz?. I suspect that the comes from the identical phrase at the end of this passage. Thus the superior man, insofar as li is concerned, being respectful is contented; being straightforward12 12 . Hsün-tz? has , and CHy says also has this meaning. in affairs he is not remiss; being generous13 13 : Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 1781-2) says, "The two characters are redundant. stands for by a mistake in form, and is the same as by a mistake in sound. One edition would write and one would have , and a later editor, unable to choose between them, kept them both." Chao thinks this is correct, as two characters balance with the other phrases. But Hsün-tz? has , and it is not easy to confuse phonetically *iwan and *giug. in his relations with others, he is not self-seeking. In regard to demeanor he is polished14 14 Cf. Analects 278 (14/9): "Tzu-yü polished the style." without giving offence.15 15 : Wang Nien-sun says should be taken as in the sense of "oppose" , and paraphrases: "The superior man corrects and adorns his person without offending against what is proper." When he responds to changing circumstances, being alert and adaptable, he does not get into trouble. In his relations with officials and craftsmen he does not compete16 16 : CHy, B, C have , likewise Hsün-tz?, and Chou would follow that reading; however, the two are interchangeable. (Chao 109.) with their ability, but makes use of their services. In regard to the living creatures of Heaven and Earth, he does not oppose their state, but carefully plans for their prosperity.17 17 . For B, C have . CHy and D write probably under the influence of Hsün-tz?: "He does not bother about explaining how they got to be as they are, but makes the best possible use of their properties." and are interchangeable; cf. Yi King 281 (11 hsiang): , where is a variant. In serving18 18 : Hao I-hsing above has argued that Hsün-tz? should be as in HSWC, and Wang Hsien-ch`ien thinks his argument is also valid here. his superiors he is loyal and obedient, but not lax. In employing his subordinates he is just to all without prejudice. In social intercourse, having classified people, he accords to them what is proper (i). In his own village he is tolerant but not [to the 137 point of permitting] disorder. For these reasons, though he be in straits, he will be famous; and if successful, he will perform meritorious deeds. Jên and i together will cover the empire, inexhaustible. Their brilliance will penetrate Heaven and Earth, governing without instability the ten thousand transformations. Blood and ch`i are in harmony; will and thought are projected; virtuous conduct and i fill Heaven and Earth. [Such a person is] the acme of jên and knowledge. This is what is meant by the li to which the Former Kings attended. Under these circumstances, the old are at peace, the young are cherished, and friends are sincere—[all naturally] as an infant turns to its mother. I say, this results when jên is the pattern and i prevails, when teaching is sincere and love is deep, when li and music are universal.19 19 Cf. HSWC 4/10 at the end. This does not occur in Hsün-tz?. The Ode says,20 20 Shih 371 No. 209/3. Li and ceremonies are all according to rule; Every smile and word are as they should be. 121 1 This is from YTCC 5.17a-b, where it is told in a way less to the credit of Confucius. Yen-tz? made a visit of state to Lu.2 2 Chou remarks, "There is no further mention in the Ch`un-ch`iu of envoys sent on friendly visits to Lu by Ch`i, after Ch`ing Fêng in the 27th year of [Duke] Hsiang (B.C. 545). This is just an invention of the philosophers." In ascending the hall he hastened. In presenting the jade he knelt. Tz?-kung was surprised at this and aked Confucius, "Does Yen-tz? know ritual (li)? He came today on a visit of state to Lu, and when he ascended the hall, he hastened; when he presented the jade he knelt. Why did he do this?" Confucius said, "He had his reasons. Wait until he [comes to] see me, and I will ask him about it." Soon afterward Yen-tz? came in, and Confucius asked him about it. Yen-tz? replied, "Now the ritual (li) of ascending the hall is for the minister to take two steps when the prince steps once. Today the prince went quickly—did I dare not hasten? Today the prince received my present on a low level. Did I dare not kneel?" 138 Confucius approved, saying, "In the [canon of] ritual there are even more rites. With the little experience you Tz`?, have had in such matters,3 3 Shih. 371 No. 209/3. how can you be up to knowing ritual?" The Ode says,3 3 Shih. 371 No. 209/3. Li and ceremonies are all according to rule; Every smile and word are as they should be. Yen-tz? is an example of this. 13 In antiquity eight families were [associated with] one ching-t`ien [unit].1 1 For a description of this system cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique 109-17. A square li comprised one ching.2 2 : CHy and C write . A breadth of three hundred pu and a length of three hundred pu made one [square] li. Each field [contained] nine hundred mou.3 3 Cf. Ku-liang chuan 12.16a: "Of old 300 pu made up one li. It was called a chingt`ien [unit]. One ching-t`ien unit contained 900 mou. The public field occupied one [section]." A breadth of one pu and a length of one hundred pu4 4 CHy and D have — for . made one mou. A breadth of one hundred pu and a length of one hundred pu made one hundred mou. The eight families made a neighborhood. One family had a hundred mou, and each extra [adult] male5 5 Ho Hsiu's com. on Kung-yang chuan 16.15b: "Those in excess of five persons [per family] were called . By rule these people received field of 25 mou"; likewise Mencius 245 (3A/3.17). had twenty-five mou. Each family [tilled] ten mou of the public field. The remaining twenty mou [they used] together for their [summer] huts,6 6 Ho Hsiu, ibid., says "Dwellings in the fields were called ; those in the city were called ." each having two and one half mou. The eight families protected one another; they stood watch in turn over each other's movements; in sickness they shared the anxiety; in difficulty and distress they aided one another. Those who had, loaned to those who had not; they invited each other to food and drink. They planned marriages together; in fishing and hunting they divided 139 up the catch. They put into practice jên and kindness. It was in such ways as these that the people of that time were on good terms and fond of one another. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 375 No. 210/4. In the midst of the fields are the huts, And among the boundary divisions8 8 : Shih k`ao 17b says the Han shih reading was . (Chao 109.) are gourds. Today, however, it is not like that. The people are made responsible in groups of five. When there is a crime they spy upon one another; when there is to be punishment they inform on one another. As a result of the resentments and enmity called into being by such practices, the people injure one another to the detriment of their [natural] feelings of friendship. Violence is done to jên and kindness, while the reforming [capacity] of superiors is vitiated.9 9 I follow Chou and emend to . Those who are on good terms are few, while those who want to destroy others are legion; by these practices the path to jên is obliterated. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 522 No. 257/5. How can [such methods] bring a good state of things about? You [and your advisors] will sink together in ruin. 141 1 This is derived from Hsün-tz? 19.11a-b, where it is introduced by the line, "When superiors lay emphasis on i, then i triumphs over [motives of] profit. When they lay emphasis on profit, then profit triumphs over i." ? The Son of Heaven should not speak in terms of quantity; the feudal lords should not speak of profit and loss; the Great Officers should not speak of success and failure; the gentleman should not speak of exchanging goods or follow the way of a merchant.2 2 B, C write "nor be merchants in the streets." The phrase is lacking in Hsün-tz?. Just as a family that has a four-horse team does not depend3 3 CHy and D incorrectly write for . on the increase of fowls and pigs [for its livelihood], and a family that 140 has ice cut4 4 Chêng Hsüan's com. on Li chi 60.5b says, " `A family that has ice cut'—that is, one with [the rank of] minister or Great Officer, or above, that used ice in mourning or sacrifices." ? ? . does not concern itself with the breeding of cattle and sheep, so the prince of [a state of] a thousand chariots does not circulate merchandise.5 5 Cf. GL 379-80: "He who keeps horses and a carriage does not look after fowls and pigs. The family which keeps its stores of ice does not rear cattle or sheep. [So], the house which possesses a hundred chariots should not keep a minister to look out for imposts that he may lay them on the people." A prime minister will not repair a decrepit fence6 6 : Hsün-tz? lacks , and Yü Yüeh (Chu-tz? p`ing-i 15.14a-b) thinks it should be added there. He explains as a mistake for ; for he would read , as a phonetic borrowing. he says is "bamboo fence." Actually only the variant is so defined, but as Yü points out, this emendation makes sense with the next phrase, , both expressing the idea of not competing with the people for gain. ; a Great Officer will not do gardening, nor will the Minister of Storehouses7 7 Cf. Chou li 1.25b. covet8 8 For Li Hsien's quotation in his com. on Hou-Han shu 58B.3a writes "seize." (Chao 110.) the income of the markets. In this way the poor and wretched have something to rejoice in,9 9 : Li Hsien, ibid., has "encourage." (Chao.) and orphans and widows have something with which to employ their hands and feet.10 10 Cf. Analects 264 (13/3.6): "The people do not know how to move hand or foot." The Ode says,11 11 Shih 381 No. 212/3. There shall be handfuls left on the ground, And here ears untouched:— For the benefit of the widow. 151 1 Abridged from Hsün-tz? 8.9a-11a, which frequently has an easier reading. When a ruler wants to get a good archer who can hit a small mark from a distance, he offers noble rank and generous awards to attract him. On the one hand he is not partial to his own brothers, nor on the other hand does he keep in obscurity those from afar: he selects the one who can hit the mark. Is not this 141 the way to get him to come?2 2 Chou would add after as in Hsün-tz?. CHy has for . B, C have "Can such be called anything but the Great Way?" Not even a saint could improve on it.3 3 : lit., "alter it." After this sentence, Hsün-tz? has an identical passage about getting a good driver. Now if one wishes to govern the state and to control the people, he should harmonize and unify superiors and inferiors; if he would make the walls strong within and guard against difficulties [from] without, his government must consist in controlling men. If he is unable to control men, disorder is imminent, and sudden extinction awaits him. However, in seeking ministers and assistants [actually] there is none of this impartiality, but instead bias and favoritism are what are indulged in.4 4 I follow CHy, who adds after from Hsün-tz?, and with B, C reverses . Can such conduct be called anything but wrong? 5 Read with CHy, B, C for . Truly, no ruler of a state but wishes for stability, yet unexpectedly a crisis comes; none but wishes for continuity, yet unexpectedly he is lost. In ancient times there were states to the number of over a thousand; today they come to no more than a few tens.6 6 : likewise Huün-tz?. Wang Nien-sun would transpose to "10-odd," since in Hsün-tz?'s time there were no more states than that. Why is this? Not one but was lost through this [fault].7 7 I. e., favoritism. It is a fact that the intelligent ruler will [reward] his favorites with precious metals or rare jewels,8 8 . I follow CHy, who emends to the Hsün-tz? reading: . The probably was introduced by attraction of the cliché . but not with offices and public charges. And why? Because it would be no real advantage to them whom he favors. It is a benighted ruler who employs such persons when they are without ability, and it is a false minister who insists on filling his office when he lacks ability. When above the ruler is benighted and below the ministers are false, disaster is not far off; both are ways to injury. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler who is able to treat those whom he loves with affection. The benighted ruler always endangers those whom he loves. Now King Wên was not free from favoritism and partiality. 142 He took T`ai-kung, a boatman,9 9 : Hsün-tz? has . Yü Yüeh (Chu-tz? p`ing-i 13.11a) prefers as referring to the legend that T`ai-kung was in a boat fishing when King Wên found him. Later (CYTT 17.5b-6a) he argues for *tiôg, the name of a state, and for which *tiôg would be a phonetic borrowing. That does occur as a place name is substantiated by texts (cf. Kuo yü 16.3b, and Kao Yu's com. on LSCC 20.2a), but the point here is the lowly origin of the man, not his nationality. up out of the ranks and employed him. Why did he favor him? Because he was a relative?—No, he was of a different clan. Because he was an old friend?—No, he had never known him before. Because of the beauty of his appearance?—No, T`ai-kung was a toothless old man of seventy-two. So in using him King Wên wished to set up the Precious Way, to make clear the Precious Name, and with him to govern the empire to the benefit of the Middle Kingdom. All this he was unable to do alone. Therefore, raising up this man, he employed him; and in fact the Precious Way was set up, and the Precious Name was made clear. They governed the empire together, setting up dependencies to the number of seventy-two,10 10 I follow D and Hsün-tz?; the other texts have 71. of which fifty-three11 11 After Hsün-tz?. CHy, B, C, D have 52. were occupied by people of [King Wên's] own Chi clan alone. Of these descendants of Chou, not one who was not insane but became a brilliant feudal lord in the empire. Now it is this that is called being able to treat with affection those one loves. Truly, only the enlightened ruler is able to treat those he loves with affection, while the benighted ruler always endangers those he loves—this is illustrated above. The "Ta-ya" says,12 12 Shih 463 No. 244/8. He would leave his plans to his descendants, And secure comfort and support to his son.13 13 CHy would add "This refers to treating with affection those one loves." The "Hsiao-ya" says,14 14 Shih 391 No. 217/3. It is this quotation which accords with the sequence of paragraphs. Death and ruin may come any day; It is not long that you will see one another. This refers to endangering those one loves. 143 161 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 1.11b-12a (Dubs 39-40). Do not answer one whose questions are coarse; do not ask one whose answers are coarse.2 2 , "If the enquirer does not tell [what his question is], let the one who is to answer not ask [for it]" (?) This is forced, and I follow CHy, who has , , after Hsün-tz?. Yang Liang equates with , which he explains as "bad" . Hsün-tz? continues "Do not listen to one whose speech is coarse." Do not enter into discussion with one of argumentative disposition. It is necessary that a person come following the True Way, and only then should he be engaged [in conversation]. Unless his is the True Way, he should be avoided. Thus only with one who is courteous and respectful can one discuss the methods of the Way; only with one whose words are complaisant can one discuss the principles of the Way; only with one whose demeanor is docile can one discuss the Way in its entirety. Hence one who speaks with a person that should not be spoken with should be called blind, and one who does not speak with a person that might properly be spoken with should be called secretive.3 3 Cf. Analects 297 (15/7): "When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their man nor to their words." The superior man is not blind, but in speaking is careful about the kind [of man he addresses]. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 403 No. 222/3. There is no remissness in their demeanor;— Of such should the Son of Heaven approve. It says that first they must accord with my intention before I approve of them. 17 In the case of the son who conceals the misconduct of his parents,1 1 Cf. Analects 270 (13/18.2): "The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this." justice (i) is not being strictly observed. In the case of the prince who punishes the wicked, jên is not being adhered to.2 2 For read with B, C. I have rendered as "wicked." 144 But though [the one] go against jên and [the other] impair justice (i), still the right way of acting lies therein. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 404 No. 222/5. How mild,4 4 HSWC 8/25 quotes this line with for . (Chao 114.) The Mao shih reading "joyous" makes no sense in the present context. how happy, Is their coming here! 181 1 SY 3.14a-b copies this verbatim. Duke Huan of Ch`i asked Kuan Chung, "What is it the True King should respect?" [Kuan Chung] said, "He respects Heaven." Duke Huan looked up at the sky. Kuan Chung said, "What I called Heaven is not the blue void of the sky. The True King regards the people as Heaven. When the people are with him, there is peace. When they support him, he is strong. When they disapprove of him, he is in peril. When they rebel against him, he is lost. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 405 No. 223/4. People [who he thinks] are not good Hate him with one accord.3 3 Translated after the Han School commentary preserved in a Hou-Han shu commentary and quoted by Schên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 10.4a): "It says those thought to be evil by the king all hate him with one accord." When the people all with one accord hate their ruler, there has never been an instance when he was not lost." 191 1 Huai-nan tz? 10.13b is quite similar. The skillful charioteer does not neglect his horses; the skillful archer does not neglect his bow; the skillful superior does not neglect his inferiors. When with true love he works for their advantage, all within the four seas is in harmony. If in a single family advantage is made the end without love,2 2 The punctuation of this passage is debatable. I take as beginning a new sentence, since the conclusion emphasizes a contrast between and . Huai-nan tz? is clearer: . it may happen 145 that a son will kill his own father. How much the worse [the deeds to be expected] in the whole empire! The Ode says,3 3 Shih 405 No. 223/4. People [who he thinks] are not good Hate him with one accord. 201 1 D makes this part of the last section; cf. HSWC 4/23, note 7. Outside to grieve the members of one's clan, and inside to sadden the inhabitants of one's village—as the Ode says,2 2 Shih 407 No. 223/8. He becomes like the Man or the Mao— This is what makes me sad. A mean man's conduct! 211 1 This is a paraphrase of Hsün-tz? 20.12b-13a. Chia-yü 2.11b-12a follows Hsün-tz?. There are those incapable of serving their ruler who expect their own servants to act loyally. There are those incapable of serving their own fathers who expect their sons to be filial. There are those incapable of respect toward their elder brothers who expect their younger brothers to obey their commands. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 405 No. 223/4. He gets a place, and shows no humility Until he is involved in ruin. It says that one can be known to others without being capable of knowing himself. 221 1 From Hsün-tz? 3.12b-17b (Dubs 77-79 leaves out half of this passage), but much condensed and with changes in the names mentioned. Now the ignorance of the present2 2 I. e., the 3rd century B.C., Hsün-tz?'s own time. age is due to the dressing 146 up of heretical discourses and the making of obscene speeches that throw the empire into disorder and lead the ignorant masses astray, causing them in their confusion not to know wherein lie truth or falsehood, order or anarchy. The ones responsible are those like Fan Sui, Wei Mou, T`ien Wên, Chuang Chou, Shên Tao, T`ien P`ien, Mo Ti, Sung Chien, Têng Hsi, and Hui Shih.3 3 Hsün-tz? lists twelve: T`o Hsiao Wei Mou, Ch`ên Chung , Shih Ch`iu , Mo Ti, Sung Chien, Shên Tao, T`ien P`ien, Hui Shih, Têng Hsi, Tz?-ss? , Mêng K`o . On the omission of these last two names Chou says, "This is the penetrating understanding of a Great Confucian." . All these ten philosophers cleave to the false and spread [their pernicious teachings]. Their learning is varied and extensive,4 4 ? is peculiar, but enough of this occurs in Hsün-tz? to fix the punctuation: ? . . . but they do not follow the techings of high antiquity, nor do they model temselves on the Former Kings. They attribute to the ancient past the doctrines which they make up, and devote themslves to being clever.5 5 : I follow B, C, , likewise CHy, with for . Though they have nothing that coincides with the True Way, still people follow them.6 6 : "On a road without traffic, two persons stick together." CHy, B, C have for , and so in my translation. Chou defends on the ground that in Hsün-tz? the twelve philosophers are discussed in pairs. However the expression does not once occur there. It makes no sense here, and HSWC has not followed Hsün-tz?'s arrangement. So we say that all the fine talk of these ten philosophers is not enough to harmonize with the Great Way, or to improve customs, or to administer a government.7 7 CHy, B, C, D and Hsün-tz? reverse . Cf. Shih 444 No. 238/5. But what they advocate is always plausible, and what they say is always reasonable—sufficiently so to mislead the ignorant masses, and to throw into confusion the simple and the rustic: it is this the ten philosophers are guilty of. If [a ruler] will take charge of plans for action,8 8 Yang Liang defines as . unify the general and the specific,9 9 : Yang Liang says, " means rules. means to compare. Treating on a large scale is called ; when distinctions are made it is called ." make words correspond to conduct, and assemble the heroes of the empire, telling them of the Great Way and teaching them perfect obedience, then on the mat in the interior10 10 : CHy, D have for . B, C have . Chou has followed Hsün-tz?. Yang Liang says, "The southwest corner is called ; the southeast corner It means he does not go outside his dwelling." 147 of his palace will be collected in quantity the culture of the Saintly Kings,11 11 : Hsün-tz? has , and I take as a verb parallel to in the next sentence: . and there will arise12 12 For B, C have . in abundance the usages of a peaceful world. The fine talkers will be unable to enter, the ten philosophers will be unable to come near. If he has not the slightest holding of land,13 13 : lit., "without [so much as] an awl's point of land." This is a common cliché which occurs also in HSWC 5/5, 5/14, and Hsün-tz? 4.16b. and yet even the nobility is unable to contest with him for fame—this is a case of a saint who does not attain his goal. It was thus with Chung-ni. [If he unites the empire, completes all things, rears and nourishes the people, and uniformly profits the empire, then of those with whom he establishes contact none but will follow him. If the clever talkers at once cease and the ten philosophers are reformed, then it is a Saint that has achieved power.]14 14 ? . CHy adds this form Hsün-tz? changing to and to to agree with the rest of the HSWC passage. Chou also remarks that the text is defective. Wang Nien-sun says means . Of Yang Liang quotes, "Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever the strength of man penetrates." (DM 429, 31/4). It was thus with Shun and Yü. With what should the man endowed with jên occupy himself? On the one hand he makes the government of Shun and Yü his pattern; on the other hand he models himself after the i of Chung-ni, and thereby strives to put an end to the theories of the ten philosophers. Such a course will bring to completion the task of the man endowed with jên. In the empire harmful elements will be eliminated, while the traces of the sages will become clear. The Ode says,15 15 Shih 406 No. 223/7. The snow may have fallen abundantly,16 16 . CHy emends to the Shih k`ao reading: . Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 10.7a) thinks present texts of HSWC are here corrupted by Mao shih. But when the sun comes out it dissolves.17 17 . For B, C, D have as in Mao shih. Ch`ên (ibid.) quotes the gloss from Ching-i shih-wên to show that should be , the binom being there defined as . 148 231 1 Modified from Hsün-tz? 2.4b-5b, which begins, "The superior man is the opposite of the mean man." . When greathearted, the superior man reveres Heaven, and follows the True Way; when timid, he respects i, and practices moderation; when intelligent, he is possessed of clear understanding and thinks logically; when ignorant, he is upright and law-abiding; when happy, he is friendly and controlled; when sad, he is quiet and withdraws;2 2 Cf. Yi King 409 (1 ), "Rejoicing, he carries his principles into action; sorrowing, he keeps with them in retirement." when successful, he is peaceful and contained; when in straits, he is frugal3 3 : Chou has emended from Hsün-tz?; all other texts have . and careful. When greathearted, the mean man is rude and violent; when timid, he is lecherous and perverted; when intelligent, he is a thief and a cheat;4 4 : B, C write "devious." Wang Yin-chih defines as . when stupid, he is a killer and a rebel; when happy, he is frivolous and gay; when sad, he is crushed and subdued;5 5 For B, C, D have , likewise Hsün-tz?. (Chao 116.) when successful, he is arrogant and partial; when in straits, he is despondent and harassed. The joints of his limbs are disposed like those of animals. In violence of speech he is no different from the barbarians; outside he grieves the members of his own clan, and inside he worries the inhabitants of his village. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 407 No. 223/8. He is like the Man or the Mao— This is what makes me sad. A mean man's conduct!7 7 . Chou adds this line from HSWC 4/20; likewise Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 10.8b) Chou would expunge the rest of ¶20. 24 Traditionally, the love that comes from the feelings is called jên. Love tempered by principles and fitness is called i. The 149 humility which conveys love is called li. Proper carriage of the body is called jung.1 1 For read ; cf. Li Ki 2.636 (40/1): . The excellence of correct bearing is such that itself it is an adequate pattern [for conduct]. . . .2 2 . The text is corrupt, and there would seem to be words missing after this sentence. I follow CHy, B, C: , emending to as above. Hence, since the words of such a man are worthy of serving as a guide for the people, the people will follow these words, and since such conduct is worthy of serving as a rule for the people, the people will emulate this conduct. Record it in the books and transmit it in the records; tell it to ten thousand generations of sons and grandsons, that they may follow in this path without neglecting it. From keeping to it comes order; from abandoning it, anarchy; from following it, life; from abandoning it, death. Now those whose joints are disposed like those of animals, who are no different from the barbarians in the violence of their speech,3 3 Cf. HSWC 4/23. who are confused and without principles, are the ones who are held guilty by enlightened kings and saintly rulers. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 407 No. 223/8. He is like the Man or the Mao— This is what makes me sad. 251 1 CKT 5.38b-40a is the same as HSWC, and is translated by J. J. L. Duyvendak, "The Chronology of Hsün tz?," TP 26 (1929) .86-90. HFT 4.12b-13a (Liao 131-3) contains the part beginning "The proverb says," but omits the fu, which is in Hsün-tz? 18.18a-19a. On this passage cf. Wang Chung (Shu-hsüeh pu-i 7b), and Wang Hsiench`ien's refutation (Hsün-tz? k`ao-chêng 47b.-48b). (Chao 117.) Among his itinerant advisors there was one who persuaded Prince Ch`un-shên saying, "T`ang with seventy li and King Wên with a hundred li both brought the empire together and unified [all] within the seas. Now Hsün-tz?2 2 ; cf. HSWC 3/36, note 2. is the world's sage. I venture to suggest that in giving him control of a hundred li Your Highness will be inconveniencing yourself. What are you going to do about it?" 150 Prince Ch`un-shên approved of his argument and sent to dismiss Hsün-tz?, who3 3 CHy repeats ; Chou agrees. left and went to Chao. Chao made him prime minister. An itinerant advisor again persuaded Prince Ch`unshên saying, "Of old I-yin left Hsia and went to Yin. Yin gained the imperial sway and Hsia perished. Kuan Chung left Lu and entered Ch`i. Lu declined and Ch`i waxed strong. Judged in the light of this, wherever there is a sage, invariably the ruler is well off, and invariably the country is at peace. Now Hsün tz? is the world's sage. What was the idea of sending him away?" Prince Ch`un-shên in turn approved of this argument and sent to invite Hsün-tz? [to come back]. Hsün-tz? thereupon wrote a letter declining the offer:4 4 CHy has for . Both he and Chou have followed CKT. Other editions have "with feigned pleasure." "The proverb says, `The leper pities the king.' This is a disrespectful statement, but it is necessary to look into it. This is in reference to rulers who are robbed or assassinated or who suffer death and ruin.5 5 B, C have for . CHy, following HFT, omits and writes for . CKT is the same, and so in my translation. Now with a ruler who, being young and on his own, has no method for recognizing treachery, powerful ministers will make decisions independently of him and plan for their own interests to prevent punishment from reaching themselves. Hence they will depose a worthy, adult ruler to set up a youth and weakling; they will degrade the rightful heir to set up an illegitimate one.6 6 D has for . I follow CHy (after CKT): . "Thus the record of a Ch`un-ch`iu tells7 7 . Cf. Tso chuan 581 (Chao 1), where the story is told in more detail but with some identity in phrasing. "Ch`un-ch`iu," if it refers to a specific work, must mean the annals of Chêng or Ch`u, as the Ch`un-ch`iu of Lu has no mention of the incident. how the Prince Wei of Ch`u paid a visit of state in Chêng. Before he had crossed the border [on his way home] he heard that the king was ill, and returning [on the pretext of] asking about his illness, assassinated the king by strangling him with his cap tassel, and in the course of events put himself on the throne. 151 "The wife of Ts`ui Chu of Ch`i was beautiful, and Duke Chuang had an affair with her.8 8 Cf. Tso chuan 514 (Hsiang 25) for details. [Ts`ui Chu led his partisans to attack Duke Chuang. The duke begged to divide the state with him,]9 9 ? . CHy adds this from CKT. but Ts`ui Chu would not consent. He wished to commit suicide in his ancestral temple, [but Ts`ui Chu again would not consent.]10 10 : also added by CHy, after in HFT. Then when Duke Chuang fled, climbing up over the outside wall, they shot him in the thigh. Having killed him, they put his younger brother, [known as] Duke Ching, on the throne. "Recent times have seen Li Tui, when he administered Chao, starving the Father of the Ruler11 11 : title taken by King Wu-ling of Chao on his abdication (B.C. 299) in favor of his son Ho , who became King Hui-wên. in [the palace] Sha-ch`iu, where he died after a hundred days,12 12 "killed him after 100 days," but cf. Mém. hist. 5.94-5. and Nao Ch`ih, who, when he administered Ch`i, hung King Min up [from the rafters of] the ancestral temple13 13 CHy adds from CKT and HFT. after pulling out his tendons, so that he died14 14 . CKT and HFT have . over night.15 15 in the meaning of , as in CKT 13.1a (translated in Mém. hist. 5.273-4, note 2). q.v. for the background of this deed. "Now although a leper [suffers from] ulcers, swelling, and scabs, it is not so bad on the one hand as being strangled or shot in the thigh, as in far-off times, nor on the other hand as having the tendons drawn or being starved to death, as in recent times. Now a ruler who is robbed or assassinated, or who suffers death and ruin, is grieved and oppressed in mind and pained in body— certainly his lot is worse than the leper's. Viewed in this light, it is appropriate that even a leper should pity a king." Whereupon [Hsün-tz?] wrote a fu that reads: Red jade16 16 : Hsün-tz? has , explained by Hao I-hsing as , by Yang Liang as . and green, jasper and pearl, he does not know enough to use them for girdle pendants.

Oh Heaven, Where find his equal? The Ode says,22 22 Shih 408 No. 224/2. Our ruler is very changeable;23 23 For CHy, D have , which seems to have been the Han shih reading. Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo-k`ao 10.9b-10b) regards them as variants (with ) of the same word. is generally accepted as here referring to the ruler. Do not get yourself into trouble with him. 26 The [flesh] of the strange animals of the Nan-miao is like [that of] dogs or sheep,1 1 D has for . CHy, B, C have for . The passage has perhaps been contaminated from Analects 255 (12/8.3): . "Hide from which the hair has been removed" makes no sense here. From the context it seems likely that the flesh of some animal is referred to that is eaten with impunity by the natives who are used to it, but to an outsider is fatal. My translation is only a conjecture. but give it to a man and it is like a fatal drug. It is thus because2 2 For read with CHy, B, C. custom changes the disposition, and habit alters the nature. Now a madman gnaws at himself, oblivious that his is not the flesh of an animal raised for food. He eats dirt, unaware that it is not millet or rice. None the less, a madman of Ch`u speaks the Ch`u language, while a madman from Ch`i speaks the Ch`i language. It is thus from habit. Now the effect of habit on a man is such that, even if slight, it appears, while if it be carried on farther, it is fixed in him. It spreads through his very bones and sinews; it is more adhesive than glue or lacquer. 15311 This is why the superior man pays careful attention to what he studies. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 415 No. 228/3. I have seen the superior man— His virtuous fame is glued to him.4 4 I have taken as in the text above. Variant translations occur in Legge and Karlgren, Book of Odes 16.255. 271 1 This is modified slightly from Mencius 414 (6A/11). I follow Legge's translation with a few changes. Mencius said, "Jên is man's mind, and i is man's path. [How lamentable]2 2 HSWC lacks . it is to neglect the path and not pursue it, to lose this mind and not to seek it again!3 3 For Mencius has . When men's fowls and dogs are lost, they know enough to seek for them again, but they lose their mind, and do not know enough to seek for it.4 4 The following lines, from "Is it" "Truly" are lacking in Mencius. Is it that their minds are not worth so much as fowls and dogs?5 5 . I follow CHy, B, C and omit . This is indeed ignorance of relative values. Alas, their end inevitably will be destruction. Truly the great end of learning is nothing else but to seek for the lost mind." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 415 No. 228/4. In the core of my heart I keep it, And never will forget it. 281 1 Cf. Hsün-tz? 1.21b (Dubs 51) for the first three sentences. The whole passage is corrupt. Though I have been able to make some sort of sense out of it by following the easier readings, I suspect that the argument originally may have been quite different. Though the road be near, there will be no arriving without walking; though the task be small, unless it be undertaken it will not be completed. If days spent in idleness be many, there will 154 be no great superiority over others.2 2 . B, C have for . D has for . CHy has , and for , emending on the basis of Hsün-tz?: .

Sincerely loving the good is essential to understanding reverence.1 1 I follow CHy, B, C to read for before and . Only sincerity can move the spirits and penetrate into the hearts of the people. When one understands the basis for punishments and reverence, he inspires awe without [a show of] anger, and confidence without speech:2 2 Cf. DM 432 (33/3). he is a ruler who has the virtue of sincerity. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 417 No. 229/5. The drums and bells are beaten in the palace, And their sound is heard without. 30 Confucius had received a visitor.1 1 KTCY A.4a has ? "Confucius went to Wei, and Wei had him receive guests." (Chao 120.) This paragraph is omitted by D. After the guest's departure Yen Yüan said, "Was your visitor [a man possessed of] jên?" 155 Confucius said, "His heart was unyielding (?), his mouth . . .

Yen Yüan with a start of surprise changed color and said, "Though a foot length5 5 : the foot measure based on the length of 100 millet seeds placed lengthwise. of good jade be covered with ten fathoms of earth, its brilliance cannot be concealed, and though a fine pearl an inch long be under a hundred fathoms of water, its lustre6 6 Lei-chü 83.6b, Po-t`ieh 7.45a, Ch`u-hsüeh chi 27.6a have for ; TPYL 802.8a has .

(Chao.) 31 The deceitful cannot last long; The empty cannot be preserved.1 1 Note the rhyme: . Rotten wood cannot be carved,2 2 Cf. Analects 176 (5/9.1).

It says that what there is inside must show on the outside. 156 321 1 This is abridged from Hsün-tz? 20.14a-b. TTLC 1.5b is closer to Hsün-tz?, while Chia-yü 1.23a-b diverges considerably from all the others. He whom we call a commoner2 2 Hsün-tz?, TTLC, and Chia-yü introduce this with "Duke Ai said, `I venture to ask what are the characteristics of one who is called a commoner?' " . The reply is attributed to Confucius. is one whose mouth is incapable of speaking good words, and whose mind is incapable of knowing the methods of the Former Kings. He moves without knowing what to attend to; he takes a stand without knowing wherein to establish himself. Every day he chooses things without knowing what to value. He does not know enough to select sages and fine gentlemen to whom he might entrust himself. He lets himself be carried along by the world, not knowing whither to return. He is controlled by the five emotions;3 3 B, C have for . Hsün-tz? and TTLC have for , and Chou prefers that reading. The "five viscera"—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, require the reading : "His five viscera are not controlled." is variously defined by Yang Liang as the five apertures: ear, eye, nose, mouth, and heart, or the five emotions: joy, anger, grief, pleasure, and resentment. Hao I-hsing and Wang Nien-sun prefer the latter, and so in the translation. his mind is impaired by following them, but he never turns back. Thus his actions endanger his body, and his repose brings shame to his reputation. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 418 No. 229/7. That man is bad, Ever varying in his conduct. 157 331 1 Versions of this story occur in LSCC 18.6b and SY 15.15b-16a. As the latter resolves some of the ambiguities of HSWC, I append a translation: "Master Wang Man of Ch`i had an interview with the Duke of Chou. The Duke of Chou came out to see him and said, `You, sir, have had the trouble of coming a long way. What is it you have to teach me?' Master Wang Man said, "One speaks of essentials inside, and of external outside. Now shall I speak of essentials or of externals?' The Duke of Chou led him inside. Master Wang Man (delete ) respectfully followed him and spread out his mat, but the Duke of Chou did not lead him to a seat. Master Wang Man said, `One speaks of important affairs sitting, and of minor affairs standing. Now shall I speak of important affairs or of minor ones?' The Duke of Chou led him to a seat. When Master Wang Man had sat down, the Duke of Chou said, "What is it, sir, you have to teach me?' Master Wang Man said, `I have heard that the saint knows without being told, and that one who is not a saint does not know even with telling. Now do you want me to speak or not?' The Duke of Chou lowered his head for some time in thought without answering. Master Wang Man took brush and tablet and wrote, `The state is in danger, take it to heart.' The Duke of Chou looked up. Seeing what was written he said, `Yes, yes. I respectfully attend your command.' Next day he punished [the princes of] Kuan and Ts`ai." There was a visitor2 2 Shêng Shu according to LSCC; SY has . who had an interview with the Duke of Chou. Meeting him at the door, the Duke of Chou said, "How are you going to instruct me?" The man said, "Outside I would speak of externals; inside, of essentials. Shall I come in or not?" The Duke of Chou said, "Please come in." The guest said, "Standing, I would speak of i; sitting, of jên. Shall I sit or not?" The Duke of Chou said, "Please take a seat." The guest said, "Speaking distinctly will result in trouble; speaking softly, in not being heard.3 3 LSCC has . "The court is small and people are many. If I speak softly you will not hear; if I speak distinctly people will know what I say." The context fixes the meanings of and . For cf. Shih 331 No. 195/2: , where Han Ying understood . (Legge's note.) Shall I speak or not?" The Duke of Chou said, "Yes, yes. I understand." And next 158 day he mobilized troops and punished [the princes of] Kuan and Ts`ai. Truly the visitor was good at giving counsel without speech, and the Duke of Chou was good at listening to counsel without speech. A person like the Duke of Chou may be called capable of listening to subtle discourse. Truly what the superior man tells others is subtle, and the aid he offers people in difficulty is indirect.

      <field name="fulltext">159 CHAPTER V 1 Tz?-hsia asked, "Why is the kuan-chü made to begin the "Kuo-fêng" [section of the Odes]?" Confucius said, "The kuan-chü is perfection.1 1 Confucius is made to express himself more cautiously in Analects 161 (3/20): "The kuan-chü is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive." Now in its relation to man,2 2 It is necessary to understand after . the kuan-chü above is like Heaven; below it is like Earth. Mysterious and dark is the virtue it hides; abundant and rich the Way it puts into practice. Its transformations are like those of the supernatural dragon.3 3 I follow CHy, B, C and read for . It is complete in its brilliancy and order. Oh great is the Way of the kuan-chü! It is that which connects all things and on which the life of human beings is dependent.4 4 Out of context this sentence would mean "That which connects all things and on which human life is dependent is fate." "The Ho and the Lo [Rivers] gave forth the writing and the diagram;5 5 Cf. Yi King 374 (hsi-tz`u), "The Ho gave forth the map and the Lo the writing, of [both of] which the sages took advantage." the lin and the phoenix frequented6 6 lit., "soared." Similar constructions occur in Analects 232 (10/8.5): , and Yi King 349 (hsi-tz`?) . the suburbs:7 7 These are omens of a Golden Age; cf. Analects 219 (9/8), "The Master said, `The Fêng bird does not come; the river sends forth no map;—it is all over with me!' " by what means could this be brought about except by following the Way8 8 I follow CHy, B, C and read for . of the kuan-chü, and by taking the subject of the kuan-chü for a model?9 9 . "Except by following the way of the kuan-chü, how is the subject of the kuan-chü going to achieve its end?" The text is corrupt. My translation is arrived at by taking the negative with , but it can hardly be correct. Now the writings of the Six Classics10 10 I. e., Shih, Shu, Li, Yüeh, I, Ch`un-ch`iu. all are devoted to exhaustive discussion, but they derive [their matter] from the kuan-chü. The subject of the kuan-chü is great! Vast 160 and soaring, `from the east to the west, from the south to the north, there is not a thought but does it homage.'11 11 Shih 463 No. 244/6. May you exert yourself [to emulate it], and cherish it in thought.12 12 Cf. Shih 3 No. 1/2: "Waking and sleeping he thought of her." Or perhaps from the line just quoted, , with the meaning, "do it homage in thought." Neither human beings between Heaven and Earth nor the origin of the Kingly Way are outside its compass." Tz?-hsia sighed deeply and said, "Great indeed is the kuan-chü; it is the [very] foundation of Heaven and Earth." The Ode says,13 13 Shih 4 No. 1/3. With bells and drums14 14 Read with HSWC 1/16; see note 13. let us show our delight in it. 2 Confucius had the heart of a saint. He moved about in the realm of the Way and of Virtue; he wandered in the province of the formless. He regarded human emotions in the light of eternal principles.1 1 : the principles of Heaven. He understood beginning and end; he comprehended success and failure. Truly he made jên and i flourish and kept down opportunism and materialism; by so doing he maintained and nourished his [sage-heart]. In his time the House of Chou was failing and the Kingly Way had been broken off. The feudal lords governed by force, the strong robbed the weak, the rich oppressed the poor, the people had no peace, and no one made rules for them. Li and i being destroyed, human relationships were not regulated. Whereupon Confucius "From the west to the east, from the south to the north,2 2 Shih 463 No. 244/6. crawled on his knees to help them."3 3 Shih 57 No. 35/4. 161 31 1 Taken from Hsün-tz? 5.1a-2a (Dubs 121-2), but with some omissions and variation in the sequence of sentences; see note 10. Under the government of a True King, promotion of the sage and the able does not wait on seniority, and dismissal of unworthy persons takes place without a moment's delay. Punishment of a chief criminal does not wait on instruction,2 2 Yang Liang here quotes Analects 353 (20/2.3), "To put the people to death without having instructed them;—this is called cruelty," and observes that chief criminals constitute an exception. nor does the reform of the ordinary man wait on his being perfect.3 3 in the sense of . Before distinctions are established, there are natural gradations.4 4 : the tablet of the father was placed on the left and that of the son on the right of the ancestral temple, so that successive generations faced one another; cf. Li Ki 1.287-8 (3/3.4) and diagram. Yang Liang says, "Sages occupy a higher position; unworthy persons occupy a lower position." Though a person be the descendant of a duke, minister, or great officer, if his conduct breaks the rules of li and i,5 5 CHy, B, C have . Hsün-tz? has . he is put back to the rank of a commoner.

If they become tractable, they are supported; if not, they are banished.]10 10 The text between brackets has suffered considerable disarrangement, but is easily restored on the basis of Hsün-tz?. The following reconstruction is due to Chou and CHy: ? ? ? . [As for those afflicted with one of the five defects,]11 11 Chou would add from Hsün-tz?. CHy would emend the preceding to , in spite of having already said that the phrase has been displaced. I follow Chou. Yang Liang enumerates the five: dumb , deaf , lame , mutilated , stunted . 162 the ruler receives and employs them; he gives them office and feeds and clothes them. Covering all12 12 I follow CHy and emend to from Hsün-tz?. he neglects none. But if a gifted person transgresses [deliberately] against the proper season, he is put to death without reprieve,13 13 CHy omits with Hsün-tz?. Cf. Shu ching 166 (3/4.2.4): . and it is said that Heaven has punished14 14 CHy follows Hsün-tz? and writes for . him. Such is the government of a True King. The Ode says,15 15 Shih 84 No. 52/1. If a man has no dignity of demeanor, What should he do but die? 41 1 From Hsün-tz? 8.4a-5b, where a different couplet from the Shih is quoted at the end. The prince is the source of the people. If the source is pure the stream will be pure, but if the source is muddy the stream will be muddy. Hence the ruler who is unable to love his people and who yet looks for the people to cherish and love himself, [is expecting] the impossible. If, when the people neither cherish nor love him, he expects them to work for him and to die for him, [he is expecting] the impossible. If, when the people will not work for him and will not die for him, he expects his army to be strong and his walls to be stout, [he is expecting] the impossible. If, when his army is not strong and his walls are not stout, he hopes to avoid danger and destruction, [he is hoping for] the impossible. Now when all the circumstances of danger and destruction are concentrated together here, is it not hard to conceive of looking for peace and happiness? This is to be born in vain. Alas, he who is born in vain perishes before long. Hence if a ruler wishes strength and solidarity, peace and happiness, he had best turn to himself. If he wishes to gain the submission of his subordinates and unite the people, he had best extend2 2 : CHy has . likewise Hsün-tz?. to them [good] government. If he wishes to improve his government and elevate customs, he had best seek out the right man. 163 That "right man" is one who, born in the present age, fixes his mind on the Way3 3 Read for with Hsün-tz?. (Chou.) of ancient times. None of the nobles of the empire may like a thing, but this one alone likes it; none of the people may act, but this one alone will act; or those who will act are exhausted, and this one alone will act without a moment's delay or error. It is he alone who understands how the former kings succeeded and how they failed;4 4 . Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.7b) calls attention to the contrast between and , where would be the expected word: cf. HSWC 9/12, note 5. [it is he] who recognizes peace and danger, security and its opposite in a state as easily as he distinguishes black and white: such is the right man. If a ruler wishes strength and solidarity, peace and happiness, he had best act in conjunction with the right man. If he uses him more, the empire will be unified and the feudal lords will become his servants; if he uses him less, his prestige [still] will overawe neighboring states, while none will be able to conquor him. Yin's use of I-yin, Chou's meeting with [and employing] T`ai-kung can be called examples of using [the right man] more. Ch`i's use of Kuan Chung and Ch`u's use of Sun-shu Ao can be called examples of using [the right man] less. Using him more [gives results] as in the first cases, and using him less as in the last.5 5 Omit with CHy, B, C. Truly it is said [of a ruler who employs the right man], that consistently using him he becomes a true king, partly [using him], he becomes a hegemon, while without a single such person he will lose his kingdom.6 6 . This may be corrupt. Hsün-tz? has , but of a different topic. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 321 No. 193/2. All through the kingdom there is no [proper] government, Because the good are not employed. There have never been any who, not employing good ministers, were not lost. 164 51 1 Modified from Hsün-tz? 4.16a-19b (Dubs 108-113). Tsao-fu was the best charioteer in the world, but without chariot and horses he would have had no way to show his ability. Yi was the best archer in the world, but without bow and arrow he would have had no way to show his skill. The Great Confucian is one who puts the empire into harmony, but without [at least] a hundred li of territory he will have no way to show his merits. Now a person with a strong chariot and select horses who is unable to go a thousand li is no Tsao-fu; one with adjusted bow and straight arrows who is unable to shoot far and hit a small mark is no Yi; and one with a hundred li of land who is unable to put the empire into harmony and control the four barbarians is no Great Confucian. The Great Confucian may live in retirement in a miserable hut in a back alley, without the slightest holding of land, but still the nobles will be unable to contest his fame.2 2 Cf. HSWC 4/22. When he has a hundred li of territory, a state of a thousand li will be unable to contest his superiority. He castigates aggressive states, unites the empire, and none can overthrow him: such is the merit of the Great Confucian. His speech is appropriate, and his conduct is in accord with li. He has no reason to regret what he does. His conduct in dangerous situations3 3 For read as in Hsün-tz?. (Chou.) and his adaptations to changed circumstances are appropriate in the smallest detail. He moves with the times and changes with the world. Through the multiplicity of beginnings and the infinity of changes4 4 : lit., "a thousand beginnings and ten thousand changes." his Way is single: such is the Great Confucian. In this way there are ordinary people, ordinary Confucians, refined Confucians, and Great Confucians. His ear does not listen to learning, in conduct he lacks correctness and i; he is so confused that he takes wealth and gain to be the most important things: such is the ordinary man. 165 He wears large [-sleeved] gowns5 5 Cf. Li Ki 2.600: "Confucius said, `As a youth, when I lived in Lu, I wore a gown with large sleeves.' " and broad sashes; he roughly models himself on the former kings, but is inadequate in a time of confusion.6 6 . The words and are from Yang Liang's quotation of HSWC. B, C, D have , as in Hsün-tz?: "It is enough to throw into confusion the practices of the time." His method is faulty and his studies eclectic; although his attire and conduct7 7 Delete with CHy after Hsün-tz?. have become identical with the vulgar usage of the time, he does not know that they are wrong. In light conversation or serious discussion, since he differs not at all from Lao[-tz?] and Mo[-tz?], he does not know how to make distinctions: such is the ordinary Confucian. He patterns himself after the former kings and unifies institutions; as concerns speech and conduct, he is in possession of the Great Method, but his understanding does not suffice to help him where rules and instructions do not reach and where his experience does not extend. When he knows a thing, he holds that he knows it, and when he does not know a thing he admits that he does not know it.8 8 Analects 151 (2/17). Within, he does not cheat himself; outside, he does not cheat others. For this reason he esteems the sages and honors the law, not daring to be disrespectful concerning them: such is the refined Confucian. He models himself on the former kings and relies upon li and i. From the restricted he grasps the extended, and from the single he puts into action the multiple. In matters of jên and i, even among birds and beasts, he makes distinctions as clearly as between black and white. When outlandish creatures or strange transformations9 9 Reverse as in Hsün-tz? and in Yang Liang's quotation. (Chou, CHy.) which he has never seen or heard of suddenly come to light somewhere, without depending on any outside help, he produces a comprehensive category that takes care of them, and pulls out10 10 Chou adds , and would punctuate after . I follow B, C, D. a law which measures them as exactly as [the two parts of] a tally fit [together]: such is the Great Confucian. Hence if a ruler uses common men, it will result in the loss of 166 his state [though it be one] of ten thousand chariots. If he uses an ordinary Confucian, his state of ten thousand chariots will be preserved. If he uses a refined Confucian, his state, [though it consist of only] a thousand li [of territory], will be at peace. If he uses a Great Confucian, with a territory of [no more than] one hundred li, in three years at the longest,11 11 For this punctuation cf. Yü Yüeh and Wang Hsien-ch`ien. the feudal lords of the empire will be his subjects. Should he use him in a state of ten thousand chariots, he would be established as soon as he began to act; in one day he would be famous.12 12 For B, C have "in the space of one morning." D has , and CHy has . Chou and CHy have emended from Hsün-tz?, accepting Yang Liang's gloss on as "hegemon." Wang Nien-sun points out the resulting inconsistancy in Hsün-tz?'s argument, and would read with D. He paraphrases, "In one morning his name is manifest in the empire" . Chao (116) agrees. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 427 No. 235/1. Although Chou was an old country, The [favoring] appointment lighted on it recently. This can be called fame,14 14 For read as in D; see note 12. CHy, B, C are probably right in omitting this phrase. and King Wên can certainly be called a Great Confucian. 61 1 Modified from Chuang-tz? 4.7a-b. Huai-nan tz? 12.7a-b follows Chuang-tz?. King Ch`êng of Ch`u2 2 For both Chuang-tz? and Huai-nan tz? have . was reading in the hall, and at work below was Lun-pien,3 3 i.e., "wheelwright." B, C have for . who asked, "What is the book Your Highness is reading?" King Ch`êng said, "It is a book of the Former Sages." Lun-pien said, "It is certainly only the dregs of the Former Sages, and not their essence." King Ch`êng said, "What grounds have you for saying that?" Lun-pien said, "Let us put it in terms of the wheels I make. With the compass I make them round, and with a square I make them straight. These [techniques] I can pass on to my sons and 167 grandsons. But when it comes to bringing three pieces of wood together, there is a response in the heart and a movement in the body which there is no way to transmit. Hence what has been transmitted is certainly nothing but the dregs. Thus it is possible to examine4 4 For CHy and D have "changed." the methods of T`ang and Yü,5 5 Yao and Shun. but there is no attaining to their illumination of men's hearts. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 431 No. 235/7. The doings of High Heaven Have neither sound nor smell. Who can attain to this?" 71 1 This occurs in Shih chi 47.15b-16a (Mém. hist. 5.349-51) in a slightly modified form. Chia-yü 8.6a-b is closer to Shih-chi, but with some phrases in common with HSWC. Confucius was studying the lute under the music master Hsiang-tz?,2 2 . Ch`u-hsüeh chi 16.3b has (CHy), and Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 34.5a has . (Chao 127.) Analects 338 (18/9.5) mentions a Hsiang who was "master of the musical stone" (Chou), but Liang Yü-shêng (quoted by Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung, I-shuo k`ao 11.7b) denies that they are the same person. However Chia-yü says . but made no progress. Master Hsiang-tz? said, "It is within your power, sir, to make progress." Confucius said, "I have already grasped the melody, but as yet I have not got the structure [of this music]." After a while [Hsiang-tz?] said, "It is within your power, sir, to make [more] progress." [Confucius] said, "I have already grasped the structure, but as yet I do not have its meaning." After a while [Hsiang-tz?] again said, "It is within your power, sir, to make [more] progress," and [Confucius] said, ["I have already got its meaning, but I have not yet got the man." After a while (Hsiang-tz?) again said, "It is within your power, sir, to make (more) progress," and (Confucius) said,]3 3 ? . CHy adds this from Ch`u-hsüeh chi; Po-t`ieh 18.96a has . (Chao 128.) 168 "I have already got the man [who composed the piece], but I still have not managed to place him." For a while he gazed off into the distance, lost in deep thought. Then he said,4 4 . Ch`u-hsüeh chi has after . (CHy.) Neither Chia-yü nor Shih chi make this part of Confucius' speech, and I suspect that has been displaced by attraction of the phrase which occurs repeatedly above. "Pensive and majestic is he who must have composed this music. Darkly black,5 5 . D has . B, C have "in silent thought." Chao thinks this is an arbitrary emendation of . Cf. Chavannes' note 2, p. 350. and grandly tall6 6 . B, C have "in sorrowful dejection." Chia-yü has for , and Chou says they are equivalent. Cf. Shih 161 No. 106: . he rules the empire and attracts to his court the feudal lords: it can be no other than King Wên." Master Hsiang-tz? withdrew from the mat, bowed twice, and said, "Good. Music masters attribute this song to King Wên." So it was that Confucius, in apprehending the sounds [composed by] King Wên knew what he must be like as a man. Master Hsiang-tz? said, "I venture to ask how you knew the song was by King Wên?" Confucius said, "A man characterized by jên values repression;7 7 As Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.1a) points out. makes no sense here. He proposes , alluding to HFT 8.6a: "Hsi-mên Pao was of a hasty disposition and so wore a leather thong at his belt to slow himself down." Chao approves this emendation. (?) a harmonious man values decoration; a wise man values simplicity,8 8 No dictionary meaning of makes any sense here, and I suggest reading by analogy with above; see note 7. (?) and a man with the intention of being sincere values beauty. (??) This is how I knew it was song by King Wên."9 9 Because only he combined in himself all these qualities as revealed by the music. Traditionally,10 10 B, C begin a new paragraph with this. that man is a saint who penetrates to the true nature of a thing from having experienced [only] its external manifestations. 81 1 Hsin hsü 6.1b has a similar passage. CHy does not separate this paragraph from the preceding one. As ruler [the tyrant] Chou put the people's strength to work,2 2 . Chou suggests that the text is defective here. Hsin hsü is essentially the same. 16912 and imposed unjust and cruel commands on the populace, while lamentable and wicked deeds were loosed upon the great ministers. His underlings were not trustworthy, and the people were bitter and resentful. For these reasons the empire rebelled, wishing to be under King Wên; [the tyrant] Chou brought it on himself. Though he had the rank of emperor and the wealth of the empire,3 3 This cliché occurs also in SY 10.16a. when the armies of Chou arrived, his commands were not carried out by his attendants. Alas, in that time [of extremity], though he had sought [the status of] an ordinary man, he could not have achieved [so much]. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 432 No. 236/1. Yin's rightful heir to the heavenly seat5 5 For Shih k`ao 19b has . (CHy.) Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 11.7a) gives no suggestion as to how might be interpreted.

Though the five colors2 2 : blue , yellow , red , white , and black . be brilliant, at times they will fade; the luxuriant [foliage] of a tree3 3 : PWYF cites only this passage. Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.1b) thinks is an error for ? , "branches." Chao (129) quotes Mo T`ien-i , who interprets the expression as similar to in *Yü p`ien 12.5a s.v. "The united shade of two trees," and refers to Huai-nan tz? 16.18b Mo's remarks are, as Chao observes, far fetched. Preferable in Chu Ch`i-fêng's suggestion (TT 302) that is a mistake for as in (Yang Hsiung's `Shu-tu fu' , *Ku wên yüan 4.8b). He identifies with "luxuriant" and quotes Shih chi 28.29a "The abundance of this year's harvest is not yet repaid." This accords well with the Huai-nan tz? reading "flourishing trees and luxuriant plants." in season will fall. Living things have [their periods of] growth and decay; they do not attain constancy. So the Way of the Three Kings: made to revolve, it returns to its original state; pushed to the extreme, it reverts to its fundamental basis. It is not merely a matter of change for its own sake, but it is to rectify4 4 B, C have for . evil and support the weak, eliminate 170 error and overcome the false, to harmonize yin and yang and to act in agreement with the proclivities of all things. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 444 No. 238/5. Ever active was King Wên,6 6 . This line occurs in Shih 428 No. 235/2. CHy, B, C have , which is the line immediately preceding the next in Shih 444 No. 238/5. Chou insists on the mixed quotation. Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 11.13a-b) ascribes it to No. 238/5 as a Han shih variant. There is no difference in meaning, as is here King Wên, and the binom occurs elsewhere as a variant of . (Cf. Ch`ên, ibid.) Further, No. 238 is necessary to preserve the sequence from No. 236 (§ 8) to No. 241 (§ 10). Giving law and rules to the four quarters [of the kingdom]. 101 1 This paragraph is a modification of Hsün-tz? 1.22a-b. Li resembles the form of Heaven and Earth.2 2 . CHy, B, C have for . Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.6a) would emend to , in the sense of as in Li Ki 2.83 (17/3.2): "Li and music resemble the nature of Heaven and Earth" (Legge 2.114). As the character is not in Shuo wên, Yü assumes it was formerly written , for which he takes to be a graphic error. he thinks was a scribal emendation. I have followed Yü. (Chao 130.) While [li] is in accord with human feelings, it goes on to bring them under control.3 3 : cf. Li Ki 1.202 (2/2.1): "Beating the breast, and leaping are extreme expressions of grief, but the number of such acts is limited, as well as the timing and the manner." (Legge 1.169.) Without li, how would it be possible to rectify oneself? Without a teacher, how can one know the correctness of li? If you approve of what li approves, it is because your feelings are at rest in li. If you speak as your teacher speaks, it is because your knowledge is equal to your teacher's. When your feelings are at rest in li and your knowledge is equal to your teacher's, then4 4 is preferable to as in B, C. yours is the way of the superior man. When words correspond with reason and conduct is in accordance with the true principle,5 5 Analects 337 (18/8.3), but with for . the empire is in accord. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 454 No. 241/7. Without consciousness of effort on your part, In accordance with the pattern of God. 171 11 If superiors do not know enough to be obedient and filial, the people will not know enough to revert to the fundamental; if the prince does not know enough to revere the aged, the people will not know enough to honor their parents. If the sacrifices are not reverently carried out, and hills and streams lose their seasonal [offerings], the people will have no [sense of] fear. If they are punished without instruction,1 1 Analects 353 (20/2.3), with for . the people will not respond to admonition. Hence when the ruler improves himself until he is [wholly] filial, the people do not rebel. When reverence and filial piety penetrate to [the masses] below, the people know about love for parents. [The differences between] good and evil is made clear among the populace, and inferiors respond to their superiors like shadow or echo. This is the essential method for simultaneously governing the empire, establishing [all] within the seas, and making subjects of the people; it is one that the enlightened king or the sage ruler cannot for one moment neglect. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 459 No. 243/3. He secured the confidence due to a king, And became the pattern of all below him. Ever thinking how to be filial, His filial mind was the model [which he supplied]. 121 1 SSTC 4.3b relates the story of the three sprouts growing together, and ibid. 4a-5a tells of the mission from Yüeh-shang; the latter is translated by Legge in Shu ching 536, along with the HSWC version. SY 18.13a-b seems to be based on both SSTC and HSWC. In King Ch`êng's time there were three sprouts that grew up through a mulberry [leaf]2 2 SSTC has . and united to put forth a single ear of grain large enough nearly to fill a cart and long enough nearly to cover the bed of a wagon. King Ch`êng asked the Duke of Chou, "What is this thing?" The Duke of Chou said, "It seems to me that three sprouts 172 united into a single ear of grain [means] that the empire is now about to become unified."

The Duke of Chou then respectfully received12 12 For read as in SY. that which they had brought. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 460 No. 243/6. For myriads of years, Will there not be their helpers?14 14 TPYL 872.2a quotes Shih 381 No. 212/3, The clouds form in dense masses, And the rain comes down slowly. and adds, "From this we may clearly know that in [a time of] the Great Peace there are no sudden winds or violent rains." This belongs to HSWC 8/20. (Chao.) 173 13 For the pleasure of seeing far after climbing to a height and standing by a gulf, towers and lookouts do not provide so elevated an outlook as hills and mountains. For the pleasure of looking out across a plain and getting an extensive view, ponds and [artificial] lakes do not provide so wide a vista as rivers and [natural] lakes. He troubles his heart and pains his mind, gives rein to his desires and goes to the extreme in his likes, wastes property and does violence to his feelings, sullies his reputation and shortens his life: alas! alas! that a ruler in extremity should turn from this way [of natural economy] and worry the people! The Ode says,1 1 Shih 499 No. 254/1. The ruler2 2 for Han Ying meant "ruler," as it did for Mao (cf. Legge's note in loc.). Legge translates "God." turned against [the right way], And the lower people are full of distress.3 3 For read with Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung. 14 The Confucian is pliant;1 1 : cf. Shuo wên 3483-4: . Punning definitions of this sort occur also in HSWC 5/19. 5/30. the meaning of the word ju is emptiness.2 2 in the Taoist sense? (?) It is an immutable technique [of living]. In the thousand undertakings and the ten thousand transformations their Way is unexhausted—such are the Six Classics. Now as to appropriate relations between prince and subject, the love between father and son, the distinction between husband and wife, and precedence between friends—these are what the Confucian takes care to preserve; daily he "cuts and polishes"3 3 Shih 91 No. 55/1. without ceasing. Though he live in a poor alley and in a wretched hut, not having enough to fill his emptiness or to clothe himself, and though he be without so much as an awl's point of territory, still his understanding is sufficient to control the empire. When he is employed in a greater 174 capacity, he has the makings of a nobleman. If he is employed in a lesser capacity and given office, he will be a minister to whom may be entrusted the destiny of the state. Though he live secluded in a mountain cave, kings and feudal lords will be unable to contest his fame.4 4 Hsün-tz? 4.3b is similar. (Chou.) Why is this? Simply because from him is an emanation of jên and i. Should he give a king the opportunity to hear his words and rely on his conduct, it would be possible to see [again] the methods of T`ang and Yü,5 5 Yao and Shun. while the sound of songs of praise would become audible. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 501 No. 254/3. The ancients had a saying:— `Consult the grass and firewood gatherers.' [It shows that] they got advice from all sources.7 7 lit., "broadly." 151 1 Hsin hsü 5.9a is similar. There is a traditional saying: That the Son of Heaven can stay inside the curtain in his great room, seated on the mat wearing his imperial robes2 2 Chou thinks should be supplied after . and slippers, without looking outside the door, and [still] have a broad knowledge of [the affairs of] the empire is due to his sage counselors. Thus viewing a thing alone is not so good as viewing it in company for clearness; hearing a thing alone is not so good as hearing it in company for understanding; thinking about a thing alone is not so good as thinking about it in company for effectiveness. Hence the enlightened king brings sage ministers together and goes forward with them, thereby everywhere attaining the right and attracting gentlemen living in retirement. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 501 No. 254/3. The ancients had a saying:— `Consult the grass and firewood gathers.' This is illustrated above. 175 16 When Heaven is established in its height, sun and moon achieve their brilliance; when Earth is established in its mass, hills and mounds achieve their positions;1 1 For read with Chih-yao 8.22b. (Chao 133.) when superiors are established in the True Way, all things are properly ordered. After the decline of the [Royal] House2 2 CHy, B, C have "fall" for . of Chou, the Kingly Way disappeared and did not [again] rise up. Li and i were broken off and not continued. In Ch`in times li and i were held in disrepute, the Shih and the Shu were discarded, and antiquity was neglected. The Way of the saints was completely destroyed, and [people] devoted themselves solely to vain and perverse practices. Avarice was the usual thing, accusations and arrests3 3 . B, C have for . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 2466) would make (*liap) a phonetic borrowing for (*kiat). This is unlikely, though the combination is common, and Chao accepts it. Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.6a) explains it as "arrest" and paraphrases, "accusations are made to the officials, who arrest and punish them." Chao thinks this is far fetched, but I follow it for lack of a better explanation. were common, and the empire was in great confusion. Whereupon troops were employed and fire flared up.4 4 For CHy, D write "there were great uprisings." Living outside, exposed to the elements, the people considered exactions, robbery and stealing from one another the ordinary practice. Every day they were further separated in time from the radiance of the Saintly Kings. They had never viewed the Way of jên and i, nor received the influence of rites (li) and music. Since they were unscrupulous and without ritual (li), dignified and respectful conduct daily degenerated.5 5 For CHy, B, C write "increased." Violently they threatened one another with force and military power. Irresponsibly they became sycophants and did not flee disaster and suffering. This is why they were difficult to govern. Man has six desires. His eyes desire to see good-looking colors, his ears desire to hear [the notes] kung and shang,6 6 The first two notes of the scale. his nose desires to smell fragrant odors; his mouth desires to taste fine flavors, his four limbs desire repose and inactivity; of clothing he likes the 176 elegant and embroidered, the light and warm. These six are the six desires of the people. Neglecting them results in trouble; acting in accord with them, in harmony. Hence the Saintly King, in instructing the people, always makes a point of following their desires, employing ritual (li) to restrain them; he accords always with their wishes, using i to control them. I being simple and complete, ritual (li) being easy and regulated, and [neither] departing far from [human] desires, the people as a result obey orders quickly. Confucius, knowing how easy the Way is put into action, said, "The Ode says,7 7 Shih 502 No. 254/6. The enlightenment of the people is very easy. —these are not empty words. 171 1 Huai-nan tz? 20.4b is similar. Tung Chung-shu (CCFL 10.8a) applies the metaphors of the cocoon and the egg to his own theory of human nature. It is the nature of a cocoon to make silk thread, but if it is not first heated in boiling water by the woman whose job it is, and then unraveled and put into order,2 2 Chao (134) would here add from Huai-nan tz? to balance with the next phrase. it will not become silk thread. It is the nature of an egg to make a chick; but without a good hen to cover it and protect it for days on end, it will not become a chick. Now the nature of man is good, but without the support of an enlightened king or saintly ruler who will make him intimate with the True Way, he will not become a superior man. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 505 No. 255/1. Heaven gave birth to the multitudes4 4 For CHy has as in Mao shih. of the people, But the nature it confers is not to be depended on.5 5 For CHy writes as in Shih k`ao 21a; cf. I-shuo k`ao 13.1a. All are [good] at first, But few prove themselves to be so at the last. It says that it may be brought about only with an enlightened king or saintly ruler. 177 18 One whose knowledge is like a spring and whose conduct can be taken as representative of good manners is a teacher. One whose knowledge can be improved1 1 . Chih-yao 8.23a, Ch`ang-tuan ching 1.9b have a better reading: . (Chao 134.) and whose conduct can be considered helpful2 2 : Chih-yao has "an instrument for straightening a bow." Ch`ang-tuan ching has "to warn." (Chao.) is a friend. One who holds to the law, sticks to the duties of his office, and dares not do wrong is a clerk.3 3 . *Shih t`ung 11.2a-b in quoting this writes , likewise TPYL 235.2a. CHy and Chao (135) agree that it makes no sense here. One who, standing before [his master], confirms his ideas (?) and answers every call with repeated assent is a servant. Thus the superior ruler makes the teacher his assistant; the mediocre ruler makes the friend his assistant; the inferior ruler makes the clerk his assistant; the ruler who is headed for destruction makes the servant his assistant. As the saying has it, "If the pond is big, the fish in it will be large; if the ruler is enlightened, his ministers will be intelligent."4 4 A similar aphorism occurs in Shih chi 129.3a: "When the pond is deep, fish grow in it; when the hills are deep (? secluded), animals go to them." Cf. HSWC 5/21. When two persons on looking at each other find their intentions in accord, they will always follow a mean.5 5 . Chih-yao has "To see the superior, it is necessary to procede from the inferior." Likewise Ch`ang-tuan ching, but with for . (Chao.) The variants indicate a corrupt text. (?) Thus persons6 6 After , and , Chih-yao and Ch`ang-tuan ching have . with the same sight will see eye-to-eye; those with the same ear for sounds will listen to one another; and those with the same intentions will follow one another's suggestions. Only a sage can use a sage. Truly, the ministers and assistants who are employed in office are the pivot between survival and extinction, and the key to success and failure. Can one but take care? The Ode says,7 7 Shih 507-8 No. 255/4. 178 All unintelligent are you of your [proper] virtue, And so you have no [good] men behind you, nor by your side.8 8 Shih k`ao 21a has for and for . Without any intelligence of your [proper] virtue, You have no [good] intimate adviser nor minister." 191 1 The first two sentences, containing the pun on and occur in Hsin shu 10.71b. The Hsin shu passage then (10.71b-13a) develops quite differently; it is followed closely by SY 8.6a-7b. Of old through Yü the Hsia was ruled, and through Chieh the Hsia was lost. Through T`ang the Yin was ruled, and through Chou the Yin was lost. Thus there is no state always static,2 2 D has for : "There are no enduring pleasures." Hsin shu 10.73b-74a is again the source for HSWC, both here and for 7/16. SY 8.7b-8b follows Hsin shu. TTLC 3.14a-b is similar. nor a people [always] ready to be ruled. If it gets a sage, [the state] will be prosperous; if it gets an unworthy [ruler]3 3 . HSWC 7/16 has (Chou), but Lei-chü 23.2a agrees with the present reading. (Chao 136.) it will be lost: from antiquity to the present time this has always been the case. Now a bright mirror is the means of reflecting the form, and the past is the means of knowing the present. For to know enough to detest that whereby ancient [dynasties] fell and not follow the methods by which they preserved themselves,4 4 Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 54.21b quotes: . . . "For to know enough to detest the evil of the past without knowing to improve what is good in the present, to know enough to detest that whereby ancient [dynasties] fell and not to know enough to continue the methods by which they preserved themselves. . . ." (Chao.) This however agrees with none of the other citations or parallels. is no different from seeking to catch up with the man ahead of you by walking backwards. The proverb says, "If you do not know whom to make an officer, look at a task which he has completed." Another says, "If the chariot ahead turns over and the one following does not take warning, then it too will overturn." Truly, that which brought about the fall of the Hsia was practiced by the Yin, and that which brought about the fall of the Yin was practiced 179 by the Chou. Hence the Yin could have used the Hsia as a mirror, and the Chou could have used the Yin as a mirror. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 510 No. 255/8. The beacon of Yin is not far distant:6 6 HSWC 10/15 quotes this line with for , and Chao thinks the former was the Han shih reading; likewise Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 13.4b). However, that the line is quoted in the present context is strong support for the reading . — It is in the age of the last sovereign of Hsia. 201 1 Huai-nan tz? 10.13a is similar. There is a traditional saying: The prince whose pride is excessive rarely has loyal [subjects],2 2 Huai-nan tz? has for is not a term usually applied to princes. and the man who speaks a great deal is seldom sincere. Just as a tree that can be compassed by the hand has no branches that would fill the embrace, neither does a small stream3 3 CHy has for . B, C have . Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.6b-7a) points out that is a place name and makes no sense here. For he would read is defined in Shuo-wên as a small stream. (Chao 137.) contain any fish that could swallow a boat. If the roots are shallow, the branches and leaves will be scrubby; if the roots are broken off, then branches and leaves will wither. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 510 No. 255/8. Its branches and leaves are yet uninjured, It is the trunk that broke off first. Calamity or fortune each appears naturally and of itself (?). 211 1 This is modified from Hsün-tz? 9.9b-10a. If the water or pool is deep and broad, dragons and fish will live in it. If mountain forests are flourishing, birds and beasts will go to them.2 2 A similar phrase occurs in Shih chi 129.3a; cf. HSWC 5/18, note 4. If li and i are polished and made brilliant, the 180 superior man will embrace them. Thus when the practice of li reaches the individual, his conduct is improved; when the practice of li3 3 Chou would emend to as in Hsün-tz?. reaches to a state, its government becomes brilliant. If one is able to support himself with li, his honorable name will automatically become prominent, and the empire will be obedient. His commands will be put into effect, his prohibitions will be observed, and the task of the ruler will be complete. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 511 No. 256/2. To an upright virtuous conduct, All in the four quarters of the state render obedient homage. This is illustrated above. 221 1 From Hsün-tz? 3.10b. SY 11.1a follows Hsün-tz?, beginning "Sun Ch`ing says," but at the end quotes from the same Ode as HSWC. Confucius said, "In offering advice, the [proper] method is to begin by putting it on a plane of solemnity, to establish it on a note of rectitude, hold to2 2 Read with Hsün-tz? and SY for , which here can hardly be used with . it with strength, illustrate it with metaphors, make it clear by establishing distinctions,3 3 : B. C lack . and express it with joy and friendliness.4 4 For I follow Hsün-tz? to read , explained by Wang Nien-sun as "friendly." Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 821) identifies with , of which he records several variants, including the present SY reading, . Make it valuable and rare, make it worthy of honor and respect. Advice of which these things are true will always be put to use. This is what is known as being able to esteem what one values. Now as to outlandish advice, unpatterned behavior, and carping words, the superior man bewares of them." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 514 No. 256/6. I have used Waley's translation (Songs 301). Karlgren (BMFEA 17.78) is essentially the same. Do not be rash in your words, Do not say, "Let it pass." 181 23 Now if the people on the one hand do not lack food, and on the other1 1 . . . , lit., "the inside . . . the outside [of their bodies]." do not suffer from cold, they can be taught and governed through li and i. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 586 No. 279; 602 No. 290. We offer to our ancestors, male and female, And provide for all ritual. When all ritual (li) is provided for, all wishes are realized; when all wishes are realized, yin and yang are in harmony. When yin and yang are in harmony, hot and cold are equalized; when hot and cold are equalized, the three radiances3 3 : sun, moon, and stars; cf. Po-hu t'ung 3.1b. are clear; when the three radiances are clear, wind and rain are seasonable; when wind and rain are seasonable, all living things are at peace. Under such circumstances the Way of Heaven is operative. In this way [a ruler] may know the empire without going outside his door, and without looking out of his window he can view the Way of Heaven. The Ode says, "Here is a wise man;— His views and words reach to a hundred li."4 4 Shih 525 No. 257/10. "Oh! Happy was the king's leadership; He followed the principle of nourishment in times of darkness."5 5 Shih. 606 No. 293; cf. HSWC 3/20, note 6. It says he nourished them even in the darkness. 241 1 This paragraph is the same as Li chi 51.5b-7b (Couvreur 2.397-9). In Chia-yü 8.12a-b it is incorporated into a longer passage which also quotes from the same Ode. I have consulted Legge's translation in Shih, Proleg. 91-2; also in Li Ki 2.281-3. To Heaven belong the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter,2 2 CHy changes to , the sequence in Li chi, but Chia-yü and the citation in TPYL 18.6a are the same as the present texts of HSWC. (Chao 137.) From the next phrase one would expect and to be interchanged, to match each season with its appropriate phenomenon. with wind, rain, hoar frost, and dew; [in the action 182 of] all and each of these [there] is a lesson.3 3 Li chi continues, "Earth contains the mysterious energy [of nature]. By the wind and thunder-clap the [seeds of] forms are carried abroad, and the various things show the appearance of life:—in all and each of these things there is a lesson." When the personal character is pure and bright, the spirit and mind are like those of a spiritual being. When what such a person desires is about to come, there are sure to be premonitions of it in advance, [as when] Heaven [is about to] send down seasonable rain, clouds come out from hills and streams. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 535 No. 259/1. Grandly5 5 For D has , which Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 14.1a) takes as the Han shih reading. lofty are the mountains, With their large masses6 6 For CHy, B, C follow Mao shih and write . reaching to the heavens.

Such was the virtue of [Kings] Wên and Wu.8 8 B, C begin a new paragraph with the following two lines. The rulers of the Three Dynasties always were preceded by their good names.9 9 . Li chi has for , and Legge there translates "it was necessary that they should be preceded by the fame of their forefathers"; likewise Couvreur. But Legge's translation of the HSWC paragraph is closer to mine. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 555 No. 262/6. Very intelligent is the Son of Heaven; His good fame shall be without end. Let him display his civil virtues, Till they permeate all quarters of the kingdom. Such was the virtue of King T`ai.11 11 For cf. Mencius 176 (1B/15.1). 183 251 1 The exotic animals of this paragraph are also mentioned in *Erh ya B.10b, LSCC 15.15b, and SY 6.1b. Borrowing the blue color of the indigo plant, a [dyed] thread is bluer than indigo.2 2 The figure seems to be a common one: Shih chi 60.10a: (This, however, is in a section from the hand of Ch`u Shao-sun.) It would better suit the present argument if the following could be omitted, so that the line could be rendered "Indigo is possessed of blue and a thread borrows its blue from indigo. Earth is possessed of yellow and a thread borrows its yellow from earth." Borrowing the yellow color of earth, a [dyed] thread is yellower than earth. If even the blue of indigo and the yellow of earth can be borrowed, cannot the substance of jên and i certainly be borrowed? In the Eastern Sea there are fish called the tieh,3 3 For D has . Wang Yin-chih (Ching-i shu wên 33b-34a) thinks this latter is a mistake for , an alternative form of . (Chao 138.) which go about sharing their [single] eyes. Unless they are two together, they cannot get anywhere. In the north there are animals called lou, one of which eats while the other keeps watch.4 4 Chih-yao 8.24a has for : "One eats while the other waits." (Chao.) Unless they are two together, they cannot eat their fill. In the south there are birds called chien, which fly by combining their [single] wings. Unless they are two together they cannot get up [off the ground]. In the west5 5 LSCC, Huai-nan tz? 12.4b, and SY all say it is an animal from the north. (Chao 139-40.) there are animals called chüeh, whose front legs are those of a rat and whose hind legs are those of a rabbit. When it gets sweet grass, it always takes it in its mouth and gives it to the ch`ung-ch`ung-chü-hsü;6 6 . SY makes it two animals, the ch`ung-ch`ung and the chü-hsü. Chao (141-2) thinks the evidence is in favor of this, and opines that they were similar creatures, each of which was dependent on the chüeh for its food. not that by instinct it loves the ch`ung-ch`ung-chü-hsü, but that it may avail itself of its legs.7 7 Read for after SY. Now if even birds, beasts, and fishes depend on one another,8 8 Chih-yao has for , probably from the in the next phrase. how much the more lamentable that the ruler of [a state of] ten 184 thousand chariots9 9 Chih-yao writes after : "How much the more the ruler, etc." The phrase after is certainly long, and the text may be faulty, but punctuating after spoils the parallelism between . . . . . . should be the only one not to know enough to avail himself of the company10 10 Read with Chih-yao for . of the empire's heroes and worthies and associate himself with them. Truly it is said, clarity supported by clarity will rise up to Heaven; obscurity supported by clarity will attract the right men; but it is pure luck if two blind men supporting each other do not injure [themselves against] a wall or a tree, or fall into a well or a hole. The Ode says,11 11 Shih 525 No. 257/12. There is a man unobservant of the right, Whose goings12 12 for Mao shih . Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 13.16b) suggests that is the correct reading here. Since the traditional gloss on the Mao shih reading is , it is as likely that is a corruption of . will be according to his inward13 13 Read with CHy, D for or as in B, C. (Chao.) filthiness. This [speaks of]14 14 Chao suggests adding . going in obscurity. 26 Prosperity takes it rise from non-interference, and trouble from desiring too much.1 1 Cf. HSWC 9/16: ; also Tao tê ching B/5a, with for . If one knows enough to be content, riches will follow; if one has the qualities appropriate to a ruler, honor will follow. Hence one with high rank who is deficient in these qualities would not be honored2 2 For "respected," I follow Chih-yao 8.24b: , as and are the topic of the whole paragraph. (Chao 143.) though he should be Son of Heaven, and one who covets material goods without knowing where to stop would not be rich though he should possess the empire. Now the produce of the land does not increase [indefinitely], and the products of mountains and lakes are exhaustible. Cherishing an insatiable mind3 3 , lit., "a mind not to be made wealthy." to seek things whose increase is limited, and fostering desires a hundredfold to seek exhaustible 18513 property—this is how Chieh and Chou lost their thrones. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 526 No. 257/13. The point of the quotation seems to lie in the words . Great winds have a path;— The covetous men subvert their peers. 271 1 Hsin hsü 5.1a-b seems to derive from this paragraph. LSCC 4.5a-4a is similar in intention, but includes a longer list of famous teachers. Duke Ai asked Tz?-hsia, "Is it necessarily true that only after study one can keep a state at peace and protect the people?" Tz?-hsia said, "There has never been such a thing as keeping a state at peace and protecting the people without having studied." Duke Ai said, "Did the Five Emperors then have their teachers?" Tz?-hsia said, "I have heard that Huang-ti studied under T`ai-chên.2 2 For read one of the following variants: with TPYL 404.1a, Han shu 20.12a, or with Hsin hsü. (CHy.)

Had these eleven sages not met with these teachers, it would not have been possible for their accomplishments10 10 Read with CHy for . 186 to appear in the empire, or for their names to be transmitted to later generations." The Ode says,11 11 Shih 482 No. 249/2. Erring in nothing, forgetful of nothing, Observing and following the old statutes. 28 Now as to virtue (tê), it encompasses the magnitude1 1 : CHy, D write "beauty." of Heaven and Earth; it matches the brilliance of sun and moon. It establishes the harmony2 2 : CHy, B, C have "revolutions." of the four seasons and overlooks3 3 : B, C have "controls." the interchanges of yin and yang. It is unmoved by cold and heat; it is unchanged by the four seasons. It is more shrinking than the extreme of yin, yet is not damp; it is more expansive than the extreme of yang, yet it is not dessicated. Fresh, clean, pure, and bright in its perfection; stern, majestic, resolute,4 4 : D has "devoted." and prompt in its spirituality; most refined and subtle essence5 5 : D has "Powerful, pure, and auspicious." between Heaven and Earth—[such] is virtue. Who but the sage can partake of it? The Ode says,6 6 Shih 544 No. 260/6. Virtue is light as a hair, But few are able to lift it. 29 As in a year of drought, when the grass does not attain to luxuriance,1 1 Cf. Shih quoted below. and then Heaven, bringing forth an abundance of clouds, sends down torrents of rain,2 2 Cf. Mencius 137 (1A/6.6), "When the clouds collect densely in the heavens, they send down torrents of rain." so that of living things none but rise up, [even so] among the people there are none in whose 187 hearts jên and i are not rooted.3 3 Cf. ibid. 460 (7A/21.4).

Truly it is said that if the Way is preserved the state will be preserved, and if the Way is lost the state will be lost.

Truly when the Way is attained, grace flows to the people and prosperity comes back to the nobles. When grace flows to the people, inferiors are at peace and in harmony. When prosperity comes back to the nobles, superiors are respected and honored. 189 Since the people all cherish feelings of peace and harmony, they support their superiors with pleasure. This is what is called "inferiors in order and superiors informed." When inferiors are in order and superiors informed, because of this sounds of praise arise. The Ode says,14 14 Shih 579 No. 274.

Chia-yü 9.31a-b relates the anecdote in different words, perhaps from an independent source. Confucius was sitting by [one of the] Chi-sun [family]. The Chi-sun's minister T`ung2 2 : Chia-yü does not supply a name: "The Chi-sun's minister visited him and said." said, "If the prince should send someone to borrow a horse, should it be given him?" Confucius said, "I have heard that when a prince takes [a thing] from his subject, it is termed `taking'; one does not speak of `borrowing.' " The Chi-sun understood and said to the minister T`ung, "From now on when your prince takes a thing, call it taking. Do not speak of borrowing." Confucius rectified3 3 Delete after to agree with Hsin hsü. (Chou, CHy.) the expression "borrowing a horse," and as a result the proper relation between prince and subject was established. The Lun yü says,4 4 Analects 263 (13/3.2). "What is necessary is to rectify names." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 339 No. 197/8. The prince should not lightly utter his words.6 6 CHy concludes with "Names are rectified."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">191 CHAPTER VI 1 When Pi-kan was put to death for remonstrating [with the Tyrant Chou], Chi-tz? said, "To speak, knowing [one's words] will not be put to use, is stupid. By sacrificing oneself to make the wickedness of one's prince apparent, is not loyal. These are two things that should not be done. If, however, they are done, there is no greater misfortune." Whereupon he let his hair down his back and, feigning madness, left. On hearing of this the superior man says, Chi-tz? was put to a hard task indeed. He exhausted his vigor and pushed to the limit his loyalty and love. When he witnessed the affair of Pi-kan, he removed himself. [He represents] the extreme of jên [combined with] understanding. The Ode says,1 1 Shih 510 No. 256/1. People have the saying, "There is no wise man who is not [also] stupid." 21 1 HFT 15.5a records this incident without developing it. LSCC 15.9a-b seems to be the immediate source for HSWC, but is more closely followed by Hsin hsü 5.4a-b, which however copies the conclusion (beginning with "On hearing of this the feudal lords . . .") from HSWC, including the quotation from the Shih. The same idea is expressed in HSWC 9/21. Duke Huan of Ch`i, wishing to see the Hsiao-ch`ên [Chi],2 2 After the parallel texts all have . (Chou, CHy.) thrice went to him without being granted an interview. His attendants said, "The office of hsiao-ch`ên is the lowest in the state. Having thrice gone to him without being granted an interview, Your Highness may properly desist." Duke Huan said, "Alas, what sort of talk is this? I have heard that a gentleman in cotton clothes who does not desire riches and honor will stand on his dignity toward the ruler of [a state of] ten thousand chariots, and that the ruler of [a state of] ten 192 thousand chariots who does not love jên and i will stand on his dignity toward a cotton-clothed gentleman. It is all right if our master3 3 : i.e., Chi. does not desire riches and honor, but for me not to love jên and i is not all right." When he went for the fifth time, he was granted an interview. On hearing of this the feudal lords of the empire said, "If Duke Huan condescends even to a cotton-clothed gentleman, how much the more can a prince of the realm expect!" And they led one another to his court; there were none who did not come. Such were the means whereby Duke Huan assembled the feudal lords and by which he united and rectified the empire.4 4 Cf. Analects 282 (14/17.2), "Duke Huan assembled all the princes together, and that not with weapons of war and chariots." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 511 No. 256/2. To an upright virtuous conduct, All in the four quarters of the State render obedient homage. 31 1 From Hsün-tz? 8.7a-8a, where the paragraph is introduced by "When the perfect Way achieves its greatest manifestation, rites (li) are exalted and laws perfected, and as a result the state is stable. When sages are honored and the able are employed, the people know what is right. When discussions are made continuous and investigations impartial, the people have no doubts" . (I follow Wang Hsien-chien's commentary in the above translation.) When industry is rewarded and idleness punished, the people are not lax. When judgments are impartial and uniformly perspicacious,2 2 , not the (chai) of DM 397 (16/3): "to fast and purify oneself." the empire submits. After that official duties3 3 . are made clear, occupations are examined, and abilities compared: there are none that are not controlled,4 4 Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 1202) thinks should be as in Hsün-tz?, since ?, the li form of , is easily confused with . (Chao 147.) He does not explain how the phrase might have been inverted. so that the Public Way is current and selfish authority is impeded, public duties (i) are established 193 and selfish affairs inhibited. In this way, while those possessing good qualities are brought forward,5 5 For Hsün-tz? has , parallel with and the two following phrases. flatterers and sycophants are stopped; while the avaricious and the wicked withdraw, the scrupulous and the moderate rise up. The Regulations of Chou read,6 6 : Hsün-tz? has . As Chou says, it is rather the "Governmental statutes" quoted in the "Hsia-shu" section of the Shu ching. The section in question ("Yin-chêng" ) is however from the ku-wên text, and of course was unknown to Han Ying as well as to the compiler of Hsün-tz?. "When they anticipate the time, let them be put to death without mercy; when they are behind the time, let them be put to death without mercy."7 7 Shu ching 166 (3/4.2.4), which has for ; likewise Hsün-tz?, but with for . In practicing affairs, men are confined to human occupations (?), just as ear, eye, nose, and mouth may not be mutually interchanged.8 8 . Hsün-tz? has an easier reading: ? "The various occupations of man are fixed from each man's practicing his own occupation. It is like ear, eye, nose, and mouth in that they cannot borrow the functions of one another." Hence it is said, "Duties being apportioned, the people are not remiss; precedence being establised, ranks are not confused; judgments being impartial, perspicacity is uniform, and the various affairs are not hindered." Under these circumstances, of inferiors and petty officials, none but practice self-improvement; only thereafter do they dare rest secure in office, and only after they have perfected their abilities do they dare receive employment. Mean men reform their hearts, and the people reform their customs. Of such as rebels and traitors, none but return to a state of honesty. The perfection of such government and of such teaching cannot be added to. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 511 No. 256/2.

I supect that HSWC is the older version. The citation in TPYL 267.1b, while attributed to HSWC, is closer to Chia-yü. (Chao 148.) After Tz?-lu had been governing P`u for three years, Confucius went to see him.2 2 For cf. HSWC 9/25. On entering the borders [of P`u] he approved, saying, "Yu (= Tz?-lu) trusts those who are respectful (?)." On entering the city he said, "Excellent! Yu is generous to the loyal and trustworthy (?)." On arriving at the audience hall he said, "Excellent! Yu is enlightened in his judgments." Grasping the reins, Tz?-kung asked, "Master, you have not yet seen Yu, and still have thrice praised his excellence. Might I hear [your reasons]?" Confucius said, "On entering the borders, [I saw that] the grain fields and the hemp fields were very well attended to, and that the fallow lands were well opened up.3 3 Add after from Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 7.20a.

I have used Karlgren's translation (BMFEA 17.78). 196 Make assurances of good faith to your people;11 11 With CHy read for after Shih-k`ao and the quotation by SY. Karlgren seems to have followed Han shih. Observe carefully the measures of your feudal princes,12 12 This line is extremely ambiguous; cf. the versions of Legge and Waley (Songs 301). And so prepare against the unforseen. 61 1 Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.1b-2b) thinks the HSWC text is corrupt and cites a quotation from Liu Hsiang's Pieh-lu by Pei Yin in his com. on Shih-chi 76.5b which is very similar and which frequently has better readings. (Chao 151.) In the world's debates there are three excellencies and five points of superiority, but language as such is relegated to an inferior place.2 2 . Sun I-jang prefers the Pieh-lu reading, . Disputants distinguish different categories to prevent their interfering with one another. They (arrange in succession ?) keep separate incompatible doctrines to prevent their mutual contradiction.

Chao paraphrases, "By raising your voice trouble his train of thought so that he is not able to apply his mind to the matter." . may be convenient to the argument, still harm results from these.8 8 Têng-hsi tz? is similar: ? ? "Hence speakers distinguish different categories to prevent their interfering with one another. They arrange incompatible doctrines in succession to prevent their mutual confusion. They proclaim their intent and display their ideas without devoting themselves to contradicting one another. Using decorated words to confuse [the argument], and obscure words to obfuscate and shift it is not discussion in the ancient way." *Yen-t`ieh lun 5.14a-b has another variant passage: "To delude with falsity, confuse with verbiage, stop only after boasting, with the hope of victory by any means, is not what is estimable in debate." 197 Now not explaining one's point so that it is not known is called obscurantism, and excluding meaning and excluding yourself9 9 : I do not understand this phrase. (?) is called evasion. In approaching an honest man, to take advantage of his slips is called shiftiness. In pointing out connections, to use misleading words is called wrong. These four are not practiced [by the superior man],10 10 I follow Sun and supply . and as a result the truth is made apparent to everybody. Now if arguments and disputes can be brought to an end only11 11 For read with Sun after Pieh-lu. by obscurantism, evasion, perversion, and wrong, they cannot but injure a person as a superior man, and so the superior man does not practice [the like]. The Lun yü says,12 12 Analects 264 (13/4.7). "What the superior requires, is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect." The Ode says,13 13 Shih 514 No. 256/6. Do not speak lightly—your words are your own; Do not say, `This is of little importance.' 71 1 From Hsün-tz? 3.19a-b. SY 10.13b-14a has some phrases in common, but is not directly connected with either Hsün-tz? or HSWC. I tell you,2 2 , lacking here in Hsün-tz?, but cf. ibid. 20.26b: . The Ss?-k`u editors picked this phrase as being out of context; Ss?-k`u ch`üan-shu t`i-yao 16.11a. [the man who] attracts other people's minds is not arrogant toward others because of elevated and high rank, nor does he keep others in obscurity because of his own great intelligence and saintly knowledge. He does not use his courage and strength to encroach on others, nor does he cheat others because he is clever and quick.3 3 ; cf. HSWC 2/31, note 5. If he is unable [to do a thing], he practices; 198 if he does not know [something], he asks. Though he know [a thing], he is always humble, and only afterward admits that he knows it. When he encounters a ruler, he practices conduct appropriate to a subject. When he meets a villager,4 4 Read for as in Hsün-tz?. (Chou.) he practices conduct appropriate to the age [of the person]. When he meets an elder he practices conduct appropriate to a disciple. When he meets one of his own status, he practices conduct appropriate to a friend. When he meets one younger and inferior [to himself], he practices conduct appropriate to instruction and generosity. Thus there are none he does not love and none he does not respect. He does not contest with others, but is as universal as5 5 : Hsün-tz? has ; the two are interchangeable. (Chou.) Heaven and Earth, which embrace all things. One who is like this gives rest to the aged, treats the young tenderly, and shows sincerity to his friends.6 6 Analects 183 (5/25.4), where the last two phrases are interchanged. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 514 No. 256/6. If you are gracious among your friends, And to the people, as if they were your children, Your descendants will continue in unbroken line,8 8 For read with CHy after Shih-k`ao. And all the people will surely be obedient to you. 81 1 This is based on Hsün-tz? 9.7a-b with many variants. The same Ode is quoted by Hsün-tz?. The man characterized by jên always is respectful toward his fellows. There is a proper method in respecting one's fellows. With a sage one respects him in loving and keeping near to him. With an unworthy person one respects him while fearing and keeping him at a distance. The being respectful is the same [in both cases], but the circumstances are different. If he is loyal, sincere, upright, and guileless, and does not work harm, then none he deals with but are thus. Such is the substance of jén. Jén is the substance and i is the principle. [Such a man] never opens his mouth but that [what he says] may be taken as a model for others. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 515 No. 256/8. 199 Committing no excess, doing nothing injurious— There are few who will not in such a case take you for their pattern. 9 The Master said, "As for one who does not study, but who loves to think, though he have [some] knowledge, it will not be broad. One who studies, but is remiss about his person, though studious, will not be respected. He who establishes himself without being sincere, though he be established, will not long endure. One who loves speech without showing that he is sincere will not be believed if he speak. One with fine talents who will not follow the way of the superior man, who conceals a small thing and thereby harms a great one—disaster will certainly overwhelm him." The Ode says,1 1 Shih 522 No. 257/5. I have followed Karlgren, BMFEA 17.80. [If you say], "What can be the good of it?" Then you will all together sink in ruin. 101 1 Shih 523 No. 257/7. When the people are weary they think of ease; when the government is harsh they think of jên, when punishments are severe they think of peace, and when the state is in disorder they think of Heaven. The Ode says,1 1 Shih 523 No. 257/7. I have no strength [to do anything], And so think of [the Power in] the azure vault. 111 1 Hsin shu 7.17a-20a has a longer version of this story, but with many variants. Hsin hsü 5.10a-11a has a series of similar anecdotes, some close to HSWC. LSCC 20.18a-b records the example of King Chuang of Ch'u. One asked,2 2 According to Hsin shu it was Prince Huai who inquired of Master Chia , i. e., Chia I. "The ancients' designation for a person of understanding was `earlier born.' What does this mean?" 200 It is like saying "earlier awakened."3 3 CHy prefixes from Hsin shu. The latter has "Now the proper term is not `earlier born,' but `earlier awakened.' " A man who has not heard of the methods of the True Way is in the dark as to success and failure, and does not know the sources of government4 4 Add from Hsin shu with Chou. and disorder. His befuddlement is like drunkenness. Now among the world's rulers there are those who are earlier awakened,5 5 In each case for read with Hsin shu. (Chou, CHy.) those who are later awakened,5 5 In each case for read with Hsin shu. (Chou, CHy.) and those who are not awakened5 5 In each case for read with Hsin shu. (Chou, CHy.) [at all]. Of old, when King Chuang of Ch`u was making plans, whenever one turned out well6 6 For read with Chou and CHy. LSCC has . (Chao 152.) he would have an anxious look. Shên-Kung Wu Ch'en asked, "Why is Your Highness anxious?" King Chuang said, "I have heard [it said] of the potentialities (tê) of the feudal lords that one who can himself choose his teachers will be king; one that can himself choose his friends will be hegemon; and one whose associates are not his equals will be lost. I am unworthy insofar as none of the arguments of the Great Officers come up to mine. For this reason I am anxious." It was fitting that King Chuang, with his mortal power (tê), should rule men and subjugate the feudal lords; yet every day he was anxious and concerned to seek out sage advisers. Such is the earlier awakened. Of old Duke Chao of Sung went into exile. He said to his charioteer, "I know how I lost [my state]." The charioteer said, "How?" Duke Chao said, "When I put on clothes and stood up, of the several tens of attendants, none of them but said, `Our ruler is elegant.' Whenever I spoke or did anything, of the several hundreds of court ministers, none but said, `Our ruler is a sage.' Inside [the court] and out I never saw my faults, and this is how I lost [my state]." Whereupon he reformed his principles and changed his conduct, rested in i and practiced the True Way. He had been two years in exile before his excellence became known in Sung. The people of 20114 Sung went to meet him to restore him to his throne. His posthumous designation was Chao, "in demeanor respectful and intelligent."7 7 Chou would prefix "at his death." For in posthumous titles cf. Legge, Tso chuan 575. Such is the later awakened. Of old the Prince of Kuo was driven out of Kuo. He said to his charioteer, "I am thirsty and wish to drink." The charioteer gave him clear wine. He said, "I am hungry and wish to eat." The charioteer gave him dried meat and cooked millet. He said, "How is it that you had it ready?" The charioteer said, "I had stored it away." "Why had you stored it?" The charioteer said, "Against your going away into exile, when you would be hungry and thirsty on the way." "Did you know I was about to8 8 For B, C have "suddenly." lose my state?" The charioteer said, "I did." "Then why did you not remonstrate with me?" The charioteer said, "You were pleased with flattery in speech and disliked straightforward language. I wished to offer remonstrances, but feared before [I could speak] Kuo would be lost. For this reason I did not remonstrate." The Prince of Kuo flushed in anger and said, "What was really the cause of my losing my state?" The charioteer reversed his statement and said, "You lost it because you were too much of a sage." He said, "How is it that a sage loses his state instead of preserving it?" The charioteer said, "It was because you alone were the only sage in the empire that you lost your state." The Prince of Kuo was pleased,9 9 . Chou adds this from Hsin shu. CHy supplies only . and leaning against the crossbar sighed, "Alas, so this is the way it goes with a sage!"10 10 . B, C, D have for . (CHy.) Then, his body being weary and his strength exhausted, he pillowed [his head] against the charioteer's knee and went to sleep. The charioteer put a clod in his own place,11 11 For B, C, D read with Chou, following Hsin shu. and abandoned him. 202 [The Prince of Kuo] perished in the wilderness and was eaten by tigers and wolves. Such is the one who is not awakened at all. Now one earlier awakened, in that same year becomes hegemon —such was King Chuang of Ch`u. One later awakened is restored within three years—such was Duke Chao of Sung. One not awakened at all dies in the wilderness and is eaten by tigers and wolves—such was the Prince of Kuo. There are those earlier awakened, those later awakened, and those not awakened at all.12 12 CHy omits this last sentence as superfluous. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 526 No. 257/13. I have followed Karlgren's translation (op. cit. 80-1). When there are admonishing words, You are [sleepy] as if drunk. 121 1 Hsin hsü 8.1a is a modification of this paragraph. After T`ien Ch`ang had assassinated Duke Chien,2 2 Tso chuan 840 (Ai 14), "On chia-wu Ch`ên Hêng of Ch`i murdered his ruler Jên in Shu-chou." (B.C. 481.) The details of the event are told in Shih chi 32 (Mém. hist. 4.83-6), where his name is written . Hsin hsü has . and are often interchanged, likewise and . he made a covenant with the people of the state, saying, "Those who do not covenant with me will be put to death with their families." Shih T`o3 3 . Hsin hsü adds : Shih T`o-jên. said, "Of old those who served a ruler died in their ruler's interests. To abandon4 4 For read with B, C, D. one's ruler so as to preserve one's parents is not loyal. To abandon4 4 For read with B, C, D. one's parents so as to die in the interests of one's ruler is not filial. So I cannot do it. However, if I do not covenant, it will be to kill my parents. If I do as others do and covenant, it will be repudiating my ruler. Alas! One born in disordered times cannot achieve upright conduct, and one suffering violence at the hands of a cruel man cannot behave in complete conformity with i. Too bad!" Whereupon he went up and covenanted so as to spare his father and mother, and then withdrew and threw himself on his sword to die for his ruler. 203 Those who heard of it said, "A superior man indeed! What could he have done?5 5 Chou punctuates after . It was fate." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 524 No. 257/9. The people have the saying: "To go forwards or backwards is alike impracticable." This applies to Master Shih. 13 The I [ching] says,1 1 Cf. Yi King 162 (47 ). "[The subject is] straitened before a [frowning] rock. He lays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife. There will be evil." This speaks of one who in difficulty does not find a sage on whom to rely. Of old Duke Mu of Ch`in was in difficulty in Hsiao,2 2 For this episode cf. Tso chuan 224-5 (Hsi 33); Mém. hist. 2.39-40. but quickly relying on the Great Officer Wu-ku, Chien Shu, and Kung-sun Chih, he became a minor hegemon. [Duke]3 3 Add to parallel and . (CHy.) Wên of Chin was [involved] in difficulty through Li[-chi],4 4 For details cf. Kuo yü 7, passim, and Mém. hist. 4.264-7. but quickly relying on Uncle Fan, Chao Shuai, and Chieh-tz? T`ui, he became in the end ruler [of Chin]. Kou-chien, King of Yüeh, was in difficulty in Kuei-chi,5 5 Cf. Mém. hist. 4.423-4. but quickly relying on Fan Li and the Great Officer [Wên] Chung, he gained the hegemony over the states of the south. Duke Huan of Ch`i was in difficulty in Ch`ang-cho,6 6 Cf. Tso chuan 86 (Chuang 10). but quickly relying on Kuan-chung, Ning Ch`i and Hsi P`êng, he brought the empire into order. These all were men who knew enough quickly to rely on sages when in difficulty. There have never been any who, when in difficulty, did not know enough to rely on sages that were not lost.7 7 Cf. Mencius 433-4 (6B/6.4): "Ruin is the consequence of not employing sages." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 563 No. 264/5. 204 [Good] men are going away, And the country is sure to go to ruin. It refers to a lack of good men. 14 Mencius exercised his eloquence on King Hsüan of Ch`i, who was not pleased. Ch`un-yü K`un was in attendance.1 1 For other debates between Mencius and this man, cf. Mencius 307 (4A/17), 432-5 (6B/6). Mencius said, "Today I exhorted your ruler, but he was not pleased. I suppose that he does not know what good is?" Ch`un-yü K`un said, "Master, it is only that you are really not good. Of old when Hu-pa played the cither, the fishes of the deep came out to listen; and when Po-ya played the lute, his six horses raised their heads from their feeding.2 2 This line occurs in Hsün-tz? 1.11a, Shên-tz? 22b, Lun hêng 2.16a. It is quoted three times in Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan (16.37a, 31.13a, 18.13b) and twice in Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu (80B.16b, 60.13a) with minor variants. (Chao 153.) For Po-ya's lute playing, cf. HSWC 9/5. If even fishes and horses know what is good, how much the more must a prince3 3 For read with B, C, D. (Chao 154.) [know it]." Mencius said, "Lightning and thunder occur and split bamboo, break trees, and convulse the empire, but they are not able suddenly4 4 . (Chou.) to make the deaf have hearing. The brightness of sun and moon everywhere illumines the world, but it is not able suddenly4 4 . (Chou.) to make the blind have sight. Now it is like this with your ruler." Ch`un-yü K`un said, "Not so. Of old when I-fêng lived in Kao-shang, the people of Ch`i were fond of singing.5 5 Mencius 434 (6B/6) has Mien Ch`ü for , which latter Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 325) thinks is a misreading of the cursive forms of . For Mencius has T`ang. When Ch`i Liang's wife grieved and wailed, people praised her voice.6 6 Mencius, loc. cit., has "The wives of Hua Chou and Ch`i Liang bewailed their husbands so skilfully, that they changed the manners of the state." Truly, `There is no sound so faint as not to be heard, and no conduct so 205 secret as not to show.'7 7 This line occurs in Hsün-tz?, loc. cit. (Chou.) If you, Master, are living as a sage in Lu, how is it that the state of Lu is being dismembered?" Mencius said, "If the sage is not employed, [the result is ruin]; how can there be [only] dismemberment?8 8 . Punctuating after the text reads, "Not at all. If sages are employed, what dismemberment could there be?" But cf. Mencius, loc. cit.: "How can it rest with dismemberment [merely]?" I suggest that must understood in the HSWC text. The fish [large enough] to swallow a boat does not dwell in a shallow pool, nor does the gentleman of capacity dwell in a polluted world. [Just as] plants, when winter comes, must wither, so have I too my seasons." The Ode says,9 9 Shih 315 No. 192/2; 563 No. 264/7. [Why was this time] not before me? Or [why was it] not after me? Is this not [said of] one who encountered a time of withering? 151 1 SY 3.10a follows HSWC and quotes the same Ode at the end. Chia-yü 2.7a-8a is a development of the same idea. Confucius said, "Is it not only the man of learning with whom one can speak all day long2 2 . KTCY 1.5b has "who can be with others all day long"; likewise Chia-yü and SY. Chao (154) thinks the original reading was "who can speak with others." without fatigue? His physique may not be worth looking at and his strength insufficient to inspire fear; his family may not be worth mentioning and his ancestors not worth talking about, but he can be famous everywhere and illustrious among the feudal lords. It is not only the man of learning [of whom this is possible]?" The Ode says,3 3 Shih 482 No. 249/2. Erring in nothing, forgetful of nothing, Observing and following the old statutes. This refers to [a man of] learning. 206 16 The Master said, "Without recognizing the ordinances [of Heaven], it is impossible to be a superior man."1 1 Analects 354 (20/3.1). What he means is that everything given life by Heaven is in possession of [ideas of] jên, i, li, knowledge, and a mind devoted to the good; but without knowing how through its ordinances Heaven gives life, one is without [ideas of] jên, i, li, knowledge, or a mind devoted to the good. One lacking [ideas of] jên, i, li, knowledge, and a mind devoted to the good is termed a mean man. That is why he said, "Without recognizing the ordinances [of Heaven] it is impossible to a superior man." The "Hsiao-ya" says,2 2 Shih 255 No. 166/1. Heaven protects and establishes you, With the greatest security. It speaks of the great security with which3 3 Delete with Chou. Heaven protects and establishes man through jên, i, li, and knowledge. The "Ta-ya" says,4 4 Shih 541 No. 260/1. Heaven, in giving birth to the multitudes of the people, Associated with every physical attribute its law. The people possess this normal nature, Because they love that beautiful virtue. It says that the people in possessing virtue pattern themselves after Heaven. How can the person who does not know how to pattern himself after Heaven be a superior man? 171 1 SY 1.4b-5a is in more detail and may represent a different version. The True King must needs set up three2 2 For read with CHy after the quotation in Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 28.3a. inspectors3 3 : not "governor" as in Li Ki 1.90. whom he sends to inspect distant places and care for the masses. When the 207 people of distant places suffer from famine and cold without being able to obtain clothing and food, when they have criminal cases and lawsuits and no one settles their complaints,4 4 Li Hsien's com. has for ; (CHy); also below. This is probably a contamination from SY: . when sages are neglected and not brought forward, [then the inspectors] go back and report to the Son of Heaven. When the rulers of such [places] come to court, the Son of Heaven bows and has them advance to him, saying, "Alas, have my government and teachings failed to get to you? How else is it that [your people] suffer from famine and cold without being able to obtain clothing and food, that they have criminal cases and lawsuits and no one settles their complaints,4 4 Li Hsien's com. has for ; (CHy); also below. This is probably a contamination from SY: . that sages are neglected and not brought forward?" Thereafter such rulers return [to their own states] and discuss the matter with their ministers and Great Officers. When the people of those distant places hear of it, they all say, "He is truly Son of Heaven. Although we dwell in an out-of-the-way place, he sees us as though we were near at hand, and though we dwell in seclusion he sees us clearly. How is it possible to deceive him?" Thus it is that inspectors were the means by which he everywhere kept his eyes open and made effective his hearing.5 5 Cf. Shu ching 41: . "to throw open all the doors of communication between the court and the empire, and to see with the eyes and hear with the ears of all." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 543 No. 260/4. In the States, the princes, be they good or bad, Are clearly distinguished by Chung Shan-fu. This is illustrated above. 208 181 1 Kung-yang chuan 16.6a-9a varies slightly in wording. Hsin hsü 4.4b-5b follows Kung-yang chuan, but may also have used HSWC, as it quotes from the same Ode at the end. CKCS 1.6a-b is abridged from Kung-yang chuan. Tso chuan 316-21 (Hsüan 12) gives an elaborate account of the events leading up to and following the engagements with Chêng and Chin, but shows little verbal identity with the other versions. Shih chi 40.9a-b (Mém. hist. 4.355-6) abridges the Tso chuan account. King Chuang of Ch`u attacked [and defeated]2 2 Hsin hsü adds . Chêng. The Earl of Chêng advanced with bared body, holding in his left hand an ox-tail tufted banner3 3 . Wang Yin-chin (Ching-i shu-wên 17b-18a) shows that is a phonetic borrowing for "a standard with an ox-tail ornament," as in Hsin hsü. (Chao 156-7.) and in his right grasping a sacrificial knife with bells,4 4 For cf. Shih 376 No. 210/5. and said to King Chuang, "I am devoid of goodness. Because of [my behavior toward your] subjects on the frontier, I have met with a Heaven5 5 Other texts have for . Chou and CHy have emended from Kung-yang chuan. Hsin hsü also has . (Chao.) -sent disaster and have caused you, Prince of a great state, to have the overwhelming disgrace of coming from afar to this place." King Chuang said, "It was the words of Your Highness' bad subjects in their intercourse with us6 6 . This is not clear. I have translated in accordance with Ho Hsiu's com. on Kung-yang chuan. that gave me the opportunity of viewing Your Highness' jade countenance, and this is the insignificant [reason] which has brought us to this pass."7 7 . Again I follow Ho Hsiu: "It was the accumulation of petty words that brought us to this." . Taking his signal staff8 8 ; cf. Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 1.10a: " is used as a sign of trust. It has a handle made of bamboo eight ch`ih long and for its tuft (?) an ox-tail thrice folded (?)." ? ? ? . King Chuang signaled to his attendants to remove the camp of Ch`u's army seven li. The general Tz?-chung proffered an objection, "Nan-ying is several thousand li distant from Chêng. Among the Great Officers 209 there have been several casualties, and among the camp laborers9 9 . Ho Hsiu says, "Those who cut bushes for a barricade are called ; those who draw water are called ." ? . several hundreds have been killed. Now to win a victory and not to have it—is this wasting the strength of the people and of your servants or not?"10 10 Ho Hsiu says . King Chuang said, "I have heard that of old, if the cups did not leak and the leather [garments] were not worn out, it was because one had not gone outside his own borders.11 11 Ho Hsiu explains, "It says that if drinking cups are leaky and furs worm-eaten, it is from having gone outside the borders. Of old on going outside the borders on a court visit or to undertake a punitive expedition, one always first counted on losses proportional to the scale [of the undertaking] before doing it. It speaks figuratively, meaning that having already gone out on the expedition, it is inevitable that there should have been losses among his troops, but that they should not for that reason destroy Chêng." ? ? ? . Takei Ki (Hsin hsü tsuan chu 4.10a) quotes Okai Hyo : "The phrases are inverted. If one does not go ouside one's borders, there will be no leaky cups or worm-eaten garments." ? . Through this the superior man [shows that he]12 12 Add after from Hsin hsü. (CHy.) holds li to be important but despises property;13 13 Ho Hsiu says, "He does not grudge the loss of cups and garments, but respects the court's request to undertake a punitive expedition." . that he wants the men but not their territory.14 14 Ibid: "The real reason for attacking Chêng was only the desire [to secure] the submission of the people for their faults; he did not want to take their territory." ? . When a man offers submission, it is inauspicious not to desist. Should I [try to] establish myself in the empire by inauspicious means, disaster would overwhelm me. How can I take [their territory]?" Meanwhile those Chin [had sent] to help Chêng arrived and requested [that Ch`u give] battle. King Chuang assented. The general Tz?-chung proffered an objection, "Chin is a powerful state. They have had [only] a short way [to come], and their troops are fresh, while Ch`u's army is long since worn out.15 15 as in Kung-yang, where Ho Hsiu glosses it as . (Chou.) May Your Highness not consent [to fight]." 210 King Chuang said, "It is not possible. If I should flee before the strong but [attempt to] overawe the weak, I would have no way to establish myself in the empire." In the end he turned his troops back to meet the intruders from Chin. King Chuang took a drumstick and beat with it.16 16 I. e., personally took part in the battle. The army of Chin was severely defeated, so that of the officers and men who fled and struggled for boats, the fingers [cut off by those who already had taken possession of the boats] could be gathered by the double-handfuls.17 17 . This is elliptical. Kung-yang has ; Tso chuan: . Most explicit is Hsin hsü: ? ? ? ? "When the people of Chin had come [to attack], they crossed the river and went south. Now that they fled in defeat, they wished to cross to the north. The soldiers struggled for boats, striking with knives at those who pulled [from the outside] until the fingers [cut off] within the boat could be gathered by the double-hundfuls." King [Chuang] said, "Alas, we two rulers are not on good terms, but of what crime are the people guilty?" Whereupon he withdrew Chu's army to let the invaders from Chin escape. The Ode says,18 18 Shih 544 No. 260/5. He does not devour the soft, Or eject the powerful. 191 1 Abridged from Hsün-tz? 2.3b-4b. The superior man, in revering a man's virtue and holding up a man's excellencies is not speaking flattery; nor in correcting speech and rectifying conduct, nor in pointing out a man's faults is he picking flaws. He is pliant and docile,2 2 Hsün-tz? has "That he bends and straightens with the times and is yielding as a reed is not due to cowardice." . strong and resolute.3 3 Ibid: "That there is no place into which he does not extend his strength and resolution is not due to arrogance." . Everywhere moving with events, he does not go outside the Way and virtue. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 544 No. 260/5. 211 He does not devour the soft, Or eject the powerful. He does not insult the poor or the widow; He does not fear the strong or the oppressive. 20 Duke Ling of Wei had been asleep in the daytime.1 1 occurs in Analects 176 (5/9.1) and elsewhere (cf. PWYF) with no stronger implications than mere laziness. When he got up, his vitality became progressively weaker. A man was sent in haste to summon the brave soldier Kung-sun Chüan. On the way he met the Hsing-jên2 2 : an officer in charge of official visits. Pu Shang. Pu Shang said, "Why are you in such a hurry?" [The man] replied, "The Duke having slept in the daytime, when he got up he sent me to summon the brave soldier Kung-sun Chüan." Tz?-hsia said, "Would another person than Chüan,3 3 . For this use of cf. Analects 282 (14/18.2). but equal to Chüan in bravery do?" The driver said, "He would do." Tz?-hsia said, "Carry me back." When they arrived the ruler said, "I sent you to summon a brave soldier. Why have you brought a literatus?" The messenger said, "[This] Hsing-jên said, `Would another person than Chüan, but equal to Chüan in bravery do?' And I said, `He would do.' So I brought him with me." The ruler said, "Very well. Invite the gentleman to come up, but in addition summon Kung-sun Chüan." [Suddenly Chüan] arrived.4 4 TPYL 436.7b-8a has before . (Chao 157.) He came in the door grasping a sword and impetuously cried, "Shang, if you will come down I will leave you your head!" Tz?-hsia5 5 Pu Shang. looked at him and said, "What!6 6 Omit the first with TPYL. (CHy.) Put away your sword. I am going to speak with you about courage." Whereupon the ruler ordered him to put away his sword and come up. Tz?-hsia 212 said, "Come, now. I once was with you when we followed our ruler to the west to visit Chao Chien-tz?. When Chien-tz? gave our ruler an audience, his hair was not done up and he held a lance. I was following thirteen ranks behind and came forward and said, `When feudal lords meet it is not proper for them not to wear court costume. If [Your Highness]7 7 Add from TPYL. (CHy.) does not put on court costume, this Hsing-gên, Pu Shang, is going to splash your dress with the blood from your throat.'8 8 Cf. Shih chi 81.4b: , where Lin Hsiang-ju is threatening the king of Ch`in. Now was it you or was it I who caused him to change to court costume to receive our ruler?" Chüan said, "It was you." Tz?-hsia said, "This is one instance where your courage was not equal to mine. Another time I was with you when we followed our ruler to the east of A. When we met the ruler of Ch`i, he sat on a double mat, while our ruler sat on a single mat. I was following thirteen ranks behind and came forward and said, `According to etiquette (li), when feudal lords meet, it is not proper that they should face one another as befits commoners.'9 9 . No dictionary meaning of makes sense here. The character may have dropped out: "from several mats." Now was it you or was it I who took away one of his mats?" Chüan said, "It was you." Tz?-hsia said, "This is the second instance where your courage was not equal to mine. Another time I was with you when we followed our ruler in the hunting park and two full-grown boars pursued our ruler.10 10 Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.2b) refers to Shih 151 No 97/1: "We pursued together two boars of three years." There Mao's com. (5A.7b) says is a beast three years old is the simple form of ; YTCC 2.21a: "I once took a boar and twice a nursing tigress in the hunt." has as a variant , explaining the TPYL reading . (Chao.) Sun would emend to , but as it is omitted in the TPYL citation Chao thinks it was originally a gloss on that has crept into the text. (Chao 158.) Now was it you or was it I who seized a lance and, striking downward,11 11 For the construction cf. SY 17.13b: . turned them?" Chüan said, "It was you." 213 Tz?-hsia said, "This is the third instance where your courage was not equal to mine. Now what is valued in a soldier is that while on the one hand he can assist [in governing a state of] ten thousand chariots, on the other hand he dares not be arrogant toward a commoner. Outside he establishes moderation and compassion, so that enemies do not attack or make disturbances; inside [the state] he forbids harmful [acts], so that the ruler is not in danger. These are the excellencies of a soldier and that to which the superior man attaches the highest value. But covering up the short with the long, ill-treating the few by the many, oppressing a guiltless people and exerting authority inside the village lanes—these are the extreme evils of which a soldier may be guilty; they are that on which the superior man visits his dislike, and what the masses punish and root out. The Ode says,12 12 Shih 84 No. 52/1. If a man has no dignity of demeanor, What should he do but die? How is it you discuss courage in front of a ruler?" Whereupon Duke Ling withdrew from the mat, raised his hands, and said, "Though I am not intelligent, I should like13 13 For this common formula of thanks for instruction received cf. Analects 250 (12/1.2). to follow your [kind of] courage." The Ode says,14 14 Shih 544 No. 260/5. He does not insult the poor or the widow, He does not fear the strong or the oppressive. Such was Master Pu. 211 1 SY 17.13b-14a follows HSWC with some variants. Chia-yü 5.22b differs slightly from each of them. Traditionally this is the incident referred to in Analects 217 (9/5.1). Confucius had gone on a journey2 2 To Sung, according to SY and Chia-yü. when Chien-tz? was about to kill Yang Hu. Confucius resembled the latter, and [Chien-tz?] 214 surrounded Confucius' dwelling with troops.3 3 , lit., "shield bearers." Tz?-lu was angry, and, brandishing a lance, was about to strike when Confucius stopped him, saying, "Yu, how is it you are so lacking in an abundance of jên and i? If the Shih and the Shu are not studied, if rites (li) and music are not explained, that is my fault. If when I am not Yang Hu, they take me for Yang Hu, that is not my fault; it is fate. You sing and I will accompany you."4 4 . Other texts have . Chou has emended from SY: , which CHy follows: . Tz?-lu sang and Confucius accompanied him. When they had finished three strophes, the soldiers had left off surrounding them. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 491 No. 252/1. Rambling and singing. This is how through a display of the harmony of flourishing virtue noninterference is practiced. 22 The Ode says,1 1 Shih 489 No 251/1. The happy and courteous sovereign Is the parent of the people. What is meant by saying that the sovereign is the parent of the people? It means that the sovereign is reverent in aspect and strict in conduct; he is frugal toward himself, but liberal to others. Truly the unworthy cannot come up to him. In his own affairs (?) he is rigorous with himself, but is easy-going (?) with others.2 2 : the force of and is not clear. Truly he is able to serve to the extent of his abilities (?). Being sincere in his love, he does not rob; he is generous in his gifts but not boastful. On seeing a man who is good he rejoices in him gladly, and on seeing a man who is not good he conceals [his wickedness] in alarm. When there is a fault, he wraps it up completely. In giving clothes, he gives the best; in giving food he gives much. Laws he puts in an inferior place and makes them 215 easy to follow. He makes duties few and easy to perform. This is how by acting impartially3 3 , cf. Li Ki 2.433. he is a parent to the people. He builds cities and has them live there. He divides up the fields and nourishes [the people with their produce]. He sets up schools to instruct them. He causes them to realize that parents are worthy of respect. Because they are worthy of respect, one wears deepest mourning4 4 . garments of unhemmed sackcloth worn in mourning for parents. Cf. Li Ki 1.742 and passim. for three years [on the death of] a father. Likewise [on the death of] a prince one wears deepest mourning for three years. This is what is meant by his being parent to the people. 231 1 From Hsün-tz? 6.17b-19a. To serve a tyrannical state is difficult, but it is easy to make a tyrannical state serve oneself. If you serve it with goods and valuables, then when your valuables are exhausted,2 2 . friendly relations will not continue. If you make treaties and covenants, it will not be long after the agreement is fixed that [such a state] will repudiate it. Should you present [such a state] with territory cut off from your own borders, even though the amount cut off [and presented] be fixed, still their greed will not be satisfied. The more completely one gives in to them, the more serious their encroachments. The inevitable end is that your valuables are used up2 2 . and your [whole] state taken over; even with Yao on your left and Shun on your right you would not be able to avoid [such an end], if you follow this road. So one who, without the methods of the sages, serves in fear, putting his sole3 3 Read with CHy for , here a contamination from the in the next line. Hsün-tz? has . Wang Nien-sun defines as . reliance on glib speech and obsequious conduct will not be able to hold his state or keep his own person intact. Hence the enlightened ruler does not follow this way. It is necessary to reform ritual (li) to regulate the court, to rectify the laws to regulate the officials, and to stabilize the government to regulate the lower classes. Only 216 after that is the rhythm of li and i adjusted in the court, are rules and regulations rectified among the officials, and loyalty and honesty, love and gain stabilized among the lower classes. He would not practice one unjust thing, or put to death one innocent man to get the empire, and so those in his vicinity contest for his affection, while those far away desire to go to him. Superiors and inferiors are of one mind; the three armies make common effort. When his renown in sufficient to consume [his opponents] and his power sufficient to bring them under his control, he bows and grasps his signal flag, and not one of the tyrannical states but makes haste to send envoys, like infants turning to their mother. Why is this? It is because jên is put into practice,4 4 For CHy, B, C, D have "is made apparent." i is established, instruction is sincere, and love deep. Truly, as the Ode says,5 5 Shih 559 No. 263/6. The king's plans were true and sincere, And the country of Hsü submitted. 241 1 This is reproduced in Hsin hsü 4.12b. Wên-tz? 2.9a and Huai-nan tz? 10.2b-3a are to the same effect, but omit the anecdote of Hsiung Ch`ü-tz?. With one shout the brave officer puts to flight all the three armies: it is because of his sincerity.2 2 . Wên-tz? and Huai-nan tz? have for , and Chao (159) thinks that is correct: "it is because of the sincerity with which he utters [his cry]." Hsin hsü has .

When he looked down and realized it was a stone, [he then again shot it, but the arrow bounced off without leaving a 21715 mark.

"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be followed." That the Former Kings were able to attract to themselves as guests everyone in the world by bowing and grasping a signal flag8 8 Cf.

The Ode says,10 10 Shih 559 No. 263/6. The king's plans were true and sincere, And the country of Hsü submitted. 251 1 Huai-nan tz? 12.8b and Hsin hsü 4.4a-b are quite close to HSWC.

Before he had finished surrounding [the city], ten ch`ang of its walls fell down of their own accord. Hsiang-tz? beat the signal for retreat,4 4 : a gong was used to signal a retreat. 218 and [his forces] withdrew. An officer objected, "When Your Highness is punishing the crime of Chung-mou and their walls break down of themselves, it is Heaven aiding you. Why have you withdrawn [your forces]?" Hsiang-tz? said, "I have heard Shu-hsiang say that the superior man does not take advantage of another in distress,5 5 For CHy, B, C, D incorrectly have (Chou); likewise Hsin hsü and Huai-nan tz?, and TPYL, loc. cit.

[. . . .] Hsiang-tz? is meant by this."7 7 ? . As CHy remarks, the text is defective. There seem to be lacunae before and after , perhaps the usual formula ? ? . The Ode says,8 8 Shih 559 No. 263/6. The king's plans were true and sincere, And the country of Hsü submitted. 261 1 From Hsün-tz? 11.1b-3a. There are three methods of [acquiring] prestige. There is the prestige [derived] from the Way and virtue, there is the prestige from harsh supervision, and there is the prestige from demented wantonness. It is absolutely necessary to examine into these three [sources of] prestige. What do we mean by the prestige [derived] from the Way and virtue? Rites (li) and music are in order; distinctions and obligations (i) are clear; promotions and employment are seasonable; love and profit are impartial.2 2 . Hsün-tz? has , glossed by Yang Liang as "apparent" . Hao I-hsing quotes HSWC and says "What is is according to rule. Loving others and profiting others are both by rule and there is no favoritism or petty kindnesses. [Yang's] commentary is wrong in explaining as `apparent.' " ? ? . Under such circumstances as these, the people honor [the ruler] as emperor. 219 They love him as their parent, and fear him as [they do] spiritual beings. Truly, when rewards are not used and still the people are persuaded [to do good], when punishments are not applied, and yet [the ruler's] prestige is effective, his is the prestige [derived] from the Way and virtue. What do we mean by the prestige from harsh supervision? Rites (li) and music are not in order; distinctions and obligations are not clear; promotions and employment are not seasonable; love and profit are not impartial. But restrictions on wrong-doers are harsh, and the punishment of those who do not submit is invariable;3 3 Omit with CHy after Hsün-tz?. Chou would transfer after below; see note 4. penalties are numerous4 4 With CHy supply after as in Hsün-tz?, or read with Chou. and extensive; executions are cruel and inevitable. With a crash5 5 For read with CHy, who emends on the basis of "suddenly" in Hsün-tz?. "darkly" makes no sense. like thunder [people] are struck down, oppressed as by a [falling] wall. [Under such conditions, when]6 6 Hsün-tz? has . the people are under pressure they are afraid; when it is relaxed they are disrespectful toward their superiors. When seized by force, they assemble; when from afar they hear [of him], they scatter. If they are not pressed by punishments and force and stirred up by executions and death, [the ruler] has no way of keeping them under him. Such is the prestige from harsh supervision. What do we mean by the prestige from demented wantonness? No disposition for loving others, no undertakings to benefit others, and daily throwing into disorder the Way of man. When the people murmur, [the ruler] following them up, seizes and binds them, punishes and tortures them.7 7 is not clear. I have translated from Hsün-tz?: . (Chou, CHy.) He does not conform to human feelings and goes against Heaven's principles. Under these conditions flood and drought are unseasonable; the yearly grain crops do not ripen. The people on the one hand suffer distress from the troubles of harsh [government] and disorder, and on the other hand are in straits in the matters of food and clothing. They are 220 anxious and grieved, with no way of making complaint. Forming cliques, they run off and are estranged from their superiors. Overthrow and destruction can be expected at any moment: such is the prestige from demented wantonness. Now the prestige [derived] from the Way and virtue culminates in numbers and strength; the prestige from harsh supervision culminates in danger and weakness; and the prestige from demented wantonness culminates in destruction. Now though the term "prestige" is the same [in all these cases], the good or bad results are far apart. Hence it is absolutely necessary to examine into them. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 564 No. 265/1. Compassionate Heaven9 9 For Mao shih has . (CHy.) is arrayed in angry terrors; Heaven is indeed sending down ruin, Afflicting us with famine, So that the people are all wandering fugitives. 271 1 SY 8.13b-14a and Hsin hsü 1.8b-9a differ between themselves and from HSWC enough that it is unlikely Liu Hsiang has used HSWC for the immediate source of either. See notes 2 and 3. Duke P`ing of Chin2 2 . SY writes Chao Chien-tz?. (Chou, CHy.) was happily drifting along the River and said, "Where am I to get worthy gentlemen to enjoy this with me?" His boatman Ho Hsü3 3 . Hsin hsü has Ku Sang; SY Ku Ch`êng. These are probably only graphic and phonetic variants of the same name; cf. Chao 163. knelt and replied, "It is simply because Your Highness does not care for [worthy] gentlemen [that he has none]. Now pearls from river and ocean, and jade from the K`un mountains, come to you without having feet, because of Your Highness' liking for them.4 4 For CHy, D have . They are interchangeable (Chou); cf. Mencius 183 (2A/1.8): , and Legge's note. If [worthy] gentlemen, possessed of feet, do not come, it means nothing else than that Your Highness 221 does not care for gentlemen. Do not worry about there being no gentlemen." Duke P`ing said, "As for the guests I support, to the left of the gate there are a thousand men, and to the right of the gate [another] thousand. If in the morning there is not enough for their support, in the evening I give them the market revenues; if in the evening there is not enough for their support, in the morning I give them the market revenues. Can it be said of me that I do not care for gentlemen?" Ho Hsü replied, "Now the heron in going a thousand li at a single flight relies on only six quills. As for the feathers on his back and the down under his belly, should you add a handful he would not fly any higher, and should you take away a handful he would not fly any lower. Now these two thousand men Your Highness is supporting to the right and to the left of his gate— are there really six quills among them? Or are they all feathers on the back and down under the belly?" The Ode says,5 5 Shih 331 No. 195/3. The counselors are very many, But on that account nothing is accomplished.6 6 For read with Chih-yao 8,26b. (CHy.) Shih-k`ao gives for the Han shih reading. Chih-yao adds "This refers to the above." (Chao 164.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">222 CHAPTER VII 11 1 SY 19.16a-b is nearly identical, but lacks the quotation from the Shih. King Hsüan of Ch`i said to T`ien Kuo, "I have heard that Confucians mourn three years for their parents, [and three years for a ruler].2 2 . Read with SY. (Chou.) Now which is the more important, a father or a ruler?" [T`ien Kuo] replied, "Without a ruler's lands there is no place to settle one's parents; without a ruler's pay there is no means of supporting one's parents; without rank [conferred] by a ruler there is no way of making one's parents respected and illustrious. What is received from the ruler is passed on to the parents. So serving a ruler is also something always done on behalf of one's parents."3 3 . I follow the reading in Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 57.22a, which has after . (CHy.) King Hsüan was taken aback and had nothing to answer him. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 248 No. 162/3. The king's business is not to be slackly performed, And I have no leisure to nourish my father. 21 1 SY 12.1b-2a tells the same story rather more clearly, but is probably based on the HSWC, which text is defective. The King of Chao was [on the point of] sending an envoy to Ch`u. He played [for a while] on the cither, and then dispatched him saying, "Be careful not to forget the words [of my message]."2 2 . Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 55.3b quotes this as "You must speak my very words"; likewise SY, but without . Chih-yao 8.25a-b combines the two lines. Chao (165-6) admits this is repetitious, but maintains that stylistically it is a better reading. TPYL 576.4b-5a is the same as the modern text of HSWC. (Chao.) The envoy received the order kneeling and said without rising, 223 "Never have I heard Your Majesty play such moving [music] on the cither as today." The king said, "[It is true. The cither is certainly well] tuned."3 3 . Read with Chih-yao, loc cit. Likewise TPYL, loc. cit., with for and at the end. SY has "The tones kung and shang are certainly well tuned." (Chao.) The envoy said, "Since it is in tune, it would be a good thing to make a note of [the position of] the bridge." The king said, "It will not do. As the weather is dry or wet, so the strings are loose or tight. The bridge [must] be adjustable,4 4 . SY is more logical: "The tones kung and shang are [produced] in different positions." and cannot be marked [for a given position]." The envoy said, "May I borrow a metaphor from this?5 5 Chih-yao, TPYL, and Li Shan's com. all have before . (Chao.) SY adds here "When the enlightened prince sends an envoy, he charges him with [the execution of] a mission; he does not hold him to definite words. If [the envoy] finds them well off, he congratulates them; if they have suffered misfortune, he offers condolences." ? . Ch`u is more than a thousand li distant from Chao. Furthermore fortune is variable. Bad luck calls for condolences, and good luck for congratulation. It is like the bridge [of a cither] which must be adjustable and cannot be marked [for a given position]. So when a ruler sends an envoy, he should hold him to the mission he is sent on and not charge him with [specific] words."6 6 For read with Chih-yao: ? "When the enlightened prince sends an envoy, he is always careful about the man he employs for the mission. Once he has sent him off, he charges him with an idea [to be communicated], but does not hold him to [specific] words." (Chao.) Literally, refers to the mission rather than to the man, but it comes to the same thing, whether you pick the mission for a given man or the man for a specific mission. The Ode says,7 7 is from Shih 545 No. 260/7. SY quotes , a variant of Mao , Shih 249 No. 163/1. The next line is the same in both poems. That HSWC originally quoted the same line as SY is apparent both from the Mao shih number sequence (162-163-168) and from the quotation in Shih k`ao 39a. I surmise that the variant reading in HSWC led an inept editor to emend to the Mao shih reading, with the result that he chose the wrong poem. Kuo yü 10.3a also has . (Chao 167.) 224 Many are the messengers, Ever anxious lest they should not succeed. It is lamenting that subordinates are controlled from above. 31 1 Han shu 45.6a-7a relates the anecdote with some similarity in wording. This is the only passage in HSWC dealing with events taking place in Han times. In Ch`i were [two] retired gentlemen, Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih.2 2 Han shu introduces them thus: "Formerly T`ien Jung, Prince of Ch`i, resenting Hsiang Yü, plotted to raise troops and rebel against him. He forced the gentlemen of Ch`i to join him on pain of death. Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih, recluses of Ch`i, were within his power and were forced to follow him. When T`ien Jung's cause was lost, the two were ashamed [of having taken part in the rebellion] and retired together into the depths of the mountains, where they dwelt in seclusion." At the time when Minister of State Ts`ao was minister of Ch`i, a retainer said to Master K`uei,3 3 : surely the same person as K`uai T`ung? *g`i?wed; *K`wed. "Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih are the worthy men of the times. They have secreted themselves in the depths of the mountains and will not bend their bodies or degrade their wills to seek office. I hear that you have access to Minister of State Ts`ao. I wish you might recommend them. Now in my village the matrons are on good terms with one another.4 4 . Han shu is less concise: "There was a girl of my village who was on good terms with the village matrons." A girl was suspected of stealing meat, and her mother-in-law drove her out. Indignant, the girl told a village matron, who said, `Go slowly,5 5 Yen Shih-ku glosses with . and presently I will have your mother-in-law call you [back],' and tying up a bunch of grass, she [went to] ask for a light from the family that had driven the girl out. She said, `My dogs were fighting over a piece of meat and killed each other. May I have a light so that I can cook6 6 Yen Shih-ku says means . them?' Whereupon the mother-in-law immediately sent a man after the girl she had driven out to bring her back. Now a village matron is not a gentleman skilled in speech, nor is tying up a bunch of grass and asking for a light the way to bring a woman back home, but there are things that touch off the proper 225 response and situations which can be properly dealt with. Will you not recommend them?" Master K`uei said, "I am afraid I can not come up to it, but I will try my best to tie up a bunch of grass and ask for a light on behalf of Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih." After this he had an interview with Minister of State Ts`ao and said, "In my village there was a woman who married [again] three days after her husband's death. There was another who all her life long never [re-]married. Now if you were going to marry, which [kind of woman] would you take for a wife?" The Minister of State said, "Of course I would marry only the one who to the end of her life would never [re-]marry." Master K`uei said, "In Ch`i are the retired gentlemen, Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih. They are the worthy gentlemen of the times, secreting themselves in the depths of the mountains and not bending their bodies or degrading their wills to seek office. If Your Honor in choosing a wife would want to marry one who would not [re-]marry, are you going to make an exception in choosing a minister by not taking one who will not serve [another master]?" Whereupon Minister of State Ts`ao through the good offices of Master K`uei sent a "comfort chariot" with rolls of silk to fetch Master Tung-kuo and Master Liang Shih and treated them as guests of honor. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 264 No. 168/5. Let us but see the superior man8 8 : Legge arbitrarily translates "our husbands." And our hearts will be at rest. 41 1 Huai-nan tz? 13.3b-4a is nearly identical. Confucius said, "Of old, when he served King Wên, the Duke of Chou had nothing arbitrary about his conduct and nothing self-willed about the affairs he managed. It was as though his body could not bear [the weight of] his clothes, or his mouth could not utter words, [so difFIDent he was]. When he respectfully 226 received anything direct from [King Wên], he was cautious as though [he feared] he would drop it. It can be said that he was [able to act like] a son.2 2 . Insert before with Huai-nan tz? to parallel and below. (Chao 167.) When King Wu died, King Ch`êng being young, the Duke of Chou took over the work of [Kings] Wên and Wu. He occupied the place of the Son of Heaven3 3 Cf. HSWC 3/31, note 2, with for . and controlled the government of the empire,4 4 I follow Chao (168) and read as in Huai-nan tz? for . took measures against the disturbances among the barbarians and punished [the Princes of] Kuan and Ts`ai for their crimes.5 5 For and cf. Mém. hist. 1.245-6. Holding King Ch`êng in his arms, he received homage from the feudal lords. Concerning punishments and rewards, laws and judgments, he never consulted [the young king]. His prestige shook Heaven and Earth, his gestures terrified the empire. It can be said that he was able to be martial. When King Ch`êng gained his majority, the Duke of Chou turned the rule over to him, and, facing north, served him. He asked permission before acting and never had the air of boasting. It can be said that he was able to be a subject.6 6 Supply before ; see note 2. (Chao.) Truly one capable of three transformations in his own person is able to adapt himself to changing times." The Ode says,7 7 Shih 385 No. 214/4. This number is out of sequence; possibly it represents a Han shih divergency from the Mao shih order of poems. When he carries it out to the left, to the left, The superior man performs it as it should be done. When he carries it out to the right, to the right,8 8 is certainly a misprint. CHy, B, C have as in Mao shih. The superior man is [complete] master of it.9 9 I have disregarded Legge's translation; cf. I-shuo k`ao 24a. 5 There is a saying: "Birds fear birds with fine wings and curved beaks;1 1 For read with CHy and TPYL 464.4b. (Chao 168.) fish fear fish with large mouths and pendant fat;2 2 . The expression occurs in Lun hêng 7.14a: "The rulers Chieh and Chou had fat on their bellies hanging down for over a foot." It seems to imply a voracious appetite. men 227 fear men with sharp mouths3 3 : cf. Analects 326 (17/18): "I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families." and facile speech."4 4 For TPYL, loc cit., has "clever talkers." (Chao.) For this reason the superior man avoids the three points: he avoids the brush-point of the literary man; he avoids the spear-point of the military man; he avoids the tongue-point of the sophist. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 296 No. 183/3. If my friends would take care, Would slanderous speeches be made? 61 1 This is a development of Hsün-tz? 20. 5b-6a. SY 17.11b-13b follows HSWC with some variants from Hsün-tz?; Chia yü 5.11a-13a is partly from Hsün-tz? and partly from Shih chi 47.19a-20b (Mém. hist. 5.364-70). Confucius [and his disciples] were in distress between Ch`ên and Ts`ai.2 2 He was on his way to Ch`u at the invitation of King Chao. The Great Officers of Ch`ên and Ts`ai realized that it would be dangerous for their states if a sage were to be used in Ch`u, and so sent troops to block Confucius' passage. (Chia yü.) Cf. Analects 237 (11/2.1). They spent seven days without food sitting on the "Three Classics mat."3 3 . Read with SY for . I am unable to find another reference to the san ching hsi. They had li soup but no rice,4 4 Cf. LSCC 17.9b: ? . and the disciples had a hungry look. They read the Shu and practiced rites (li) and music without stopping.5 5 SY has before but omits . Chao (169) would add to balance , but if the "three classics mat" has any connection with this sentence, the emendation would require the omission of with SY, and the balance remains uneven. Tz?-lu offered an objection: "Heaven rewards with good fortune those who practice good and requites with disaster6 6 Read for with CHy, SY, and Hsün-tz?. those who practice evil. Now you, Master, have long accumulated virtue, piled up jên, and practiced good. I suppose there is still some defect in your conduct?7 7 After supply with CHy, following Li Shan's quotation (Wên hsüan 45.1a, 54.18b), likewise SY. (Chao.) B, C have , which makes no sense. For cf. Li Shan's com., loc. cit.: "conduct which should be discarded." Otherwise why do you live in obscurity?"8 8 Yang Liang defines as "straitened circumstances." 228 Confucius said, "Come, Yu. You are a mean man, without any understanding of principles. Be still while I tell you. Do you think that the wise are never punished? Then how was it the Prince Pi-kan had his heart cut out and died? Do you think the just are [always] hearkened to? Then how was it Wu Tz?-hsü had his eyes torn out and hung from the eastern gate of [the capital of] Wu?9 9 This event took place in B.C. 483, while Confucius is supposed to be speaking in B.C. 489 (according to Ss?-ma Ch`ien; cf. Chavannes' note, loc. cit.). Do you think the scrupulous are [always] employed? Then how was it Po-i and Shu-ch`i starved on Mt. Shou-yang? Do you think the sincere are [always] employed? Then how was it that Pao Shu was not employed, or that Tz?-kao, Duke of Shê, never took office?10 10 Both these men held office. Pao Shu was tutor to the kung-tz? Hsiao-po (cf. Tso chuan 82), while Shên Chu-liang held simultaneously the two positions of ling-yin and ss?-ma (cf. Tso chuan 848); nor had he yet died at the supposed time of this speech. This is noted by Shên Yü in Ch`un-shu tsa-i (Chao 170). SY more accurately reads "prominent" for . Pao Chiao embraced a tree and wept; [Chieh] Tz?-t`ui climbed a hill and was burned to death. Many superior men of wide learning and subtle plans have not met with the right time; I am certainly not the only exception. A man's ability depends on natural endowment; his success or failure is a matter of opportunity.11 11 The reading "fate" for appears to be an unsupported emendation by CHy. Now without opportunity, what use is there for a man of worth? That Shun of Yü was set up as Son of Heaven from having plowed a field on the north slope of Mt. Li was due to his meeting Yao. That Fu Yüeh was made a Great Officer from having carried dirt and worked with building frames12 12 Cf. Mencius 446 (6B/15.1). was due to his meeting Wu-ting. Originally I-yin was a servant in the Hsin family, carrying the tripods, holding the sacrificial stand, and blending the five flavors.13 13 I. e., he was a cook. For his discourse on the five flavors, cf. LSCC 14.5a. That he was set up as minister was due to his meeting T`ang. When Lü Wang was fifty he sold food in Chi-chin, and at seventy he 229 was a butcher in Ch`ao-ko; at ninety he was Teacher to the Son of Heaven—this because he met King Wên. Kuan I-wu was bound and kept with sealed-up eyes in a barred cart.14 14 For SY has . HSWC is defective. (CHy.) Chao quotes LSCC 34.3b: . "Whereupon [the Duke of Lu] had his hands bound with thongs and his eyes sealed; they enclosed him in a leather sack and put him in a cart." Cf. Mencius, loc. cit. That he became Chung-fu was because he met Duke Huan of Ch`i. Po-li Hsi sold himself for five rams' skins to the Po family of Ch`in and herded cattle. That he was raised to the rank of Great Officer was because he met Duke Mu of Ch`in. That Yü-ch`iu [was famous] in the empire15 15 Supply after as in SY (Chou, CHy). Ch`én Ch`iao-ts`ung suggests that this is the same person as the Prime Minister Shên in HSWC 2/4, since SY, LNC 2.8b and Hsin hsü 1.2b all mention . (I-shuo k`ao 8.4a-b.) for yielding his position as Prime Minister to Sun-shu Ao was because he met King Chuang of Ch`u. Wu Tz?-hsü at first had considerable merit. Later on he was put to death by decapitation. It was not because his understanding had decreased, but because he first met Ho-lü and later met Fu-ch`ai. Now that a thoroughbred horse is put to work on the salt carts16 16 Cf. Chia I's "Lament for Ch`ü Yüan" (Shih chi 84.9b): "The thoroughbred lets his two ears hang; he is hitched to a salt cart." is not because he has not the appearance [of a thououghbred], but because no one recognizes him as such. If a thoroughbred horse does not get his Po-lo, how can he achieve a thousand-li run, and how could Tsao-fu in his turn manage to drive a thousand-li? If there is no one to see the lan-ch`ih plant growing in a dense forest in the depths of the mountains, it will not be the less fragrant.17 17 : "if there is no one to see it, it will not be fragrant." Supply before on the basis of Hsün-tz?, KTCY and SY. (CHy.) So the purpose of study is not to achieve success, but [to enable one] to be in straits and not be distressed, and to keep the determination from failing in times of difficulty. First understand the beginnings of disaster and good fortune, and your mind will be without illusions. For this reason the sages lived in retirement and reflected profoundly; they were unique in their apprehension and insight.18 18 : cf. Lun hêng 26.1a: ? ? ? "Saints are possessed of the enlightenment that comes from unique insight and of the understanding that comes from unique apprehension." Now Shun was certainly a sage and 230 a saint, but that he faced south and ruled the empire was solely due to his meeting with Yao. If Shun had lived in the times of Chou or Chieh, he would have been well off to escape punishment or execution; there would have been no question of his holding office. Chieh put Kuan Lung-fêng to death, and Chou put the Prince Pi-kan to death. On those occasions did Kuan Lung-fêng lack understanding? Did the Prince Pi-kan lack wisdom? In both cases it was a matter of not meeting with the right time. So the superior man devotes himself to study. He rectifies himself and orders his conduct, waiting for the right time. May you not be confused about this." The Ode says,19 19 Shih 297 No. 184/2. The crane cries in the ninth pool of the marsh, And her voice is heard in the sky. 7 Tsêng-tz? said, "When they are gone, there is no recalling them—such are our parents.1 1 Cf. HSWC 9/3, where this statement is attributed to Kao Yü. When they have reached their limit there is no adding to them—such are the years [of their lives]. This is why,2 2 is redundant here; it occurs again below before . though the filial son may wish to go on supporting them, his parents can not tarry [forever];3 3 HSWC 9/3 is the same, but omits . and though a tree may wish [to remain] straight, the seasons do not give it a chance.4 4 . Logically this phrase should precede the one above as in HSWC 9/3 with . It is in terms of this line that I have translated and . The passage may be corrupt, but sense can be forced out of it. Thus to slaughter an ox as a sacrifice at their grave is not so good as bringing chickens and pigs to parents while they are still alive. That is why I was only too glad to serve as an officer in Ch`i with a salary of only a chung5 5 For read ; cf. HSWC 3/20, note 4. and a fu [of grain]; not because I thought it much, but I was happy that I could get it to my parents. After their death I once went south to Ch`u, where I got an honorable position, with a hall nine jên high that 231 had projecting beams three wei in circumference.6 6 CHy has for , likewise Lei-chü 21.9a and Po-t`ieh 8.63b. (Chao 172.) Cf. Mencius 496 (7B/34.2): "Halls several times eight cubits high, with beams projecting several cubits." I had a hundred carts bringing me gifts, but still I looked to the north and wept. Not that I thought [my treatment] too mean, but I was grieved that I could not get it to my parents.7 7 Cf. Chuang-tz? 7.16b (Legge, Texts of Taoism 2.145): "Tsêng-tz? twice took office, and on the two occasions his state of mind was different. He said, `While my parents were alive I took office, and though my emolument was only three fu of grain, my mind was happy. Afterwards when I took office, my emolument was three thousand chung; but I could not share it with my parents, and my mind was sad.' " So one whose family is poor and whose parents are old is not particular about the office he will fill.8 8 Cf. HSWC 1/1. One who, for the sake of his ambition, stints his parents is not filial." The Ode says,9 9 Shih 299 No. 185/3. Our mothers have to do all the labor of cooking.10 10 Mao shih has for . 81 1 Hsin hsü 1.5b-6a is a somewhat modified version of this passage, furnishing a better reading in several places. Shih chi 43.11b (Mém. hist. 5.36-7) has the story in an abridged form. Chavannes, ibid., translates also the HSWC version. Chao Chien-tz? had a minister named Chou Shê, who stood outside his gate for three days and three nights. Chien-tz? sent a messanger to ask, "On what business do you wish an interview?" Chou Shê replied, "I would like to be your outspoken minister.2 2 For Chih-yao 8.25b has , and P`ei Yin's quotation in Shih chi, loc cit., writes . Chao (173) shows that they are interchangeable. With inked brush3 3 . TPYL 603.1a has "holding a brush." (CHy.) and tablet in hand I would follow after [Your Highness, looking out for] your faults and [writing them down,4 4 .

(Chao.) 232 so that] each day there will be a record, each month an achievement, and each year good results."5 5 Hsin hsü inserts "Chien-tz? was pleased." Where Chien-tz? stayed, [Chou Shê] stayed there with him, and when [Chien-tz?] went out, he went out with him. After a little while Chou Shê died, and Chien-tz? mourned for him as if he had been his own son. Later he was drinking with the Great Officers in the Hung-po Terrace. When he was drunk on the wine, Chien-tz? began to weep, and the Great Officers all went out6 6 Hsin hsü has for . saying, "We are at fault without knowing ourselves [wherein we have offended]." Chien-tz? said, "You Great Officers are not at fault.7 7 Chou would emend to "on the contrary," as in Hsin hsü. My friend8 8 Read for with CHy, Hsin hsü, and Chih-yao. (Chao.) Chou Shê used to say, `A thousand sheepskins are not worth the fur under one fox's forelegs, and the servile assent of the multitude is not worth the outspoken works of one gentleman.'9 9 This proverbial expression occurs also in Shih chi 68.6b. (Chavannes.) Of old Chou of the Shang was lost through silence, while King Wu prospered through frankness [on the part of their ministers]. Now after Chou Shê's death I never hear of my faults, and it will not be long before I am lost. This is why I wept." 91 1 Similar passages occur in YTCC 3.11b-12a, HFT 13.7a-b, and SY 7.18b-19b. HSWC is most clearly related to YTCC, in that Yen-tz? and Duke Ching are the speakers, but HSWC is more concise, possibly because the text is defective. HFT reverses the order of the two parables and attributes the dialogue to Kuan Chung and Duke Huan of Ch`i. SY seems to be based on HFT, in that Kuan Chung and Duke Huan appear, while the arrangement of incidents is the same as YTCC. Tradition has it that2 2 is lacking in the other versions. Duke Ching of Ch`i asked Yen-tz? about the worries of governing a state.3 3 Emend to as in all the other versions; cf. below. (Chou.) Yen-tz? replied, "What one worries about are `altar rats.' " Duke Ching said, "What do you mean by altar rats?" Yen-tz? said, "Altar rats steal things outside and then go 23316 inside the altar for protection.4 4 The other versions here insert "The altar is made of wood fastened together and plastered over with mud." You would drown them out, but you fear damaging the [mud] wall. You would burn them out, but you fear setting the wood on fire. This is the worry of rats. Now as to Your Highness' officers, outside they sell you for profit,5 5 HFT is clearer: . and inside they depend on Your Highness not to punish them for throwing the laws into disorder.6 6 . HFT has "If you fail to punish these officials, the laws are thrown into confusion. If you do punish them, then you are not at ease. Relying on this they exist." SY and YTCC are similar, and HSWC may be defective. Your Highness moreover both protects and supports them.7 7 is probably a corruption of SY, YTCC: "They rely on his protection to exist." This is the worry of altar rats." Duke Ching said, "Alas! How can this be?"8 8 The interruption by the Duke is lacking in the other versions. What follows should be prefaced with . "A man sold wine of very fine quality, and put out a long advertisement, but the wine soured before he had sold any. He asked the villagers why [they had not bought his wine], and one of them said, `Your dog is very fierce, and every time anyone comes with a container wanting [to buy wine], the dog comes out and bites him.' This is why the wine had soured before he had sold any. If, when a gentleman wishes to communicate with the ruler of [a state of] ten thousand chariots, the functionaries come out and bite him, they too are the bad9 9 There is no need to emend to "fierce" with Chao (174) to agree with the other versions. dogs of a state. Officers that are `altar rats' and functionaries that are `bad dogs'— these are the great worries of a state." The Ode says,10 10 Shih 316 No. 192/4. Look into the middle of the forest; There are [only] large faggots and small branches in it. It says that those in the court are all mean men. 234 101 1 This is expanded from HFT 14.2b. Huai-nan tz? 12.7b is nearly identical with HSWC, and SY 1.24b-25b follows HSWC with some changes; both quote the line from Lao-tz?, but lack the quotation from the Shih. Of old the Ss?-ch`êng2 2 was used for in the state of Sung to avoid the taboo personal name of Duke Wu. Tz?-han was minister to [the ruler of] Sung.3 3 Chou identifies with Yo Hsi , T. Tz?-han, and concludes that the story is apocryphal, as no mention is made of it in Tso chuan. CHy denies that they were the same person, but it is unlikely that two men with the same appellation would hold the same office in the same state (cf. Tso chuan 439). He said to the Prince of Sung, "Now the peace of a state and the governance of its people depend on the conduct of the ruler. Titles and rewards4 4 . CHy emends to on the basis of HFT: , and Huai-nan tz?: . Chou proposes the same changes. SY has . (Chao 175.) are what people like. May Your Highness take charge of them. Executions and punishments are what the people hate. Let me be responsible for them." The Prince said, "Agreed. I will get their approval and you will receive their hatred. I am convinced that I will not be the laughing-stock of the feudal lords." When the people of the state knew that the punishments of death and decapitation were entirely in the hands of Tz?-han, the great ministers were friendly with him and the common people feared him. Before the year was out, Tz?-han had driven out the Prince of Sung and taken over the government himself. Just as Lao-tz? says,5 5 Waley, The Way and Its Power 187. It is best to leave the fish down in his pool; Best to leave the State's sharpest weapons where none can see them. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 323 No. 193/5. But why does he call us to action, Without coming and consulting with us? 235 111 1 Modified from LSCC 11.6b-7a. Hsin hsü 8.5a reproduces LSCC as far as the moralizing passage at the end. In the time of Duke I of Wei there was a minister named Hung Yin,2 2 . For CHy writes . B, C have . D has , likewise Hsin hsü and LSCC. Kao Yu's com. on LSCC says is to be read as . who received the order to go on a mission [to another state]. Before his return, the Ti barbarians attacked Wei.3 3 Cf. Tso chuan 129 (Min 2). Duke I wished to raise an army to meet them, but his people with one accord said, "What Your Highness values and what have [high] salaries and rank are cranes. What you love are your concubines. Go have your cranes and concubines fight. How can we fight?" And they all scattered and fled. The Ti barbarians arrived and attacked Duke I at Jung-tsê.4 4 For CHy, B, C, D have . They killed him and completely ate the flesh [of his body], leaving only his liver. When Hung Yin got there, he reported on his mission to the liver. When he had finished speaking, he cried out to Heaven and wept. When his mourning was over, he said, "As minister all I may properly do is die." And he then actually cut himself open and, pulling out his intestines, put Duke I's liver inside and died. When Duke Huan heard of this he said, "Wei was destroyed because it had not the proper Way. But with a minister like this, it cannot but be preserved." Whereupon he re-established Wei in Ch`u-ch`iu. One like Hung Yin can be called a loyal officer. He killed himself so as to follow his prince, and not only did he succeed in following his prince, he also caused the ancestral temple of Wei to be re-established and kept the sacrifices from being broken off. He can be said to have had great merit. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 324-5 No. 193/8. In other quarters there is ease, And I dwell here alone and sorrowful. Everybody is going into retirement, And I alone dare not seek rest. 236 121 1 Lieh-tz? 8.5a-b and Huai-nan tz? 12.12a are close to HSWC. Wên-tz? 4.18a is related to Huai-nan tz?, but attributes the saying to Lao-tz?, omitting the old man of Hu-ch`iu and Sun-shu Ao. Hsün-tz? 20.22b-23a differs considerably, and Hao I-hsing believes that it was not the immediate source for any of the other texts. Sun-shu Ao met an old man of Hu-ch`iu who said, "I have heard that as there are three advantages there must be three worries. Do you know about this?" Sun-shu Ao uneasily changed countenance and said, "I am not intelligent; how could I know about it? I venture to ask what is meant by the three advantages and by the three worries?" The old man of Hu-ch`iu said, "If your rank is high, others will envy you. If your office is a big one, your ruler will dislike you. If your salary is large, resentment will be your lot. This is the meaning." Sun-shu Ao said, "Not necessarily. The higher the rank the more humble the ambitions; the greater the office the smaller the desire; the larger the salary the more widespread the gifts— would this not permit one to escape the three worries?" The old man of Hu-ch`iu said, "Well said! Even Yao and Shun would not have found fault with such conduct."2 2 Cf. Analects 194 (7/28.1), 292 (14/45). The Ode says,3 3 Shih 335 No. 196/6. We must be mild, and humble, As if we were perched on trees. We must be anxious and careful, As if we were on the brink of a valley. 131 1 SY 1.13b-14b follows this closely. Confucius said, "There are three things the enlightened ruler fears: The first is that occupying a position of honor he fears he will not hear of his faults; the second is that being successful he fears he will be overconFIDent; the third is that hearing of the Supreme Way [for governing] the empire he will be unable to put it into practice." 237 Of old King Kou-chien of Yüeh fought with and greatly defeated Wu, and conquered the southern I. At that time, as he sat facing south with three ministers near at hand and five in distant places, he issued the following command to the Great Officers: "Those hearing of [my] faults who fail to tell me, will suffer capital punishment." This is an example of one's occupying a position of honor and fearing he will not hear of his faults. Of old Duke Wên of Chin fought with and overwhelmingly conquered Ch`u, burning their camp2 2 Chou defines as "grain," here meaning supplies. SY has and Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.7a-b) thinks is a corruption of this, since there is no textual support for Chou's definition. "to encamp" occurs frequently in Tso chuan. (Chao 177.) so that the fire lasted three days. Duke Wên drew back with an expression of anxiety, and his attendants asked, "Your Highness has overwhelmingly conquered Ch`u, and [now] you have an expression of anxiety. Why is this?" Duke Wên said, "I have heard that only a Saint can rest secure after victory in battle, while those who conquer through deceit are without exception in a perilous situation. This is why I am anxious." This is an example of one who has been successful and who fears being overconFIDent. Of old Duke Huan of Ch`i got [as ministers] Kuan Chung and Hsi P`êng3 3 CHy would supply from SY: ? ? ? "They used the language of debate and elucidated their meanings. In the audience of the first month he had them accompany the T`ai-lao and he presented them to his ancestors. Duke Huan stood facing west, Kuan chung and Hsi P`êng stood facing east." Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao) would also add these lines. and sat facing south. Duke Huan said, "Since getting you two, my sight is the keener and my hearing the sharper. I dare not act alone." And he introduced them to his ancestors. This is an example of one hearing of the Supreme Way and being afraid he will be unable to put it into practice. Viewed in the light of Duke Huan, [Duke] Wên of Chin, and King Kou-chien of Yüeh, these three fears are the concern of the enlightened prince. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 335 No. 196/6. We must be mild, and humble, As if we were perched on trees. 238 We must be anxious and careful, As if we were on the brink of a valley. We must be apprehensive and cautious, As if we were treading upon thin ice.5 5 With B, C, omit the line , which belongs to Shih 333 No. 195/6 (Chou, Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung). This speaks of the great king6 6 For read with CHy, B, C. Chou suggests "the enlightened ruler," but fails to support the emendation, which yields excellent sense. who occupies a position above other men. 141 1 SY 6.8a-b retells the story with some changes in detail. King Chuang of Ch`u gave a drinking party to his ministers. By evening they were tipsy, while the attendants were all drunk. The lamp in the hall went out and someone tugged at the clothing of the queen, who, [reaching out in the dark], brushed the person's cap tassel and broke it off. She called out to the king, "Just now when the lights went out someone tugged at my clothing, and I brushed against his [cap] tassel and broke it off. I wish you would quickly make a light to see who has a broken tassel." The king said, "Stop!" He immediately issued the order, "I will not be pleased with those drinking with me who have not broken tassels."2 2 SY prefaces this remark with "When you have made a gentleman drunk by giving him wine so that he neglects propriety (li), how can you be willing to put him to shame to show off the decorous behavior of a woman?" . As a result there were no unbroken cap tassels, and it was not known who had his cap tassel broken by the queen. After that the king went on as before, pleasantly drinking with his ministers. Later Wu3 3 SY says it was Chin. raised an army and attacked Ch`u. There was one man constantly in the van.4 4 For read as in SY (Chou). Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 855) says was also written , whence for . (Chao 177.) In five encounters5 5 : B, C have . he five times overthrew their ranks and put the enemy to flight. Then he took 239 the leader of the main force [prisoner] and presented him. The king was astonished and asked, "I have never distinguished you [particularly]; how is it you are so generous to me?" He replied, "I was the one in the hall with the broken tassel. For a long time6 6 Emend to . (Chou.) I have deserved to have liver and gall smeared on the earth for [what I did] that day. There has never been an occasion for fulfilling [my obligation] until today when I was fortunate enough to be employed as befits a subject and could then defeat Wu and strengthen Ch`u for Your Majesty." The Ode says,7 7 Shih 337-8 No. 197/4. Deep looks the pool, And abundantly grow the rushes8 8 Chao (178) thinks "a cup" must be incorrect, even though Shih k`ao 16b gives it as the Han shih reading. occurs in Shuo wên as ?k k For this character, see the table on p. 358. , of which is an easily explained corruption. and reeds [about it]. It says the great are not without their marks [of greatness]. 15 Tradition tells us that Po-ch`i was filial and yet was abandoned by his parents. Duke Yin was king, and yet was slain by his younger brother. Shu-wu was a sage, and yet was killed by his elder brother. Pi-kan was loyal, and yet was put to death by his prince. The Ode says,1 1 Shih 340 No. 198/1. Indeed I have commited no offense. 161 1 Hsin shu 10.73b-74a is almost identical and may either have been the direct source for HSWC or have been derived from a common source. SY 8.7b-8b copies Hsin shu. TTLC 3.13b-14a is also similar. When [the tyrant] Chou killed the prince Pi-kan,2 2 Supply after and as in Hsin shu. (Chao 178.) Chi-tz? let his hair down his back and feigned madness. When Duke Ling of Ch`ên killed Hsieh Yeh,2 2 Supply after and as in Hsin shu. (Chao 178.) Têng Yüan left Ch`ên with his family. 240 After these events, Yin was conquered by Chou, and Ch`ên was destroyed by Ch`u, because they had killed Pi-kan and Hsieh Yeh, and had lost Chi-tz? and Têng Yüan. King Chao of Yen got Kuo Wei; Tsou Yen and Yo I came from Wei and Ch`i. Thereupon he raised an army and attacked Ch`i, detaining King Min in Chü.3 3 The text is corrupt: . Chou has added from SY; the other editions lack these characters. He also suggests that is a mistake for , as SY has , where he thinks should be . CHy writes ? , etc., from Lu Pien's quotation of HSWC in his com. on TTLC and from Hsin shu, which has . If the reading is admitted, and it occurs in three of the texts, ? ? ? must ? ? ? , and not "brought them over." Since Tsou Yen actually came from Ch`i, and Yo I from Wei (cf. Mém. hist. 4. 145), I follow CHy and read for . In territory and population Yen4 4 . CHy has , as TTLC, for . Lu Pien says is like . Chao (179) accepts CHy's reading, and suggests that Hsin shu is a corruption from the seal forms of the two characters. Chou would emend to as in SY. was no match for Ch`i. But what enabled Yen to expand to this extent was reliance on gentlemen. Truly,5 5 The following, to "T`ai-kung knew it" is repeated in 5/19. It occurs verbatim in all the parallels mentioned in note 1. there is no state always static, nor a people [always] ready to be ruled. If it gets a sage, [the state] will be prosperous; if it loses a sage, it will perish: from antiquity to the present time this has been always the case. Now a bright mirror is the means of reflecting the form, and the past is the means of knowing the present. For to know enough to detest that whereby ancient [dynasties] fell, but not to follow the methods by which they preserved themselves, is no different from seeking to catch up with the man ahead of you by walking backwards. T`ai-kung knew it and so gave office to the successors of Wei-tz? and built a mound over the tomb of Pi-kan. Now when saintly men act in so generous a manner toward even the descendants of sages, how much the more [generous] they must be toward [sages] still living in their time. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 340 No. 198/1. [The terrors of] great Heaven are very excessive, But indeed I have committed no offense. 241 171 1 Hsin hsü 5.12b is based on this, but on the whole is more intelligible. SY 11.7a-b applies the same idea to another setting: "Prince Mêng-ch`ang sent a retainer to the King of Ch`i. When after three years he was not made use of, the retainer returned and said to Prince Mêng-ch`ang, `I do not know whether it was my fault or yours that for three years after you sent me I was not made use of?' " Prince Mêng-ch`ang said, "I have heard that the thread follows the needle in, not that the tightness [of the stitch] comes from the needle; and that a marriage is achieved through a go-between, but not that intimacy is established through the go-between. It must be that your ability is inconsiderable; why blame me?' The retainer said, `Not so. I have heard that Ku, belonging to the Chou family, and Lu, belonging to the Han family, were the fastest dogs in the world. If you sighted a rabbit, pointed him out, and set [one of them] on him, that rabbit never escaped. But if you sighted [the rabbit] from afar and then let the dog go after him, he would not be able to catch the rabbit in a hundred years. It is not that the dog lacked ability; it is the fault of the one who set [the dog on the rabbit].' " Sung Yü through a friend was introduced to King Hsiang of Ch`u, who treated him with no special distinction. He complained to his friend, who said,2 2 Supply before from Lei-chü 89.5b, TPYL 977.?a and Hsin hsü. (Chao 179.) "Ginger and cinnamon grow from the earth, but their acrid flavor does not come from the earth. A woman marries through a go-between, but she does not establish intimacy [with her husband] through a go-between. You simply did not serve the king satisfactorily. Why blame me?" Sung Yü said, "Not so. Of old Ch`i had a trained rabbit which in the course of a day could run five hundred li. If you sight him from afar, point him out, and set [a dog on him],3 3 in the sense of , the SY and Hsin hsü reading. (Chou.) even a good dog will be unable to reach the dust of the trained rabbit. If you put [the dog] on the trail4 4 makes no sense; read with Hsin hsü. and take off the leash, [not even the trained rabbit will be able to get away. Now your connection with me— has it been a matter of putting me on the trail and taking off the leash?]5 5 . This is supplied from Hsin hsü as necessary to the sense of the passage. (CHy.) Or has it been sighting from afar, pointing him out, and setting me on him?" 242 The Ode says,6 6 Shih 350 No. 201/2. In your time of rest and pleasure, You have cast me off like an abandoned thing. 181 1 CKT 4.17a, SY 8.15b-16a, Hsin hsü 2.5b-6a are all similar, but with slight verbal identity. SY is closest to HSWC. Sung Yen had been minister of Ch`i and, on his dismissal, returned home and summoned the Mên-wei Ch`ên Jao2 2 Li Shan's quotation from this passage in his com. on Wên hsüan 28.27b has for ; likewise SY. The two names are interchangeable, and he is probably to be identified with the T`ien Jao in HSWC 2/23. CKT has , and Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 686) thinks is a graphic error for . (Chao 180.) and others to the number of twenty-six men. He said, "Are there any of you Great Officers who would be able to make the rounds of the feudal lords with me?" Ch`ên Jao and the others all prostrated themselves without answering. Sung Yen said, "Alas, how easy it is to get gentlemen and Great Officers, and how difficult to get any use from them!" Jao said, "[It is not that they are easy to get and hard to get any use from;] it is because you are unable to make use of them. To be dissatisfied [because you are unable to make use of them]3 3 . . . Only the phrase between brackets is in present texts of HSWC; the remainder is added from Chih-yao 8.26b-27a. SY has . (Chao 180-1.) is missing it in yourself and putting the blame on others." Sung Yen said, "Missing it in myself and putting the blame on others—how it that?" Ch`ên Jao said, "The three tou4 4 Chih-yao has Shêng for ; likewise SY. (Chao.) of millet [which you give them for salary] is not enough for a gentleman, but your geese and ducks have grain to spare. This is Your Excellency's first fault. The women of the inner palace pick up the pears and chestnuts of your orchards and throw them at one another, while your officers never get a taste. This is Your Excellency's second fault. Thin silk and white silk, open-work silk and gauze silk are 243 abundant in a hall where wind and rain5 5 Emend to after SY. come and spoil them, while your officers never receive a [single] piece as a gift.

CHy.) treating them like leaden swords and trying to use them as Kan-chiang blades7 7 Product of a famous swordsmith; cf. HSWC 3/36 note 8. —is it not indeed a difficult thing?" Sung Yen's face was suffused with shame and he retired in confusion from the mat saying, "It was my fault." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 355 No. 203/5. If we present them with spirits, They do not look on them as liquor. 19 There is a saying, "One good at government acts in accord with human emotion and human nature and follows the sequence of yin and yang; he understands the principle of basic and subsidiary and brings together the spheres of Heaven and man." Under such conditions the Heavenly breadth is nourished, and living things are abundant. One who does not understand government lets emotions override human nature, and allows yin to surpass yang. He makes the subsidiary go against the basic and causes man to cheat Heaven. His breath being exhausted cannot be prolonged; he is depressed and cannot give vent to his feelings. Under such conditions disasters occur and monstrosities appear. All living things suffer and the year's grain crops do not ripen. Thus it is that if he acts, his power is vitiated, and if he remains quiet, he loses [any chance of] succor. Hence he devotes himself to what is not pressing, not recognizing what is urgent. He daily offends against right principles, and still he hopes in that way to govern. 244 The Ode says,1 1 Shih 358 No. 204/4. Of their degenerating into ravening thieves, I know not the evil cause. 201 1 HFT 12.7b gives the same story in different words. SY 6.18a-b writes Yang Hu for , but otherwise is closer to HSWC. In the time of Marquis Wên of Wei, Tz?-chih was in office and got into trouble. After leaving he traveled north, where he said to [Chao] Chien-chu,2 2 CHy points out that Chien-tz? was not a contemporary of Marquis Wên of Wei. "From now on I will not again plant virtue in anyone." Chien-chu said, "What do you mean by that?" [Tz?-]chih said, "Of the officers in the hall I planted the half; of the Great Officers in the court I planted the half; of the officials on the frontier I likewise planted the half. Now the officers in the hall [got me hated by my prince; the Great Officers in the court] threatened me with the law,3 3 . CHy follows TPYL 632.4b and writes , , emending to . Lei-chü 86.1a has ? . Chou would add , from SY. (Chao.) I follow CHy. and the officials on the frontier attacked me with troops; this is why I will not again4 4 Supply from TPYL and Lei-chü. (CHy.) plant virtue in men." Chien-chu said, "Ha, what you say is wrong. If you plant peach and pear trees in the spring, in summer you will have shade beneath them and in autumn you will be able to eat their fruit. If you plant caltrop in the spring, in summer you will not be able to gather its leaves, and in autumn you get thorns from it. If you look at it this way, it depends on what you plant. Now those you planted were not the right men. Truly, the superior man first makes a selection before he plants the seed." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 363 No. 206/2. Do not push forward a waggon; The dust will only blind you. 245 211 1 Two anecdotes are related here, and in B, C, D they are separated into two paragraphs. The first is paralleled by Li chi 10.3b (Couvreur 1.227-8). The second appears in a different form in Hsin shu 10.73a-b, Hsin hsü 1.2b-3a, TTLC 3.13a-b, and Chia yü 5.24b-25a. These four texts are closely related, but none shows any direct connection with HSWC. The correct and upright act in accordance with the True Way and speak in accordance with right principles. They are just and unselfish, not relaxing their determination for the sake of peace or altering2 2 Emend to with TPYL 429.6a, Shu-ch`ao 37.2b. (Chao 183.) their conduct to escape danger. Of old Duke Hsien of Wei fled his country. [Later] he returned to Wei and had reached the suburbs of the capital, where he was about to distribute fiefs before entering the city to those who had accompanied him [into exile]. The T`ai-shih Liu Chuang said, "If everyone had [stayed behind] to look after the altars to earth and grain, then who would there have been to serve you in your exile?3 3 Lit., "hold halter and bridle and follow you." And if everyone had followed you, then who would have looked after the altars to earth and grain? Is it right that Your Highness should be partial on being restored to your state?" Whereupon [Duke Hsien] did not distribute [fiefs]. Liu Chuang was correct. Of old when the Recorder Yü,4 4 Cf. Analects 296 (15/6.1): "The Master said, `Truly straight-forward was the historiographer Yü. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow.' " a Great Officer of Wei, was sick and on the point of death, he said to his son, "I have frequently spoken of Ch`ü Po-yü's5 5 Ibid: "A superior man indeed is Chü Po-yü! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, and keep them in his breast." worth without being able to get him advanced, and of the unworthiness of Mi Tz?-hsia without being able to get him retired. Now if during his life a minister is unable to advance the worthy and retire the unworthy, it is not fitting that mourning should be conducted for him in the main hall after his death. It is enough to bury me in a [secondary]6 6 Supply before as in Li Hsien's quotation in Hou-Han shu 109A.8a (Chao). Hsin shu, Hsin hsü and TTLC have . hall." 246 When the Prince of Wei [came to offer condolences]7 7 Supply from the other versions (except Chia-yü, which has ). (Chou.) and asked why [the burial had been so conducted], the son reported his father's words. The prince quickly summoned Ch`ü Po-yü and granted him honors, and retired Mi Tz?-hsia. Before he left he had the [place of] burial moved to the main hall with full rites. To remonstrate in person during life and to remonstrate through the corpse in death—[such conduct] may be termed upright. The Ode says,8 8 Shih 366 No. 207/5. Quietly fulfill the duties of your offices, Loving the correct and upright. 221 1 This is modified from Hsün-tz? 20.23a-b. SY 2.17a-b varies considerably, while Chia-yü 5.23a follows Hsün-tz?. CCFL 16.2a-b belongs with HSWC 3/26, but one line is repeated here; see note 4. Confucius was at leisure, with Tz?-king sitting by his side. [Tz?-kung] asked the way to be below others.2 2 I. e., be humble. Confucius said, "An excellent question! Being below others—is it not like the earth?" Tz?-kung did not understand. Confucius said, "As for the earth, if you dig it you get a spring of sweet water; if you plant it you get the five cereals. Plants grow in it; birds and beasts, fish and turtles live out their lives on it.3 3 Cf. HSWC 3/26, note 4. Alive we stand on it, and dead we are put into it. It has numerous merits but it does not speak of them,4 4 Cf. CCFL 16.2b: . (Wang Yin-chih.) but hands them on to [successive] generations5 5 is unusual. One would expect . without intermission. Hence I said, Only the earth is capable of being lowly." Tz?-kung said, "Though I am not intelligent, I hope to act on these words." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 371 No. 209/4. The connection is not immediately apparent. We have performed every ceremony without error. 247 231 1 SY 17.15b-16a copies this with slight changes. There is a story about Nan Chia-tz?'s visit to Ch`êng Pên[-tz?],2 2 Supply from SY. (CHy.) who boiled a li fish for him. Nan Chia-tz? said, "I have heard that the superior man does not eat li fish." Pên-tz? said, "This is a superior man's food, all right; but what has that to do with us?" Chia-tz? said, "By aiming at what is high, one enlarges his virtue; by aiming at what is low, one hampers his conduct. By aiming at what is good one is brought forward a step, and by aiming at what is bad one falls back to the starting point. And does not the Ode say,3 3 Shih 393 No. 218/5. The high hall is looked up to; The great road is easy to be traveled on. How could I be aiming to be a superior man? It is only that I admire him in my mind." 241 1 SY 2.5a-b differs considerably; it is followed closely by Chia-yü 3.13a-b. Tz?-kung asked about great ministers. The Master said, "Ch`i had Pao Shu and Chêng had Tz?-p`i." Tz?-kung said, "Did not Ch`i have Kuan Chung and Chêng have Tz?-ch`an of Tung-li?" Confucius said, "[Kuan Chung was recommended by Pao Shu, and Tz?-]ch`an was recommended [by Tz?-p`i]."2 2 . Supply ? . (CHy.) SY has ? "I have heard that Pao Shu got advancement for Kuan Chung and that Tz?-p`i got advancement for Tz?-ch`an. I have not heard that Kuan Chung or Tz?-ch`an got advancement for anyone." Chou deals with the passage less drastically by emending to : "Who recommended them?" Tz?-kung said, "In that case it is more worthy to recommend a sage than to be a sage." "To recognize a sage is to be wise, to advance a sage is to be jên, to introduce a sage is to be i. Who is greater than one possessed of these three qualities?" 248 251 1 HSWC 9/15 is similar and is followed by SY 15.8a-9b and Chia-yü 2.1a-2a. The idea is a development of Analects 182-3 (5/35) and 246-9 (11/25). Confucius was wandering on top of Mt. Ching.2 2 : HSWC 9/15 has , SY and Chia-yü . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 586) is probably right in making *niông a phonetic variant of *nông, but he is certainly off the mark when he tries to dispose of *kliang in the same way. I suspect the latter may be a graphic corruption of the seal form of . Tz?-lu, Tz?-kung, and Yen Yüan accompanied him. Confucius said, "The superior man, when he climbs to a height, must express himself.3 3 usually means "to compose or recite verse"; cf. Tso chuan 6 (Yin 1) and passim. However, the word is understood to be cognate with "to spread out" (cf. Suzuki Torao, Fushi daiyó? 1-3), and here is to be taken in that sense. In Mao's com. on Shih 82 No. 50/2 (*Mao shih 3.5b) is given as one of the qualifications of a Great Officer. My little children, speak out your desires, whatever they may be. I am going to instruct you." Tz?-lu said, "I wish I might brandish a long lance and oppose the three armies, with a nursing tiger4 4 is not "a suckling tiger," but "a tiger with young." behind me and my enemies in front. Like a li insect I would leap, like a dragon I would rush5 5 For TPYL 436.8a-b has "seizing and stamping I will gratify my ambition." (Chao 184.) as I advanced to rescue two states from grief." Confucius said, "A brave soldier!" Tz?-kung said, "Say two countries are involved in trouble. Stout men form ranks, and the dust [of battle] rises to heaven. Then I, without grasping a weapon [so much as] a foot long or [possessing a single] measure of grain, will smooth away the trouble between the two states. The one that employs me will be preserved, and the one that does not employ me will be lost." Confucius said, "A sophist!" Yen Hui had no wish. Confucius said, "Why don't you make a wish?" Yen Yüan said, "Since the other two have [expressed] their wishes, I dare not." Confucius said, "Their ideas were not the same, and each invented a situation [to illustrate his ambition]. May you make a wish. I am going to instruct you." 24917 Yen Yüan said, "I wish I might be minister in a small state. The ruler would govern by the True Way, and his subjects would be reformed by his transforming virtue. Prince and subjects would be of one mind, and those inside and those outside [the court] would respond to one another. Of the various states and the feudal lords, none but would fall in line with i and be subject to [my] influence. The able-bodied would rush to come forward, and the old would come leaning on their staves. My teachings would take effect among the people and my transforming virtue would pass to the four barbarians. Everyone would give up his weapons and assemble inside the four gates [of my capital]. In the world everywhere enduring peace would prevail. Flying or crawling,6 6 Cf. *Kuei-ku tz? B.11b, . each [creature] would rejoice in his own nature. I would advance the worthy and employ the able, each to be in charge of the office suited to himself. Then the prince above would be tranquil and his subjects below would be in harmony. I would let [my robes] fall, fold my hands,7 7 : cf. Shu ching 316 (5/3.10): "[King Wu] had only to let his robes fall down, and fold his hands, and the empire was orderly ruled." and practice noninterference. What was done would coincide with the True Way, naturally and easily adhering to li.8 8 : cf. DM 413 (20/18), "He naturally and easily embodies the right way." Also cf. Li Ki 2.519 (30/9): . Those who spoke of jên and i I would reward, and those who spoke of war and strife I would put to death. So what occasion would Yu have for `advancing and rescuing'? What difficulties would T`z? have to smooth away?" Confucius said, "A saint! When a great man appears, mean men hide away, and when a saint arises, sages fall prostrate. In a government with Hui, how would you, Yu and Tz`?, have a chance to show your abilities?" The Ode says,9 9 Shih 406 No. 223/7. The snow may have fallen abundantly,10 10 Read for ; cf. Shih k`ao 45a. But when it feels the sun's heat,11 11 For read as in *Shih wên 2.35a. Note that Mao shih has for . it dissolves. 250 261 1 KTT 1.23b-24a is similar. The motif of a lute player's passions revealed in his music turns up again in an anecdote about Ts`ai Yung (Hou-Han shu 60.28a-b ). He had been invited to a dinner, but on approaching his host's house heard music that made him fear assassination. The player had been watching the attempt of a mantis to seize a cicada, and his emotions colored the music which he continued to play on his lute. Of old Confucius was playing the cither. Tsêng-tz? and Tz?-kung were listening beside the door. When the piece was finished Tsêng-tz? said, "Ah, the sound of the Master's cither had something in it of the desire of a ravenous wolf, of depraved actions. How lacking it was in human feeling (jên)! It was avaricious to a degree." Tz?-kung thought the same, and went inside without replying. Confucius saw as he came in that he had the appearance of one who objects to a transgression and the bearing of one going to raise a difficulty. He laid aside the cither and waited for him [to speak]. Tz?-kung reported Tsêng-tz?'s words, and the Master said, "Ah, Ts`ên is the sage of the empire. He is an adept at `understanding music.'2 2 For cf. HSWC 9/5. Just now as I was playing the cither a rat came out [of his hole] and ran about. A wildcat appeared in the room and, creeping along a pillar, approached [the rat], who took flight. His eyes [filled with] hatred and his back arched, [the wildcat] strove to catch him, but failed. With the cither I followed the current of their passions.3 3 For "sounds" read with B, C. Was it not with perfect justice Ts`ên thought I was a ravenous wolf and depraved?" The Ode says,4 4 Shih 417 No. 229/5. Their drums and bells are beaten in the palace, And their sound is heard without. 27 To practice the art of being a father, one must embrace a tender and benevolent (jên) love with which to rear a son. One 251 quiets him with food and drink, so that his body may be perfect. When he begins to have understanding, [the father] must maintain a stern demeanor and speak correctly to lead him forward. When it is time to tie up his hair,1 1 At puberty; cf. TTLC 3.8b ; Chou Lu-pien's com: . [the father] provides him with an intelligent teacher to perfect his abilities. At nineteen he shows his ambitions, and [his father] invites a guest to cap him.2 2 For the capping ceremony cf. I li, ch. 1 (). This serves to complete his virtue.3 3 might be taken to mean "fix his mind," but I prefer to follow Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.2b), who suggests emending to and quotes *I li 1.11b: "Bannissez vos idées de jeune homme; suivez les inspirations d'une vertu parfaite." (Couvreur 19.) Chêng Hsüan's com: "Having been capped is termed `completed virtue.' " (Chao 185-6.) His blood is pure and his pulse steady, and so [his father] betroths him so as to keep it that way. The relations [between father and son] are characterized by honesty and friendliness, with no trace of suspicion. After the son is capped, [his father] does not curse4 4 For read with TPYL 432.1a. (Chao.) him, nor does he beat him after his hair is bound up. He listens to [his son's] subtle reproach and does not let him worry. Such is the art of being a father. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 352 No. 202/4. Oh my father, who begat me! Oh my mother, who nourished me! Ye indulged me, ye fed me, Ye held me up, ye supported me. Ye looked after me, ye never left me, Out and in ye bore me in your arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">252 CHAPTER VIII 11 1 SY 12. 11b-12a retells the story with different actors and ends by quoting Shih 493 No. 252/7 instead of Analects; perhaps the Shih quotation should be supplied here. King Kou-chien of Yüeh sent Lien Chi2 2 . SY has Chu Fa . Kuo yü 19.1b mentions a Chu Chi-ying , who according to Wei Chao, was a Great Officer of Yüeh. Han shu 20.32a (Ku-chin jên-piao ) has , and Wang Hsien-ch`ien (Han-shu pu-chu 20.80b) quotes a commentary saying that should be . Shih chi 41.3b (Mém. hist. 4.425) mentions the Great Officer [of Yüeh] Chê Chi . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 392), who lists these variants, says that the confusion of and and is due to the similarity of the characters. As and are not found elsewhere, he takes the correct name to be . Chao (187) agrees. to make a present of some citizens3 3 For SY has "a plum branch." Chao (187-8) quotes with approval the not very convincing reasons for emending to advanced by Wang Shao-lan (in ) and Mo T`ien-i (in ). Both Shu-ch`ao 40.5a and TPYL 779.2a write . to the King of Ching. The King of Ching's emmisary said, "Yüeh is a barbarian state. I would like to impose on their envoy." The King of Ching said, "Both the King of Yüeh and his envoy are sages. You had better be careful." The emissary went out to see Lien Chi and said, "If you wear an official cap, you will be granted a ceremonial4 4 For read with SY and Shu-ch`ao. (Chao.) interview, but if you do not wear a cap, you will not get an interview." Lien Chi said, "Now [the ruling family of] Yüeh also received their fief from the House of Chou. Not finding a place among the Great States5 5 For SY has "the provinces of Chi or Yen" (not , as CHy states). they dwelt beside the Chiang and the ocean, with yüan-chan and yü-pieh6 6 . This pair of binoms occurs (with variants) in several Han and preHan texts (cf. TT 757). That something more than the aquatic animals usually so called is intended here is evident from the parallel SY passage: ? "Whereupon we made our homes on the coasts of the sea and dwelt in retirement on the outer frontiers. Further the chiao and the dragon fought with us there. For that reason we cut off our hair and tattooed our bodies, making bright patterns, to resemble the dragon's children, that we might avoid the water spirits." Here the chiao and the dragon () take the place of the yüan-chan and the yü-pieh, which also were probably forms of water spirits. for companions. They tattooed their 253 bodies and cut off their hair, and their descendants lived there.7 7 Cf. Shih chi 41.1a (Mém. hist. 4.419). Now when I am come to your state you insist on saying that I will be granted an interview if I wear an official cap and not otherwise. By the same token, if your country sends someone to Yüeh, he will have to cut off his nose and submit to branding, tattoo his body and cut off his hair before he will be granted a ceremonial4 interview. Do you approve?" When the King of Ching heard what he had said, he put on [court] dress and came out to thank him [for his present]. Confucius said,8 8 Analects 271 (13/20.1). "He who, when sent to any quarter, will not disgrace his prince's commission deserves to be called an officer." 2 The reason we love riches and honor, ease and fame, the which others praise us for, is for our bodies. It is also for the sake of our bodies that we hate poverty and meanness, danger and shame, the which others despise us for. But of our bodies, what is most valuable? Nothing is more valuable than ch`i.1 1 "[vital] breath." When a man gets ch`i he lives; when he loses it he dies. His ch`i is not gold or silk, pearls or jade, and it cannot be sought from others. It is not painted cloth or the five cereals, and it cannot be got by purchase. It exists solely in our own bodies. One cannot but be careful. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 543 No. 260/4. Intelligent he is and wise. In protecting his body. 254 31 1 This is expanded from Chuang-tz? 9.23b-24a (Legge, SBE 40.155-7), the additions serving to point a moral the opposite of that intended in the Chuang-tz?. CKCS 2.8a-b is based on Chuang-tz?. The people of Wu attacked Ch`u and King Chao left the country. There was a sheep butcher of the country [named] Yüeh,2 2 Lu Tê-ming gives both yüeh and shuo () as readings of . who followed him in his exile. When King Chao returned to his state, he rewarded those who had followed him. When it came Yüeh's turn he refused [a reward], saying, "When His Highness lost his state, what I lost was my butchery. When he came back to his state, I also came back to my butchery. My income is adequate;3 3 Chao (188) would emend to after Chuang-tz?: "I have got back my income." what need is there for a reward?" He refused to obey the command. When the prince insisted, Yüeh said, "That he lost his state was not my fault, so I have not prostrated myself for punishment. That he came back to his state was not my merit, so I may not receive any reward for it. When the army from Wu entered Ying, I was afraid of the invaders and fled from harm. What part could I possibly have had in his returning?" The prince said, "Since he will not accept [a reward], grant him an audience." Yüeh sent back word, "By the laws of the state of Ch`u, if a merchant wants an audience with the prince, he must have a large present or valuable goods to offer4 4 : Chuang-tz? fits the argument better: "a rich reward for great accomplishments." before he is granted the interview. Now my knowledge is inadequate to preserving the state, my sense of duty (i) unequal to dying for my prince, and my courage not enough to make me face an invader. To grant me an audience in spite of this would be going against the laws of the state." He persisted in not accepting the command and retired to the Chien [River]. King Chao said to the Ss?-ma Tz?-ch`i,5 5 Chuang-tz? has for . "Here is a man who 255 is living in most straitened circumstances, and whose discourse is extremely exalted. Seek him out for me. I desire to make him my sworn brother and would like to make him a san-kung." The Ss?-ma Tz?-ch`i, after leaving his carriage, went on foot five days and five nights to seek him. On finding him he said, "Not to rescue the state when it is in danger is to fail in jên. Not to obey the prince's commands is to fail in loyalty.6 6 This phrase occurs in HSWC 2/21, with for . On the one hand to hate riches and honor, and on the other to be satisfied with poverty and discomfort, seems to me excessive. Now our Prince desires to make you his sworn brother and would like to make you a san-kung. What are you to do if you refuse to obey your prince?" Yüeh said, "I know that the position of san-kung is more honorable than a butcher shop,7 7 : lit., "a knife and table shop." and that an income of ten thousand chung is more than one makes from slaughtering sheep. But I have not heard that one should see [only] the benefits of rank and salary and forget what conduct is proper (i) in matters of refusing and accepting." In the end he refused the position of san-kung and returned to his sheep butchery. On hearing of this the superior man says, "Extreme indeed was the conduct of his honor this butcher! Limiting himself and clinging to poverty, he [continued to] live in another man's state."8 8 Without fulfilling his duty by taking office. Yüeh said, "What do you mean poverty? Having refused it on grounds of li, I [have the right to] live out my life in his state." "To live in seclusion and fail to help when [the state is] in a precarious situation, to see King Chao's virtue decline in the face of Wu, and to find fault with one's state while `cherishing one's jewel,' and withdrawing oneself with the sole desire of self-perfection—this is to be generous toward oneself but miserly toward one's prince. Being overcautious, he is not one to save the world." "What is he like, one who may be called a savior of the world?" "One like the Chief of Shên or Chung Shan-fu can be called a savior of the world. Of old when the virtue of Chou greatly declined and the True Way had been lost under [King] Li, the 256 Chief of Shên and Chung Shan-fu assisted King Hsüan. They regulated a time of confusion and restored things to their proper condition.9 9 Cf. Kung-yang chuan 12.9b. The empire was to a certain extent put into order, and the ancestral temples again flourished. The Chief of Shên and Chung Shan-fu unified the empire and enforced obedience; they rectified the depraved and saved the lost. They gave out virtuous instruction and promoted neglected gentlemen. All within the seas united in responding to their influence. Hence the people spontaneously sang of King Hsüan's virtue. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 540 No. 259/7. Throughout the regions of Chou all rejoiced; You have got a good support. Another says,11 11 Shih 543 No. 260/4. In the States, the princes, be the good or bad, Are clearly distinguished by Chung Shan-fu. Intelligent is he and wise, Protecting his own person; Never idle, day or night, In the service of the One man. One like this can be called a savior of the world." 41 1 SY 4.13a-b tells this story in essentially the same words, but tempers the conclusion —which the Ss?-k`u editors (Ssu-k`u . . . ti-yao 16.11a) found objectionable—by quoting from Mencius instead of I ching; see notes 10, 12. When Ts`ui Chu of Ch`i assassinated Duke Chuang,2 2 Cf. HSWC 2/13. Ching K`uai-jui3 3 For SY has Hsing K`uai-wai . Ching and hsing are easily confused from their similarity of form, while *?i?wad and *ngwed are possible phonetic equivalents. Chu Ch`i-fêng's suggestion (TT 1850) that SY has confused this person with the Heir Apparent of Wei, K`uai-wai is possible, but in view of the frequency of variants in the writings of old names, hardly necessary. was on a mission to Chin. As he returned, [his driver said, "Ts`ui Chu has assassinated Duke Chuang. What shall you do?" 257 Ching K`uai-jui said, "Drive quickly. I am going to enter (the capital) and die so as to repay my prince."]4 4 ? ? . CHy adds this from SY. His driver said, "None of the neighboring feudal lords in every direction but has heard of the lack of principle on the part of our ruler. Is it not a difficult thing to expect you, Master, to die for him?" Ching K`uai-jui said, "Well said!5 5 . Yü Yüeh ( 2.10b) interprets as "you" in in this phrase. [But it comes too late.] Had you spoken earlier, I might have remonstrated. Then if he failed to make use of my remonstrance, I would have been able to leave. But now since I did not remonstrate and did not leave— as I have heard, `You eat his food and you die for his cause.' Since I have eaten the food of a bad prince,6 6 : a prince who is uncontrolled in his own actions and who gives his state the opposite of good government. how am I to get a good prince7 7 by contrast with : "a governing prince." to die for?" And making haste in his chariot he entered [the capital] and died.8 8 . Omit with CHy as in SY. (Chao 189.) It is probably an echo of the in the preceding line. The driver said, "If a man with a bad prince6 6 : a prince who is uncontrolled in his own actions and who gives his state the opposite of good government. must still die for him, can I, who had a good master,9 9 is intelligible from the parallel construction and its opposite above. do anything but die?" And tying the reins, he cut his throat in the chariot. On hearing of this the superior man says, "It can be said of Ching K`uai-jui that he preserved his virtue and died for his principles (i). The driver, however, had no reason to die. It was like encountering poison in eating or drinking.10 10 I. e., accidental death, with no moral implications; cf. HSWC 10/7. SY's "superior man" is more generous: "Although the death of the driver cannot be considered as coinciding with what was proper under the circumstances (i), still it shows the quality of the determined officer." . The Ode says,11 11 Shih 543 No. 260/4, likewise quoted by SY. Never idle, day or night, In the service of the One man. 258 This could be said of Master Ching. The I [ching] says,12 12 Yi King 126 (32/ ). SY here quotes from Mencius 262 (3B/1.2): "The brave officer never forgets that he may lose his head." `One who does not continuously maintain his virtue. There are those who will impute this to him as a disgrace.' This could be said of the driver." 51 1 D quotes SY 9.1a-b as parallel, but the connection is at best remote: ? ? "There are five ways of remonstrance. The first is straightforward remonstrance; the second is submissive remonstrance; the third is loyal remonstrance; the fourth is naïve remonstrance; the fifth is satirical remonstrance. Confucius said, `Am I one to practice satirical remonstrance?' " [In a minister], to be yielding and yet upright is best. To be exact is next. Last of all is to be carpingly critical. Utter weakness means death. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 544 No. 260/5. He does not devour the soft, Or eject the powerful. 61 1 This is almost identical in wording with Kung-yang chuan 3.12a-b (Chuang 12). Hsin hsü 8.1b gives a modified version. Wan of Sung fought with Duke Chuang and was captured by him.2 2 For this incident cf. Tso chuan 88 (Chuang 11), where Wan is called by name: Nan-kung Chuang-wan . Duke Chuang detained3 3 Ho Hsiu: means "to place" is "detained" . him in the palace. After several months he sent him back to Sung, where he again took up his position as Great Officer. Wan of Sung was playing with Duke Min at chess, and all the [palace] women were looking on. Wan said, "The Marquis of Lu is a very fine man. Such is his beauty that of all the feudal lords only he is fit to be a prince." Duke Min esteemed the women present and was made jealous by his remark. Turning he said, "You were a prisoner there; what do you know about the beauty of the Marquis of Lu?"4 4 CHy thinks HSWC has been arbitrarily changed from the more difficult reading in Kung-yang chuan: ? ? "He turned [to the court women] and said, `He was a prisoner.' [To Wan he said,] `[You say that] because you were his prisoner.' Of what account is the beauty of the Marquis of Lu?" Yü Yüeh (Chu-tz? p`ing-i 23.6b) is probably right in preferring the HSWC version, taking as an error for . (Chao 190.) 259 Wan of Sung was enraged and struck Duke Min, breaking his neck. Ch`ou Mu, hearing that the Prince had been assassinated, rushed to him and met [Wan] at the door. Grasping his sword he cursed him, and Wan hit him with the full force of his arm,5 5 : Ho Hsiu says, "[to strike with] the edge of the hand is called . Hsin hsü has for . Tso chuan 89 has "killed him with a slap of the hand." shattering his skull so that his teeth scattered (?) on the door sill. It may be said of Ch`ou Mu that he "did not fear the strong or the oppressive."6 6 Cf. Shih 544 No. 260/5. The Ode says,7 7 Ibid. But Chung Shan-fu Does not devour the soft, Or eject the powerful. 7 If a thing is approved by his prince but not approved by his father, the filial son will not do it. If it is approved by his father but not by his prince, the superior man likewise will not do it. Thus it is not proper to do violence to either one's prince or one's parents.1 1 Cf. Li Ki 1.463 (5/2.27) and Chia yü 10.11b. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 493 No. 252/5. O happy and courteous superior man, You are a pattern to the four quarters. 81 1 SY 18.11a-12a deviates considerably from HSWC. At the end it quotes stanza 9 (instead of 7) of Shih No. 252. When Huang-ti ascended the throne, he diffused grace, followed [the ordinances of] Heaven,2 2 After , TPYL 915.2a, in quoting this, adds , which appears to be redundant. It may have been a contamination from SY: . (Chao 190.) The TPYL citation is considerably abridged. unified the Way, rectified virtue, 260 practicing only what was jên, and the world was at peace. As yet the phoenix had not appeared, and he thought only of its signs. He went early to bed and rose early in the morning.3 3 Note the jingle: *g'ang, *b'i?eng, *gwang, *dzi?ang, *?i??ng. He summoned T`ien-lao and asked, "What are the signs of the phoenix?" T`ien-lao answered, "As to the signs of the phoenix, its front is like a swan and its back like a lin. It has a neck like a snake and a tail like a fish; it is marked like a dragon and has a body like a tortoise; it has the beak of a swallow and it pecks like a chicken.4 4 In addition to the SY parallel and the TPYL quotation cited above, minor variations and elaborations of this description occur in TPYL 79.3b-4a, Po-t`ieh 29.45a (both quoting HSWC) and Kuang ya 7B.38b (where Wang Nien-sun quotes many others in his commentary ). On its head it carries Virtue, on its back it bears jên; it embraces Sincerity, and under its wing it clasps i.5 5 Minor variants are to be found in the works named in note 4; cf. also Shan-hai ching 1.9a-b.

LSCC 13.2b-3a are put into motion. Its ch`i corresponds with seasonable rain. In eating it shows moderation; in drinking, deportment. It passes by, and civilization begins. It comes, and everything good is complete.7 7 TPYL 915.2b expands considerably: (for ?) ? , ? ? , "Where it goes there is culture, where it comes there is joy. When it wanders it always chooses its place. In hunger it does not forget those below. As for its cry, that of the male is `be moderate!'; that of the female, `enough, enough!' Its evening cry is `firm and constant'; its morning cry is `bring on the light'; its noon cry is `maintain order'; its cry on taking flight is `soar aloft'; its cry on perching is `bring back splendor.' " Likewise Kuang ya. (Chao 192.) Only the phoenix is able to spread the blessings of Heaven and respond to the bounty of Earth, arrange the five sounds and oversee the nine virtues.8 8 For the cf. Shu ching 70-1: "Kao-yao said, `Oh! there are in all nine virtues to be discovered in conduct...' Yü said, `What [are the nine virtues?]' Kao-yao said, `Affability combined with dignity; mildness combined with firmness; bluntness combined with respectfulness; aptness for government combined with reverence; docility combined with boldness; straightforwardness combined with gentleness; easiness combined with discrimination; vigour combined with sincerity; and valour combined with righteousness.' " When the empire has the 261 proper Way and has achieved one of the signs of the phoenix, then the phoenix passes through. When it achieves the second sign, it soars above. With the third, it alights there. With the forth, it descends all year around. With the fifth it lives all its life long in the state." Huang-ti said, "Alas, in truth how would I dare associate myself with [these signs]?" Whereupon he put on yellow robes and [wore a yellow girdle and]9 9 CHy adds from Ch`u-hsüeh chi 30.3a; likewise TPYL. yellow hat, and rigorously purified himself10 10 For cf. Li Ki 2.272 (31/1.2): "He purifies himself rigorously inside his apartments." inside the palace, and then phoenixes came [in flocks] covering the sun. Huang-ti descended the Eastern Steps and, facing west, repeatedly bowed, striking his head on the ground and said, "August Heaven sends down its blessing, and I dare not but accept its mandate." Thereupon the phoenixes stopped in the Emperor's eastern park,11 11 Read either with Chou after SY or with CHy, D. The latter reading occurs in TPYL and Ch`u-hsüeh chi. in B, C is a misprint.

The male and female phoenix fly about, Their wings rustling, While they settle in their proper resting place. 91 1 SY 12.5a-7a is a free retelling of this story; it includes an additional quotation from Shih No. 100/1. Marquis Wên of Wei had one son named Chi and a younger named Hsin.2 2 : B, C have Su. Though Hsin was the younger, he appointed him 262 successor,3 3 Supply after with CHy from Li Shan's quotation in his com. on Wên hsüan 51.14a; likewise TPYL 779.2b. (Chao 194.) and gave Chi the fief of Chung-shan, where for three years [he lived] without any intercourse [with his father]. His tutor Chao Ts`ang-t`ang4 4 Han shu 20.35a () lists a Chao Tsang-t`ang , whom Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 4.2b) takes to be the same person. (Chao 195.) [remonstrated] saying,5 5 Supply before with CHy from Li Shan's com. and TPYL. "Though a father forget his son, it is not proper for a son to forget his father. Why do you not send a messanger to him?" : TPYL has "Though I have never acted as an envoy, still . . ." (CHy.) Chi said, "I would like to, but there is no one to send." Ts`ang-t`ang said, "Let me go." When Chi agreed, he asked what the Prince liked and what he was fond of [eating]. [Chi] said, "He likes northern dogs, and is fond of morning geese."7 7 : SY and TPYL have for . (CHy.) I do not know what is the force of the . So he asked for a northern dog and a morning goose to take along as a present. When Ts`ang-t`ang got there he said, "The Prince of Chung-shan, your vassal on the north, having a northern dog and a morning goose, has charged Ts`ang-t`ang to present them, bowing repeatedly." Marquis Wên said, "Chi knows I like northern dogs and am fond of morning goose." And so he granted an audience to the envoy. Marquis Wên said, "Chi has nothing wrong with his health?" Ts`ang-t`ang stammered without replying. Thrice he asked and thrice he failed to answer. Marquis Wên said, "Why do you not answer me?" Ts`ang-t`ang said, "I have heard that feudal lords do not address one another by given names. Since you have granted him a insignificant fief, enabling him to become marquis of a small state, I dare not answer when you use his given name in asking about him." Marquis Wên said, "The Prince of Shung-shan has nothing wrong with his health?" 263 Ts`ang-t`ang said, "On this occasion when I came to offer his respects, he escorted me to the suburbs." Marquis Wên asked, "How tall is the Prince of Chung-shan [now]?"8 8 SY prefixes this question with "Marquis Wên turned and pointed to his attendants, saying . . ." Ts`ang-t`ang said, "When you ask about one feudal lord, it is in comparison with other feudal lords. In the court of a feudal lord, those who stand by his side are all subjects,9 9 Read after with CHy. Chou would emend to , giving essentially the same sense. and there is no one to compare him with. But he has almost grown out of the clothes and furs you gave him [when he went away]." Marquis Wên said, "Just what does the Prince of Chung-shan like?" He replied, "He likes the Odes." Marquis Wên said, "Which of the Odes does he like?" "He likes the shu-li10 10 Shih 110 No. 65. and the ch`ên-fêng."11 11 Shih 200 No. 132. Marquis Wên said, "How does the shu-li go?" "There was the millet with its drooping heads; There was the sacrificial millet coming into blade. Slowly I moved about, In my heart all agitated. Those who knew me Said I was sad at heart. Those who did not know me Said I was seeking for something. Oh distant and azure Heaven! By what man was this [brought about]?" Marquis Wên said, "Is he resentful?" "He would not dare be resentful. He is constantly thinking [of you]." Marquis Wên said, "How does the ch`ên-fêng go?" "Swift12 12 For read with CHy after Li Shan's com. and Shih k`ao 12a. The meaning is the same. flies the falcon To the thick-wooded forest in the north. 264 While I do not see the superior man, My heart cannot forget its grief. How is it, how is it, That he forgets me so very much?" Whereupon Marquis Wên was very glad and said, "If you want to know about your son, look to the mother, and if you want to know about a prince, look to his envoy. If the Prince of Chung-shan were not a sage, how could he have got a sage [to be his envoy]?"13 13 For TPYL has ". . . how could he cause his envoy to be a sage?" (CHy.) In the end he degraded the Heir Apparent Hsin and, summoning the Prince of Chung-shan, made him his successor. The Ode says,14 14 Shih 493 No. 252/7. The male and female phoenix fly about, Their wings rustling, While they settle in their proper resting place. Many are your admirable officers, O King, Ready to be employed by you, Loving you, the Son of Heaven. The superior man says, if an envoy is not upright, it is just a waste of horses and carriage [to send him on a mission]. He must [be able to] convey sincerity and transmit [his master's] will, making clear what is desirable and what is not, before he can be sent on a mission. 101 1 From the Fu-tz?, now lost. The text is lacking Ma Kuo-han's reconstruction, but is restored and translated by Haloun, op. cit., 485-6 as version B of Fu-tz? 1a-2b in Ma's text. SY 7.13a-b and Chia-yü 3.21a-b both follow version A of Fu-tz?, for which cf. Haloun, op. cit., 482-5. When Tz?-chien governed Shan-fu, the people adhered to him. Confucius said, "Tell me the means you employ in governing them." He replied, "At the proper seasons I open the public granaries, aid2 2 : Haloun takes it in the sense of "to give in charity." those in trouble, and help those who have not sufficient." Confucius said, "This merely brings over the common people.3 3 For read with Haloun; he ascribes to a T`ang taboo. It is not enough." 26518 "I reward the capable, summon those with great abilities, and retire the unworthy." Confucius said, "This merely brings over the upper classes. It is not enough." "There are three men I treat as one treats a father, five I treat as elder brothers, twelve I treat as friends, and one I treat as my teacher." Confucius said, "Treating the three men as fathers [is enough to teach filial pietly];4 4 . CHy has added this from SY and Chia yü, changing to to agree with the succeeding phrases. treating five as elder brothers is enough to teach fraternal feeling;5 5 Chou suggests before , an easier emendation than CHy's (see note 4). Haloun thus emends his Fu-tz? reconstruction. treating twelve men as friends is enough to do away with impediments to access to yourself; treating [even] one man as a teacher is sufficient guarantee that in plans you will not lack devices, and in undertakings you will not fall short of success.6 6 KTCY 1.4a(4) has the isolated line: "The Master said, `Yao and Shun purified and refined their persons that they might sit in judgment on the empire, and devoted themselves to attracting sages. Now the employment of sages is the origin of the hundred blessings and the most important thing in spiritual enlightenment.' " Chia-yü and SY are quite similar, and Chao (196) thinks it should be added. Alas, the place you govern is small.7 7 CHy interpolates from SY and Chia-yü; Haloun also adds it. If it were large, you might be classed together with Yao and Shun." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 489 No. 251/1. The happy and courteous sovereign Is the parent of the people. Tz?-chien resembles him. 11 By measuring the land and making plans [for the people] to live in it [the ruler] establishes his state. By magnifying his bounty and widening profit he cherishes the masses. By making [the distinction between] good and evil clear he rectifies the laws. He leads the people to devote their energies to agriculture. . . .1 1 There is a lacuna here in the text. (Chou.) 266 [By establishing] educational institutions2 2 : cf. Mencius 242 (3A/3.10): "Establish hsiang, hsü, hsüch, and hsiao, [—all those educational institutions,—] for the instruction of [the people]. The name hsiang indicates nourishing [as its object]; hsiao indicates teaching; and hsü indicates archery. By the Hsia dynasty the name hsiao was used; by the Yin, that of hsü; and by the Chou, that of hsiang. As to the hsüeh, they belonged to the three dynasties [and by that name]. The object of all is to illustrate the human relations." he instructs the people. By serving the old and nourishing the orphaned he transforms the people. By promoting the worthy and rewarding the meritorious he encourages [people] to do good. By punishing the wicked and dismissing the negligent he makes evil hateful. By encouraging the practice of driving and archery he guards against trouble. By forbidding treachery and putting a stop to depravity he gets rid of harm. By receiving the worthy and meeting friends he spreads knowledge. By granting honors to his relatives and bringing together those near to him he increases his strength. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 489 No. 251/1. The happy and courteous sovereign. 121 1 This anecdote occurs in a different form in Hsin shu 7.8b-9a (Ch`ü-Chia-wên ho-pien ed. . The Ming ed. reproduced in the SPTK is here defective, one folio having been omited. The numeration of the remaining folios is consecutive, however, and the first two characters on 7.25a have been altered to to connect with the foregoing section). Duke Ching of Ch`i sent an envoy to Ch`u. The King of Ch`u climbed the Nine-storied Tower with him and turning to the envoy said, "Has Ch`i2 2 Chih-yao 8.29a has "also" before . (Chao 196.) such a tower as this?" The envoy said, "My prince has a throne room3 3 Read for with Chih-yao. (Chao 197.) with three tiers of earthen steps. The grass thatch is untrimmed, the unpainted rafters4 4 : Chih-yao has . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 665) notes the variants , , and , all of which he refers to an original . Probably he is correct and "rafters" is an adequate rendering of . are not finished, and still he feared those who built it would be overworked and he who dwells in it [to much] 267 exalted. How could my prince have a tower such as this?"5 5 Supply from Chih-yao. (Chao.) Whereupon the King of Ch`u was ill at ease. Of the envoy it can be said that "he did not disgrace his prince's commission,"6 6 Analects 271 (13/20.1). but was able to answer on his own initiative. 131 1 This paragraph appears to be very disconnected. If the first sentence is to be in any way illustrative of the generalization in the second, the phrase should be taken in apposition with : "You, who are a descendant of the line of the Duke of Shao." Not only is this grammatically indefensible, but there is no justification to be derived from the numerous Shu ching passages dealing with investitures (Shu ching 366, 383, 489, 534, 573, 578, 582), which on the other hand do tend to give the antecedents of the person addressed by the king. The HSWC text may be defective, especially as the expected Shih quotation is lacking for this paragraph. It is probably to be found in Shih No. 262, of which the hero is Hu of Shao , a descendant of the Duke of Shao, and which speaks of King Hsüan's charge to him. Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 14.10b-11a) quotes this passage in conjunction with the line . The traditional statement, "I who am as a little child2 2 : this cliché is very common in the Shu ching and occurs also in Shih 599 No. 288 and passim. cause you to continue as heir to the Duke of Shao," . . . Those receiving a command were always named in terms of their ancestor. When Confucius was made ss?-k`ou of Lu, the order read, "Fu-fu, son of a Duke of Sung, has3 3 Wang Ying-lin (K`un-hsüeh chi-wên 6.19b) quotes this with for . (Chao 198.) Cf. Mém. hist. 5.284-7, note 2 for the genealogy of Confucius. Fu-fu's name was Ho . [this] descendant K`ung Ch`iu of Lu. I order you to be ss?-k`ou." Confucius said, "Fu-fu's purity reached to his sovereign.4 4 : cf. Shu ching 199 and passim, esp. Legge's note, p. 200. Moreover I am not worthy." The Duke [of Lu] said, "Be not careless." 268 141 1 A, B, C include this paragraph as part of the last. I follow CHy and D. The same list in a slightly different order occurs in Li-wei han-wên-chia 6a. Po-hu t`ung 5.7b-8b elaborates: "He whose virtue is put into action is granted carriage horses; he who can pacify the people is given clothes; he who can make the people contented and happy is given a musical performance; one whose people are numerous is given vermilion doors; one who can advance the talented is given an audience; he who can retire the wicked is given a bodyguard; he who can punish the guilty is given a battle-axe; he who can chastize the unrighteous is given bow and arrows; he who is perfect in filial piety is given millet wine" . According to tradition, to the virtuous among the feudal lords the Son of Heaven gives presents. The first gift is carriages; the second is clothes; the third, a bodyguard; the fourth, a musical instrument; the fifth, an audience;2 2 Pelliot (TP 29(1932) .205-6) quotes Liu P`an-sui (in Kuo-hsüeh lun-ts`ung 2.2.227-8) as saying it was the favor of aiding the emperor to mount the audience stage while holding out to him the jade disc . the sixth, vermilion doors; the seventh, bow and arrows; the eighth, a battle-ax; the ninth, millet wine.3 3 Lei-chü 53.1a adds "These are called the nine [imperial] presents"; likewise Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 35.27b, with for . (Chao 197.) The Ode says,4 4 Shih 554 No. 262/5. I give you a large libation cup of jade, And a jar of herb-flavored spirits from the black millet. 151 1 Parts of this are paralleled in SY 11.20a, 11.19b-20a, 11.19a-b; in the two latter excerpts the interlocutor is respectively Chao Chien-tz? and the T`ai-tsai P`i. There is slight verbal identity with HSWC. Duke Ching of Ch`i said to Tz?-kung, "Whom do you serve as your teacher?" He replied, "Chung-ni of Lu." "Is this Chung-ni a sage?" "He is a saint, not merely a sage." Duke Ching laughed slightingly and said, "Wherein does his saintliness consist?" 269 Tz?-kung said, "I do not know." Duke Ching quickly2 2 For read with C, D. colored up and said, "First you say he is a saint, and now you say you do not know. What do you mean?" Tz?-kung said, "All my life long I have had heaven over my head, and I still do not know the height of heaven. All my life long I have trodden upon the earth, and still I do not know the thickness of the earth. My serving Chung-ni is comparable to a thirsty man who grasps the handle of a pitcher and goes to the river or the lake, drinks his fill, and leaves. How is he also to know the depth of the river or lake?" Duke Ching said, "Are you not overpraising him?" Tz?-kung said, "How would your servant Tz`? dare speak extravagantly? I only fear that I have still not done him justice. If I praise Chung-ni, it is comparable to lifting up a double handful of earth and adding it to Mt. T`ai: it is perfectly obvious that there is no increase [in the size of the mountain]. If I do not praise Chung-ni, it is comparable to scratching up a double handful [of earth] from Mt. T`ai: it is perfectly obvious that there would be no decrease." Duke Ching said, "Is there such goodness as this? Is there such goodness as this? The Ode says,3 3 Shih 558 No. 263/5. Composed4 4 For Lu Tê-ming (Ching-tien shih-wen B.21b) quotes Han shih as . (Chao 199.) Probably the two graphs were used indifferently to write the same binom: *mi??n, *mi?an. and dignified; Inscrutable, invincible. 161 1 This paragraph looks like a commentary on three terms, , and , occurring in the stanza of the Shih from which one line only is quoted at the end. Erh ya B.6a defines the same three words, but differently, while Ku-liang chuan 9.11b (Hsiang 24) is closely related to HSWC, though with graphic variants. When one of the [five] cereals does not ripen, it is called want; when two do not ripen, it is called famine; when three do not ripen it is called dearth; when four do not ripen it is called desolation;2 2 : Ku-liang has . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 852) gives examples of two used interchangeably. (Chao 199.) 270 when all five do not ripen it is called a major disaster. [Here are] the rites practiced during a major disaster: the prince in eating does not combine flavors; towers and lookouts are not decorated; roads are not cleared; among the various officials [vacancies] are made good, but no new offices are established;3 3 Fan Ning's com: . spirits are prayed to but not sacrificed to. Such are the rites practiced during a major disaster. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 564 No. 265/1. In the places where we live5 5 for Mao shih . all is desolation. This is what is referred to. 171 1 This is paralleled by SSTC 2.14b. Of old of the fiefs which the Son of Heaven caused to be conferred on the feudal lords, there were [parts] called "designated lands."2 2 are mentioned in Chêng Hsüan's com. on Chou li 3.24a as providing one fourth their income as taxes payed to the king. The other references to , none earlier than the Latter Han, are equally irrelevant. A feudal lords of a hundred li reserved thirty li, one of seventy li reserved twenty li, one of fifty li reserved ten li. Their successors, though they should be guilty of a crime and dispossessed, [were not dispossessed of their "designated lands,"]3 3 Chao (199) supplies from SSTC as necessary to the sense of the passage. so that their descendants, if worthy, might preserve these lands, generation after generation using [the income from them] to make sacrifices to the prince [of their line] who first received the fief. This is what is called "reviving states that have been extinguished and restoring families whose line of succession has been broken."4 4 Analects 351 (20/1.7). The Shu [ching] says,5 5 Shu ching 230. HSWC lacks and . "Now when I offer the [great] sacrifices to my predecessors, your forefathers are present to share [in them]." 271 181 1 This paragraph is closely related to Ku-liang chuan 8.4b-5a (Ch`êng 5). A variant tradition, whereby no blame is attached to Po-tsung for using the carter's advice, is represented by Kuo yü 11.6b-7a and Tso chuan 257 (Ch`êng 5). These two texts are again closely related, but vary greatly from the first two, so it is hardly valid to assume that Ku-liang has been corrupted (specifically Confucius' remark at the end) and that the false reading was perpetuated by HSWC, as Tsang Lin argues (Ching-i tsa-chi 16a2-3), with the approval of Chao (200-1). There was a landslide on Mt. Liang. The Prince of Chin summoned the Great Officer Po-tsung,2 2 : Ku-liang writes for ; Chao (200) shows that they were interchangeable. who on the way [to court] ran into a man pulling a cart. The cart turned over,3 3 : Chou glosses as , and would emend to . and Po-tsung had his spearman on the right get down, intending he should whip the man. The carter said, "If you kept on hurrying along the road, you would [already] be well on your way.4 4 . Ku-liang has "The time used whipping me would take you a long way." Is it right to travel without knowing what you are about?" Po-tsung was pleased and asked where he lived. He said, "I am a native of Chiang." Po-tsung said, "And have you heard any news?" "Mt. Liang has had a landslide that blocked up the River, so that for three days no water has flowed. This is why you have been summoned." Po-tsung said, "What is to be done?" "The mountain is Heaven's, and Heaven caused it to collapse. The River is Heaven's, and Heaven caused it to be blocked up. What can Po-tsung do about it?" Po-tsung took him aside5 5 lit., "in private." and interrogated him. He said, "Let the prince lead his assembled ministers in donning plain mourning clothes and weeping. After that, perform sacrifices [to the spirits of the River and the mountain]. Then the River will flow." Po-tsung asked his family and name, but he would not tell. When Po-tsung arrived, the prince asked him [for advice], and he replied in the man's words. Whereupon the prince wore plain 272 mourning and led the assembled ministers in weeping. After that he performed the sacrifices, and the River flowed. The prince asked Po-tsung how he had known [that he should do this], and Po-tsung falsely passed it off as his idea without revealing that he had got it from the carter. When Confucius heard of this he said, "Po-tsung will be without posterity, stealing another man's credit." The Ode says,6 6 Shih 523 No. 257/7. Heaven is sending down death and disorder, And has put an end to our king. Another says,7 7 Shih 576 No. 272. Revere the majesty of Heaven, And thus preserve [its favor]. 191 1 YTCC 5.13b-14a is the source for this anecdote. It is followed more closely by Hsin hsü 1.8a-b than by HSWC. When Duke P`ing of Chin sent Fan Chao to inspect the government of the state of Ch`i,2 2 YTCC and Hsin hsü both prefix "desiring to attack Ch`i." Duke Ching [of Ch`i] gave a banquet for him. Yen-tz? was up in front. Fan Chao hurried forward and said, "I would like Your Highness to have a servant fill a goblet that I might drink to your health." Duke Ching turned to his attendant and said, "Fill my goblet and present it to our guest." [After Fan Chao had drunk,] Yen-tz? said,3 3 . Read with CHy after YTCC and Hsin hsü. "Take the goblet away." Fan Chao was not pleased. He got up to dance and turning to the Grand Music Master said, "Play the music of Ch`êng-chou for me; I want to dance."4 4 CHy emends to "I will dance to it for you," as in YTCC and Hsin hsü. 273 The Grand Music Master replied, "Your blind servant5 5 : Professional musicians were blind; cf. Analects 305-6 (15/41). is not practiced in it." Fan Chao hastily left.6 6 seems to be repeated from above (). I read as in YTCC and Hsin hsü. Duke Ching said to Yen-tz?, "Chin is the greatest state in the empire, and when they send Fan Chao to come here to inspect the government of the state of Ch`i, you anger him, the envoy of that great state. What are we to do?" Yen-tz? said, "Fan Chao, by character, is not a vulgar man, ignorant of etiquette (li). The object [of his coming] was to try us, prince [and subjects].7 7 Supply after with CHy from YTCC and Hsin hsü. That is why I did not fall in with [his desires]." Then Duke Ching summoned the Grand Music Master and asked, "When Fan Chao would have had you play the music of Ch`êng-chou, why did you not do it?" He replied as had Yen-tz?.8 8 YTCC and Hsin hsü have ? ? ? "The music of Ch`êng-chou is the music of the Son of Heaven. When it is played he must be a ruler who dances to it. Now Fan Chao, a subject, desired to dance to the music of the Son of Heaven. That is why I did not play it." Afterwards Fan Chao went back and reported to Duke P`ing, "Ch`i cannot yet be annexed. I tried their prince, and Yen-tz? knew [what I was about]. I went against their [principles in the matter of] music, and the Grand Music Master knew [what I was doing]." When Confucius heard of this he said, "Excellent. Yen-tz?, without leaving the sacrificial vessels, could act as a buffer a thousand li away."9 9 Add after with TPYL 322.6a, YTCC, and Hsin hsü. Cf. LSCC 20.10b: . (Chao.) The Ode says,10 10 Shih 577 No. 273. Truly is the Chief of the Chou House honored in his place. To his movements11 11 Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung (I-shuo k`ao 15.4b-5a) would write for on the basis of a quotation by Li Hsien in his com. on Hou-Han shu 53.5a () of Hsieh's Han-shih chuan (? = ). All respond with tremulous awe. 274 201 1 SSTC 2.10a-b has a brief paragraph on the responsibilities of the san-kung, and Po-hu t`ung 3.1b-2a mentions the subject; likewise TTLC 8.9b-10a. There is no apparent connection between these texts. What are the san-kung? They are the ss?-k`ung, the ss?-ma,2 2 CHy follows the quotation in Liu Chao's com. on Hou-Han shu () 24.7b-8a to reverse the order of these, bringing it into conformity with that of the following discussion. However Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 30B.12b () places the ss?-ma last. and the ss?-t`u. The ss?-ma is in charge of heaven; the ss?-k`ung is in charge of earth;3 3 For one would expect , which is the reading in Shu-ch`ao 50.1b and the quotation in Li Hsien's com., loc. cit.; likewise Po-hu t`ung. (Chao 202.) the ss?-t`u is in charge of man. So when yin and yang are not adjusted, when [the weather of] the four seasons is not seasonable, when stars and constellations miss their courses, and calamaties are out of the ordinary, the responsibility devolves upon the ss?-ma. When mountains and hills fall and collapse, when rivers and streams do not flow, when the five cereals do not grow, and plants do not thrive, the responsibility devolves upon the ss?-k`ung. When ruler and subjects are not in their correct places, when the Way of Man is not harmonious, when in the state thieves and rebels are numerous, and inferiors resent their superiors, the responsibility devolves upon the ss?-t`u. The san-kung take carge of their offices, [each] anxious about his own duties, each offering his suggestions, and each clarifying what is obscure4 4 . Liu Chao's com., loc. cit., writes for CHy thinks , standing for , is the correct reading. It is not easy to see how could have become corrupted to . [in his task]: such are the duties of the san-kung. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 429 No. 235/3. Numerous is the array of officers, And by them King Wên enjoys his repose. Another says,6 6 Shih 578 No. 273. Brilliant and illustrious is the House of Chou. He has regulated the positions of those in office. It speaks of each fitting his office. 275 21 The sage prince in his government is mild, good, and friendly; generous, tolerant, and loving; upright, pure, and clear-sighted. He rejoices in rewarding and hates to punish. He reforms customs and honors good teaching. He lets the living live (?) and does not kill. He spreads kindness and diffuses grace. He practices jên and does not show favoritism in his gifts. He does not rob the people's strength. In the corvée, he does not overstep the [regular] times. The people are able to do their plowing, and each household has its harvest and its reserve. The people are without cold or hunger; food is not allowed to spoil.

Chao 203-5 for additional arguments on both sides of the question. I follow the Mao shih reading to agree with the in the conclusion. 276 From this we may clearly know that in [a time of] the Great Peace there are no sudden winds or violent rains. 22 Yesterday how begun? How perfected today? You must think of reaching perfection,1 1 : cf. Analects 141 (1/9): "Then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence." You must think of controlling life. By daily concern with each day, You will become as stout as a metal wall.2 2 The rhymes are *s?ng, *di??ng, , *di??ng, . The Ode says,3 3 Shih 334-5 No. 196/4. My days are advancing; Your months are going on. Rising early and going to sleep late, Do not disgrace those who gave you birth. 231 1 SY 10.6b-7a incorporates this in a story about Tsêng-tz?, ending with the same lines from the Shih. Wên-tz? 4.19a and Têng-hsi-tz? 10a are similar. Officials become lax with success;2 2 : SY has for : "Officials grow lazy when offices are complete." Têng-hsi-tz? has "Harm comes from the organization of officialdom." Wên-tz?: [var. ] . (Chou.) a disease worsens after a slight improvement; disaster comes from carelessness, filial piety declines with [the advent of] wife and child. Examining into these four [phenomena, we find we must] be careful that we end as well as we begin. The I [ching] says,3 3 Yi King 207. "A young fox has nearly crossed [the stream], when its tail gets immersed." The Ode says,4 4 Shih 505 No. 255/1. All are [good] at first, But few prove themselves to be so at last. 277 241 1 Adapted from Hsün-tz? 19.16a-b, which is followed more closely by Chia-yü 5.19b-20b. Lieh-tz? 1.5a gives the last part of the Hsün-tz? version, omitted in HSWC. Confucius was at leisure, when Tz?-kung advanced holding up his robe with both hands2 2 For cf. Analects 229 (10/4.4): "He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe with both his hands." and said, "Your disciple has served his master for years, until his abilities are exhausted and his [capacity for] knowledge is come to an end. Though he be stirred up with learning, he is unable to advance further, and he would like to take a rest." Confucius said, "Tz`?, where do you want to rest?" "I would like to rest by serving my prince." Confucius said, "The Ode says,3 3 Shih 543 No. 260/4. Hsün-tz? and Chia-yü here quote from Shih 633 No. 301: "Be mild and humble morning to night,/Be reverent in discharging the service." Never idle day or night, In the service of the One man. Service like this is not easy. What rest would you get from that?" "I would like4 4 B, C omit . to rest by serving my father." Confucius said, "The Ode says,5 5 Shih 477 No. 247/5. For such filial piety, without ceasing, There will ever be conferred blessing on you. Service like this is not easy. What rest would you get from that?" "I would like to rest by serving my brothers."6 6 Hsün-tz? and Chia-yü omit this and instead have "wife and child," and "friend." (Chou.) Confucius said, "The Ode says,7 7 Shih 252 No. 164/7. Loving union with wife and children Is like the music of lutes; But it is the accord of brothers Which makes intense8 8 Mao shih has for Han shih . the harmony and happiness. Service like this is not easy. What rest would you get from that?" 278 "I would like to rest by tilling the fields." Confucius said, "The Ode says,9 9 Shih 232 No. 154/7. In the daytime collect the grass, And at night twist it into ropes; Then get up quickly on our roofs:— We shall have to recommence our sowing. Service like this is not easy. What rest would you get from that?" Tz?-kung said, "Then is there any rest at all for the superior man?" Confucius said, " `Covered in his coffin, he stops toiling (?). He does not [then] know the vicissitudes of his time.'10 10 The particle and the rhyme *kwan, *ts`ian suggest that Confucius is quoting a common saying, but the line does not occur in the parallel passages, and I have been unable to locate it elsewhere. The *pwar is suspect; its meaning is not too clear in this context, and followed by it should also rhyme. Other words with the phonetic have a *-wan or *-wan final (Grammata Serica 180), but none appears to provide an obvious emendation. This is a statement of where the superior man rests. Truly he studies without ceasing until, shut up in his coffin, he stops at last." The Ode says,11 11 Shih 599 No. 288. By daily progress and monthly advance. It refers to one who studies. 251 1 CKT 3.82a-84b supplies a different frame, first relating the success of Yao Chia on behalf of Ch`in, and then bringing in the other worthies in defending him against an attack by Han Fei on the grounds of Yao Chia's unworthy origins. The point of the anecdote is quite different; no emphasis is placed on the advantages of learning, but praise is bestowed on enlightened rulers who recognize ability wherever they find it. Duke Ai of Lu asked Jan Yu, "With nothing more than the natural endowments of the ordinary man, is it study that is necessary to make him a superior man?" Jan Yu replied, "I have heard that `though you have good jade, without cutting and carving, it will not make a useful vessel.'2 2 Cf. HSWC 2/32. One may have fine endowments, but without study, he will not become a superior man." 279 "How do you know that it true?"3 3 CHy remarks that the words following would seem to be those of the author, since Yao Chao lived after Jan Yu, who would hardly be citing him as an example. However the concluding sentence of the paragraph brings us back to Duke Ai, who has apparently been listening to the intervening speech, so he should probably be taken as the subject of , and another supplied before . The resulting anachronism is not unusual in apologues of this sort. "Now Tz?-lu was a country fellow from Pien,4 4 Shih chi 67.4a is to the same effect. and Tz?-kung was a merchant from Wei.5 5 I find no other mention of Tz?-kung as a merchant. Shih chi 67.7a also gives Wei as his native state. Both studied under Confucius and afterwards became famous persons in the empire. None of the feudal lords that heard of them failed to treat them with respect, and none of the ministers and Great Officers that heard of them failed to love them. This was the result of study. "Of old Wu, Ch'u, Yen, and Tai6 6 The Ss?-k`u editors (Ssu-k`u . . . t`i-yao 16.11a) object to this statement as an error in fact. CKT names the same four states, but Pao P`iao emends to , without adequate justification, according to Wu Shih-tao. In view of the CKT context: "went south to Ch`u and Wu," the emendation seems especially infelicitous. Could the Ss?-k`u editors have based their objection on grounds so uncertain? planned to raise a joint force and were going to attack Ch`in. Yao7 7 Read with CHy, D, and CKT for . (Chou.) Ku, the son of a gatekeeper,8 8 : HSWC 2/2. went on a mission to them on behalf of Ch`in and succeeded in breaking up their plans and stopping their armies [from attacking Ch`in]. When he went back, the King of Ch`in was greatly pleased and set him up as a minister of the highest rank. "There was Po-li Hsi, who was a beggar in Ch`i. Driven out of Ch`i to the west, he had no way of bringing himself to the notice [of the prince], and so he sold himself for five sheepskins and drove a single-yoke cart. When he was set up as minister by Duke Mu of Ch`in, he succeeded in establishing [Ch`in's] hegemony over the western Jung. "As a youth T`ai-kung Wang lived with his wife's family as son-in-law, but in his old age was driven out. He butchered cattle in Ch`ao-ko, hired himself out in Chi-chin, and was a fisherman in P`an-ch`i. King Wên raised him up and employed him, enfeoffing him in Ch`i. 280 "Kuan Chung with his own hands shot Duke Huan,9 9 Cf. Mém. hist. 4.47, where it says only that he was in charge of the troops when Duke Huan was struck by an arrow. who nevertheless expelled from his heart all idea of revenge and set him up as minister. [Kuan Chung] preserved [Ch`i] from destruction, and insured the continuation [of the ruling line]; he brought together the feudal lords and unified the empire. "These four men were all at one time lowly and poor, in straits and in a state of degradation, and yet their fame has spread to later generations. Was it not through learning that this result was achieved? Viewed in the light of this, a gentleman must first study and only then will he become a superior man. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 599 No. 288. By daily progress and monthly advance. Whereupon Duke Ai laughed joyously and said, "Although I am not intelligent, I wish to receive your teaching, Master." 261 1 SY 3.5a-b seems to be a free retelling of this paragraph, possibly from another source, as Chia-yü 4.5a-6a is close to SY. HSWC appears to be defective; see notes 5 and 6 below. Tsêng-tz? had committed a fault.2 2 He was hoeing melons and by mistake cut the roots: (SY and Chia-yü). [His father,] Tsêng Hsi beat him with a stick until he fell to the ground. After a while he revived and getting up, said, "I hope, sir,3 3 addressed to a father is unusual.

The people of Lu, esteeming Tsêng-tz? as a sage for this act, reported the matter to Confucius, who said to his disciples, "If Ts`an comes, [do not let him in." Tsêng-tz? felt himself innocent of any wrong and sent a man to make his excuses to the Master, who said,]5 5 CHy adds from SY. Chou also thinks the text is defective here. However, it reads satisfactorily without the addition. is usual in direct address. "Have you not heard how of old Shun played the part 28119 of a son? If it was a small whip he stayed for his beating, but if it was with a large stick, he ran away. If [his father] looked for him, having something for him to do, he was always at his side. But if he looked for him with the intention of killing him, he was never to be found. Now you gave yourself up and stayed [to suffer the consequences of] his violent anger, standing with folded hands without running away. Are you not a subject of the king? What kind of crime is this [—causing one of the king's subjects to be killed?]"6 6 . CHy writes after SY, Chia-yü, and so in the translation. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 404 No. 222/5. Peaceable and yielding—8 8 . Mao shih has for . My translation is made to agree with the HSWC context, and will not fit into the stanza from which it is taken. as "arrive" is an attested use in the Shih, and Legge's "How joyous, how happy,/Is their coming here" is unobjectionable. This too is a fault. Another says,9 9 Shih 617 No. 299/2. Blandly he looks and smiles; Without any impatience he delivers his instructions. 271 1 This story occurs in LNC 6.5b-6a, with Duke P`ing of Chin for Duke Ching of Ch`i. Duke Ching of Ch`i employed a man to make a bow. It took three years to finish, but when Duke Ching shot with the bow [the arrow] would not pierce a single2 2 For read with Shu-ch`ao 125.2a and LNC. Chao (206) suggests that may be a repetition from above. layer of armor. Duke Ching was angry and was going to have the bow-maker put to death. The bow-maker's wife went to see Duke Ching and said, "I am the daughter of a man of Ts`ai3 3 . CHy, B, C, D have for . LNC has Fan for . and the wife of the bow-maker. To the south of Mt. T`ai is the `crow-caw' chê tree;4 4 : cf. Hsü Shên's com. on Huai-nan tz? 1.5b: . "The wu-hao is a chê mulberry tree. Its wood is firm and strong. When a crow which has built its nest on a limb of this tree makes ready to fly, the branch bends down with force sufficient again to raise up the nest. The crow follows [the branch as it moves], unable to fly, and caws as it sits there. Such branches are cut to make bows, and from this are called wu-hao (`crow-caw') bows." (Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist. 3.489 note 2). Hs? Shên also gives an alternative etymology for wu-hao. 282 there are [also] the horn of a red ox,5 5 : cf. Li Ki 1.590: "The victim was red, that being the color preferred by the [Chou] dynasty." (Legge 1.428.) LNC has for ; see note 7 for the "horn from Yen." the sinew of deer in Ching,6 6 For Ch`u-hsüeh chi 22.11b has "bow ends," which makes no sense. (Chao.) Chou remarks that they bound bows with sinew. and the glue from the fish of A.7 7 For read with D and LNC; cf. TPYL 347.8b: "Horn from Yen is superior, sinew from Ch`u is fine, glue from A is sticky." (Chao.) These four articles are the choice materials of the empire. It is not right that [a bow made of them] should pierce so few layers of armor as this. Besides, I have heard that [even] Duke Hsi's chariot was not able to move by itself, and though [the sword] Mo-yeh8 8 D has for . was sharp, it could not cut by itself, but must have someone to wield it. Now the technique of archery consists in holding [the bow in] the left hand as though it were a carpenter's square, with the right hand as though resting on a branch,9 9 For read with Shu-ch`ao and LNC. (Chou, Chao.) B, C, D have for . with the palm [cupped] as though grasping an egg, and the four fingers [extended] like sticks broken off short. When the right hand releases [the arrow], the left hand is not aware of it. This in general is the technique of archery." Adopting this method, Duke Ching shot with the bow and pierced seven layers of armor. The husband of the woman of Ts`ai was at once set at liberty. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 366 No. 207/5. LNC quotes the rather more appropriate lines from Shih 474 No. 246/3: "The ornamented bows are strong,/And the four arrows are all balanced." Loving the correct and the straight. 283 281 1 This is a more literary version of an anecdote in YTCC 1.26a. In Ch`i there was a man who had offended against Duke Ching. Duke Ching was very angry and had the man bound and placed below in the hall. Then he summoned his attendants to sever his limbs.2 2 CHy has for ; cf. HSWC 1/23, note 4. Any who objected would be put to death. Yen-tz? with his left hand grasped [the man's] head and with his right whetted his sword. Looking up he asked, "I have not discovered with which one they began to cut3 3 Lei-chü 25.2a, TPYL 641.5a omit . (Chao 207.) when the enlightened kings and sage rulers of antiquity severed a man's limbs?" Duke Ching got off the mat and said, "Release him. The fault lies with me." The Ode says,4 4 Shih 366 No. 207/5. Loving the correct and the straight. 29 There is the traditional saying: If there is balance in rest, the face will be beautiful. If there is balance in eating and drinking, the ch`i1 1 "Breath." will be defined. If there is balance in speech, it will be heard with belief. If the thoughts are balanced, they will succeed. If one is balanced in these five respects, spirits will take up their abode in him. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 631 No. 301. All harmonious and blending together, According to the notes of the sonorous gem. 30 Marquis Wên of Wei asked Hu Chüan-tz?, "If a father is worthy, is that enough for him to be relied on?" 1 is ambiguous. "Is a [person whose] father is a sage [thereby] qualified to be depended on?" or "Is a [person who as a] father is a sage [thereby] qualified to be depended on, [specifically by the one to whom he bears that relationship]?" Lit., "If a father is a sage, is that enough for reliance?" Hu Chüan-tz? plays on both these meanings: the son cannot rely for good treatment on his sage-father, nor does the sage-father necessarily have a son worthy of confidence. 284 He replied, "It is not enough." "If a son is worthy, is that enough for him to be relied on?" "It is not enough." "If a elder brother is worthy, is that enough for him to be relied on?" "It is not enough." "If a younger brother is worthy, is that enough for him to be relied on?" "It is not enough." "If a minister is worthy, is that enough for him to be relied on?" "It is not enough." Marquis Wên suddenly changed countenance and said angrily, "To each of these five that I have asked you about, one by one, you say `It is not enough.' What do you mean?" He replied, "No father was more worthy than Yao, but Tan Chu was banished.2 2 For cf. Mencius 467 (7A/31.1). Neither Shu ching nor Shih chi speak of Tan Chu's banishment, so perhaps "set aside" would be better here. No son was more worthy than Shun, but Ku-sou was stupid.3 3 Lei-chü 20.5a, TPYL 402.2a-b, have "was arrested" for . (Chao (207) thinks it is a scribal emendation to parallel the verbs , and . Chih-yao 8.27b has . No elder brother was more worthy than Shun, but Hsiang was overbearing.4 4 Cf. Mencius 346-7 (5A/2.3). No younger brother was more worthy than the Duke of Chou, but Kuan-shu was punished.5 5 Cf. Mém. hist. 1.245. No minister was more worthy than T`ang or Wu, but Chou and Chieh were attacked. He who puts his hope in others will not achieve his goal, and he who relies on others will not long endure. The prince who desires to rule must begin with himself. Why should he rely on others?" The Ode says,6 6 Shih 618 No. 299/4. He seeks the blessing for himself. 285 311 1 Shih chi 24.39b-40a (Mém. hist. 3.291) lists the effects of hearing the several tones, without relating them to the hu; likewise Po-hu t`ung 2.6a-b, with considerable disscrepancies. T`ang composed the hu.2 2 : cf. LSCC 5.10a: "T`ang then ordered I-yin to compose the great hu." When they heard the tone kung, people were made mild, good, and generous; when they heard the tone shang, they were made straight and scrupulous, and loved i. When they heard the tone chio, they were made sympathetic, and loved jên. When they heard the tone chi, they were made to rejoice in supporting [their dependents] and to love to give. When they heard the tone yü3 3 : the five tones; cf. HSWC 1/3, note 17. they were made reverent and loved li. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 321 1 This is a variant of HSWC 3/31, q.v. for parallels. Confucius said, "The I [ching] first has the t`ung jên2 2 : Yi King 86-7 (13). and afterward the ta yu.3 3 : ibid. 88 (14). That it continues them with the ch`ien4 4 : ibid. 89-90 (15). — is this not indeed fitting? Truly, `It is the way of heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble. It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble. Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble. It is the way of man to hate the full and love the humble.'5 5 Ibid. 226 (15 t`uan). Humbleness is to repress and diminish; if you would hold to the way of fullness, repress and diminish. Such is the action of humbled6 6 For CHy, D write "diminish," incorrectly, says Chou. virtue. Those who conform to it will have good fortune, while those who oppose it will have bad luck. After the death of the Five Emperors, 286 and after the decline of the Three Kings, was it not only the Duke of Chou who was able to put humbled virtue into practice? The son of King Wên, the younger brother of King Wu, and uncle of King Ch`êng, he borrowed the esteemed position of the Son of Heaven for seven years. There were ten men whom he met with presents and treated as teachers. There were thirteen men7 7 Cf. HSWC 3/31, note 4. with whom he exchanged gifts and whom he regarded as friends, and forty-nine gentlemen from poor dwellings in mean quarters to whom he gave precedence in interviews. There were a hundred good men whom he advanced at regular times, and a thousand to whom he granted audiences in his palace. He had five ministers whose duty it was to remonstrate, and five who aided him, and six who supported him. There were a hundred gentlemen of his own clan who bore shield and spear and attained to the [status of] feudal lords."8 8 After KTCY 1.3b (4) has "There were 97 men from other clans as well as a hundred, etc." Chao would supply this here. Confucius said, "Even the Duke of Chou when ruling the empire in rewards gave most to his own clan9 9 . KTCY has for , which would change the stop to after : "Even the Duke of Chou made the empire his own party: he gave, etc." Chao (209) prefers this reading, claiming that makes no sense. But is hardly an improvement. and less to outside clans." Truly, "one whose virtuous conduct is ample and who preserves it by reverence will prosper; one whose territory is extensive and who preserves it by economy will find security; one whose rank is elevated and whose pay is rich and who preserves them by humility will be honored; one whose people are many and whose weapons are strong and who preserves them by fear will be victorious; one who has intelligence and knowledge and who preserves them by [an air of] stupidity will be wise; one whose learning is extensive and whose memory is strong and who preserves them by [an air of] shallowness will not go to excess." These six are all of them "humbled virtues." The I [ching] says,10 10 Yi King 89 (15); cf. HSWC 3/31, note 14. "Ch`ien indicates progress and success. The superior man will maintain his success to the end, and have good 287 fortune." What is able to bring about this lucky issue is the Way of the superior man. To have the rank of emperor and the wealth of the whole land and then to lose their lives for not humbling their virtue—such was the lot of Chieh and Chou; how much the more should common people [be circumspect]. Now the I [ching] has one way whereby, on a large scale, one may preserve an empire; or on a medium scale, a state, or more immediately his own person—is it not simply by "humbled virtue"? The Ode says,11 11 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 331 1 Huai-nan tz? 18.18a-b is nearly identical. Of old T`ien Tz?-fang went out and saw an old horse on the road. Sighing compassionately, he fixed his attention [on the horse] and asked the driver, "What horse is this?" "It was formerly kept by the ducal house. It was worn out and of no use, so they turned it out." T`ien Tz?-fang said, "To use up its strength when it was young, and cast it out2 2 . Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 14.2b, 28.23a has for . (CHy.) Lei-chü 93.1b, TPYL 486.1a, Chih-yao 8.28a, Po-t`ieh 29.58b all have , of which is a variant. Huai-nan tz? has . (Chao 209.) when old is not what the humane (jên) man would do." He bought [the horse] with rolls of silk. When gentlemen in extremity heard of this they knew whom to give up their hearts to. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 288 341 1 Huai-nan tz? 18.18b is nearly identical. That these two stories (cf. HSWC 8/33) succeed one another in both texts indicates definite filiation. In Huai-nan tz? they are more intimately connected with each other, being parts of a consecutive argument, and being referred to in the summary following, circumstances suggesting that Han Ying made use of Huai-nan tz?. Duke Chuang of Ch`i was out hunting, when a mantis lifted its legs to seize the wheel [of his chariot]. He asked his driver, "What insect is this?" The driver said, "This is a mantis. Its characteristic as an insect is that it knows how to advance but not how to retreat. Without calculating its own strength it lightly advances against its opponent." Duke Chuang said, "If it were a man it would be the bravest soldier in the empire." Whereupon he backed up his chariot to avoid [crushing] it, and brave soldiers turned to him. The Ode says,2 2 Shih 640 No. 304/3. T`ang was not born too late, And his wisdom and virtue daily advanced. 35 Marquis Wên of Wei asked Li K`o, "Have people hatreds?" Li K`o said, "They have. The lowly hate the nobles; the poor hate the rich; the stupid hate the wise." Marquis Wên said, "Excellent! Can these three be exercised so as to avoid hatred?" Li K`o said, "They can. I have heard that if nobles humble themselves before the lowly, the masses will not hate them. If the rich can divide [their wealth] among the poor, needy gentlemen will not hate them. If the wise teach the stupid, inexperienced youths will not hate them." Duke Wên said, "Well said! Even Yao and Shun would not have found fault with such conduct..1 1 Cf. HSWC 7/12, note 3. Though I am not intelligent, I venture to keep to these words." The Ode says,2 2 Shih 248 No. 162/2; 260 No. 167/3. I had not leisure to kneel or to sit. 289 361 1 SY 11.7b-8a incorporates this in a reproach addressed to Prince Mêng-ch`ang by a retainer, similar to HSWC 7/17. Here is a bird that has built its nest in the top of some reeds. A puff of wind from the sky, the reeds break, and the nest is ruined.2 2 Chou calls attention to Hsün-tz? 1.3a: ? ? . "In the south there is a bird called the mêng-chiu. It makes its nest of feathers, weaving it with hair, and attaches it to the top of a reed. The wind comes and the reed breaks off: the eggs are broken and the young die. It is not because the nest was imperfect, but because of the nature of what it was attached to." SY seems to have followed this. Why? Because what [the bird] put its reliance on was weak. That millet wasps3 3 : PWYF list only this occurrence. (?) are not molested and that altar rats4 4 Cf. HSWC 7/9. are not burned out is not because millet wasps and altar rats are holy, but because what they put their reliance on serves the purpose. Hence the saint seeks out sages to help him.5 5 Chou would emend to and transfer it after . Lei-chü 20.4a has "seeks sages to help himself." (Chao.) Now a fish that can swallow a boat is large, but if [the lake] overflows and he is left out of the water, he will be at the mercy of crickets and ants.6 6 Cf. Chuang-tz? 6.10a: "If a fish that could swallow a boat be left by the flowing away of the water, then [even] the ants are able to trouble it." (Legge, 2.76.) [It is because] he has lost his support. Truly [the Ode] says,7 7 Chou suggests emending to ; cf. Shih 507 No. 255/4. All unintelligent are you of your [proper] virtue, And so you have no [good] men behind you, nor by your side.8 8 Cf. HSWC 10/14, note 10. Without any intelligence of your [proper] virtue, You have no [good] intimate adviser nor minister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">290 CHAPTER IX 11 1 LNC 1.15b-16a relates the first incident in quite different words. Mencius as a child was once reciting his lessons when his mother happened to be spinning. Breaking off suddenly, he stopped in the middle, then started up again. His mother knew his mind was wandering, and called out to ask, "Why do you stop in the middle?" He replied, "I had forgotten part of it, and then I remembered it again." His mother took a knife and cut her thread. She did this as a warning to him. After that Mencius did not let his mind wander again. When Mencius was a child, their neighbor on the east killed a pig. Mencius asked his mother, "What did our neighbor on the east kill the pig for?" His mother said, "To feed you." His mother then regretted [her words] and said,2 2 TPYL 430.1a-b has "His mother regretted the slip of her tongue." (CHy.) Po-t`ieh 6.25a: "Then she admonished [herself] saying." (Chao 211.) "When I was pregnant with this child I would not sit on a mat that was not straight,3 3 Analects 233 (10/9). nor would I eat meat that was not cut properly4 4 Ibid. 232 (10/8.3). —this was teaching him in the womb. To deceive him now when he has grown to have understanding is to teach him to be distrustful." Whereupon she purchased some of the pork from the neighbor on the east and fed it to him to show that she had not been deceiving him. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 11 No. 5/2. Right it is that your descendants Should be as in unbroken strings. It speaks of a worthy mother making her son worthy. 291 21 1 LNC 1.28a-b has a more artistic version of this story. When T`ien-tz? had been minister three years he went back home to rest. He had got a hundred i of gold,2 2 LNC has "received 100 i of gold in bribes from underofficials." which he presented to his mother. His mother said, "Where did you get this gold?" He replied, "It is the salary I received as an official." His mother said, "Were you three years a minister without [having to] eat? I do not care for this way of holding office. The filial son, in serving his parents, makes every effort to be honest, and does not allow anything improper to come into his house. [To be disloyal as a minister] is to be unfilial as a son.3 3 For "a son must be filial" read with CHy after TPYL 811.1b and LNC. (Chao 212.) May you get rid of it." T`ien-tz? was ashamed and left. He went to the court and returned the gold. He resigned and asked to be put in prison. The king,4 4 King Hsüan of Ch`i, according to LNC. (Chou.) considering the mother to be a worthy woman and pleased with her sense of what was proper (i), pardoned5 5 = . (CHy.) T`ientz?'s fault and ordered him to come back as minister. The gold he gave to the mother. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 11 No. 5/2. Right it is that your descendants Should be as in unbroken strings. It speaks of a worthy mother making her son worthy.7 7 B, C lack this line. 31 1 SY 10.17b-18b and Chia-yü 2.6b-7a provide two versions of this story, based perhaps on HSWC, but retold with the addition of further details. Both agree in making the speaker Ch`iu Wu-tz? instead of Kao Yü; see note 3 below. Confucius was on a trip2 2 To Ch`i, according to Chia-yü. when he heard sounds of bitter weeping. Confucius said, "Make haste! Make haste! There is a 292 sage up ahead!" When they got there it was Kao Yü,3 3 . SY and Chia-yü have . Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 403-4) gives six other variants, all of which he derives from a Kao Ch`ai, the disciple of Confucius. (Chao 212.) dressed in coarse cloth and holding a sickle, weeping by the side of the road. Confucius left his carriage and said to him, "You are not in mourning; why do you weep so bitterly?" Kao Yü said, "I have erred in three ways. When I was young I was [fond of] study and traveled [about] among the feudal lords,4 4 . Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 18.12b quotes this as . (CHy.) KTCY 1.4a (4), Li Hsien's com. on Hou-Han shu 37.4b (), and TPYL 487.7a likewise, but with for and for . (Chao 213.) to the neglect of my parents. This was my first error. Setting my ambitions high, (?) I was careless in serving my prince.5 5 . D has "I neglected my prince to serve my parents." Li Shan's com.: "Refusing to serve a mediocre prince, in the end my service was without results." (CHy.) TPYL has "Neglecting my duty, I would not serve a mediocre prince." (Chao.) This was my second error. I have broken off relations with intimate friends for trifling causes.6 6 . Li Shan's com.: "I seldom made friendly visits and had few friends, so that in my old age I have no one to rely on." (CHy.) TPYL is nearly identical. KTCY has "I suddenly broke off relations with intimate friends." As HSWC 9/25 has , Chao thinks here is a mistake for . The variant in TPYL and Li Shan presupposes (corrupted to ?) as a point of departure. SY has . This was my third error. `The tree would be still, but the wind will not stop,7 7 . CHy prefixes from Li Shan's com.; cf. HSWC 7/7: and 1/17: . the son wishes to look after them, but his parents will not tarry.'8 8 Cf. HSWC 7/7. 1/17 has . When they are past there is no [overtaking them—such are the years of our lives]; when they are gone there is no recalling them—such are our parents.9 9 For read ? with CHy after TPYL. Li Hsien's com. is the same, but omits ; also Li Shan's com., with for for , and for . KTCY agrees with the latter. (Chao 214.) Cf. HSWC 7/17. I venture to take leave [of the world (?) from this time." And he at once stiffened in death.10 10 Cf. HSWC 1/27, note 8. For SY has "cut his throat"; Chia-yü: "cast himself into the water." Li Shan quotes it with for : "broke out in tears." 293 Confucius said, "May you take a warning from him, my disciples. It is worth your attention." Whereupon thirteen of his followers took their leave and returned home to look after their parents. 41 1 From Hsün-tz? 20.8a-9a. Chia-yü 5.21a-b follows Hsün-tz?. B, C connect this with the preceding paragraph. Tz?-lu said, "Here is a man who gets up early and goes to bed late, whose hands and feet are callused and whose face and eyes are burnt black from planting the five cereals in the service of his parents, and yet he has not the name of a filial son. Why is this?" Confucius said, "I suspect2 2 . Omit with CHy after Hsün-tz?. that probably he is not respectful in bearing, or his expression is not conciliatory, or his words are not polite. The ancients had a saying, `Is it clothing? Is it food? I have never relied on you for them.' "3 3 . D has for and for . Yang Liang quotes HSWC as , but Lu Wên-ch`ao thinks is a mistake for . I follow Lu in emending to as in Hsün-tz?, where Yang Liang defines it as "rely on." I have been unable ot find a source (older than Hsün-tz?, where it is also introduced as an "ancient saying") for this enigmatic remark. The variant in Chia-yü is the most intelligible: "Nor other, nor I, [ever] cheat you." "This son works hard to serve his parents, and he lacks these three defects. How is it he [still] has not the name of filial?"4 4 Although none of the other versions interposes to make this remark revert to Tz?-lu, Hsün-tz? at least repeats (where HSWC has ), and it is best taken as a further objection on Tz?-lu's part. "It may be that his friends are possibly not good men. Sit down and I will tell you. If a man, although he has the strength of the stoutest warrior in the state,5 5 Yang Liang defines as . is unable to lift his own body, it is not that his strength is lacking, but that such a feat is impossible.6 6 . Hsün-tz? has , certainly a better reading than "inconvenient." Hsün-tz? here adds ? "Hence if his behavior is not disciplined within his family, it is his own fault. If outside he is not known for his good qualities, it is the fault of his friends." For this reason the superior man inside his house 294 is sincerely filial, and outside he makes friends with worthy men. Then how can be not have the name of a filial son?" The Ode says,7 7 Shih 18 No. 10/3. Your parents are very near. 51 1 From LSCC 14.4b-5a. Lieh-tz? 5.7a tells about Po-ya and Chung Tz?-ch`i, without mentioning Po-ya's behavior on the death of the latter, which is included in Fêng-su t'ung-i 6.8a-b. SY 8.9b-10a follows LSCC. Po-ya played the lute while Chung Tz?-ch`i listened to him. As he played he happened to think of Mt. [T`ai],2 2 Supply before after the quotation in Liu Hsiao-piao's com. on Shih-shuo hsin-yü 3A.11b. The other versions all have . (Chao.) and Chung Tz?-ch`i said, "How well you play! [The music] is lofty as Mt. T`ai." [After a little while]3 3 Liu Hsiao-piao's com. has ; SY, LSCC: . Fêng-su t'ung-i: . All express the idea of "in a short while." (Chao.) he thought of flowing water, and Chung Tz?-ch`i said, "How well you play! [The music] is expansive as the Chiang or the River." When Chung Tz?-ch`i died, Po-ya split his lute and broke the strings, and to the end of his life did not again play the lute, maintaining that there was no one in the world worth playing for. It is not only the lute that is like this; for the sage it is also true. If it is not the proper time, in what way can the sage accomplish his meritorious acts? 61 1 LNC 5.20b-21a gives a fuller account of this episode. Ch`in attacked and defeated Wei.2 2 In B.C. 225. (Chou.) One of the younger sons3 3 , below referred to as kung-tz?, a term applied to the sons of a feudal lord other than the designated heir apparent. [of the ruling house of Wei] escaped and was not taken. An order was issued to the state of Wei that read, "Anyone who takes the kung-tz? will be rewarded with a thousand chin of gold. Anyone 295 who conceals him will be punished along with his relatives to the tenth degree." The kung-tz?'s nurse had escaped with him, and someone said to her, "Whoever gets the kung-tz? will be very richly rewarded. His nurse should know where the kung-tz? is, [and if so, should] tell it." The nurse replied, "I do not know where he is, and even if I did know, I would die sooner than tell. When you have brought up a child for someone, you cannot tell where you have hidden him (?). That would be to betray one's master and to [show] fear [of] death. I have heard that a loyal person does not betray his master, nor does a brave one fear death. The rule is that one who brings up another's child has the duty of4 4 Supply with CHy from LNC. keeping him alive, not that of killing him. It would not be right to violate what is proper (i) and to practice deceit out of fear of punishment and with an eye to gain. I cannot go on living and let the kung-tz? die alone." And she fled with the kung-tz? into a marsh. Catching sight of them, some soldiers of Ch`in shot at them. The nurse shielded [the boy] with her own body and received twelve arrows, not one of which did she let strike the kung-tz?.5 5 According to LNC the kung-tz? also died: . When the King of Ch`in heard of it, he performed the Great Sacrifice6 6 For the cf. Li Ki 1.291 (Legge 1.226). to her, and further gave her elder brother the rank of Great Officer. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 39 No. 26/3. My mind is not a stone— It cannot be rolled about. 71 1 This is reminiscent of Analects 288 (14/36): "Someone said, `What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?' The Master said, `With what then will you recompense kindness? Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness.' " Tz?-lu said, "If a person treats me well, I will also treat him well. If a person does not treat me well, I will not treat him well." 296 Tz?-kung said, "If a person treats me well, I will also treat him well. If a person does not treat me well, I will bring him around. It is simply a matter of adapting oneself."2 2 : lit., "advancing or retreating" as necessary. Yen Hui said, "If a person treats me well, I will also treat him well. If a person does not treat me well, I will still treat him well." The three disciples differing among themselves in what they advocated, asked the Master about it. He said, "What Yu advocates3 3 For read with B, C; likewise below, where all texts write . (Chou, Chao 216.) is appropriate to the Man and Mai barbarians; what Tz`? advocates is appropriate to friends; what Hui advocates is appropriate to relatives." The Ode says,4 4 Shih 80 No. 49/1. This man is all vicious,5 5 : read for with CHy after Shih k`ao 7b. And I consider him my brother! 81 1 Abridged from YTCC 7.3b-4b; 1.6a-b gives a variant account. Hsin hsü 6.3a-4a is primarily based on YTCC, but twice uses a phrase which otherwise appears only in HSWC. Duke Ching of Ch`i gave himself over to wine. Drunk, he loosened his clothes and cap, and [began] to play on a lute for his own enjoyment. Turning to his attendants, he said, "Does the perfectly good (jen) man also take pleasure in this sort of thing?"2 2 Cf. Mencius 127 (1A/2.1): . His attendants said, "The ears and eyes of the man who is perfectly good are like those of other people; why should he not enjoy it?" Duke Ching said, "Send a carriage to fetch Yen-tz?." Yen-tz? had heard [of what was going on], and came dressed in court costume. Duke Ching said, "Today I have been enjoying this, and I would like to share [my pleasure] with the Great Officers. [Let us dispense with propriety (li).]"3 3 Supply with CHy from Hsin hsü; likewise YTCC. (Chao 216.) 29720 Yen-tz? said, "What Your Highness proposes is wrong. In the state of Ch`i, men of five ch`ih4 4 Not quite four feet. A was .231 m. in Han times; cf. Dubs, HFHD, loc. cit. and upwards [in height] are all of them strong enough to overcome you or me. The reason they do not dare do so is out of respect for propriety (li). Truly, if the Son of Heaven lacks propriety, he will have no means of protecting the altars of Earth and Grain; if the feudal lords lack propriety, they will have no means of protecting their states. If those in a superior position lack propriety, they will have no way of employing those under them. If those in a subordinate position lack propriety, they will have no way of serving their superiors. If the Great Officers lack propriety, they will have no way of keeping their own houses in order. If brothers lack propriety, they will be unable to live together. If a common man lacks propriety, he had best quickly die."5 5 : paraphrased from Shih 85 No. 52/3 (also quoted at the end). Duke Ching, shamefaced, got off the mat and made his excuses, "I am devoid of goodness (jên). I have been brought to this by evil attendants who befuddled me with drink. Let me put the attendants to death to make good their transgression." Yen-tz? said, "The attendants have transgressed in nothing. If Your Highness were fond of propriety, then men with propriety would come to you, while those lacking propriety would leave. If you dislike propriety, then those lacking propriety will come, while men with propriety will leave. Of what crime are the attendants guilty?" Duke Ching approved, and, having changed his clothes, took his seat. When the wine beaker had three times passed around, Yen-tz? took his leave. Duke Ching escorted him out, bowing. The Ode says,6 6 Ibid. If a man observes no propriety, Why does he not quickly die? 298 91 1 This exchange of pleasantries is probably intended as a specimen of Wei-yen "insinuations," for which cf. Shih chi 46.9b-10b (Mém. hist. 5.246-9). There is a tradition that T`ang I-jo [once] knocked at Confucius' gate and said, "Is Ch`iu at home? Is Ch`iu at home?" Tz?-kung answered, "The superior man honors the worthy and bears with all. He praises the good and pities the incompetent.2 2 Analects 340 (19/3). His affection for his family extends to outsiders. What he does not want done to himself, he does not do to others.3 3 Ibid. 251 (12/2), 301 (15/23). Why do you use my teacher's given name?" T`ang I-jo said, "Why do you who are so immature speak rudely?"4 4 . In Tz?-kung's answer there is a pun on "abrupt, rude," and "bind, wrap"; cf. Analects 208 (8/2.1): "straightforwardness, without li, becomes rudeness." These same lines occur in the exchange between Tsou chi and Ch`un-yü K`un in Shih chi, loc. cit. (?) Tz?-kung said, "If a large chariot is not made tight,4 4 . In Tz?-kung's answer there is a pun on "abrupt, rude," and "bind, wrap"; cf. Analects 208 (8/2.1): "straightforwardness, without li, becomes rudeness."

In Tz?-kung's answer there is a pun on "abrupt, rude," and "bind, wrap"; cf. Analects 208 (8/2.1): "straightforwardness, without li, becomes rudeness." These same lines occur in the exchange between Tsou chi and Ch`un-yü K`un in Shih chi, loc. cit. so I responded with rudeness."4 4 . In Tz?-kung's answer there is a pun on "abrupt, rude," and "bind, wrap"; cf. Analects 208 (8/2.1): "straightforwardness, without li, becomes rudeness." These same lines occur in the exchange between Tsou chi and Ch`un-yü K`un in Shih chi, loc. cit. T`ang I-jo said, "At first I had the strength of a wild goose, but now I simply flap my wings in vain." Tz?-kung said, "Without the strength of a wild goose, how can5 5 B, C, D have before . you lift your wings?" The Ode says,6 6 Shih 91 No. 55/1. As from the knife and the file, As from the chisel and the polisher. 101 1 An expanded version of YTCC 7.15a-b. SY 9.14b-15b follows YTCC. Duke Ching of Ch`i went on a shooting expedition to the lake at Chao-hua. Yen Têng-chü,2 2 . TPYL 832.6a has cho for ; YTCC and SY have Chu-ch`u. For the several theories about the identity of the person (or persons) so designated, cf. Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.2b-3a), Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 1294), Ch`üan Tsu-wang (Ching-shih wên-ta 7.9b-10a) and Chao 217-8, where these and other relevant sources are quoted at length. It is sufficient to point out that *ti?uk and *t?k could be interchanged phonetically, but not with *d'??ng; while *dz'i?u and *dz'i?u are interchangeable. who was in charge of the birds, lost 299 one. Duke Ching was angry and wanted to put him to death. Yen-tz? said, "Têng-chü is guilty of four crimes punishable by death. Please permit me to charge him with them before punishing him." Duke Ching said, "Granted." Yen-tz? said, "Têng-chü, you3 3 Supply with CHy from YTCC were in charge of the birds for our Prince, but you lost one. This is your first crime. You have caused our Prince to kill a man because of a bird. This is your second crime. You will be the cause of the feudal lords of the four [neighboring] states, when they get words of it, believing that our Prince values birds above his officers. This is your third crime. When the Son of Heaven hears of it; he will certainly degrade our Prince, so that the altars to Earth and Grain will be endangered, while [worship in] the ancestral temple will be broken off. This is your fourth crime. For these four crimes you deserve to be put to death without mercy.4 4 Cf. Shu ching 166. I would like to administer the punishment." Duke Ching said, "Stop! I too was at fault. I would like you, Master, to make my humble excuses." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 133 No. 80/2. In the state he holds to the right. 111 1 HFT 12.8a gives two versions of this story, and SY 14.11b-12a a third. There seems to be no direct filiation between these texts. Tso chuan 419-20 (Hsiang 3) has quite a different anecdote in which Hsieh Hu figures as the man who was recommended to a post by his enemy Ch`i Hsi , but died before he could take it. Chou thinks that HSWC and SY are recording a garbled version of that tale. It is probably safer to speak of variant traditions. Marquis Wên of Wei asked Hsieh Hu,2 2 SY has Duke Wên of Chin and Uncle Fan. HFT makes Chien Chu the interlocutor. "I am going to appoint a governor of Hsi-ho. Who is fitted for the place?" 300 Hsieh Hu said, "Ching Po-liu3 3 HFT has Hsing for ; SY has Yü Tz?-kao. (Chou.) is a worthy man and well enough fitted." Marquis Wên appointed Ching Po-liu governor of Hsi-ho.4 4 CHy follows TPYL 482.2a to write "Marquis Wên said, `Is he not your enemy?' He replied, `Your Highness asked about suitability, not about enemies.' Whereupon he appointed Ching Po-liu governor of Hsi-ho." SY is similar, and may have influenced the TPYL version. Ching Po-liu asked his attendants, "Who mentioned me to our Prince?" They all said, "It was Hsieh Hu." Ching Po-liu went to see Hsieh Hu and thanked him, saying, "You must have forgiven me my fault. For mentioning me to the prince, I respectfully and repeatedly bow my thanks." Hsieh Hu said, "Mentioning you was a public matter, but hating you is my private affair.5 5 . Omit with TPYL for better rhythm. (Chao 218.) The public matter has been discharged, but I hate you as before." He strung his bow and shot him. [Po-liu] ran ten steps and collapsed. [Hsieh Hu] may be called brave.6 6 I assume it is Hsieh Hu who is praised. "Brave" is hardly the adjective one would expect, and it may possibly refer to Po-liu, cf. HSWC 8/6. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 133 No. 80/2. In the state he holds to the right. 121 1 From LSCC 24.10b-11a. Hsin hsü 5.9b-10a varies slightly from LSCC and HSWC, quoting at the end from Shih 429 No. 235/3. CKCS 1.10a follows Hsin hsü. In Ch`u there was a man skilled in physiognomizing people. His predictions never failed,2 2 For read with Chou after LSCC and Hsin hsü. Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.3a) accounts for as a misreading of , the li-script form of . CKCS also has . (Chao 219.) and he was famous throughout the country. King Chuang summoned him to an audience and asked him about it. He replied, "I am not able to physiognomize people; it is a mater of being able to size up their friends. Take a commoner whose friends are all filial and fraternal, sincerely respectful and in awe of commands from their superiors—[with 301 friends] like this, his household will daily increase and he will always be comfortable. This is what I call a [common] man destined for good luck. Take one serving a prince, whose friends are all sincere and trustworthy, who conduct themselves properly and love the good—[with friends] like this, his activities daily flourish and he daily advances in office. (?) This is what I call an official destined for good luck. Take3 3 . Chou has supplied and from LSCC; they are lacking in the other editions of HSWC. a ruler among whose court ministers are many sages, and among whose attendants are many loyal men, so that whenever the ruler neglects or mismanages anything, all strive to correct and admonish him. [With supporters] like these, his state is daily more peaceful, the ruler is daily more respected, and his fame daily becomes more apparent. This is what I call a ruler destined for good luck. I am not able to physiognomize people; it is a matter of looking at their friends." The king approved. [King Chuang's]4 4 : understand . (Chou.) employment of sages and use of the able to establish his hegemony over the empire was probably derived from this.5 5 . Read for ; (Chou), also Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.7b-8a), who would go on to emend to . He confesses that there is no similarity in either form or sound of the two words, and the two further examples from HSWC 5/4 and 10/1 rather support Chao's (219-20) contention that has the meaning , though the example he cites from Mencius 337 (4B/30.3): hardly strengthens his argument. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 133 No. 80/3. That officer Is the ornament of the country. 13 Confucius went out for a stroll in the meadow of Shao-yüan. There was a woman standing in the middle of a marsh and weeping most bitterly. Confucius [thought it unusual and]1 1 CHy supplies from TPYL 55.4a and Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 55.32b; likewise KTCY 3. (Chao 220.) sent his disciples to make inquiries. They said, "Why do you weep so bitterly?" 302 The woman replied,2 2 Read before as in Li Shan's com. (CHy.) "Just now I was cutting milfoil for firewood when I lost my hairpin made of [a stalk of] milfoil. This is why I was grieved." The disciples said,3 3 For TPYL and Li Shan's com. have . (CHy); likewise KTCY, but TPYL 487.7b has . (Chao.) "To lose a milfoil hairpin when you are cutting milfoil for firewood—how is that a cause for grief?" The woman said, "It is not that I am unhappy at losing the [value of the] pin; [what grieves me is that]4 4 Supply from TPYL 55.4a and 688.5a, and Li Shan's com. (CHy.) KTCY has . (Chao.) I cannot forget the associations I had with it."5 5 KTCY adds "The Ode says, `The horse from Tai rejoices in the north wide; / The flying bird soars to his old nest.' Both are symbols for not forgetting old associations." This quotation is not from the Shih. The first of the "19 Old Poems" in Wên hsüan 29.1b reads "The horse from the Hu [country] rejoices in the north wind; / The bird from Yüeh builds its nest on a southern branch." Li Shan's com. quotes the above line as from HSWC, with "perch" for , and for . Again, in Wên hsüan 36.3b, he quotes as a line from HSWC. Chao is probably right in saying that the original Shih quotation must have been early lost from HSWC, and that before the T`ang someone had supplied the lines from the "Old Poem" as especially suitable. Later on, when it was felt to be out of place, it was expunged. 141 1 This differs considerably from Hsün-tz? 1.8b: "In learning the superior man lets it enter his ears and appear in his heart, spread through his four limbs and take form in his activity. One of his least words, of his slightest movements, can be taken as a rule. The mean man, however, in learning lets it enter his ear and ejects it through his mouth. Between mouth and ears there is only four inches. How can that suffice to ameliorate a body of seven ch`ih?" , . Traditionally, when the superior man hears of the Way, he lets it enter his ears and treasures it up in his heart. He illumines it with jên and protects it with sincerity. He puts it into practice according to i, and delivers it with complaisance. As a result none listens to him but with a receptive mind. When the mean man hears of the Way, he lets it enter his ears 303 and then ejects it through his mouth. It is simply a case of speech put to a perverted use. It is comparable to eating to repletion and then vomiting. Not only is that of no benefit to the body, but this also impairs the mind.2 2 The meaning is clear, but the logic is bad. It might be expanded to "as in the latter case, where the body fails to benefit from the food ingested only to be vomited up again, so in the former, there is no benefit to the mind—but what is worse, the mind actually suffers from the procedure." The Ode says,3 3 Shih 44 No. 29. How can he get his mind settled? 151 1 SY 15.8a-9b is amplified from this. Chia-yü 2.1a-2a is close to SY. Cf. also HSWC 7/25. Confucius was walking about on top of Mt. Jung with Tz?-kung, Tz?-lu, and Yen Yüan. With a sigh Confucius said, "May each of you, my disciples, express his ambition. I am going to examine them. How about you, Yu?" He replied, "[I would like] to get white plumes like the moon and red plumes like the sun.2 2 ? ? ? , in lieu of banners: cf. I li 5.35a: ?

(Dubs, HFHD, loc. cit.) of grain, I would cause the two states to be intimate as brothers." 304 Confucius said, "A sophist! Hui, what about you?" He replied, "Rotten fish are not kept in the same container with the lan-ch`ih plant.6 6 Lun-yü chüan-k`ao ch`an (quoted in TPYL 983.2a): , "Approach the lan plant and it smells good; approach a rotten fish and it stinks." Chieh and Chou do not rule at the same time as Yao and Shun. These two have spoken, so how can I speak?" 7. The text is defective. (CHy.) Chou suggests emending to "Why do you speak so humbly?" Confucius said, "Hui has a humble mind. . ." (?) Yen Yüan said, "I would like to get to be minister to an enlightened king or a saintly ruler. I would have no walls built nor moats or ditches dug. Yin and yang would be [kept] in equilibrium. [Every] family would have sufficient, [every] man would have enough. I would melt down the weapons in storage to make agricultural implements." Confucius said, "A great officer! Yu might come confident, but what attacks would you be making? Tz`? might come loquacious,8 8 : cf. Analects 311 (16/4): : "specious airs" and "glib-tongued." but what use would you have for him? I would like to have an official's robe9 9 Emend to . (Chou.) and cap and be your steward." 161 1 From Tao tê ching B.4b-5a. The sage does not suffer shame that he may eat, or endure disgrace that he may succeed. Lao-tz? said, Fame or one's self, which matters to one most? One's own self or things bought, which should count most? In the getting or the losing, which is worse? Hence2 2 is not in Tao tê ching. he who grudges expense pays dearest in the end; He who has hoarded most will suffer the heaviest loss. Be content with what you have and are, and no one can despoil you: Who stops in time nothing can harm. He is forever safe and secure.3 3 Waley, The Way and Its Power 197. What is most perfect seems to have something missing, 305 Yet its use is unimpaired. What is most full seems empty; Yet its use will never fail. What is most straight seems crooked;4 4 Tao tê ching has for . (Chou.) [The greatest skill seems like clumsiness,]5 5 . HSWC omits this line. The greatest eloquence seems like stuttering.6 6 Waley, op. cit. 198. Yet their use is not impaired.7 7 : this line is not in Tao tê ching. No fault is greater than desiring much,8 8 . Tao tê ching has for , and Waley translates, "No lure is greater than to possess what others want." No disaster greater than not to be content with what one has.9 9 HSWC here omits the line . Truly, he who has once known the contentment that comes simply through being content, will never again be otherwise than contented.10 10 Waley, loc. cit. 171 1 LNC 1.16a-b in recasting this anecdote has toned it down somewhat. Mencius' wife was alone and in a squatting position. Mencius entered the door and saw her. He told his mother, "My wife has no sense of propriety (li), and I would like to send her away." His mother said, "How is that?" "She was squatting." His mother said, "How do you know?" Mencius said, "I saw her myself." His mother said, "Then it is you who have no sense of propriety, not she. Do not the rules of propriety say, `When you are about to enter a gate [you should ask who is there],2 2 Supply from LNC. (CHy, Chou.) when you are going to ascend the hall you must make a noise, and when you are going to enter a door you must look down,3 3 The prescriptions for ascending the hall and for entering a door occur in Li chi 1.5b. I cannot locate a source for , etc. so that you do not take by surprise a person who is unprepared? Now you went into a place of retirement, entering the door without making a sound, so as 306 to catch sight of a person squatting. In this you acted improperly; it is not your wife who was improper." Thereupon Mencius took the blame on himself and did not dare send his wife away. The Ode says,4 4 Shih 55 No. 35/1. When we gather the mustard plant and earth melons, We do not reject them because of their roots.5 5 For Shih-k`ao 6b has . (Chao.) Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung believes this was the Han shih reading, but as a phonetic loan word for the of Mao shih. 181 1 Shih chi 47.13a (Mém. hist. 5.337-8) gives another version. Chia-yü 5.23a-b follows Shih chi with slight modifications. Chavannes (op. cit. 338-40, note 6) translates the HSWC passage. Confucius left [the capital of] Wei by the east gate and met Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing.2 2 Hsün-tz? 3.1a mentions Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing as a famous physiognomist. He said, "My disciples, draw my chariot aside. A man is coming who will undoubtedly [want to] physiognomize me. Pay attention [to what he says]." Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing also said, "My disciples, draw my chariot aside. A saint is coming." Confucius got down and walked. Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing came to meet him, and for fifty paces regarded him. Then he followed him for fifty paces, looking at him. He turned to Tz?-kung and said, "Who is this man?" Tz?-kung said, "He is my teacher. His name is K`ung Ch`iu, of Lu." Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing said, "So that is K`ung Ch`iu of Lu! I have certainly heard of him." Tz?-kung said, "How does my teacher impress you?" Ku-pu Tz?-ch`ing said, "He has Yao's forehead and Shun's eyes,3 3 Shun, like Yao, had eyes with double pupils; cf. Hsün-tz? 3.3a: , and Yang Liang's com. (Chou.) Yü's neck and Kao-yao's mouth.4 4 Hsün-tz? says, "Kao-yao had the appearance of a split mellon." . (Chou.) Viewed from the front he is complete as though he possessed territory.5 5 is corrupt. (Chao 222.) Emend to after KTCY 2.1a (No.11). "One in possession of territory" is one who rules a fief, hence Chavannes' "semble quelqu'un qui doit regner" is not far off. Viewed from the 307 back, he has high shoulders and a weak back;6 6 KTCY adds . only in this is he inferior to [those] saints." Tz?-kung sighed. Ku-pu Tz?-ching said, "What are you worried about? For his unprepossessing face7 7 : see notes 3, 4 above; cf. also Huai-nan tz? 16.16a: "King Wên had a sunken chest" (Hsü Shên's com.: ). Hsün-tz? 3.2b says, "Chung-ni had a small, square face" (?) (Yang Liang's com.) . (Chou.) he is not hated, nor is he employed for his reed mouth8 8 is given only for this passage by PWYF. I do not understand its force here. (?). Viewed from afar he is uneasy9 9 : Shih chi has ; Chia-yü and I take in that sense. as the dog in a house of mourning. What are you grieved about? What are you grieved about?" Tz?-kung reported this to Confucius, who found nothing to disclaim, excepting only [the part about] the dog in a house of mourning. He said, "How should I dare?" Tz?-kung said, " `For his unprepossessing face he is not hated, nor is he employed for his reed mouth'; this I understand. I do not understand why you should disclaim that about the dog in a house of mourning." The Master said, "Tz`?, have you never seen the dog in a house of mourning? After [the body] is put into the coffin, and that put into the outer coffin, vessels are set out for the sacrifice.10 10 For Pei Yin's com. on Shih chi has "there is the mat for the sacrifice." Chou prefers that reading. Everywhere [the dog] looks, no one is about, and he has the idea of wanting to let himself go.11 11 . Chavannes translates, "il a l'intention de veiller a tout (c'est-a-dire que, en l'absence de toute personne vaquant aux occupations habituelles de la famille, c'est le chien qui sent qu'il doit veiller à tout)." This makes good sense, but I do not find with the meaning "to watch over." If the dog "extends himself" it may come to the same thing, or possibly it implies that he can indulge his proclivities for taking what ordinarily is forbidden him. (?) Above there is no enlightened king and below no sage overseers of provinces;12 12 is superfluous. (Chou.) KTCY lacks it, (Chao), and I omit it in the translation. the Kingly Way is declining, government and teaching are lost. The strong oppress the weak and the many are cruel to the few. The people give rein to their desires and no one can regulate them. That man certainly 308 took me as one who wishes to play that part.13 13 Here there must be a reflection of the recurring theme in Kung-yang chuan 5.3b (and passim; cf. Combined Concordances s.v. ): ? . "No Son of Heaven above, no overseers below, and the feudal lords of the empire destroying one another:—let anyone whose strength is enough to save them, save them; it will be all right." How should I dare?" 191 1 SY 10.19a-b varies from this passage, which in part at least is in rhyme: *no, *li?o, *pi?wo; mi?w?r, *ti?w?r; *må, *sio. Self-improvement is something about which one must be careful. If desires are extravagant, conduct will be deficient. If slander is indulged in, perfection will be impaired. Trouble is born from anger, and disaster arises from trifles. Shame and disgrace are hard to wash away; defeat and loss cannot be again made good. If you do not think deeply and do not exercise far-sighted care, what good will remorse be? Hoping for good luck is the axe that cuts down a man's nature; desire is the horse that gallops after disaster; boasting is the path that leads to disaster; slandering others is the dwelling place of poverty. For this reason the superior man expels false hopes of good luck,2 2 . Chou has emended to from SY; all other texts have . A verb balances better with the following phrases. regulates his desires, and devotes himself to being sincere and trustworthy. He does not slander anyone, and so his name is venerated and he is called a superior man. The Ode says,3 3 Shih 60 No. 37/2. Why do they rest without stirring? It must be they expect allies. 20 The way of living of the superior man is soft as comforting furs,1 1 : PWYF gives only this example. as stable as an inverted cup.2 2 : cf. Shih chi 65.16b: . (Chao 223.) When the empire has the True Way, the feudal lords are in awe of him; when the empire is 309 without the True Way, the common people are comfortable in his presence.3 3 : or, "commoners take his place," but this gives no sense in context. Not today only, but since antiquity it has been thus. Of old when Fan Li went on his wanderings, he lived in a shambles in Ch`i.4 4 There seems to be a hiatus in the text after this line. Both Shih chi 129.3b and Han shu 91.4a tell of Fan Li's success in making a fortune in Ch`i, but in neither of these accounts, nor in Kuo yü, WYCC, nor Yüeh chüeh shu do I find any mention of his dwelling in a slaughter house. . . . (?) . . . Suddenly there is a supernatural transformation,5 5 : lit., a "dragon transformation"; cf. Shih chi 28.29b . jên and i are agitated,6 6 : lit., "sink and float." vast and comprehensive, Heaven and Earth share his grief. (?) Hence, how can the place where the superior man dwells be static? The Ode says,7 7 Shih 166 No. 109. My heart is grieved; Who knows [the cause of] it?" 211 1 Shih chi 44.3a-b (Mém. hist. 5.138-9) has this story in a slightly different form. SY 8.18a-b follows Shih chi, with a few locutions from HSWC. Chavannes, loc. cit., translates both the HSWC version and SY 10.10b-11a, giving yet another anecdote of an interview between T`ien Tz?-fang and the Heir Apparent; cf. HSWC 6/2. T`ien Tz?-fang went to Wei, and the Heir Apparent of Wei met him in the suburbs of the capital with an escort of a hundred chariots. The Heir Apparent bowing twice, welcomed T`ien Tz?-fang who did not ascend from his own chariot. The Heir Apparent was displeased and said, "May I enquire how it is you can treat another person arrogantly?" T`ien Tz?-fang said, "I have heard that there have been those who have made [possession of] the empire a pretext for being arrogant toward others and who lost [the empire].2 2 CHy here adds "and that there have been those who were arrogant toward others because of [ruling] one state, and who lost [their states]" from TPYL 773.3b-4a; likewise 498.1a-b. (Chao 224.) Viewed in this light, a poor and humble person may be arrogant toward others. If he does not get what he wants, he has only to put on 310 his shoes3 3 For CHy writes after TPYL 773.4a (498.1b also has , but with ). It is the Sung ed. of *TPYL (773.3b) that has ; the Pao ed. has ?m m For this character, see the table on p. 358. , a vulgar form of "take in the hand." Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.8a-b) remarks that makes no sense, as one does not walk carrying one's shoes, while "hand over" is still worse. He goes on to list several possible emendations, none of them very convincing. Chao (225) tentatively suggests as in HSWC 2/22. Shih chi has "as easily as taking off a slipper." I have followed SY: . and go to Ch`in or Ch`u. Where should he go that he would not be able to be poor and humble?" Whereupon the Heir Apparent bowed twice and withdrew to the rear. T`ien Tz?-fang never did descend from his chariot. 22 Tai Chin-shêng, in a worn gown and cap, went to see the King of Liang, who said, "Some time ago I invited you [to serve me] with the salary of a Great Officer of upper rank, but you would not stay. And now you have come to me?" Tai Chin-shêng laughed merrily, then looking up with a long sigh, he said, "Alas, from this I see that Your Highness has never been worth associating with. Have you not seen the pheasant in a large marsh?1 1 : CHy is probably right in suggesting the demonstrative for . Every five steps he pecks [at the ground], and only at the end of the day is he full. His feathers are rich and glossy,2 2 Cf. *I lin 12.21a: , ? , . "On coming to water, the wild duck dives in. Happily he preens himself, and his feathers become rich and glossy." glistening and shining under the sun and moon. He flaps his wings and sings arrogantly, so that the sound echoes from the hills and through the marsh. Why does he do so? Because he enjoys what he wants. If you take him away and put him inside a granary, so that he is constantly pecking up millet, he will be full before the sun is up. But his feathers will be dull and bedraggled, and his appetite and ch`i increasingly decline. He hangs his head and does not sing. Is it possibly because his food is not good? It is because he has not what he wants. Now when I have not counted it far to come a thousand li3 3 Cf. Mencius 125 (1A/1.2). to be with Your 311 Highness, was it possibly because [otherwise] my food would have been insufficient? It was simply because I ventured to admire your principles. I used to think you were fond of gentlemen, and without a peer in the empire. Now I clearly see that you are not fond of gentlemen." Taking his leave he departed, and never came back again. 231 1 LNC 2.24a-b is similar. King Chuang of Ch`u sent a messanger to visit Master Pei-kuo2 2 LNC has Ling Tz?-chung. (CHy, Chou.) and present him with a hundred chin3 3 One = 244 g. in Han times. (Cf. Dubs, HFHD, loc. cit.) Unless hyperbole is intended, I suspect there must be an error in either the weight or the material. A hundred is more likely; cf. HSWC 2/21. LNC has . of gold. Master [Pei-kuo] said, "I have a dustpan-and-broom servant, and I would like to go in and consult with her." To his wife he said, "Ch`u wants me for its minister. Should I be minister today, immediately I will have horses harnessed four abreast and a mounted escort,4 4 . The usual cliché for an ostentatious equipage has for ; cf. LNC, Shih chi 67.16a. and food spread before me over ten cubits square.5 5 Cf. Mencius 496 (7B/34.2). How about it?" His wife said, "You, Master, gain your living by weaving straw sandals. You eat gruel and have a small income6 6 : I do not find this expression elsewhere. It might mean "skilled at [making] sandals." (?), but you are without apprehensive worry. How is this if not from having nothing to do with affairs? Now though you have horses harnessed four abreast and a mounted escort,7 7 D here has for ; see note 4. still the place you occupy is only [the room] taken up by your knees; and though you may have food spread out before you over ten cubits square, the only dish you would enjoy especially would be meat.8 8 He has been restricted to a gruel diet. For the comfort of room for your knees and the flavor of a meat dish is it right to take on the worries of the state of Ch`u regardless of your own safety?" As a result he did not reply to the offer, but went away with his wife. The Ode says,9 9 Shih 209 No. 139/3. 312 That beautiful, virtuous lady Can respond to you in conversation. 241 1 HFT 3.5b-6a (Liao 1.85-8) gives a longer version of this story. SY 20.9a-10b is a modification of HFT. Shih chi 5.15b-17a (Mém. hist. 2.40-3) has another, apparently independent, version. There is a tradition that of old the Jung barbarians sent Yu-yü on a mission to Ch`in. Duke Mu of Ch`in asked him concerning the essentials of success and failure [in a state]. He replied, "Those who held their states in ancient times without exception did it through respect and economy. Those who lost their states did so through arrogance and extravagance." Yu-yü continued with a discussion of the causes of the decline of the Five Emperors and the Three Kings2 2 : cf. HSWC 5/9, note 4. CHy writes , which ordinarily would precede the . In the HFT version Yao, Shun, and Yü are discussed, but not the . Shih chi mentions only Huang-ti, while SY brings in the Hsia, the Shang, and the Chou. and ended up with the conditions that resulted in the perishing of the common people.3 3 is not a usual cliché; it is rather the ruler who loses his state. (?) Duke Mu agreed with what he said. Afterwards he reported to the Nei-shih, Wang Mu,4 4 For read with CHy after Li Shan's com. on Wên hsüan 51.19a; likewise HFT, SY, and Shih chi. "The existence in a neighboring state of a sage is the worry of its opponents. Yu-yü is a sage. What are we to do?" Wang Mu said, "The king of the Jung lives in a rustic, out-ofthe-way place and has never experienced the sounds and sights of the Middle Kingdom. Let Your Highness present him with female musicians to deprave his mind and throw his government into confusion. His subjects will certainly be alienated. To this end, ask on Yu-yü's behalf to postpone the date [of his return], so that separation between prince and minister may be effected. After that we can put our schemes into practice." Duke Mu approved and had Wang Mu send two troupes of female musicians to the king of the Jung and ask on behalf of Yu-yü that the period [of his visit be prolonged]. The King of the Jung was delighted and granted the request. Whereupon he set out wine and listened to music, not resting day or night. By 31321 the end of the year he was dissolute and abandoned. Many of his men and horses died.5 5 : HFT has , and SY adds . For the ruler of a pastoral people that fits well enough, but makes no good sense. I suspect it is a mistake for either or . When Yu-yü came back he remonstrated in vain several times and then left for Ch`in. Duke Mu of Ch`in met him and conferred on him [the post of] prime minister. As a result [Ch`in] annexed twelve states and opened up a thousand li of territory. 6The other texts have for ; Chou has emended from SY. 25 Tz?-hsia went to see1 1 For this use of cf. HSWC 4/4, 9/29. Tsêng-tz?, who said, "Come in and eat."2 2 : TPYL 847.5b has "Tsêng-tz? fed him" (CHy); likewise Shu-ch`ao 143.6b. (Chao 226.) Tz?-hsia said, "Is it not putting you to [unnecessary] expense?" Tsêng-tz? said, "The superior man has three [unnecessary] expenditures, but food and drink are not among them. The superior man has three joys,3 3 Pun on lo "joy" and yüeh "music." but gongs and sonorous stones, lute and cither are not among them." Tz?-hsia said, "I venture to ask about the three joys." Tsêng-tz? said, "Having parents to stand in awe of, a prince to serve, and a son to leave behind—this is the first joy. Having parents to remonstrate with, a prince to leave, and a son to be angry with—this is the second joy. Having a prince to make things clear to, and friends to help—this is the third joy." Tz?-hsia said, "I venture to ask about the three expenditures." Tsêng-tz? said, "To study when young and forget when adult —this is the first expenditure. To serve one's prince with merit and be lightly repudiated—this is the second expenditure. For a long time to have friendly relations and then to break them off suddenly4 4 Cf. HSWC 9/3. —this is the third expenditure." Tz?-hsia said, "Excellent! Carefully to emulate one [wise] saying is better than continually reciting it,5 5 Cf. Analects 225 (9/26.3) and Legge's note on . and to serve one 314 gentleman (?) is better than the merit of governing all the people6 6 *dzi?ung and *kung rhyme. I suspect that the second line is defective. —this is something a man must know. I once let my fields go to grass (?) and for a whole year I got no harvest.7 7 ?n n For this character, see the table on p. 358. . CHy and Chou both take ? n n For this character, see the table on p. 358. as = , and punctuate after : "I was once uncultivated in this, and all year I tilled without getting any harvest." (?) If I have correctly understood their reading, I fail to see how it fits into the argument. My translation leaves out of account the . When this is true of all land, how much the more it is so of men! If you are sincere with men, though they be far away, they will be intimate, and if you are false with them, even close associates will be alienated. Meeting sincerity with sincerity is like glue, is like lacquer. Meeting falseness with falseness is like thin ice exposed to the noonday sun. Can the superior man do anything but bear this in mind?" The Ode says,8 8 Shih 254 No. 165/1. Treat him as holy and hearken to him; And you will have harmony and peace. 261 1 YTCC 8.35a applies the story to Yen-tz?'s wife. Another version occurs in YTCC 6.43a (Forke, Yen Ying, 122). Yen-tz?'s wife sent on an errand a man dressed in cotton cloth with hempen border. T`ien Wu-yü criticised him saying, "Who is that fellow who [just] came out of the house?" Yen-tz? said, "He is a household servant." T`ien Wu-yü said, "With the position of chung-ch`ing and sustenance fields [to the number of] seven hundred thousand, why do you keep such a person in your employ?" Yen-tz? said, "To discharge the old and choose the young is termed blindness. When rich to forget the poor is termed disorder. To be carried away by the sight of physical beauty is termed perversity. How should I take the way of perversity, disorder, and blindness?" 315 27 When first the phoenix rises, the sparrow1 1 CHy adds "on the bamboo fence" from TPYL 922.5b, which has "soaring aloft 1000 li" for . capable only of fluttering along for ten paces chirrups his laughter; but when [the phoenix] has mounted on high,2 2 For CHy has "the Eastern suburbs" after TPYL. (Chao 226-7.) one curve, one straightening,3 3 . and he soars among the clouds.4 4 : TPYL has "revolves among the clouds." (CHy.) The sparrow on the bamboo fence5 5 For read with CHy after TPYL; see note 1. in despair realizes himself unable to get so far. The gentleman clad in coarse cloth and wearing hemp-quilted garments, of which he never possessed a sufficiency, and subsisting on coarse grain and vegetables, of which he has never eaten his fill,6 6 Cf. HSWC 2/25, where the sentence is applied to Tsêng-tz?, and notes 3 and 4. is considered by the common man merely to be in a shameful condition. But when he comes out [of retirement], he settles the hundred discussions; when he is employed, he prolongs the life of the people; and the common man in despair realizes himself unable to get so far. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 224 No. 152/4. He rectifies the people of his state:— May he continue for ten thousand years! 28 The king of Ch`i offered his daughter with a rich dowry in marriage to Butcher T`u.1 1 ; properly "Beef butcher T`u." Ch`u-hsüeh chi 19.7b, TPYL 382.6b have . (CHy.) Butcher T`u declined on the pretext of illness. His friend said,2 2 : Ch`u-hsüeh chi and TPYL have "urged him" before . (CHy.) "You will just be in a stinking shop to the end of your life. Why did you refuse him?" T`u answered, "His daughter is ugly." His friend said, "How do you know?" T`u said, "From my butchery I know it." His friend said, "What do you mean?" 316 T`u said, "When my meat is good I can dispose of it [by weight] and regret only that there is too little.3 3 For read ? with CHy after TPYL and Ch`u-hsüeh chi.

Now if he offers his daughter with a rich dowry, it is simply because she is ugly." Later on his friend saw her, and she really was ugly. As the saying has it, Eyes like apricots split open, Teeth like a file of slugs.5 5 "teeth like shells in a row." Chu I-tung (quoted by Chao 227-8) points out that this metaphor is frequently employed of a person's beauty, and so is not appropriate here. The quotation of this line in Lu T`ien's Pei ya reads "insect larva" for , and I follow Chu to emend to that reading. Chao in adition cites TPYL 382.6b, which has "crab," a possible graphic error for *g'?ng and *?i?ang rhyme. 29 There is a tradition that Confucius went to see K`ang-tz? with Tz?-chang and Tz?-hsia following. Confucius went in and sat down, while the two disciples got into a discussion that was [still] not settled by the end of the day. Tz?-hsia's speech and expression1 1 For cf. Analects 209 (8/4.3). (ch`i) were choked to a degree and his countenance was greatly altered. Tz?-chang said, "You have surely heard our Master in a discussion? He speaks slowly and gently, and deports himself gravely and respectfully. He speaks after first being silent. When he makes a point, he pushes [the other] forward and makes way for him. Majestic and vast, his is a Way to turn to. The mean man, in discussions, is jealous of his own ideas and insists he is in the right. He declares the other to be wrong, and, his eyes glaring with anger, he seizes his wrist and spurts out [a stream of] rapid words. His mouth froths, his eyes are inflamed. Once he has the good luck to come out ahead in the argument, he bursts out with a hee! hee! of laughter. In gravity and deportment he is vulgar; his speech and expression2 are low. That is why the superior man despises him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">317 CHAPTER X 11 1 YTCC 1.16a-b attributes this encounter to Duke Ching, with Yen-tz? along to interpret the countryman's remarks. There is little verbal identity with HSWC or with Hsin hsü 4.9a-b, which follows HSWC fairly closely. Duke Huan of Ch`i pursued a white deer to the state of Maich`iu, where he met a man. [The Duke] said, "Who are you?"2 2 For CHy follows TPYL 736.3a to write ; Hsin hsü also has . Fragmentary citations from this paragraph occur also in TPYL 906.5a-b and 383.4a. The former writes and , possibly influenced by YTCC. Both "citations" are no more than extremely condensed paraphrases. The case is a good illustration of the danger of relying on such sources for the reconstruction of lost texts, where any control is usually lacking. An integral quotation such as that in TPYL 736.3a of course is more useful, but even here there are many omissions and variants, not all of which would have had textual justification. The man replied, "I am a native3 3 For the TPYL citations consistently write as in YTCC. Chu Ch`ifêng (TT 449) shows the two words are continually interchanged in old books. (Chao 239.) of Mai-ch`iu." Duke Huan said, "What is your age, old man?" He replied, "My age is 83."4 4 YTCC has 85. Duke Huan said, "A fine old age,"5 5 Add after with TPYL 736.3a, Lei-chü 18.26a; likewise Hsin hsü. YTCC has only . (Chao.) and drank with him, saying, "Old man, why not drink my health?" He replied, "This rustic person does not know how rulers'6 6 CHy would emend to "my ruler." healths are drunk." Duke Huan said, "Why not apply your [form of] drinking a health to me?" The native raised his cup, bowed twice and said, "May my Prince live long indeed. May gold and jade be cheap [in his eyes],7 7 Chao (230) and CHy would emend to in the phrase to agree with TPYL 906.5b, Hsin hsü, and the following . TPYL 737.3a retains but completely alters the construction by prefixing . and the people valuable." 318 Duke Huan said, "An excellent wish. I have heard that `perfect virtue is not solitary,'8 8 Cf. Analects 172 (4/25). fine sayings must be in pairs. Why not repeat it?"9 9 For ? "improve on it," read as suggested by Chou and Chao to agree with TPYL 736.3a, Hsin hsü and YTCC. The man raised his cup, bowed twice and said, "May my Prince love learning10 10 : delete "gentlemen." (Chou.) and not dislike to ask questions. May there be sages by his side, and may those with remonstrances have access to him." Duke Huan said, "An excellent wish! I have heard that `perfect virtue is not solitary,' fine words must be in threes. Why not repeat it?"9 9 For ? "improve on it," read as suggested by Chou and Chao to agree with TPYL 736.3a, Hsin hsü and YTCC. The man raised his cup, bowed twice and said, "May his ministers and people not offend against my Prince, and may my Prince not offend against his ministers and people." Duke Huan was not pleased and said, "This speech is not so good as those first two.11 11 Chou would emend to "not the equal" after Hsin hsü. I follow TPYL, loc. cit., to read . (CHy.) May you change it." The man burst into tears and said, "I hope Your Highness will think about it carefully. This one speech is superior to the first two. I have heard that a son who offends against his father can ask pardon through his aunt or his sisters, after which his father will forgive him. If a subject offend against his prince he can ask pardon through [the prince's] attendants, after which prince will forgive him. Of old Chieh offended against [T`ang, and Chou offended against King Wu. These were princes who offended against their]12 12 . The text should be expanded to the TPYL reading: (CHy). Chou would add substantially the same words from Hsin hsü. subjects. Down to the present [such] have never had anyone to ask pardon on their behalf." Duke Huan said, "Good. I owe it to the good fortune brought me by my ancestral temple and the spiritual power of the altars to Heaven and Earth that I got to meet you here." He helped him [into his chariot] and rode off with him, driving the chariot himself 319 on the way back. He presented him in the ancestral temple and then put him in charge of governmental affairs. Duke Huan owed his bringing together the feudal lords and uniting the empire without the force of arms not only to Kuan Chung but also to this meeting. The Ode says,13 13 Shih 429 No. 235/3. Numerous is the array of officers, And by them King Wên enjoys his repose. 21 1 Kuo yü 8.3a-b and Kuan-tz? 8.3a are mutually very close, each beginning with "When Duke Huan returned to Ch`i from Chü..." HSWC seems to have followed the former as may be seen in the places where the two texts differ, e. g., in Kuo yü for Kuan-tz? , but there is some evidence that both texts were available to Han Ying; cf. note 3. Pao Shu in recommending Kuan Chung said, "There are five things in which I am not the equal of Kuan I-wu.2 2 I. e., Kuan Chung. In generous giving and mild love3 3 : Kuan-tz?, ; Kuo yü, . I am not his equal. In loyalty and trustworthiness that attach him to the people,4 4 Likewise Kuo Yü; Kuan-tz? has for . Both Kuo yü and Kuan-tz? precede this with . (Readings in brackets are from Kuan-tz?.) I am not his equal. In managing li and making laws binding in the four quarters [of the empire]5 5 Kuo yü and Kuan-tz? differ from HSWC: . I am not his equal. In deciding lawsuits equitably I am not his equal.6 6 This sentence is lacking in Kuo yü and Kuan-tz?. In seizing drumstick and drum and taking a stand at the gate of the military camp to inspire troops with valor7 7 Kuo yü is identical except for writing in place of . Kuan-tz? is rather different, but also has . I am not his equal." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 429 No. 235/3. Numerous is the array of officers, And by them King Wên enjoys his repose. 320 31 1 Kuo yü 10.17a and Tso chuan (Hsi 24) in closely parallel passages both apply the analogy of the inverted heart to the Shu, T`ou-hsü , Ch`ung-êrh's treasurer, who according to Tso chuan, fled with the valuables from the treasury and spent them all working for Ch`ung-êrh's return. In this version T`ou-hsü gets his interview by arguing that those who served the Duke at home were as deserving as those who followed him into exile. Hsin hsü 5.3a-b has produced a story in general similar to HSWC, but modified by themes from the Kuo-yü—Tso chuan version. Chang Kuo-chuan (Hsin hsü chiao-chu 46-7) is of the opinion that Hsin hsü is based on HSWC. When Ch`ung-êrh, the Duke Wên of Chin, had traveled in exile to Ts`ao, Li Fu-hsü2 2 Liang Yü-shêng (Jên piao k`ao 4.15b-16a) identifies him with the of Tso chuan and Kuo yü, the latter being the form occurring in the Jên-piao of the Han-shu. he explains as "the official title of persons still uncapped" . He would make (*d'u) and (*b'u) interchangeable on doubtful phonetic grounds. he thinks was the man's clan name. Chao (231) prefers this explanation to that of Chu Ch`i-fêng (TT 310), where is taken to be a graphic variant of . accompanied him, and took advantage of the occasion to steal Ch`ung-êrh's provisions and flee. Ch`ung-êrh was without grain and so hungry he was unable to travel. Tz?-t`ui cut off flesh from his own thigh to feed Ch`ung-êrh, after which he was able to travel. When Ch`ung-êrh was restored to his state, there were many in the state who did not submit to him. Whereupon Li Fu-hsü came to him for an audience, saying, "I am able to establish peace in the state of Chin." Duke Wên sent a man to reply to him, "Do you still have the face to come see me, wanting to establish peace in the state of Chin?" Li Fu-hsü said, "Is the prince washing his hair?" The man3 3 For read with Hsin hsü (Chou); likewise below. said, "He is not." Li Fu-hsü said, "For I have heard that when a person washes his hair his heart is upside down and [so] his words are contrary [to what they would ordinarily be]. Now if the prince is not washing his hair, how does it happen his words are contrary?" The man reported this to Duke Wên, who granted him an audience. Li Fu-hsü raised his head and said, "You were long away from the country, and many of the ministers and people transgressed against Your Highness. Now that you have been 321 restored to your state, the people are all afraid for themselves. Now I, Li Fu-hsü, even plundered all of Your Highness' provisions and fled to the depths of the mountains, so that you suffered from hunger, and Chieh Tz?-t`ui [had to] cut [flesh] off his thigh. No one in the empire but has heard of it. My wrongdoing was so very great that punishment involving my relatives of the tenth degree would still be insufficient to wipe out my crime. But if Your Highness were sincerely to forgive my crime and ride together with me in a chariot through the country, seeing us, the people would know for a certainty that you harbored no old grudges, and men would be at ease about themselves." Whereupon Duke Wên, being greatly pleased, followed his plan and had him ride in his chariot through the country. When the people saw them, they all said, "If instead of punishing even Li Fu-hsü, he has him in his chariot, what have we to fear?" In this way the state of Chin enjoyed great contentment. Truly, as the Shu [ching] says,4 4 Shu ching 469 (5/15.9). "King Wên dressed meanly and gave himself to the work of tranquillization, and to that of husbandry." Guilt such as that of Li Fu-hsü, and no one to forgive it. . . .5 5 The text is defective (Chou), but this line is reminiscent of the argument in HSWC 10/1. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 429 No. 235/3. Numerous is the array of officers, And by them King Wên enjoys his repose. 41 1 A somewhat similar passage dealing with the admonitions addressed to a newly invested king by his ministers occurs in Hsün-tz? 19.5b-6a. The relationship of that account to the one in HSWC is not very clear; the style of the latter is considerably more archaic, reminiscent of the Shu; the text may be defective. There is a traditional account which tells of the difficulty of being a king: When the Heavenly Mandate arrives,2 2 I. e., on the accession of a new king. Hsün-tz? has . the T`aitsung, T`ai-shih, and T`ai-chu,3 3 In Hsün-tz?, the , and . dressed in plain clothes4 4 I. e., mourning clothes. They offer condolences because the king has just lost his father. and 322 holding their tablets, face north and offer condolences to the Son of Heaven. [The T`ai-tsung] says, "The Heavenly Mandate has arrived.5 5 None of this occurs in Hsün-tz?. What is to be done about the enduring cares [involved]?"6 6 . I follow Yang Liang; , . Hsün-tz? continues: "If evil can be expelled, there will be good fortune; if evil cannot be expelled, there will be harm." . Perhaps this should be supplied in the HSWC passage. And the first [minister] offers the Son of Heaven his tablet.7 7 : the bamboo tablet on which was inscribed the warning just read by the T`ai-tsung. (Yang Liang.) 8 Only the words and this last sentence occur in Hsün-tz?. The [T`ai-shih] says, "Respectfully present the offerings at the sacrifices. May you eternally rule by the Heavenly Mandate. May you be infinitely in awe of it. May your person dare not to rest." And the second [minister] offers the Son of Heaven his tablet. [The T`ai-chu] says, "May you night and day offer prayers. May your person be not idle. May the ten thousand people look to you." And the third [minister] offers the Son of Heaven his tablet. They say, "Let the Son of Heaven face the south and receive9 9 For read with CHy, C. the Imperial throne. May he take the government as his concern, and never take the throne as [intended for] his pleasure." The Ode says,10 10 Shih 432 No. 236/1. Heaven is not readily to be relied on;11 11 Read with CHy after Shih k`ao 46a (var ) for . The meaning is the same. It is not easy to be king. 5 The superior man seeks gentleness and moderation in jên; reverence and yielding he seeks in li. If he succeeds, he feels that he has done right, and if he fails, he feels that he has done right.1 1 Cf. Analects 142 (1/10.2), also *Li chi 17.4b: • . . . . . "Therefore, the superior man is courteous and economical, seeking to exercise jên, and sincere and humble in order to practice li. . . . If he succeed in doing so, he feels that he has done right; if he do not so succeed, he still feels that he has done right;—prepared to accept the will of Heaven concerning himself." (Legge 2.338.) 323 Thus the superior man in regard to the True Way is like the farmer tilling the fields. Though he get no great yield from the year's harvest, he will not change. Shan Fu, the King T`ai, had sons named T`ai-po, Chung-yung, and Chi-li. [Chi-]li had a son named Ch`ang. T`ai-po was eldest.2 2 CHy omits this sentence, remarking that C has "T`ai-po knew [that King T`ai . . . etc.]," but if that reading were correct there would be no need of repeating . The reading in A is satisfactory, but apparently occurred in none of the texts used by CHy. King T`ai regarded Ch`ang as worthy and wished Chi to be his successor. T`ai-po left and went to Wu. When King T`ai was on the point of death he said [to Chi], "When I die, you go and yield your place to your two elder brothers. It may be they will not come, but you will have done the right thing and so you will have peace." King T`ai died and Chi went to Wu and told his two elder brothers. His elder brothers went back with Chi. All the ministers wished [T`ai-] po to put Chi on the throne, but Chi in turn made way for [T`ai-]po, who said to Chung[-yung], "Now all the ministers wish me to put Chi on the throne, but Chi in turn makes way for me. How shall we settle it?" Chung[-yung] said, ". . . . . .3 3 . Both Chou and CHy agree that the passage makes no sense. Only the weak need support. It will be all right to put Chi on the throne." In the end Chi ascended the throne and brought up4 4 Chou also finds doubtful. King Wên. King Wên actually received the Mandate [of Heaven] and ruled as king. Confucius said, "T`ai-o had singular insight; King Chi had singular knowledge. [T`ai-]po recognized his father's will, and Chi understood his father's mind. Hence it can be said of King T`ai, T`ai-po, and King Chi that seeing the beginning they knew what the end would be, and that they were able to carry out their wills." 324 The Ode says,5 5 Shih 451 No. 241/3. From the time of T`ai-po and King Chi [this was done]. Now this King Chi In his heart was full of brotherly duty. Full of duty to his elder brother, He gave himself the more to promote the prosperity [of the country], And secured to him the glory [of his act]. He accepted his dignity, and did not lose it, And [ere long his family] possessed the whole kingdom. This is illustrated above. T`ai-po returned to Wu and was made its ruler. [Wu endured] for twenty-eight generations to [the time of] Fu-ch`ai, when it perished. 61 1 In Shih chi 46.10b-11b (Mém. hist. 5.250-1) King Wei takes the place of King Hsüan (B.C. 342-24), the meeting being dated B.C. 355. King Hui of Wei (B.C. 370335) was contemporaneous with both. King Hsüan of Ch`i met with King Hui of Wei to hunt in the suburbs. The King of Wei said, "You certainly must have treasures?" The King of Ch`i said, "I have none." The King of Wei said, "If even a little state like mine has pearls an inch in diameter, ten of which will illuminate the space around a chariot for a distance of twelve ch`êng,2 2 . Chavannes translates, "il y en a dix dont l'éclat est tel qu'ils éclairent douze chars en avant et douze chars en arrière." From the context should be a measure of length, perhaps a chariot length. I do not think it is used here as a numerator for chariots, as Chavannes seems to take it. how can a state of a thousand chariots [such as Ch`i] lack treasures?" The King of Ch`i said, "I differ with Your Majesty in what I consider treasures to be. Among my subjects is a certain T`an-tz?. I sent him to administer Nan-ch`êng, and as a result the people of Ch`u dared not commit acts of violence, and all the twelve feudal lords up the Ss? River came to [pay homage at] my court. Among my ministers is a certain P`an-tz?.3 3 CHy emends to after the Shih chi reading. I sent him to administer 325 Kao-t`ang, and as a result the people of Chao dared not fish to the east in the River. Among my subjects is a certain Ch`ien-fu. I sent him to administer Hsü-chou, and as a result the people of Yen offered sacrifices to the North gate,4 4 Yen was north of Ch`i. and the people of Chao offered sacrifices to the West gate,5 5 Chao was to the west. while there were over ten thousand families that came over to serve him. Among my subjects is a certain Chung-shou. I had him oversee robberies, and [the result was that] things dropped on the roads were not picked up. With [these subjects] I light up a thousand li beyond my borders. How is it a mere matter of twelve ch`êng?" The King of Wei was ashamed and left displeased. The Ode says,6 6 Shih 500 No. 254/2. Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung omits this quotation. If your words were pleasing,7 7 The supplies the rather tenuous connection with the preceding (cf. the concluding sentence ). The people would be settled. 71 1 The version of this story in Wu-Yüeh ch`un-ch`iu 4.27b-29a is superior in motivation, but lacks one or two of the more pungent phrases of HSWC, which gains in vigor from its very non-sequiturs. At Tung-hai there was a brave soldier named Tz?-ch`iu Hsin, who was known throughout the empire for his valor. He was passing through2 2 For read as in TPYL 13.3b. (CHy.) a haunted valley and said, "Give my horse a drink." His servant said, "If you let a horse drink here he will certainly die." "Do as I tell you." He gave him a drink, and the horse really did collapse. Tz?-ch`iu Hsin took off his court dress, drew his sword and entered [the water]. He came out after three days and three nights, during which time he had killed three scaly dragons and one ordinary dragon. The Spirit of Thunder followed and attacked him for ten days and ten nights, blinding his left eye. 326 Yao Li, hearing of it, went to see him and said, "Is Hsin at home?" "He has gone to escort some mourners." He went to see Hsin at the grave and said, "I hear that the Spirit of Thunder attacked you for ten days and ten nights, blinding your left eye. Now one with a grudge against Heaven does not leave the suns intact,3 3 "Heaven-grudges" could either be those belonging to Heaven or those directed against Heaven. might be temporal: "not complete the day," i.e., "not wait out the day." WYCC is explicit: , and one is led to think of the Archer I and the nine suns. nor does one turn on his heel [and walk away] when he has been wronged by a man. How is it that up to the present time you have not repayed [the Spirit of Thunder]?" And he left with a snort of derision.4 4 Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.9a) makes Tz?-ch`iu Hsin the subject of . In the next sentence he emends to and to , glossing, "The people at the grave who fell prostrate from fear were past counting. This all gives an extravagant account of what a martial person Tz?-ch`iu Hsin was." , . Although Chao (322) quotes this explanation with approval, it seems to me extremely farfetched. As appears from Tz?-ch`iu's reproach in the second paragraph below (), the point is that there were a great many people present, not that many of them behaved in a particular way. Those giving vent to their grief at the grave were past counting. When Yao Li had returned home he said to his gateman, "Tz?ch`iu Hsin is the bravest soldier in the empire. Today I put him to shame in the presence of others. For that he will certainly come to attack me. This evening do not close the gate, nor the door [of my chamber] when I have gone to bed." Tz?-ch`in Hsin really came that night. He drew his sword and held5 5 Read for . (Chou.) it at Yao Li's throat, saying, "You are guilty of three crimes for which you deserve to die. Putting me to shame in the presence of others6 6 : CHy suggests for is the first. Not closing your gate [when you knew I would be coming] is the second. Not closing the door when you had gone to bed is the third." Yao Li said, "Wait until I have said a word. Coming [at night]7 7 As CHy remarks, the sense demands the addition of (or some similar word). As no text supports the emendation, I do not follow him in further supplying "You are unworthy in three respects." 327 to pay a visit is your first unworthy act. Drawing your sword without using it is your second unworthy act. Preceding speech with a sword is your third unworthy act. Your being able to kill me is nothing more than poisoning me would be."8 8 Not one of the approved methods which a man noted for his valor uses to dispose of his enemies. Tz?-ch`iu Hsin withdrew his sword and left, saying, "There is only this man in the whole empire whom I am not equal to." There is the traditional saying, "The Kung-tz? Mu-i got a state with words,"9 9 The "saying" does not occur in either Tso chuan or Shih chi, and though both texts have much to say about the Kung-tz? Mu-i, neither credits him with the "getting" of a state, at least for himself, since he refused to succeed to his father's dukedom; cf. Mém. hist. 4.237. and now Yao Li saved his life with words. Speech must be polished, as in this case. The Ode says,10 10 Shih 500 No. 254/2. Here the connecting word is . If your words were pleasing, The people would be settled. 81 1 The story seems to have been a popular one. In SY 12.17a-18a it is told of Wu-tsê sent on a mission by Marquis Wên of Wei to the Marquis of Ch`i; in Shih chi 126.11b it is Ch`un-yü K`un sent by the king of Wei to Ch`u. Both of these versions write in place of the hapax legomenon of HSWC, but show no real signs of borrowing. There is a story as follows: Ch`i sent an envoy to present a goose to Ch`u. The goose became thirsty. When the envoy gave it a drink on the way, the goose escaped from its basket.2 2 . I follow Chou, who takes it as the name of a basket. Yü Yüeh's suggestion (CYTT 17.9a-b) that is an error for ?o o For this character, see the table on p. 358. "basket," may be correct, but his explanation of the binom (*kiwak) ?o o For this character, see the table on p. 358. (*klak or *glak) as a "spelling" of (*lung) is phonetically impossible. Chao (233), on uncertain grounds of "making sense" approves of CHy's suggestion of for : "the goose seized the basket and escaped." Below, it would be "Here is the basket which [the goose] seized." It is hard to see the advantage of such a reading. The envoy went on to Ch`u just the same and said, "Ch`i sent me to present a goose. The goose was thirsty, and on the way I gave it a drink, but it escaped from the basket. Though I wished to run 328 away, it would have meant3 3 represents Chou's emendation from , the reading in all the other texts. Chao refers to Lei-chü 90.5a and TPYL 916.8b, where the line occurs with . He supposes that became corrupted to , which then was put after is certainly wrong, and either the encyclopedia readings or Chou's emendation gives essentially the same translation. that communications between two princes would be interrupted. Though I would have liked to draw my sword and kill myself, that would have led people to believe that my prince despises gentlemen but values geese. Here is the basket: I would like to discharge4 4 Read for . (Chou.) my service to Ch`u with it. The king esteemed his speech and appreciated the persuasiveness of his words. Accordingly he detained him and gave him presents, making him an honored guest to the end of his life. Truly, an envoy must strive for elegant speech. He must give the impression of sincerity and honesty, clarify the spirit and intention [of his master], loosen knots and straighten out the crooked. Only after that can he be sent on a mission. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 500 No. 254/2. If your words were pleasing, The people would be settled. 91 1 SY 18.23a-24b is probably copied from this, as it quotes from the same Ode. Shih chi 105.3a-6b represents a more technical account of the same episode with slight verbal identity. Pien-ch`iao went to see the Marquis of Kuo.2 2 SY writes "the King of Chao." CHy repeats , and remarks (after Ss?-ma Chên) that by the time of Pien-ch`iao the state of Kuo had been long extinct, so that is probably correct. The Heir Apparent [of Kuo] had died of a violent illness. Pien-ch`iao went to the palace [gate]3 3 Both Shih chi and SY have . and said, "I have heard that in the state there has suddenly been occasion for digging a hole in the ground.4 4 : i.e., to make a grave. Shih chi writes , and Liang Yü-shêng (quoted by Takigawa 8.105.7) thinks "exorcise" was the original reading, corrupted into by HSWC and SY. Is it urgent?" 32922 They said, "The Heir Apparent has died of a violent illness." Pien-ch`iao said, "Go in and say that Ch`in Yüeh-jên, a physician of Chêng, can cure5 5 For CHy suggests "bring him to life" with SY. him." 6Chou has supplied from SY and Shih chi. as an official title occurs in the Chou-li, but was first established by the Ch`in, and is an anachronism here. The Chung-shu-tz?, who was an amateur of medicine, came out and answered him, "I have heard that there was a physician of highest antiquity named Ti-fu.7 7 For SY has (*miog), and CHy would emend to (*môg). The suggestion is tempting, but as the person in question is not mentioned elsewhere, there is no way of knowing which form is corrupt. In practicing medicine Ti-fu would make a mat of sedge and a dog of grass,8 8 The grass dogs were used in sacrifices; cf. Chuang-tz? 5.41a: "Before the grass dogs are set forth [at the sacrifice], they are deposited in a box or basket." (Legge' 1.352.) I do not know what is implied by the sedge mat; mats are usually made of the reed known as . then facing north he would pray. When he had emited only ten words, those who came supported or carried [by others]9 9 SY has "carted" is possible, but I prefer to read with SY. all recovered.10 10 is defined from its occurrence here Can your prescriptions equal that?" Pien-ch`iao said, "They cannot." He went on to say, "I have heard that there was a physician of middle antiquity named Yü-fu.11 11 . Shih chi has for ; SY writes . (CHy.) In practicing medicine Yü-fu would make brains from ni wood or a body from chih grass, and, blowing in the apertures and fixing the brain,12 12 For , which looks like a repetition from its occurrence in the preceding line, SY has "arteries and veins." would bring the dead to life again.13 13 From this passage in isolation one might assume that some technique of homeopathic magic is being described. In Shih chi it appears to be a question of an operation on a corpse, with the intention of restoring it to life. The extremely technical passage in Shih chi is beyond my competence to translate. Can your prescriptions equal that?" Pien-ch`iao said, "They cannot." The Chung-shu-tz? said, "[The use of] prescriptions like yours can be compared to viewing the sky through a tube or poking a hole in the earth with an awl. What you look at is large, but 330 what you pierce is trifling. How can prescriptions like yours be adequate to working a transformation14 14 : i. e., bring him back to life. in the boy?" Pien-ch`iao said, "Not so. Serving antiquity is like throwing in the dark to hit a mosquito on the head, or covering the eyes to distinguish between black and white. Now the illness of the Heir Apparent is what is called a cataleptic trance.15 15 : "to fall prostrate like a corpse." "Catalepsy" is perhaps too definite, but it fits the context perfectly. If you do not believe me, why do you not go in and examine him?

In every case where these conditions hold [the patient] can be made to live." The Chung-shu-tz? then went in and examined the Heir Apparent and reported on the illness to the Marquis of Kuo. When [the Marquis of Kuo]17 17 Repeat (CHy), as in Shih chi. heard this, he got up in his bare feet and going to the gate said, "Master, you have had the trouble of coming from afar in your progress18 18 (usually in reversed order) is used only of a royal progress. From the immediately following, and from the two occurrences of in its usual meaning of "good fortune" in Shih chi, the expression here is suspect; however SY is the same. to visit me. If happily you cure him, then this animated dung,19 19 : i. e., my son; lit. "breath of befouled earth." is a common expression for something worthless; cf.

If you, Master, are unable to cure him, then [his corpse] might as well be thrown into a ditch along with [those of] dogs and horses."21 21 . Chou supplies from SY; it is also in Shih chi and is part of a cliché for the ruthless disposal of corpses. Cf. especially LSCC 10.4a: "To throw [the body of] a dead man into a ditch is something human feelings cannot endure." "take precedence over dogs and horses" looks peculiar, but the phrase is the same in SY and also occurs in Han shu 58.7b. Before he had finished speaking his tears were soaking his lapel. 331 Pien-ch`iao went in [to the chamber where the body was].22 22 is not in the other versions. I take as intransitive by analogy with SY: "Whereupon Pien-ch`iao proceded to carry out an examination." He sharpened his needles [for acupuncture] and ground his stone probe. With them23 23 Shih chi has . he opened up24 24 is nowhere so defined; however it is apparent that the word has some such technical meaning in medical treatises. Cf. Shih chi, loc. cit., ; also below, "He then had his disciple Tz?-yang grind the needle and sharpen the probe, and with them the outer san-yang and wu-hui. After a moment the Heir Apparent revived." may be a general term "to operate on," or perhaps it refers to a specific operation with the instruments for acupuncture. the three yang25 25 For the cf.

Tz?-yu practiced massage: Tz?-i "restored the spirit,"31 31 . and Tz?-yüeh "supported the form."32 32 . Whereupon the Heir Apparent came to life again. When it became known in the empire, everyone thought Piench`iao could raise the dead. Pien-ch`iao said, "I cannot raise the dead. I can only make those who should live rise." If even the dead can be treated with medicine, how much the 332 more the living!33 33 SY has "Now the dead still cannot be made to live by the use of drugs." Although CHy prefers this reading, it looks like an attempt to reconcile the statement with what Pien-ch`iao has just said about being unable to raise the dead, but results in a complete non sequitur with the concluding remark about a worthless prince. Alas that there is no medicine to restore the rule of a worn-out prince! The Ode says,34 34 Shih 501 No. 254/4. They are beyond help or remedy. It says that nothing but inevitable destruction awaits them. 101 1 Hsin hsü 5.14b-15a is slightly expanded from this, quoting from the same Ode, but adding another quotation from the Shih and one from the Shu. Master Ch`u-ch`iu2 2 Hsin hsü adds "at the age of 70" . (Chou.) came dressed in a grass raincoat and wearing a rope for a belt to see Prince Mêng of Ch`ang. Prince Mêng of Ch`ang said, "Sir, you are old; your years are advanced. You are frequently forgetful. What have you to teach me?"3 3 One is unavoidably reminded of Father William. Master Ch`u-ch`iu said, "How can Your Highness call me old? How can Your Highness call me old? I suppose you are going to have me throw a stone or leap far? Pursue a chariot or run after a horse? Chase a deer or capture a panther or tiger? In that case I would die on the spot; what time would I have for growing old? Or are you going to have me make deep-laid plans and far-reaching schemes? Settle doubts4 4 For Lei-chü 18.13a has , likewise TPYL 383.4a, with for . Chao (235) thinks this is correct: "Exert my energies to decide uncertainties?" It is not easy to see how such a corruption could arise. and decide uncertainties? Issue formal pronouncements on meeting the feudal lords? In that case I am just in my prime. How does age enter into the matter?" Prince Mêng of Ch`ang blushed and the sweat poured off him to his heels. He said, "I was wrong, I was wrong." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 501 No. 254/4. An old man, [I speak] with entire sincerity. 333 111 1 Two versions of this anecdote occur in YTCC: 1.19b-20a and 7.4b-5b, neither showing any direct relation to HSWC. Lieh-tz? 6.5b-6a is similar to HSWC and shows less connection with YTCC. Duke Ching of Ch`i was walking on top of Cow Mountain. Looking to the north out over Ch`i he said, "What a fine state! How luxuriant and flourishing!2 2 For read ?p p For this character, see the table on p. 358. ?p p For this character, see the table on p. 358. as in Lei-chü 28.1b. As Chao (235) suggests, it is probably a corruption from YTCC 7.4b, where replaces in the preceding line. TPYL 160.4a has (Chao.) Where shall I go when I leave this?" And he bowed his head and wept until [the tears] wet his lapel. 3Omit , which occurs later on in its proper context. Here it makes no sense, and is missing in the YTCC versions. Lieh-tz? inserts the phrase after and follows it with "Where shall I go when I leave this," as in HSWC but with for the more archaic . On the admittedly insufficient evidence at hand, I suggest that this paragraph in Lieh-tz? was composed on the basis of YTCC and an already defective HSWC text. Kuo-tz? and Kao-tz? said, "You are right. We ministers are dependent on Your Highness' bounty to eat [even] coarse food and bad meat, and to ride in worn-out carriages [drawn by] broken-down horses, but still we do not wish to die. How much the less Your Highness!" And they too4 4 Add with CHy from TPYL. bowed their heads and wept. Yen-tz? laughed5 5 TPYL has . and said, "What pleasure! On today's trip I have seen one frightened prince and two flattering ministers. If from antiquity there were no [such thing as] death, then T`ai-Kung would still be alive today, and you, my Prince, right now would be standing in the fields wearing a grass garment and a straw hat, with only your work to worry about;6 6 Since T`ai-wang would still be ruler of Ch`i, Duke Ching would be a commoner. This is stated more clearly in the other versions. what time would you have to think of death?" Duke Ching was ashamed and lifted up a beaker to punish himself, and in the same way punished the two ministers. 334 121 1 LSCC 8.13a-14a tells the same anecdote with some variation in detail. Huai-nan tz? 13.17a-b is modified from LSCC. SY 6.7b-8a seems to have used LSCC and HSWC, but with several changes. Duke Mu of Ch`in went hunting and lost his horse. After looking for three days he found [its remains] on the south side of Mt. Ching. Some countrymen had just been sharing [its flesh] among themselves for a meal. Duke Mu said, "Anyone who eats the flesh of a po-2 2 For the , which resembles a horse, but devours leopards and tigers, cf. the texts quoted in TT 1487.

The other versions all write , more usually associated with . horse without wine will die."3 3 . Read for . The text is not unintelligible as it stands, but all the other versions have . Duke Mu then got wine and gave it to everyone to drink. After that he left. The next year the army of Chin fought with Duke Mu. The spearman on the right [of the prince of] Chin, Lu Shih,4 4 For read with LSCC. (Chou.) cut off Duke Mu and attacked him. Six [pieces] of his armor had already dropped off [under this onslaught]5 5 LSCC is clearer: . "He struck Duke Mu's armor, and had already pierced six layers." when 300-odd men who had eaten [the flesh of] the horse all said, "Our Prince is humane (jên) and loves men. We cannot but die [in his defense]." Whereupon they fell on the spearman Lu Shih and saved Duke Mu from death. 6Read for after the other versions. 131 1 Hsin hsü 8.5b-6a copies this almost verbatim. There is the story of Pien Chuang-tz?, who loved valor. While his mother was in good health, he was in three battles and three times he fled. His friends criticized him and the prince of the state heaped shame on him. Pien Chuang-tz? endured his prince's censure2 2 lit., "received the command." without changing countenance. Three years after the death of his mother, when Lu raised an army, Pien Chuang-tz? 335 asked to accompany it. At his interview with the general of the forces he said, "Formerly I was still living with my mother, and for this reason I fled from battle to the disgrace of my person. Now that my mother is dead, I should like to atone for my failure."3 3 lit., "to meet the responsibility." Then he rushed to the enemy and fought with them. Taking a soldier's head, he [came back and] presented it [saying], "With this I should like to atone for my first flight." He took another head and presented it [saying], "With this I should like to atone for my second flight." The general stopped him and said, "This is enough." He would not stop but again took a head and presented it saying, "With this I should like to atone for my third flight." The general stopped him and said, "This is enough. I would like to make you my [sworn] brother." Pien Chuang-tz? said, "I ran away three times4 4 Read with Chou after Hsin hsü for . so that I might [live to] look after my mother. Now my mother is dead and I have atoned for my failure. I have heard that the gentleman of principle does not live in disgrace." Wherewith he charged the enemy, killing seventy men before he died. On hearing of this the superior man would say, "The three flights he atoned for, but he went on and exterminated his family and put an end to [the sacrifices to] his ancestors. This gentleman's capacity for principle was small; he was not filial to the last degree." The Ode says,5 5 Shih 505 No. 255/1. All are [good] at first But few prove themselves to be so at the last. 141 1 The maxims illustrated in this paragraph occur without the examples in *Hsiao ching 8.3b-4a. When the Son of Heaven has seven admonishing ministers, though he be without principle, he will not lose his empire. Of old 336 Chou, King of the Yin, was cruel to the people and went against the Way of Heaven to the extent of cutting off [the legs of an old man and of a boy] who were crossing the ford in the morning,2 2 Cf. Shu ching 295. of ripping up pregnant women,3 3 Ibid. 285. of making dried meat of the Marquis of Kuei, and of making mincemeat of the Earl of Mei. The reason he did not lose his kingdom was that he had Chi-tz? and Pi-kan. Wei-tz? left him, Chi-tz? was thrown into prison as a slave, and Pi-kan, remonstrating, died. After that Chou raised troops and exterminated him. When a feudal lord has five admonishing ministers, though he be without principle, he will not lose his state. Fu-ch`ai, King of Wu, acted without principle to the extent of driving the population of a whole town to be interred with Ho-lü.4 4 I can find elsewhere no mention of this. The reason he did not lose his state was that he had Wu Tz?-hsü. Once [Tz?-]hsü was dead, King Kou-chien of Yüeh wished to attack [Wu]. Fan Li objected, "Tz?-hsü's plans are not yet forgotten in the mind of the King of Wu." After Tz?-hsü had been dead for three years, Yüeh was able to attack [Wu]. If a Great Officer has three admonishing ministers, though he be without principle, he will not lose his house. The head of the Chi family was without principle, usurping the dances with eight rows of dancers of the Son of Heaven,5 5 Cf. Analects 154 (3/1). sacrificing to Mt. T`ai,6 6 Ibid. 156 (3/6). and using the "Yung" ode.7 7 Ibid. 155 (3/2). Confucius said,8 8 Ibid. 154 (3/1). "If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?" That he did not lose his position was because he had Jan Yu and Chi Lu for ministers. Truly it is said, "The state of one with outspoken admonishing ministers will be brilliant, while the state of one with reticent flattering ministers will be lost." The Ode says,9 9 Shih 507-8 No. 255/4. 337 All unintelligent are you of your [proper] virtue, And so you have no [good] men behind you, nor by your side.10 10 Read with Shih k`ao 21a for Mao shih (Ch`ên Ch`iao-ts`ung). Without any intelligence of your [proper] virtue You have no [good] intimate or minister. It speaks of King Wên's sighing and deploring that the Yin-shang [dynasty], from a lack of assisting and admonishing ministers, would lose the empire. 15 Duke Huan of Ch`i went out walking and met an old man who was wearing flowing garments and proceeding. . . . (?)1 1 must be descriptive of his gait, but I am unable to find a satisfactory definition of the expression so used. Chu Ch`i-fêng's atempt (TT 1763) to equate with *diag and *ngo is to be rejected. In his belt he was carrying a peach wood staff.2 2 . The expression (for variants cf. TT 84) is of common occurrence, but is defined as a kind of bamboo. Here it is necessary to preserve in its meaning of "peach." As the word is a homophone of "to expel," peach wood was used to expell noxious influences (cf. Tso chuan 596, Chao 4). Duke Huan asked in surprise, "What do you call that? In what classic does it occur? What section does it occupy?3 3 I. e., what textual justification have you for carrying such a thing? How do you exorcise with it? Why do you avoid me?"4 4 does not make good sense in context. A possibility would be to read for , making a term roughly synonymous with . The old man said, "This is called `two peach.'5 5 . Sun I-jang (Cha-i 2.3b) would emend to "warning." The word t`ao (peach) means to be lost.6 6 : cf. HSWC 5/14 . By analogy one would expect to precede this phrase. Now what worries can there be for one who daily is careful about t`ao? Just as the altars of a lost state are a warning to the feudal lords, the common man's warning is in this peach staff." Duke Huan was pleased with his words and carried him in his chariot. By the first month of the next year the common people all wore it. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 510 No. 255/8. The beacon of Yin is not far distant. 338 161 1 The same anecdote occurs in SY 10.14a-b in a slightly expanded form. Duke Huan of Ch`i set out wine and ordered the Great Officers,2 2 : delete . (Chou, CHy.) "The last one3 3 . Either "the last [to finish a cup]" or "the last [to arrive]." SY below has , likewise Shu-ch`ao 48.14b in quoting HSWC. (Chao 239.) shall have to drink a ching measure." Kuan Chung was last and was supposed to drink the ching measure. He drank one half and threw out the other half. Duke Huan said, "Chung-fu, you were supposed to drink a ching measure. Why did you throw it out?" Kuan Chung said, "I have heard that when wine enters one's mouth his tongue comes out.4 4 I. e., he talks too much. SY adds . One whose tongue comes out casts away his person. Is it not better to cast away wine than to cast away one's person?" Duke Huan approved. The Ode says,5 5 Shih 512 No. 256/3. You are besotted by drink. 17 Duke Ching of Ch`i sent Yen-tz? on a mission south to Ch`u. On hearing of it the King of Ch`u said to his attendants, "Ch`i has sent Yen-tz? on a mission to my state, and he will soon arrive." 1YTCC 6.33a-b, closely followed by SY 12.13b-14a, has a rather weaker version of this anecdote. The attendants said, "Yen-tz? is the greatest sophist in the world. No one can equal him in deliberating the concerns of a state or in discussing the methods of antiquity. All Your Majesty can do is sit with him. Then have an officer pass by with a bound man, and let Your Majesty make inquiries. Have him [prepared to] say, `The men of Ch`i have a propensity for thieving, and so I have bound him.' This is a good way to embarrass [Yen-tz?]." The king approved. When Yen-tz? arrived, he sat with him. [Yen-tz?] outlined the cares and concerns of the state and criticized the degrees of success 339 of their contemporaries. Over and over he would bring up a topic and exhaust it, while the king sat speechless and unable to take up the conversation. They had been [sitting] there for a while when a bound man passed them. The king said, "Who is that?" 2 is unusual. It is unlikely that the Chinese idiom would correspond with the English "pick it up"—i. e., the practice. The officer replied, "This is one of those natives of Ch`i who have a propensity for stealing. I have bound him and am going to turn him over to the sheriff." The king emitted a loud laugh of pleasure and said, "Ch`i is a state where officials caps and belts [are worn], and where eloquence reigns. Do they really have a propensity for stealing [too]?" Yen-tz? said, "Of course. Certainly they take things.5 5 Read for after Shih k`ao 21a. (Chao.) Has not Your Majesty seen those trees south of the Chiang called orange trees? If you plant them north of the Chiang they change to chih trees.3 3 , which have similar leaves but whose fruit is not good; cf. YTCC. Why? It is simply caused by the soil. When this gentleman dwelt in Ch`i he stood up in his official cap and belt as stern in his scruples as Po-i. Now that he is living in Ch`u, if he has a propensity for thieving, it seems to me that it is simply a change [wrought by] the soil. What is there for Your Majesty to be surprised about?" The Ode says,4 4 Shih 514 No. 256/6. Every word finds its answer;5 5 Read for after Shih k`ao 21a. (Chao.) Every good deed has its recompense. 181 1 Paraphrased in Lun-hêng 4.1a-b, where it is introduced by . Yen-ling Chi-tz? of Wu was out walking in Ch`i. Seeing some money that had been lost [by someone] he called a shepherd to pick it up. The shepherd said, "How is it that2 2 Supply with Chou after Lun hêng. you occupy a high position but keep your glance down? Your appearance is noble, but your words are vulgar. If I have a prince who does not act like a prince and friends who do not act like friends, it is like 340 wearing winter furs in the heat of summer. Do you suspect me of being the sort of person who picks up money?" Yen-ling-tz? realized that he was a sage and politely asked his name. The shepherd said, "You certainly are a superficial fellow. You are not good enough for me to tell you my name." Wherewith he went off. Yen-ling Chi-tz? stood up and kept looking after him until he was out of sight. Confucius said,3 3 Analects 250 (12/1.2). "Look not at what is contrary to li; listen not to what is contrary to li." 19 Yen Yüan asked Confucius, "I would like [to be able] to regard [my] poverty as wealth, to take [my] mean position as a noble one, to make myself esteemed without recourse to physical violence, to enjoy friendly relations with officials, and for the rest of my life have no trouble—would this not certainly be worth while?" Confucius said, "Excellent, Hui. Now if one regards poverty as wealth, knowing when he has enough, he is without desire. If one takes a mean position to be a noble one, being yielding, he is possessed of li. If one is esteemed without recourse to physical violence, being respectful, he offends against no one. If one for his whole life has no trouble, it is because he chooses his words before speaking. One like Hui is perfect. The saints of antiquity themselves were no better than this." 201 1 This anecdote differs slightly in wording from YTCC 1.25a-b. Duke Ching of Ch`i went out hunting and after seventeen days had not returned. Yen-tz? went after him in a chariot. On arriving, his gown and cap were awry. On seeing him Duke Ching was astonished and said, "Master, why are you in such a hurry? Is there an emergency?" Yen-tz? replied, "Yes, there is an emergency. The people of the state with one accord think that Your Highness hates the people but loves animals. I have heard that when fish and turtles 341 get tired of the depths and come to the surface2 2 lit., "the dry [land] or the shallow [water]." the result is that they are taken by hook or by net. When animals get tired of the wilds3 3 "the secluded mountains." and come down to the cities and plains the result is that they are taken by hunters. Now Your Highness has been out hunting for seventeen days without returning; is not this rather excessive?" Duke Ching said, "Not so. If there are guests is there no one to meet them?—the Hsing-jên Tz?-niu is there for that. Is there no one to offer blood and food [sacrifices] in the ancestral temple? —the Chu-jên T`ai-tsai is there for that. Are there litigations undecided?—the Ta-li Tz?-chi is there for that. Is there inequality in distribution in the state?—Wu Hsien is there to take care of that. My having these four officers is analogous to having four limbs which can act for me. What is there to worry about?"4 4 Emend to . (Chou.) Yen-tz? said, "Certainly. If a man's heart had four limbs that could act for it, that would be fine. But if the four limbs lacked a heart for seventeen days, would they not die?" Duke Ching said, "Well said," and then taking Yen-tz? by the hand, drove back with him, putting him on his right in the same chariot. Of Yen-tz? it may be said that he was skillful at offering remonstrances. 211 1 SY 9.4b-5a incorporates the parable into a story about a king of Wu who wished to attack Ch`u. Wu-Yüeh ch`un-ch`iu 5.63a-64a makes the T`ai-tz? Yu act it out in an attempt to dissuade King Fu-ch`ai of Wu from attacking Ch`i. King Chuang of Ch`u was going to raise an army to attack Chin. He announced to his officials and Great Officers, "Anyone who dares object will be put to death without mercy." Sun-shu Ao said, "I have heard that the son who, fearing the severity of a whipping, dares not remonstrate with his father is not filial, and that the minister who, fearing the punishment of axe and chopping block, dares not remonstrate with his prince is not loyal." Whereupon he went ahead and offered a remonstrance: 342 "In my garden there is an elm tree. On top is a cicada. The cicada is just vibrating his wings and singing his sad song, intent on drinking the fresh dew, not knowing that the mantis behind him is twisting his neck, about to seize and eat him. The mantis, intent on eating the cicada, does not know that behind him the sparrow is stretching his neck, about to peck and eat him. The sparrow intent of eating the mantis, does not know that the boy beneath the elm tree2 2 Supply from Shu-ch`ao 124.7a, Lei-chü 60.10b, TPYL 350.6b, 956.2a. (Chao 241.) with cross-bow and pellets is looking up about to shoot him. The boy, intent on shooting the sparrow, does not know that in front of him is a deep pit and behind him a hole.3 3 For CHy writes after Shu-ch`ao; likewise Lei-chü and TPYL. Chao would therefore emend to that reading. It is not clear what is gained by so doing. These all are occupied with4 4 Emend to (Chou). Shu-ch`ao reads . (Chao.) the advantage before them without regarding the [possible] injury behind. It is not only animals and common people who behave like this; rulers also do the same thing. Now you know enough to covet their territory and. . . .5 5 "enjoy" is probably a mistake. The text from here to the end is defective.

That of the state of Ch`u did not undertake a punitive expedition, while the state of Chin enjoyed peace was due to the efforts of Sun-shu Ao." . . ." That the state of Ch`u enjoyed peace was due to Sun-shu Ao's efforts. 221 1 SY 20.12a-b recounts another version where the Kung-tz? Ch`êng-fu congratulates Marquis Wên of Wei on the occasion of a similar catastrophe. In the time of Duke P`ing of Chin the tower in which his valuables were stored caught fire. When the officials and Great Officers heard of it they all2 2 Read with CHy and C; likewise TPYL 627.2a. (Chao 243.) hastened in chariots and on horseback to put the fire out. After three days and nights they got it under control. The Kung-tz? Yen-tz? alone congratulated him with rolls of silk, saying, "Very good." 343 Duke P`ing suddenly changed color and said, "It was where pearls and jade were stored. They were the most important treasures of the state, but Heaven burned it. Officials and Great Officers all hastened in chariots and on horseback to put out the fire; why do you alone congratulate me with rolls of silk? If you have an explanation you may live; if not, you die." The Kung-tz? Yen-tz? said, "How would I dare not have an explanation? I have heard that the king has his treasure in the empire, the feudal lords have theirs in the people, [the farmers in their granaries],3 3 Supply with CHy from TPYL 627.2a, 190.6b, 191.3b; likewise Lei-chü 80.1b, Po-t`ieh 3.65b, Ch`u hsüeh chi 24.24a.

Now that August Heaven has sent down disaster on your treasure tower is Your Highness' good luck. If you do not realize it and wake up, I fear that you too will be the laughing stock of neighboring states." The Duke approved, saying, "From now on I hope to lay up my treasures among the people." The Ode says,8 8 Shih 523 No. 257-6. Their sowing and reaping are precious to them; They love this substitute for pay. 344 231 1 This seems to be derived directly from LSCC 19.17b-18b. Huai-nan tz? 12.5b follows LSCC more closely, and Hsin hsü 5.8b has an abridged version. Marquis Wên of Wei asked Li2 2 For the other versions read , the more usual character used in this man's name. (Chou, CHy.) K`o, "What were the reasons for the destruction of Wu?" Li K`o replied, "Repeated victories in repeated battles." Marquis Wên said, "Repeated victories are the good fortune of a state. Why then was Wu of all countries destroyed?" Li K`o replied, "After repeated battles the people are exhausted. After repeated victories the ruler is overbearing. Being overbearing, he is without restraint. Being unrestrained, he goes to extremes.3 3 CHy adds from LSCC: "When things are exhausted, [people] are resentful. When they are resentful, there is [cause for] the greatest concern." When superiors and inferiors were both in extremity, the destruction of Wu was overdue even. This was how Fu-ch`ai destroyed himself in Kan-sui."4 4 Chou remarks that Fu-ch`ai died on Ch`in-yü-k`ang Mountain, where he was buried. This information is supplied in Wu-Yüeh ch`un-ch`iu 5.71a, but neither Kuo yü, nor Yüeh-chüeh shu mentions the place. On the other hand LSCC and Huai-nan tz? also have Kan-sui, and Yü Yüeh (CYTT 17.9b-10a) thinks it represents an old tradition, since it also is mentioned in Shih chi 69.11b. (Chao 245.) The Ode says,5 5 Shih 523 No. 257/7. Heaven is sending down death and disorder, And has put an end to our king. 241 1 This anecdote appears also in SY 4.7a-8b with some changes in wording. In Ch`u there was a gentleman named Shên Ming. He tended a garden to support his parents. His filial behavior became known to the king of Ch`u, who summoned him. Shên Ming refused to go. His father said, "Why do you refuse when the king wishes to employ you?" Shên Ming said, "Why should I give up being a son to become a subject?" 34523 His father said, "If you are paid by the state and hold a position in the court, you will be happy and I will have no worries. I wish you to serve." Shên Ming said, "Yes, sir," and so went to court to receive the king's command. The king of Ch`u made him ss?-ma of the Left. After one year2 2 For "that same year" read with CKCS 2.9b. (Chao 245.) there occurred the revolt of the Governor of Po, in which were killed the Ling-yin Tz?-hsi and the Ss?-ma Tz?-ch`i. Shên Ming then surrounded [the Governor of Po] with troops.3 3 Read with Chou for as in CHy, B, C, D. The Governor of Po said to Shih Ch`i, "Shên Ming is the bravest soldier in the world. Now that he [has surrounded me]4 4 I follow SY to read for . with his troops, what shall we do?" Shih Ch`i said, "I have heard that Shên Ming is a filial son.5 5 Chou supplies after SY; CKCS is the same. (Chou 246.) Let us seize his father with our troops and then have someone say to Shên Ming, `If you join me I will divide6 6 Both Chou and CHy add from SY; CKCS also has . (Chao.) with you the state of Ch`u. If you do not join me your father shall die.' " Shên Ming replied weeping, "At first I was my father's son. Now I am my prince's subject. Since I am no longer in a position to be a filial son, how can I not be a loyal subject? And seizing a drumstick he beat the signal for attack. As a result he killed the Governor of Po, but his father also died. The king offered him a reward. Shên Ming said, "To receive a prince's pay and then avoid the prince's troubles is not to be a loyal subject. By enforcing the prince's laws to kill one's father is on the other hand not to be a filial son. In conduct I am not both [loyal and filial], nor is my reputation established in both. Alas, if I [continue to] live under such circumstances, what sort of model will I be to the officers of the empire?" Whereupon he cut his throat and died. The Ode says,7 7 Shih 524 No. 257/9. To go forwards or backwards is alike impracticable. 346 251 1 This paragraph varies somewhat from LSCC 11.15a-b. It is almost identical with Huai-nan tz? 11.2a, where the quotation is from the I ching instead of the Shih. Of old T`ai-kung Wang and Tan, Duke of Chou, met as they received their fiefs. T`ai-kung asked the Duke of Chou, "How are you going to govern Lu?" The Duke of Chou said, "Honor those to whom honor is due, treat relatives with affection." T`ai-kung said, "From adherence to this policy Lu will be weak." The Duke of Chou asked T`ai-kung, "How are you going to govern Ch`i?" T`ai-kung said, "Promote the worthy and reward the deserving." The Duke of Chou said, "Among later generations there will certainly be princes robbed and assassinated." Later Ch`i grew daily larger until it became hegemon. After twenty four generations [the ruling family] was supplanted by the T`ien family. Lu daily lost territory until after thirty-four generations it was destroyed. Viewed in this light, the saints are capable of understanding the subtle.2 2 Cf. Yi King 392: "The superior man knows the minute and the manifested." The Ode says,3 3 Shih 525 No. 257/10. Here is a saint;— His views and words reach to a hundred li.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">347 APPENDIX1 1 Ss?-k`u ch`üan-shu tsung-mu 16.10b-11a, Ta Tung Shu-chü ed., Shanghai, 1926. The Ss?-k`u ch`üan shu tsung-mu Notice Han-shih wai-chuan, 10 chüan. Edition in common circulation. Compiled by Han Ying of the Han. [Han] Ying was a native of [the state of] Yen. Under the Emperor Wên (B. C. 179-156) he became a po-shih, and in the time of the Emperor Ching (B. C. 156-140) he advanced to the position of Tutor to [the Prince of] Ch`ang-shan. The "Essay on Literature" in the Han shu2 2 *Han shu 30.4b. lists a Han ku in 36 ch., a Han nei chuan in 4 chs., a Han wai chuan in 6 chs., and a Han shuo in 41 ch. With the passage of time they have been scattered or lost. In the case of the Han ku, a version in 22 chapters is still recorded in the Hsin T`ang-shu;3 3 *Hsin T`ang-shu 57.4a has a Han shih, hsü by Pu Shang , commentary by Han Ying, in 22 ch., but no mention of a Han ku; probably the former is intended. thus Liu An-shih speaks of4 4 Liu An-shih, Yüan-ch`êng yü-lu B.14a (Chi-fu ts`ung-shu): "I remember reading in my youth the `Yu yü wu chi' poem in the Han shih" . having read the "Yü wu chêng"5 5 Mao shih No. 194. ode in the Han shih. But Ou-yang Hsiu6 6 Cf. "Ch`ung-wên tsung-mu hsü-shih" , in *Ou-yang wen-chung kung chi 124.3a : "Han Ying's text was still extant during the T`ang, but all that remains today are the 10 sections. The Han [shu] `Essay' lists [Han] Ying's works in 50 sections; today we have only his Wai chuan." already says that in his time only the Wai chuan was preserved, so that in Northern Sung times some scholars had seen the Han shih and some had not. When, in the Shao-hsing period (1131-1163), Fan Ch`u-i wrote the Shih pu chuan ,7 7 In his remarks on the poem in question (Shih pu chuan 18.16b, 17a, T`ung-chiht`ang ching-chieh ed., vol. 216), Fan Ch`u-i does not mention Liu An-shih specifically, but says merely, "In my opinion the Han text of the Shih is rare today; perhaps [the additional lines] have been arbitrarily supplied by an amateur." . The Ss?-k`u editors may have had in mind another reference which I have failed to locate. he did not credit Liu An-shih with having really seen a copy of the 348 Han shih; so it was lost at the time of the change from Northern to Southern Sung. This Wai chuan alone is still preserved to the present day. However from the "Essay [on Literature]" in the Shi [shu] on, it has been [listed as having] four chapters more than [the six credited it] in the Han [shu] "Essay"; this is probably the result of redivision by later editors. This book variously quotes old stories and sayings, illustrating them with lines from the Shih. [The meanings ascribed by it to these lines] are not in accord with the [proper] sense of the Classic; hence the name "Wai chuan" ("Secondary commentary"). The materials assembled in it largely overlap with the philosophical writings of Chou and Ch`in [times]. In discussing the Three Schools of the Shih, Pan Ku speaks of its "on occasion culling from the anecdotal literature or choosing stories from various sources, but never in accord with the true meaning [of the Classic]." Here is he not pointing out this sort of thing? Hung Mai in his Jung-chai sui-pi8 8 *Jung-chai sui-pi II.8.4b, where he dismisses the story as misleading and pointless. has discussed its story about the maiden of A-ku (1/3). Other examples, where it speaks of P`êng-tsu's fame on the same level with that of Yao and Shun (1/6), or of immortality [as the result of Inaction] (1/23), or of there being no reason for fearing the transformations of Heaven (2/6), or of shield and spear as being employed in the shao (4/9), or that Shun's having two wives was wrong (4/9), or of Ching K`uai-jui's retainer's not "continuously maintaining his virtue" (8/4), all of them are objectionable. It says that "Liu-hsia Hui sacrificed himself to perfect his trustworthiness" (1/8); that Confucius made an analogy with driving to explain compassion for the people (2/11); that Confucius made the statement in the `Shun was born in Ming-t`iao' section;9 9 3/29. The quotation seems to be from memory. The paragraph in question begins "Shun was born in Chu-fêng;" the statement is , which in Mencius is not quoted as a remark of Confucius. that it was King Ch`êng10 10 And not Duke Huan as in *Chuang-tz? 5.34a. of Ch`u whom Lun-pien answered (5/6); that Jan-yu said Yen, Wu, Ch`u, and Tai were going to attack the king of Ch`in11 11 Likewise Chan-kuo ts`ê 3.81a-83b. (8/24): all these are at variance with fact. The incident of Yen Yüan, 349 Tz?-kung, and Tz?-lu telling of their respective ambitions (7/25, 9/15), as well as that of Shên Ming's dying as a result of the insurrection of the Governor of Po (1/21, 10/24)12 12 In the first reference to the Governor of Po, however, Shên Ming is not mentioned. are both repeated in different parts of the book; in such cases we find also unnecessary repetition. But where he has quoted Hsün Ch`ing's "Diatribe against the Twelve Philosophers"13 13 Hsün tz? 3.12b-16a. (4/22), in expunging the two names of Mencius and Tz?-ss?, and preserving only ten philosophers, he shows considerable discrimination in his selection. Moreover his metaphors of the cocoon and the thread, and the egg and the chick (5/17) were borrowed by Tung Chung-shu in his [Ch`un-ch`iu] fan-lu;14 14 *Ch`un-ch`iu fan-lu 10.8a. while the explanation of as and of as was used by Pan Ku in the Po hu t`ung.15 15 *Po-hu t`ung 1.9b-10a. Thus refined principles and famous sayings occur throughout the book. We should not view it as a work solely devoted to exegesis. The usual thing in this book is for each section to quote a line from the Shih, but there are twenty-eight16 16 Actually only 24. sections without such quotations; also the "I tell you" beginning one section (6/7) is out of context. In both cases there is probably a defect in the text. In his commentary on the Wên hsüan, Li Shan quotes from the Wai-chuan, "Confucius climbed Mt. T`ai and looked out over more than seventy [representatives of] ruling families not of the Chou clan,"17 17 This comes from Chang Shou-chieh's commentary on Shih chi 28.5a. I suspect that the Ss?-k`u editors were mistaken in attributing it to Li Shan. and also the story of the two women of Han-kao,18 18 *Wên hsüan 4.2b; but cf. also 12.28b and TPYL 802.8a, where it is attributed to the Nei chuan. both of which are lacking in present-day texts. It is likely that in these two cases we have also to do with textual omissions. As to quotations like "Snow flowers have six petals" in the I-wên lei-chü,19 19 I-wên lei-chü 2.4a; Po-shih liu-t`ieh 1.10b also has the quotation. since they all deal more with exegesis, it is likely they are quotations from the Nei-chuan text that through a copyist's 350 error have been falsely attributed. Tung Ss?-chang20 20 Ch`ui ying chi 12.7a-b. is probably mistaken in taking them all as parts lost from the Wai-chuan. The Han[-shu] "Essay" in entering the Han wai-chuan in the Shih classification seems to be doing so by analogy with the Nei-Chuan. Wang Shih-chên21 21 Wang Shih-chên, Tu shu hou 5.19b , Wei-ts`ai-lu ed. . speaks of the Wai-chuan as quoting the Shih to illustrate the story, not telling the story to throw light on the Shih; his remark is very apt. Today the explanations of the Shih contained in the Nei-chuan are lost, while the Wai-chuan has no connection with the interpretation of the Shih. Still, as the sole work of the period preceding Mao Ch`ang, it has been placed at the head of old commentaries of the Shih; as a result when students open the book they do not find what they are first of all looking for. We do not see any sense in so placing it. On the other hand, there is no place for it outside the Shih classification, and so by analogy with the I wei and the Shang-shu ta-chuan we put it off at the end.</field>

A collection of glosses from the lexical commentaries on the San chia shih and of readings variant from Mao shih, all derived from 357 quotations in commentaries and early sources. I have also consulted the enlarged version, the Shih-k`ao pu-chu, com. by Ting Yen (1794-1875), vols. 7, 8 in I-chih-chai ts`ung-shu , ed. of 1862. Shih-san ching chu-su , Palace ed. of 1739. *Shih-shuo hsin-yü , 3 ch. By Liu I-ch`ing , com. by Liu Hsiao-piao . Shih-tz? , vol. 11 in Hu-hai-lou ts`ung-shu . This is a reconstruction by Wang Chi-p`ei (1775-?), chiefly from Shuch`ao, of a work lost in Southern Sung times. That this was not the original Shih-tz? in 20 sections listed in Han shu 30, but a Later Han forgery is demonstrated by Sun Tz`u-chou, "Lun shih-tzu ti chên-wei," Ku shih pien 6.101-112 , ("A Discussion of the Authenticity of Shih-tz?.").
