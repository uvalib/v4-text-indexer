      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS, &amp;C. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the Student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorised to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every Student is free to attend the Schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; provided, that if under the age of twenty-one, he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall, for good cause shewn, allow him to attend less than three. The qualifications of the Student to enter the Schools of Antient Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy, are tested by previous examinations. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. In each School, there are three regular lectures a week; besides which, there are in most of them extra lectures suited to the several classes into which the school is divided. The mode of instruction is by text-books and lectures, accompanied by rigid examinations. The course pursued in each school, is as follows. I.âANTIENT LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison.âIn this school are taught the Latin and Greek Languages, and Literature, and the Hebrew Language. The instruction, given by prelections and examinations, comprises the following subjects: 1. The formation and composition of words, and the laws by which they are governed. 2. The primary and secondary signification of words and the principles by which they must be ascertained. 3. Syntax.âThe relations which words sustain to each other in a sentence, are taught at the same time and in connexion with their endings, the latter serving, with the aid of prepositions, &amp;c., as signs of the former. The importance of attending to the order in which words are arranged in a sentence, and of being careful to read the words and members of a sentence just as they stand in the Latin and Greek authors, is insisted upon. The other idomatic peculiarities are carefully noticed. 4. Metres and Quantity.âThese are objects of constant attention. 5. The Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature, are taught by prelections, and by commenting on portions of the text-books appointed to be read. These form part of the studies of the senior classes. The text-books are: In the Junior Latin Class:âHorace, Cicero's Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Comment; the last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. Zumpt's Latin Grammar is referred to. The student should have Lempriere's Classical Dictionary, new edition by Anthon, in two vols.; Adams' Roman Antiquities, and the Antient, with corresponding Maps of the series published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," or the "Ãton Comparative Atlas." In the Senior Latin Class: âJuvenal, Livy, and Tacitus. Of both Livy and Tacitus the student should have the whole works, so far as they remain. In the Junior Greek Class:âXenophon's Anabasis, a play of Euripides, or Ãschylus, and Herodotus. Buttmann's Greek Grammar, is referred to;âthe `Larger' Grammar of Buttmann, by Robinson, is to be preferred. Donnegan's Greek and English Lexicon, and Thiersch's Greek Tables by Patton, are recommended. In the Senior Greek Class:âEuripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. In the prelections to this class, it is attempted to introduce the student into the higher departments of grammatical criticism; references are made to the large Grammar of MatthiÃ¦, and to the annotations of Porson, Schaefer, Hermann, Erfurdt, Elmsley, &amp;c. 3 In Roman History, &amp;c.âThe students are advised to read the early part of Hooke's Roman History, with Ferguson's Roman Republic, Niebuhr's Roman History, and Heeren's Manual: also, Montesquie's "Grandeur et decadence des Romains," and Dunlop's History of Roman Literature. In Grecian History, &amp;c:âThe History of Greece published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, is the text-book. Reference is made to Mitford, Gillies, &amp;c. In both Grecian and Roman History, pains is taken to point out the antient authorities. In Hebrew:âBiblia Hebraica, edit: Van Der Hooght, by D'Allemand, London; or the revised edition by Aug: Hahn, Leipsic; which is better. Stuart's Hebrew Grammar, 3d edition, and Gesenius's Hebrew Lexicon, by Gibbs: (not the abridgement.) It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek, that they will read in their rooms a list of such authors and parts of authors, furnished by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture-room: e. g: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected), and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Terence, Plautus: Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the course, thestudents of each class are required to furnish regularly, once a week, a written exercise; which consists in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked: thus corrected, they are returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises, the classic authors are used as the text. The black-board is continually used for the purpose of assisting the student, by the aid of the eye, in comprehending and retaining the illustrations given. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. Professor BlÃ¦ttermann.âThe languages taught, in this school, are the French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo Saxon; and if desired, will also be taught, the Danish, Swedish, Hollandish and Portuguese Languages. In each of them, there are two classes, the senior and the junior, together with a third class for those who wish to qualify themselves for degrees in this school, as it is required that two degrees be obtained in modern languages before that of A. M. will be conferred.â Besides the oral translations in the lecture room, the students are required to write, as regular exercises out of the lecture rooms, translations from the foreign language into English, and vice versa. Lectures on the Literature of each of the nations whose languages are taught, are delivered twice a week, by the Professor; as also lectures on Modern History, and the political relations of the different civilized nations of the present day. The text-books used are the principal classics in each language. III.âMATHEMATICS. Professor Bonnycastle.âIn this school there are commonly five classes. Of these, the first junior begins with Arithmetic; but as the student is required to have some knowledge of this subject when he enters the University, the lectures of the Professor are limited to the theory, shewing the method of naming numbers, the different scales of notation, and the derivation of the several rules of Arithmetic from the primary notion of addition; the addition namely, of sensible objects one by one. The ideas thus acquired are appealed to at every subsequent step, and much pains are taken to exhibit the gradual developement from these elementary truths, of the extensive science of mathematical analysis. Lacroix's Arithmetic is the text-book. In Algebra, the first problems are analyzed with, and without, the use of letters, to make the student sensible of the advantages of these signs. In teaching the rules for adding, subtracting, &amp;c., they are compared with the correspondent rules in Arithmetic, and the agreement or diversity is noticed and explained. The text-book is Lacroix's Algebra. In Geometry, the first elements are taught, and illustrated by the use of models. The second junior class continue to read Lacroix's Algebra, and Bonnycastle's Inductive Geometry. In the latter, they successively acquireâthe theorems of Synthetic Geometryâthe theory and practice of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the latter to Nautical Astronomyâthe theory of Projectionâand the theory of Curved lines and Surfaces. Their subsequent studies usually embrace a portion of the Differential Calculus. The senior classes continue the Differential Calculus in lessons taken from Young and from Bonnycastle's Geometry, concluding the course of pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus, the theory of which is taken from Young, and the examples, from Peacock. There is, moreover, a class of Mixed Mathematics, for such of the more advanced students as choose to pursue it; which consists of parts of Venturoli's Mechanics, the first book of Laplace's Mecanique Celeste, and of the applications of the principles there given to various problems. And, lastly, there is attached to this school a class of Civil Engineering; wherein are taught the first principles of Descriptive Geometryâof the construction of draughts and plansâof surveyingâand lastly, of the construction of Roads, Canals, Bridges, and other publc works. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Patterson.âThe course of lectures in this school is divided into two parts, each of which is followed by a general written examination of the students. The first part treats of the properties of ponderable bodies, and includes Statics, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Hydrodynamics, Pneumatics, Crystalization, Molecular and Capillary Attraction, Strength and Stress of Materials, and Acoustics. The second part comprises Heat, (including Meteorology and the Steam-engine,) Electricity and Galvanism, Magnetism and Electro Magnetism, Optics, Astronomy. The text-books used are, Lardner and Kater's Mechanics, Lardner's Hydrostatics and Pneumatics, Brewster's Optics, the Treatises on Heat, Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism, and Electro Magnetism, in the Library of Useful Knowledge, and Herschel's Astronomy. As the enactments require only an acquaintance with arithmetic in order to enter this school, mathematical demonstrations, though not avoided by the Professor, are not required of the students of the general class. But the candidates for graduation form a separate class, and are taught the applications of elementary mathematics,, (Algebra Geometry, and Trigonometry,) to Natural Philosophy. The application of the higher calculus belongs to the school of Mathematics. The Apparatus provided for the school of Natural Philosophy is very extensive and complete, and thus enables the Professor to illustrate every part of his course by experiments in the presence of his class. An Observatory, with its appropriate astronomical instruments, is also attached to this school. V.âCHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Emmet.âThere are two classes in this school; one of Chemistry, to which there are lectures given twice a week, and the other of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, to which is given a lecture once a week throughout the session. In the Chemical lectures, all the important applications of the science to the mechanic arts, agriculture and domestic economy are noticed, and, when practicable, illustrated by experiment. In the lectures on earths and metals, the appropriate minerals are exhibited and noticed with reference to the sciences of Mineralogy and Geology. At the close of the history of inorganic matter, the atomic theory and the laws of definite proportions are fully explained and exemplified. The latter part of the course is occupied with the chemistry of organic substances, and it comprises the history, analysis and properties of each substance; to which are added general views of the connexion between Chemistry and the physiology of animals and vegetables. In the lectures on Materia Medica and Pharmacy, the subjects are treated in the following order:âThe operations of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical preparations, the effect which the combining of different substances has on their medicinal properties, the different classifications of the Materia Medica, and lastly, its several articles treated alphabetically. There is attached to this school, a very extensive apparatus and a laboratory, in which the students are occasionally permitted to see the operations, and to perform experiments. A free use is made of the black-board in these as in almost all the other classes in the University. VI.âMEDICINE. Professor Magill.âThe subjects taught in this school are Physiology, Pathology, Therapeutics, Obstetrics and Medical Jurisprudence. The last forms a distinct class, and comprehends other students in addition to those of Medicine A full course of lectures is delivered on each of the above branches. Dunglison's Human Physiology is the text-book on that subject; in Pathology and the practice of Medicine, Eberle's Practice of Medicine is recommended; in Obstetrics, Burns, or Dewees, or Gooch; and in Medical Jurisprudence, Beck or Ryan. VII.âANATOMY AND SURGERY. Professor Johnson.âIn Anatomy, the lectures are delivered from Subjects, with which the school is regularly supplied. The text-book is Horner's Special Anatomy. In Surgery, the text-book is Cooper's First Lines. This and the two preceding schools constitute the Medical Department of the University; and the candidates for the degree of "Doctor of Medicine," must pass examination in them all. An extensive Museum is attached to this department. It possesses one advantage, at least, over the other Medical Schools in the United States, in having a session of more than ten months, instead of one of about four. A full course of lectures in the Medical Department of this University, is considered as equivalent to a full course in both the Philadelphia and Baltimore Schools; so that a student with a certificate from this University of having attended a full course of lectures here, is entitled to stand for graduation at either of the above named schools, after having attended all the lectures there delivered for one session only. VIII.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Tucker.âThere are two classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres and Logic, the first half of the session, and Belles-Lettres and Ethics, the last half. The Senior, studies Mental Philosophy, the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, and Adam Smith. In the Junior Class, the examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers. There are also in this school, lectures on logic and general grammar. IX.âLAW. Professor Davis.âIn this school are taught the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, the Common and Statute Law, Equity, and Maritime and Commercial Law. This school is divided into two classes. The text-books studied by the junior class, are Vattel's Law of Nature and of Nations, the Federalist, the Virginia Report of '99, and Blackstone's Commentaries. Those studied by the senior, are Coke upon Littleton, (Thomas's edition,) Stephen on Pleading, Starkie on Evidence, (the first vol.) Toller on Executors, Chitty on Contracts, Bayley on Bills, Fonblanque's Equity, and Mitford's Pleadings; to which it is proposed to add a treatise on Commercial and Maritime Law. On these books, prelections are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient and explain what is obscure in the text, to refer in connection with it to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic under consideration, and generally, to offer such comments as he deems necessary to its thorough understanding. In these prelections, the statute law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law are particularly explained. Each prelection is preceded by an exami-, nation on the last together with its text. On government, and on various topics of National, Constitutional and Municipal Law, not discussed in the text-books, lectures are delivered; on which, also, the class are examined. Students not wishing to study Municipal Law, can enter for that portion only of the junior course, which embraces National Law, Government and Constitutional Law; which portion, those wishing to study Municipal Law only, can if they choose omit. The students of this school have instituted a Law Society, at the meetings of which the Professor presides. In it, questions connected with the studies of the school are discussed, fictitious cases litigated in the form of regular pleadings, and the issues produced decided in the appropriate mode, and the members exercised in conveyancing by having to prepare and submit to the Society the necessary deeds to effectuate supposed agreements, &amp;c. Religious exercises are performed at the University every Sunday, by a Minister of the Gospel, residing there, whose services are rendered on the private invitation of the Professors, Officers and Students. EXAMINATIONS. There are two public examinations of all the students, each session, the one at such convenient time about the middle of the session as the Faculty shall appoint, the other at the close of the session. These are thus conducted. The Professor of the School prepares, in writing, a series of questions to be proposed to his class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer them in writing, in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examinations, as determined by the following method. The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one half and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division.âThe examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the professor of the school and two other professors. The standing of each student at the examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian: and the names of those who are in the first divisions are announced on the public day, at the close of the session, and published in one or more of the newspapers of the State. DEGREES. Three honorary distinctions are conferred in this Institution; a Certificate of Proficiencyâthat of Graduate in any Schoolâand that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The first, the Faculty may confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of a competent acquaintance with any of those particular branches which, according to the regulations, may be separately attended in a school. The second, they are authorised to confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in the general studies of any of the schools. And the third, is obtained by graduation, in the schools of Antient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Moral Philosophy. But in all cases, to obtain a diploma, or certificate of proficiency, the candidate must give the Faculty satisfactory proof of his ability to write the English language correctly. No particular period of study is prescribed for the acquisition of these honors. The student obtains them whenever he can undergo the rigid examinations to which the candidates for them are subjected. The title of Doctor of Medicine is conferred on the graduate in the Medical Department. On the last day of the session, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students, assemble in the Rotunda, and the public are invited to attend. On this occasion, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced, and orations are delivered, and essays read by Students appointed for that purpose. EXPENSES, &amp;c. The expenses for the session of upwards of ten months, (commencing the 10th of September, and ending the 20th of July following,) are as follows:â Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance $100 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor, at cost, and 5 per cent commission, estimated, if only one student in the dormitory, at $30,âif two students in the dormitory at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two students 8 Use of the library and public rooms 15 Feesâif one professor be attended $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25âsay 75 Total (exclusive of books and stationary, clothing and pocket-money) $213 In addition to the regular see, $20 is paid by students who attend the Senior Class in the school of Law. Boarding-houses are provided within the precincts, for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except, that students above the age of twenty years, may reside out of the precincts, in such private boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. Every student resident within the precints, is required, on matriculat - ing, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate, till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, (two per cent.) to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, and twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purposes aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. 4 Students resident out of the University, are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of the Professors whom they propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows:âfor board, the use of dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated; for clothing during the session, a sum not exceeding a hundred dollars; for pocket-money during the session, not exceeding forty dollars; for books or stationary, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow; for medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These limits are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances, the Faculty shall allow it. Resident students are forbidden to contract any debts whatsoever; but for every thing purchased, they are forthwith to pay, or to draw upon a fund in the hands of the Patron applicable thereto. Students, wherever resident, are required to wear the uniform prescribed by the enactments; consisting of cloth of a dark grey mixture, at a price not exceeding six dollars a yard. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the Schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment: But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, and otherwise to the injury of the Institution. At the end of every month, a circular is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from the lectures he was bound to attend, and other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, that month; together with such information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, There are in the University, teachers of Music, Fencing and Dancing, authorised by the Faculty to give instruction in those accomplishments to such students, as wish to acquire them. A military corps has been formed by the students, and an instructor appointed, for the purpose of learning military tactics. One afternoon in the week is devoted to these exercises; but it is at the option of the student whether he will engage in them,</field>
