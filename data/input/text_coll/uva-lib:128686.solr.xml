ANNOUNCEMENTS THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only five or six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 18 and will close July 28, with lectures 5 times a week. The Second Term will begin July 30 and close September 1, with 6 lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each term. The Summer Quarter is conducted for white men and women students as follows: Elementary school teachers seeking certificate or degree credit, high school teachers desiring certificates or degree credit, students just entering college desiring advanced standing, undergraduate students, pre-medical students and pre-law students desiring to meet entrance requirements, medical students, engineering students, graduate students working for the master's degree or wishing to engage in research, school officials, supervisors and superintendents, and serious minded men and women who wish a wider knowledge of some special subject or seek broader general culture. Institute of Public Affairs.âThe eighth session of the Institute of Public Affairs will be held from July 1 through July 14 for the study and discussion of outstanding issues in national, state, and local government and of the economic and social problems underlying them. This year, in addition to topics of a national nature, there will be three round tables which will be international in character. The Institute of Public Affairs was inaugurated in 1927 to advance popular understanding of public questions and stimulate in the public mind a keener interest in public affairs. Its program that year was comparatively a simple one, consisting of 7 Round Tables and 18 Evening Addresses. It succeeded far beyond the expectations of those who conceived and planned it; and, because of the fact that it emphasized particularly the domestic problems of the United States and had among the speakers outstanding men in public life, it made a wide appeal to the American people. Since 1927, the Institute has grown both in the number of those participating in its programs and in the number of members and visitors in attendance. The attendance at the 1933 session, held from July 2 through July 15, consisted of registered members and visitors from 30 states and 9 foreign countries. The average attendance at the evening meetings was 914 with a top attendance of 1,700. Attendance.âA change from a six weeks' summer session to a full Summer Quarter was approved by the faculty and authorized by the Rector and Visitors in 1920 and its rapid growth has justified the wisdom of these bodies in establishing it. The total enrollment for both terms in 1933 was 1,507. Deducting duplicates in the second term there was a total attendance of 1,163 individual students. Of the total enrollment 1,081 were from Virginia and 426 from 33 other states and countries. There were 785 women and 722 men. Entrance Requirements.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students are admitted to such courses as instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage, but they should be graduates of accredited high schools or have had equivalent preparation. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Students who wish to enter the courses leading to the Normal Professional Certificate are required to make formal application on blanks which will be furnished by the Registrar of the Summer Quarter. Such applications should be filed in the Office of the Registrar before the opening of the Summer Quarter. LocationâCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about 650 feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir 6 miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1933, taken from the records of the U. S. Weather Bureau station at the University Observatory, were June, 72.7; July 76.3; August, 74.8. There are golf links, swimming pools, and many other attractions for summer visitors. Excursions.âOne of the most attractive features of the Summer Quarter are the trips to nearby points of interest and of beauty. Under the directorship of a competent guide there will be excursions to Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; to Natural Bridge; the battlefields in Virginia; the Endless Caverns and the Grottoes and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The trips to the famous caverns located in the Valley of Virginia have always been exceedingly popular. The underworld wonders of these caves are famous throughout the entire country and many tourists come from all over the world to see them. These trips are made by automobile and the scenic beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Piedmont Valley and the Valley of Virginia greatly enhances the pleasure and profit derived from them. The proximity to Richmond, Petersburg and Old Point Comfort should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the observatory. In addition to the trips suggested above, well planned and personally conducted trips are arranged to Washington and New York, if a sufficient number sign up for the trips. Since these are conducted by competent and experienced guides and are arranged for large numbers, a student can see more in less time and for less money than if traveling alone. To Endless Caverns and the Grottoes.âWednesday, July 4. Total cost, including transportation, entrance to both caves, and meals, about $7.50. To Natural Bridge and Lexington.âSaturday, June 23. An auto trip over the beautiful Blue Ridge and through the famous Shenandoah Valley. Cost about $6.50. To Monticello.âDates to be announced. Automobile round trip, including admission to grounds and buildings, $1.25. To Washington.âSaturday (date to be arranged), returning late Sunday. Total cost, including sightseeing trips through public buildings, Arlington and Mount Vernon, the Franciscan Monastery and National Cathedral, the services of a guide and chaperon, hotel bills (the party stops at the famous Mayflower Hotel), and railroad fare, approximately $20.00. To New York.âSaturday (date to be arranged). The New York excursion includes passage to and from New York, meals and all sightseeing cost except incidental car fare, and subway charges. The sightseeing includes, among numerous other features, Fifth Avenue, Broadway, Grant's Tomb, Columbia University, Chinatown and East Side, Aquarium, Brooklyn, the top of Woolworth Building, Statue of Liberty, and, if time allows, Coney Island. If a sufficient number desire it, a trip to Atlantic City will be arranged. Approximate cost from $16.00 to $18.00. The National Education Association will hold its annual convention in Washington, June 30 to July 7. The Dean of the Summer Quarter will issue leaves of absence to those students who desire to attend this convention for several days. Special rates to Washington will be arranged for that time. REDUCED COST OF LIVING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The Administration of the Summer Quarter has taken advantage of every opportunity possible to reduce the cost of living during the session in order to meet the needs of those whose incomes have been lowered, and therefore, takes pleasure in announcing very low rates for accommodation and board. Tuition charges have always been and now are lower than most other institutions of the same rank, and practically all railroad and bus lines offer reduced rates, so that necessary costs are reduced to a minimum and living is almost as cheap as at home. No student need be prevented from attending the Summer Quarter because the expense exceeds that in other institutions. Rooms and Board.âThe Summer Quarter is making a special effort this year to have as many of the students as possible live in the dormitories, thereby creating a closer school spirit and more comfortable living while attending the University of Virginia. Accommodations of various types can be found on the campus. Descriptions of these accommodations follow: The Halls. (For Men and Women.)âThese are the most comfortable, best equipped and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three apartments, of living room and bed room and semi-private bath, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. However, single apartments may be secured if desired. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table, steel waste-basket, two rocking chairs, two straight chairs, and floor plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single steel beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is of excellent quality. All bedrooms open directly into a semi-private bath. Save in a few instances, the occupants of two apartments use a connecting bath. Reservation should be made early to obtain such accommodations. (For Married Couples without Children.)âBasement apartments in the Halls are reserved for married couples without children. A number of these have private baths. Each suite in the Halls will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for these suites is $2.50 each person per week or $15 for the First Term and $12.50 for the Second Term. Suites for one person may be secured for $25 for the First and $20 for the Second Term. It is advisable to make reservations early. East and West Lawn. (For Women.)âThese rooms were completely renovated recently and are in excellent condition. They are double or single rooms opening directly upon a colonnade. All are provided with running water. Rooms occupied by two persons will rent for $12 for the First Term and $10 for the Second Term, per person. Single rooms will rent for $15 for the First Term and $12.50 for the Second Term. East and West Ranges. (For Men.)âThese rooms are similar to those on East and West Lawn and the costs of rental are the same. Houses E and F on Dawson's Row. (For Married Couples with Children.)âThese rooms rent for $2 per week per person or $12 for the First and $10 for the Second Term. Private Lodging and Boarding Houses.âThere are a number of lodging and boarding houses situated off the campus. All houses accommodating summer students must be on our approved list. A list will be sent upon application. Regulations in the Dormitories.âEach Hall and the Lawns will have a committee in charge selected by those rooming therein with the student hostess as chairman (there will be a student hostess living in each Hall and on the Lawns) and this committee will arrange for entertainment and recreation, and enforce regulations made by those rooming in the buildings, subject to the rule of the Administration. The Administration of the Summer Quarter requires that women students should dismiss men guests and be in their rooms by 11:30 every night, except Saturday night when they will be permitted company and leave until 12:30 without permission. Permission for leave after this time may be obtained from the hostess in charge of each Hall. Reservations.âApplications for rooms in the dormitories must be accompanied by a retaining fee of $1.00 per person, the remainder to be paid on arrival at the University. Each student must have a receipt from the Secretary for full payment of room rent in order to secure his or her room key. Checks should be made payable to the University of Virginia and sent to the Secretary of the Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Virginia. Rooms will be ready for occupancy June 15. If a room is not claimed by June 23 and no notice is received by the Secretary, the reservation may be regarded as cancelled and the room rerented. All transfers of reservations must be made through the Secretary, Miss Arehart. Board at the Commons.âThe University Commons is under the management of a trained dietitian. It is the aim of the University to serve substantial, wholesome and appetizing meals at cost. Therefore the rate is lower than that of other boarding places. Last session, the rate was $31.50 for six weeks. It is advisable to apply for board at the Commons in advance so that the lowest possible rate may be offered. The larger the numbers, the lower the rate will be. The Commons is the coolest building on the campus, which adds to its attractiveness. Its central location and nearness to class rooms makes it the most convenient place to eat. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following table may be taken as a fairly accurate approximation of necessary expenses for a session of five or six weeks. Necessary expenses are reckoned as University and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging and board. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

Reduced Railroad Rates.âReduced rates on the round trip identification plan will be authorized from points on the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western Railroads and from Southeastern territory. This year for the first time we are able to offer these reduced rates on railroads operating in the Central, Trunk Line, New England and Eastern Canadian Passenger Association territories, briefly described as follows: East of and including Chicago, Ill., and St. Louis, Mo., north of the Ohio and Potomac Rivers, to the Atlantic seaboard, including the New England States and points in Canada east of and including Armstrong, Fort William and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., also from Louisville, Ky. The basis will be one and one-third fare for the round trip, minimum excursion fare $1.00, and tickets will be sold only to students and members of their families upon presentation of identification certificates to ticket agents at time of purchase of tickets. The Southeastern Passenger Association will offer on their lines reduced rates which had not been determined at the time of printing of this catalogue. Ask your station agent in advance of your coming about rates. Tickets will be sold from June 15 to 19, inclusive, for the First Term; June 29 to July 15, inclusive, for the Institute of Public Affairs; and July 27 to 31, inclusive, for the Second Term. "Reduced Bus Rates.âBus rates are reduced to all Summer Quarter students for the first and second terms. Return tickets will be good until the end of the second term. No refund will be allowed on return tickets. Reductions will be given by the various lines as follows: Atlantic Greyhound Lines and Great Eastern Stages, Inc.,âround trip for one and one-half regular fare; The Short Lines, Inc., East Coast Stages, Peninsula Transit Corp., Piedmont Bus Corp., Southern Passenger Lines and Virginia Stage Lines,âround trip for one regular fare plus $1.00. It is understood that where a ticket is issued over two lines, each line will be entitled to $1.00 for a return fare. The buses will deliver students in the University grounds. The agents of the various lines will be glad to give full information upon being shown this announcement; or, if more convenient, students may write or wire S. A. Jessup, President Virginia State Lines, Inc., Charlottesville, Va. Phone 333." The above is the announcement in regard to reduced bus rates which appeared in the catalogue of 1933. Application has been made for the same rates this year but at the time of going to press a definite reply from the Bus Lines has not been received. Fees for Virginia Teachers and Students.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, leading to certification. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional course. To meet local expenses, a registration fee of $5.00 for a six weeks' term and a medical fee of 75 cents is charged all students except Virginia teachers, who pay no tuition, and are charged $10.00 registration fee. An extra fee of $5.00 will be charged for each graduate course. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, for which fees will be charged all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged the registration fee of $5.00 and $15.00 tuition. Virginia Teachers Other Virginia Students Students From Other States First Term Second Term First Term Second Term First Term Second Term Tuition fee $â $â $ 15 00 $ 15 00 $ 25 00 $ 25 00 Registration fee 10 00 10 00 5 00 5 00 5 00 5 00 The term "Virginia teachers" includes those who are now teaching in Virginia or whose last teaching was in Virginia. The term cannot be construed as meaning any of the following: 1. Those who are now teaching in another state. 2. Those whose last teaching was in another state. 3. Those who are planning to teach but have not yet taught. Women students from Virginia who are planning to teach but have not yet taught, may secure a State Scholarship which entitles them to free tuition in return for their pledge to teach two years in the public schools of Virginia. A student applying for such a scholarship should have her application endorsed by the Superintendent of the Division in which she lives. Fees for Non-Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 for each term and a tuition fee of $25.00 for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra course. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of courses to the regulations under which Virginia licenses are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer Quarter for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA medical fee of 75 cents will be charged each person who registers each term. This fee entitles him or her to free medical attention by the Summer Quarter Physician. Dr. Staige D. Blackford is the Summer Quarter Physician for the first term and Dr. Oscar Swineford, Jr., for the second term. They may be located at the University Hospital, telephone No. 548. Their office hours will be in the Student Physician's Office from 8:30 to 9:30 A. M., 4:00 to 5:00 P. M., and Saturdays, Sundays and holidays 12:00 Noon to 1:00 P. M. only. Students will be seen at other hours only in cases of emergency. Moderate charges will be made at the University Hospital under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Physician of the Summer Quarter; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at the usual charge for maintenance while there. The medical fee does not apply to cases requiring consultation with another member of the Hospital Staff and does not apply to cases requiring surgical operations and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for expenses incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated either by severe illness of the student or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions. In every case when a student is admitted to the hospital or receives treatment or advice from any one other than the Summer Quarter Physician, he or she should inquire about the cost in advance so that no misunderstanding may arise. Teachers' Preventorium.âVirginia teachers attending the University of Virginia Summer Quarter who are members of the Virginia Education Association, and who have made the required contribution of $4.00 to the Preventorium Fund, may receive hospital service at the Preventorium by first making application to C. J. Heatwole, Executive Secretary, Richmond, Va. Late Registration and Transfer Fees.âStudents who fail to register on the days specified for the purpose must pay a special fee of $1.00. Registration is not completed until all fees are paid; therefore, if fees are not paid on the registration days, $1.00 is added to the total of fees charged. A fee of $1.00 is charged for each change from one course to another after registration has been completed. No auditors or visitors are allowed in classes unless this privilege is mentioned in the description of the course. All who attend must be regularly registered and enrolled. Refund of Fees.âStudents who withdraw within the period allowed for registration and changes in program, that is, within the first week of the session, will be reimbursed the full amount of tuition fees and half the laboratory fees, but no other fees. Students who withdraw after the time allowed for registration and changes cannot be allowed reimbursement for any fees. Formal application for withdrawal, by notice to the Registrar before leaving the Summer Quarter, must be made and permission granted or no remission of fees will be allowed. Payment of Fees and Other Expenses.âThe Bursar does not cash personal checks, but will accept them in payment of the exact amount of fees, and they will be accepted at the Commons for meal tickets. Students should provide themselves with Travelers checks, or New York Drafts, which may be obtained from their home banks, or Postal Money Orders. A Branch of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville is located at the University where accounts may be opened, if desired. Time and Place of Recitations and Lectures.âRecitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 19, at 8:30 A. M. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except Saturday, June 30, to make up for registration day, June 18, and Saturday, July 14, to make up for July 4 which is a holiday. The length of recitation periods is one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Sunday Vesper Service.âThe Vesper Services held in McIntire Amphitheatre every Sunday evening at 7:30, draw thousands not only from the Summer Quarter but from the community. They consist of a religious address by a distinguished speaker, special music by the Vespers Choir and individual soloists, community singing and selections played on the big pipe organ in the amphitheatre. These Vesper Services have always proved to be one of the most attractive features of the Summer Quarter. The Vespers Choir.âThis Chorus is conducted along the lines of a city church choir of high standards. Students of the Summer Quarter, both men and women, particularly those with some experience in choral singing, are invited to join; membership is limited to thirty. Regular rehearsals are held each Tuesday and Friday from 12:30 to 1:30 in the Music Room when programs will be prepared to be given during the Vesper Services. The organization takes place Wednesday, June 20, at 7:30 P. M., in Madison Hall. General Assembly.âOn Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock, a general assembly of students and faculty will be held in Cabell Hall. The program will be informal and varied, and will be musical, devotional, educational, or recreational. Assembly will be under the direction of a faculty committee, and will be led by members of the faculty and prominent visiting speakers. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday there will be gatherings on the lawn in front of the Halls for games, singing, dancing, etc., thus affording an opportunity for students to become acquainted. Final Exercises.âThe Final Exercises will be held Friday evening, August 31, at 8 o'clock, when degrees will be conferred. Registration in Person.âThose students who will need advice before registering will register in person on June 15, 16, 18, in Peabody Hall. No student will be allowed to attend any class until his registration has been completed. Registration is completed and the student's card filed only after his fees have been paid in full. No student will be enrolled in any course without a card showing that he has been regularly registered for such a course and that his fees have been paid. Students are urged, therefore, to register and pay fees promptly on the days designated for that purpose. A delayed registration fee of $1.00 will be charged all persons after June 19. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 to 4:30 P. M. on registration days. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 26, except a certificate of attendance. Registration by Mail.âRegistration may be completed by mail to June 10. For the necessary blanks, address, Registrar, Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Va. Registration by mail is intended only for those who know the program of studies which they will take. All such prospective students are urged to register by mail. This will avoid the great congestion on registration days, and enable the students to arrive a day or two later. Students who register by mail are not expected to pay fees until after arrival at the University. Classes of students who should register by mail: Teachers who are working on a prescribed program of study. These students should send an official transcript of their credits to the Registrar. More careful attention can be given to the planning of such students' work than if left until the Registration days. Graduates of accredited High Schools, who are beginning work toward a teacher's certificate. As the work for such students is outlined for them, there will be no difficulty in their registering by mail. Teachers from out of the State. The work of such students is outlined by the Board of Education of their own State and therefore, they would not need advice in planning their work. College Students who have decided on a definite course of study. Procedure for Registration by Mail.âAfter receiving the registration blank from the Registrar, the student should answer all questions on the front of the card, and on a separate sheet of paper, list the classes which he wishes to pursue. After this card is returned to the Registrar, if the program is approved, the Registrar will fill in the classes on the back of the registration card. A list of the fees due will be sent to the student. Upon arrival at the University, the student should go immediately to the Bursar, in Monroe Hall, pay his fees and receive a card showing he may enter the classes for which he registered. Upon payment of fees, registration will be considered complete and the registration card filed in the Registrar's office. The General Library.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer Quarter, from 9 A. M. to 9:30 P. M. The collection contains about 120,000 volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. At the end of each term, the names of students who owe library fees or who have not returned borrowed books, are sent to the Registrar. No grades or credits are issued for such students until their names have been cleared at the library. The Heck Memorial Library.âThe Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. At present the library consists of over 9,300 well selected volumes covering most fields of Education, and files of national, state, and foreign publications. This library will be open from 8:30 A. M. to 9:30 P. M. Rest and Study Rooms.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Students' Union, will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer Quarter, from 9 A. M. until 10 P. M. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. The Secretary in charge requests the co-operation of all and invites the students to make Madison Hall "home" while at the University. The New Memorial Gymnasium.âThe new Memorial Gymnasium is situated between the athletic field and the University golf links, and offers facilities unsurpassed in any American university. The main exercise room is 180 by 96 feet, with a 10-foot running track gallery of 12 laps to the mile. There is also an auxiliary gymnasium 30 by 70 feet. The swimming pool is 30 by 75 feet, with a gallery for spectators. A general locker room provides for 1,700 full-length steel lockers, with two shower rooms. There are also spacious locker rooms and baths for home and visiting teams as well as special rooms for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, and three handball courts. The administration wing includes offices for the staff, examination rooms and a large lecture room. Twenty-four excellent tennis courts grouped around the new Memorial Gymnasium will be open to the students of the Summer Quarter. A small maintenance fee will be charged for their use. Students' Mail.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. Before leaving, each student should file at the post office his or her forwarding address; otherwise, mail without return address which comes after the student has departed, will be sent to the dead letter office. Teachers' Positions.âThe Appointment Committee of the Summer Quarter receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer Quarter file their applications. There will be no charge for this service except a small registration fee of $1.00 to assist in the expenses of the Committee. Regulations Concerning Credit.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Dean of the Summer Quarter the general average grade of each student in each course. Absence or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A report of each course completed will be signed by the Registrar of the Summer Quarter and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes his or her report sent should file with the Registrar not later than July 20, the First Term, or August 17, the Second Term, a self-addressed stamped envelope. Entrance Credit.âWhere college courses in the Summer Quarter are taken to absolve conditions or to meet entrance requirements, no more than 3 units of entrance credit may be obtained in a full quarter. College Credit.â I. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer Quarter. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer Quarter. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of courses in the Summer Quarter in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subjects, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those accepted for entrance to the University of Virginia. (c) The Dean of the College will accept for degree credit certificates of completion of Summer Quarter courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such Summer Quarter courses be approved by the University of Virginia professors concerned and the University Senate as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the winter session of the University. (d) Any course for which credit on a baccalaureate degree is allowed in this University must be a complete course, i. e., not a fraction of a course. For example, one or two terms only of a three-term course cannot be counted toward a degree. Similarly, when work is done elsewhere, one semester alone of a two-semester course cannot be counted toward a degree. However, combinations of fractions of courses may be allowed to count as complete courses with the approval of the Schools and Departments concerned. All courses for which degree credit is designated in this catalogue have been thus approved and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (e) Students, both men and women, who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit in the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer Quarter, but the summer work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (f) Graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter if approved by the Committee on Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; residence work aggregating three Summer Quarters shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. (g) Every applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter must spend the last three quarters in residence at this University. The above regulations regarding college credit hold also for the Department of Education. II. Credit from Other Colleges.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the signature of an official of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this University. In no case will credit be given on more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining 15 session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the Summer Quarter. Every applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter must spend the last three quarters in residence at this University. REGULATIONS The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the regular session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work; or five hours a week of lecture or recitation or five laboratory periods of two hours each a week for a term of six weeks in the Summer Quarter. The session-hour is equal to two semester-hours or three quarter-hours. Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student may undertake each term courses aggregating 3 session-hours with the exception noted in paragraph (I). (I) A student may take 4 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 4 session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Dean of the University. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercise) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any undergraduate course a grade of 75 per cent is required. Report of Grades.âA report of the final grade in each course pursued is mailed to each student as soon as practicable after the close of each term. In order to facilitate this and to insure his correct address each student is requested to leave a stamped, self-addressed envelope with the Registrar before the end of each term attended. The names of students who passed will be posted as soon as reported after each examination but no grades will be given out from the Registrar's Office. Transcript of Records.âAfter the original record is issued, a charge of twenty-five cents will be made for each transcript of a record. Remittance should accompany each application. Report of State Credits.âState teachers' certificates will be sent from the Department of Public Instruction, Richmond. Students who fail to get their certificates should communicate with the Supervisor of Certification, State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia. For certificate regulations see page 37. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with above, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. Re-examinations.âA candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be noted carefully that no student is entitled to more than one reexamination on a given course without repeating the course. The Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students through the Honor Committee. Parking Regulations.âMotor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or living more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park.

George Oscar Ferguson, Jr., Assistant Dean of the College and Chairman Committee on B.A. and B.S. degrees in the Summer Quarter, Administration Building, East Lawn. Other officers may be consulted by appointment. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the regular session of the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed in the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. Appropriate courses taken in the Summer Quarter count toward these degrees. No course offered by a successful candidate for one cultural baccalaureate degree can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward another cultural baccalaureate degree, whether in the College or in the Department of Education, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, exclusive of Physical Education, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. To obtain a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences an applicant must have been in residence as a college student for at least one session of nine months or for at least three full Summer Quarters. The last regular session or the last three Summer Quarters of candidacy must be spent in residence in the College of this University. Any course for which credit on a baccalaureate degree is allowed in this University must be a complete course, that is, not a fraction of a course. For example, one or two terms only of a three-term course cannot be counted toward a degree. Similarly, when work is done elsewhere, one semester alone of a two-semester course cannot be counted toward a degree. However, combinations of fractions of courses may be allowed to count as complete courses with the approval of the Schools and Departments concerned. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the signature of an official of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. Each applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter who will complete the degree requirements in the first term of the Summer Quarter must submit to the Dean of the Summer Quarter for approval by the proper Committee on Degrees, the program of work leading to the degree sought, not later than July 1 of the year in which the degree is to be obtained. If the degree requirements are completed in the second term the application must be submitted not later than August 8. Each student who expects to receive a degree at the close of the Summer Quarter is required to leave his or her name with the Registrar of the Summer Quarter on or before August 8. This is necessary in order that credits may be checked, caps and gowns ordered, diplomas engraved, etc. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREES OF BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 63 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 36 session-hours of required subjects as stated below.

This registration should promptly follow registration at the Summer Quarter Office in Peabody Hall. Graduate students must register in person and not by mail. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application as set forth below. Final approval of candidacy will depend upon the record made during the first term or quarter of residence. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least 6 collegiate session-hours, or 12 semester-hours, of foreign language (ancient or modern) credit are required. A reading knowledge of foreign languages may be attested by an examination. Note.âEach graduate student is urged to consult with the professor of the Major Subject, and to have his course of study finally arranged and approved before registering in Peabody Hall. No student may enter a graduate course for credit after three days. No graduate student is entitled to a re-examination on any course in the Summer Quarter on which his or her grade has been unsatisfactory. This deficiency may be made up during another summer or in the regular session. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Final Exercises must hand in their theses by August 1 and take their final comprehensive examinations as soon as their theses have been approved. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, or three Summer Quarters, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be aranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. Ordinarily, courses aggregating 12 session-hours, or 24 semester-hours, are required of candidates for Master's degree. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis to be accepted as satisfactory by at least two professors in the candidate's Major Subject in the regular session of the University. A candidate who expects to obtain the Master's degree in three Summer Quarters shall select his subject for a thesis not later than the beginning of his second summer of residence. This subject should be approved by October 15 following. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of good quality, 8Â½ by 11 inches, and bound in stiff board or cloth cover must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than August 1 of the summer at the end of which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must carry the author's name, degree, and the subject of the thesis, followed by the words: A thesis presented to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and two or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Graduate Work in Education.âGraduate work in Education leading to the degree of Master of Arts and Master of Science may be pursued in the Summer Quarter. Residence.âAs stated above, the Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters of two terms each. In no case will a degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three Quarters, the equivalent in time of the regular session. Graduate students in the Summer Quarter are required to make their Master's degree in three out of five summers, after being accepted for graduate courses without conditions. Graduate students are advised to continue their residence, if possible, during one or more terms of the regular session. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Final Exercises must notify the Graduate Office of their intention at the beginning of the Summer Quarter. Courses, Session-hours, and Grade.âOnly those courses marked C in this catalogue may be counted toward the Master's degree. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee on Graduate Studies. At least 12 session-hours of resident work, constituting a definite program of study and distributed over three Quarters, or six Summer terms, are required for the Master's degree. Terms devoted entirely to undergraduate study will not be counted in residence for the Master's degree. Grade.âA graduate student's standing in a course is indicated by one of the following symbols: A, B+, B, C. A is distinguished, B+ is very good, B is satisfactory, C is unsatisfactory. Failure to attain the grade of B on any one term will invalidate candidacy for the degree in the current session. PRE-LEGAL COURSES For admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued as a resident in a standard college courses acceptable toward a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least 30 session-hours or 60 semester-hours. All the required pre-legal courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Notice is given that beginning with the session of 1932-1933, non-theory courses in Art, Music, Education, Physical Training, or Military Training or other courses without intellectual content of substantial value will not be acceptable for admission to the Law School. The following subjects are recommended as desirable pre-legal courses: English, Latin, a Modern Language, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Accounting, Economics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Public Speaking. PRE-MEDICAL COURSES The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Pre-medical students are advised to take more than 30 session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking 33 or 36 session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least 30 session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the 30 session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects. Session-hours General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged. French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives. English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Ethics, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course. Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in general physics is a 6 session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and 6 hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is 4 session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he has registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. All the pre-medical courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. VIRGINIA CERTIFICATES During the Summer Quarter courses are offered which will meet the requirements for the following certificates. 1. The Normal Professional Certificate for primary grades and for grades 6, 7, 8. 2. The Collegiate Certificate for high school teachers. 3 The Collegiate Professional Certificate for high school teachers. 4. The renewal of certificates. 5. Requirements of the West Law. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NORMAL PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE The work for this certificate in the Summer Quarter was authorized by the State Board of Education by resolution December 15, 1924. 30 session-hours are required for its completion. This certificate permits the holder to teach in the elementary schools. It is valid for five years. The State Board of Education has passed a resolution to the effect that the Normal Professional Certificate, issued on the basis of graduation from a standard two-year teacher training institution, shall be the minimum grade of license for beginning teachers in elementary grades. 1. It is necessary for those taking work toward the Normal Professional Certificate to make formal application on blanks which will be furnished by the Registrar. 2. It is necessary to accompany this application with a statement of graduation from an accredited high school, or its equivalent. Only such graduates may secure credit for this course.* * For information regarding exceptions to this regulation, write Registrar of Summer Quarter. 3. It is necessary to file in the Registrar's office, a complete transcript of all credits earned at any other institution. 4 There is a residence requirement of six summer terms or three full Quarters for this certificate. However, under the new regulation passed by the State Board of Education in the spring of 1932 and which is stated below, a student who has taught successfully in Virginia for five years need not take the observation and practice teaching courses but may substitute other classes for them and such students are not required to satisfy the residence requirement of six summer terms. The State Board of Education has passed the following resolution concerning the Normal Professional Certificate: Acceptance of Successful Teaching Experience in Lieu of Practice Teaching for the Normal Professional Certificate.âWhereas the State Board of Education has by resolution required that on and after September 1, 1932, all beginning teachers in the elementary grades of the State shall hold at least Normal Professional Certificate; and Whereas many teachers of experience who are attempting to qualify for this certificate are hampered by the lack of adequate training-school facilities during the summer; be it Resolved that in addition to the present method of granting the Normal Professional Certificate it may be granted as follows: From July 1, 1932, to July 1, 1936, the Normal Professional Certificate may be issued to teachers who (1) have taught in Virginia for at least five years prior to July 1, 1932; (2) have completed all the requirements for the two-year teacher-training course except practice teaching; and (3) satisfy the State Department of Education, through such means as the State Superintendent may devise, of their success as teachers. Please observe that the above provision is applicable only to teachers who have had at least five years' experience in Virginia. Also please observe that the regulation was passed to overcome a temporary situation and that a time limit, 1936, has been fixed. It will be necessary, therefore, for those teachers who wish to secure the certificate under the regulation just passed to complete the requirements prior to July 1, 1936. A teacher's rating card has been prepared by the State Department of Education and will be sent to division superintendents and supervisors in order that an assessment of the teacher's work may be reported to the State Department of Education.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF COURSES Courses designated as A or B (for example, English sA1-I or English sB1-I) are credited toward the Bachelor's degree. C courses (for example, English sC1-I) are credited toward the Master's degree. The letter s before the number of a course denotes that the course is given in the Summer Quarter. The Roman Numeral I signifies that the course corresponds to the first term of the course in the regular session; II to the second, and III to the third term. Each A or B course, except courses in science which have a double credit value, has a credit of 1 session-hour per term of 30 lectures. Courses in Education, English, Industrial and Fine Arts, Music and Physical Education designated by Arabic numerals from 20 to 100 are of college grade but are not offered in this University in the regular session. They have a credit value of one session-hour, or one-half session-hour, as designated, toward the Elementary and the Normal Professional Certificates issued by the Virginia State Board of Education. Students, who have completed at least 30 session-hours of acceptable credit in a standard college or who present an official transcript of credit showing the satisfactory completion of the program leading to the Normal Professional Certificate at the University of Virginia or at some other standard Teacher Training institution, will be admitted as regular students in the Department of Education of the University. Courses designated by Arabic numerals above 100 have no credit value except those in Engineering. Any course for which credit on a baccalaureate degree is allowed in this University must be a complete course, i. e., not a fraction of a course. One or two terms only of a three-term course cannot be counted toward a degree. For example, a student will not be given final credit toward a degree for Philosophy sB1-I until the completion of Philosophy sB1-II and sB1-III. If a course is marked "Both Terms" it is repeated in the Second Term of the Quarter. A session-hour is equal to two semester-hours or three quarter-hours. The University reserves to itself the right to modify or withdraw any course, or to change instructors, as may seem wise.
