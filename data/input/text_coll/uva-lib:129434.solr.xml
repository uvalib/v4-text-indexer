For information as to lodging, board, etc., address the Bursar. Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been an integral part of the University from its foundation. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-1895, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as have satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âThe Law School is accommodated in its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. There are on the first floor four lecture halls, administrative offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Law Library.âThe Library contains more than twenty-three thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from income from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the Canadian and Australian Reports; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern searchbooks in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, and bound volumes of law magazines. Practically all the current American legal periodicals are received. Law students have the privileges of the general University Library. Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of the Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from November to June, inclusive. The Review is now in its fifteenth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. The Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools; is registered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York as meeting the requirements of the Court of Appeals regulating admission to the bar in that State; and is rated Class "A" by the Council on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, of the American Bar Association. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Faculty, and, indeed, of all law teachers, is that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Moreover, sound academic training tends to develop and to refine the ethical sense so necessary to an honorable career at the bar. It is this consideration that has been, in large measure, the motive of the Association of American Law Schools, and of the national and State bar associations of America, to stress, as these have been doing for some years, the need of a higher educational standard for students proposing to enter upon the study of the law. Students are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not as yet exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued in a standard college courses leading to a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least thirty session-hours. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Candidates for admission who have not completed the required thirty session-hours will not be admitted with the privilege of making up the deficiency while in the Law School. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Notice is given that two important changes in the requirements for admission are in contemplation, of which changes pre-law students should be forewarned. First: The exclusion, as subjects acceptable for admission to the Law School, of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education, Physical Training, Military Training, and Public Speaking. Second: The definite requirement, for admission to the Law School, of most of the following subjects, which are now recommended as desirable pre law courses: English, Latin, a Modern Foreign Language, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Psychology, Logic and Ethics. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session of 1920-21, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission are the same as in the case of male applicants. The High School Subjects for Admission to the College, and their values in units are indicated in the General Catalogue of the University, in connection with that department. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the work was done. Such certificate of College work must indicate the courses completed, the grades received, the time devoted to each course, and the credit, in session- or semester-hours, at which each such course is valued toward a baccalaureate degree. 2. Special Students.âA limited number of applicants who are at least 23 years old and who present proper evidence of good character and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, and only in exceptional cases, be admitted as special students, and not as candidates for the degree.1 1. The limitation of the number of special students conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association. Every applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law, with a statement of reasons why he was unable to qualify as a regular student. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean of the Law School not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. Admission with Credits.âNo advanced standing, or other credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence, and pursue all required courses in the curriculum, and pass the regular examinations therein.2 2. After considerable experimentation with the prevailing custom of giving credit for work done in other law schools, this rule was adopted in 1904. From the beginning the practical results were so satisfactory that it has become a firmly established policy of the Law School. The rule does not rest on an assumed superiority of curriculum or methods, but on the practical impossibility of dovetailing the parts of two differently arranged curricula. It also avoids certain evils usually accompanying the advanced standing privilege. For an account of the origin of the privilege of advanced standing, and the undesirable results, reference is made to Bulletin Number Fifteen (1921, p. 168) of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In the discretion of the Dean and of the professors in charge, an exception to the foregoing regulation may be made in the courses in Public Speaking and International Law, where these courses have been completed in an approved institution of collegiate rank before entrance into the Law Schoolâprovided credit for such courses has not already been utilized as a necessary credit on entrance requirements. GENERAL INFORMATION The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 20; the second, March 22; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No student may register for the work of the first term after October 15, nor for that of the second term after January 10ânor is registration in absentia permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those of the first year, should enter at the beginning of the session. Where this is impossible students may register at the beginning of the second term, but not later, save in exceptional cases. In case of such late entrance the student's chief handicap (often a serious one) will be lack of familiarity with preceding courses, on some of which his own work may be based. Entrance at the beginning of the later term, therefore, is not advised, but only permitted. Where the student has thus entered in a later term, he may not make up the work of the earlier term except by returning for such portion of a fourth year as may be necessary to complete his full three years of study. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $500 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $600 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee for residents of Virginia is $175; for non-residents, $195. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is sought to be made as thorough as possible, and is given mainly through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in many of the courses by the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for practically a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses in teaching the student to work out for himself the principles involved, and in illustrating the practical application of legal rules. The present organization of the Law School gives opportunity for more emphasis than formerly was possible on this form of instruction, and the casebook is now used exclusively in some of the courses, and in others not as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbooks and lectures. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses, in the Law Clubs, in Forensic Debating, and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by lectures and demonstrations three times a week during the first term of the first year, accompanied by the assignment of practical work in the library, on which numerous oral and written tests are held; and in the third year briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. Students are not required to become members of the Law Clubs, but they are strongly advised to take part in this work as it affords excellent training in the use of the library, in the preparation of briefs, and in the presentation of oral arguments. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be Virginia Pleading or Code Pleading.

WHITE LECTURE FOUNDATION This Foundation was established in 1922 by a gift of $10,000 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons, of the late William H. White, a distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University.

GENERAL REGULATIONS 1. Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a proper certificate indicating that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. These certificates should be forwarded not later than September first. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance (1) at the office of the Dean of the Law School and (2) at the office of the Registrar for every course taken. No credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails without good cause, to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine A. M. and one-thirty P. M. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Carrying over Uncompleted Work.âSubject to regulations below, students who are seriously deficient in the work of one year will be re-admitted on probation; and where the Law Faculty deems the deficiency serious enough the student must repeat the lectures in the courses in which he is deficient. No optional attendance is permissible in such cases, and only such a limited amount of new work may be taken as will not conflict with the previously incomplete work. 6. Probation.âStudents on probation are not entitled to leaves of absence except for imperative cause, nor are they permitted to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University. 7. Conditions of Readmission.âA student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 325 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session, but with the privilege of returning, on conditions, the next session thereafter. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 8. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 9. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per cent. on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation will be required. 10. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 8. 11. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than thirteen periods per week. 12. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject but has failed on the examination, may, with the approval of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. Re-examinations are granted only in this form, or in that designated in Regulation 20, infra. 13. Advanced Work.âStudents are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 14. General Requirements.âStudents of the Law School are required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which they are members, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 15. Dean's Privileged List.âAn average examination grade of ninety per cent. for the first two years will entitle the student to a place on the "Dean's List," which carries with it special privileges with respect to absences from lectures. The privilege will not exempt students from required practical work, nor from review quizzes; and the privilege is subject to the control of the professor in charge of Forensic Debating. The Dean may revoke the privilege if abused. 16. Extra-Curriculum ActivitiesâReports to the Dean.âStudents of the Law School who propose to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University, or who propose to devote a material portion of their time to work outside the Law School, are required to report their names and proposed activities at the Dean's office for official approval. In no case will such approval be given to a student on probation. A law student, under special circumstances, with the permission of the Dean, may register in the College Department for a course not exceeding three hours a week. See Regulation 6 foregoing. 17. Absence from the University is permitted on the written leave of the Dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organization. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 18. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professor in charge for sickness or other imperative cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined, and detract from his class grade. 19. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in case of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 20. Third Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âA candidate for the degree who in his third year is found deficient in one or more subjects, may return the following session and, without further attendance upon lectures, stand the regular examinations on such of his uncompleted subjects as the Dean and the professor or professors in charge may approve. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. In exceptional cases and for good cause this privilege may be extended to the student of any year. See Regulation 12. 21. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 22. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 23. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 24. Honor System.âAll quizzes and examinations are conducted under the Honor System. RECIPIENTS OF DEGREES, DEPARTMENT OF LAW, JUNE 12, 1928. Bachelors of Laws Abney, Hampton Parton, Jr. Sherman, Tex.
