      <field name="fulltext">TO GEORGE WILKINS KENDALL, ESQ., IN TOKEN OF RESPECT FOR HIS SKILL IN SPORTMANSHIP AND WOODCRAFT, NO LESS THAN OF PERSONAL REGARD, THIS LITTLE WORK ON SPORTING Is Respectfully Dedicated BY HIS FRIEND AND SERVANT FRANK FORESTER. A 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The very unexpected, perhaps unmerited, success, of the little series of sporting scenes and characters lately offered to the public in the “Warwick Woodlands,” has induced me to attempt something similar to it in general style, yet differing in this respect, that a regular though slender narrative of plot and story has been interwoven with the precepts, practice, and accidents of woodcraft, which, like its predecessor, it embodies. I have done this in the hope of rendering it more acceptable to readers at large, and to that fair portion of them, in particular, to whom such topics must be regarded for the most part as caviare. If I have succeeded, in any degree, in showing that my favourite field sports are not only not incompatible with refined tastes, elegant habitudes, and gentle manners, but most congenial to them; and at the same time admirably calculated to produce good feelings between the gentry of the cities and the yeomanry of the country, I shall be well contented with my labors; and, as they have wiled away some to me weary hours, I may perhaps venture to hope that others will not find them quite barren of amusing, if not useful, qualities. Henry Wm. Herbert. Newark, N. J., October 22, 1845.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. ENGLISH AND AMERICAN GAME. It wanted scarce an hour of sunset, on a calm, bright October evening—that season of unrivalled glory in the wide woodlands of America, wherein the dying year appears to deck herself, as it is told of the expiring dolphin, with such a gorgeousness of short-lived hues as she had never shown in her full flush of summer life and beauty—it wanted, as I have said, scarce an hour of sunset, and all the near and mountainous horizon was veiled as it were by a fine gauze-like drapery of filmy yellow mist, while every where the level sunbeams were checkering the scenery with lines of long rich light and cool blue shadow, when a small four-wheeled wagon with something sportsmanlike and rakish in its build, might have been seen whirling at a rapid rate over one of the picturesque uneven roads, that run from the banks of the Hudson, skirting the lovely range of the Western Highlands, through one— the fairest—of the river counties of New York. This little vehicle, which was drawn by an exceedingly clever, though somewhat cross-made, chesnut cob, with a blaze on his face, and three white legs, contained two persons, with a quantity of luggage, among which a couple of gun-cases were the most conspicuous, and a brace of beautiful and high-bred English pointers. The driver was a smart natty lad, dressed in a dark gray frock, with livery buttons, and a narrow silver cord for a hat-band; and, while he handled the ribbons with the quick finger and cool head of an experienced whip, he showed his complete acquaintance with the way, by the readiness and almost instinctive decision with which he selected the right hand or the left of several acute and intricate turns and crossings of the road. The other was a young gentleman of some five or six and twenty years, finely and powerfully made, though not above the middle height, with curly light-brown hair and a fair bright complexion, indicative of his English blood. Rattling along the limestone road, which followed the course of a large rapid trout stream, that would in Europe have been termed a river, crossing it now and then on rustic wooden bridges, as it wound in broad devious curves hither and thither through the rich meadow-land, they reached a pretty village, embosomed in tall groves and pleasant orchards, crowning a little knoll with its white cottages and rival steeples; but, making no pause, though a neat tavern might well have tempted the most fastidious traveller, they swept onward, keeping the stream on their right hand, until, as they came to the foot of a small steep ascent, the driver touched his hat, saying—“We have got through our journey now, sir; the house lies just beyond the hill.” He scarce had finished speaking, before they topped the hillock, and turning short to the right hand pulled up before a neat white gate in a tall fence, that separated the road from a large piece of woodland, arrayed in all the gorgeous colors wrought by the first sharp frost of autumn. The well-kept winding lane, to which the gate gave access, brought them, within a quarter of a mile, to a steep rocky bank feathered with junipers, and here and there a hickory or maple shadowing the dense undergrowth of rhododendrons, kalmias and azalias that sprung in rich luxuriance from every rift and cranny of the gray limestone ledges. Down this the road dived, by two rapid zig-zags, to the margin of the little river, which foamed along its base, where it was spanned by a single arch, framed picturesquely of gnarled unbarked timber; and then swept in an easy curve up a small lawn, lying fair to the southern sun, to the door of a pretty cottage, which lay midway the northern slope of the valley, its rear sheltered by the hanging woodlands, which clothed the hills behind it to their very summit. A brilliant light was shining from the windows to the right of the door, as if of a merry fire and several candles mingled; and, in a minute or two after the wheels of the wagon rattled upon the wooden bridge, it was evident that the door was thrown open; for a long stream of mellow light burst out on the fast darkening twilight, and the next moment a tall figure, clearly defined against the bright background, was seen upon the threshold. A minute more and the chesnut cob was pulled up in front of the neat portico, and the young Englishman leaped out and darted up the steps. “Well, Fred, you're here at last—” “Harry, old fellow, by Jupiter! but I'm glad to see you!” “And so am I right glad, Fred; and really obliged to you for coming up to see me here in the mountains. I would have come down to the river myself for you, but I had to ride over into Deer Park after breakfast, to get a match for Master Bob there”—pointing as he spoke to the chesnut cob, which, not a wit the worse for his long rapid drive, stood champing his light bit and pawing up the gravel, as if he had but just been brought out of his stable. “I hope he brought you up in good style, Fred?” “That he did, Harry; that he did; in prime style! Two hours and forty minutes from—Newburg don't you call it?—up to your gate here; and that's twenty-eight good miles, I fancy—” “Thirty, Fred, thirty; every yard of it. It's twenty-eight and better to the village—but come in, come in; and, you sir, get out all the traps and put them in the hall till Timothy has time to look to them, and take Bob round to the stables and go to work upon him. What are those—pointers, Fred? Exactly! well, put them in the little kennel by themselves, and see they are well fed and bedded. Pointers are no use here, Fred. English-broke pointers, I would say—they range too high, and cannot face our coverts. But come in. I was just taking a cup of coffee and a weed; for I dined early, knowing that you could not be here in time; and we will have some supper by and by, and in the mean time you shall either join me in the Mocha, or have a long cool drink, or something short, just as you fancy it.” And with the words, my old friend Harry Archer— for the host was no other than that worthy, who had exchanged his menage in the city for a snug shooting-box among the hills of Warwick—led his old friend, who had but lately landed from the Boston steamer, through a small vestibule adorned with stands of myrtle and geranium and two or three camellias, into a narrow hall or passage, the walls of which were decked with several pairs of red deer antlers—whence swung full many a sylvan implement—a map or two of the adjoining states, and several of Herring's life-like portraits— the champions of the English turf, the winners of the Leger and the Derby. “This is but a little box, Heneage,” said Harry as they entered—“My one spare bed is literal. There were but four rooms in the house when I bought it; unless you count the garrets, which are not habitable; but I have built a kitchen and two or three servants' rooms behind; and so we must make shift till I get rich enough to add some more bed-chambers—the people hereabout swear that I am crazy, and that I lodge my horses and my dogs better than I do myself. B But if it is small, Fred, it is snug and clean; and with the word he threw open a door to the right, and leading his friend into a little library—“this is my snuggery,” he added, “and that,” pointing to a door opposite the windows, which were two in number, reaching to the ground and overlooking the lawn and river, “that is my bed-room. Across the hall, as we call it by a liberal courtesy, is the dining-room, and behind it your dormitory. Now, then, take this armchair by the fire—and here comes Timothy—you've not forgotten Timothy, Fred? It's Mister Heneage Tim!” “Nay! but ay's vara glad to see thee,” exclaimed Harry's inimitable Yorkshireman, pulling his toplock with his left hand, while he thrust out the other horny paw with a grin of unfeigned delight—“Ay's very glad to see the i' these pairts—noo, damn me if ay isn't! An' hoo's they aw i' You'shire?” “Right well, Tim; all our friends; all that I think of, that's to say—but I see you stick to Mr. Archer, yet, Tim!” “Stick tull him—weel ay wot—he wad na get along at aw withoot me, He's got faive horses oot i' t'stable, and seven dogs i' t' kennel; forbye auld Charon—for he gangs whaure he wull—and hoo'd he do without Tim Matlock! Nay! nay, ay's niver quit him, Measter Heneage; but ay'll gang noo and fetch oop soom hot coffee—or mayhap, sur, you'd take a soop o' t' auld Shrub or Glenlivat.” “No, no Tim, coffee by all means—and now I'll blow a cloud, so hand me—ha! do you stick to the Manillas as of old? Well, it is certainly impossible for any thing to be nicer or more comfortable than this.” And well might he say so; for though the room was small, not above eighteen feet by sixteen, with a low ceiling and large projecting mantelpiece, and though the furniture was simple and by no means expensive, nothing could be more truly or more tastefully complete. A large bookcase of the black walnut of the country filled the recesses on either hand the fire-place, their glass-doors showing a well chosen library of something more than a thousand volumes, classics and history, and the best English poets and romances, with a few French and Italian writers, in elegant and costly bindings. The space above the fire-place was filled, instead of a mirror, by a large case with a sliding front of plate glass, containing an arm-rack lined with crimson velvet, well garnished with two superb twin double-barrelled guns, by Purday, a heavy ounce-ball rifle, by the same prince of makers, a short but large-bored twelve-pound duck-gun, a case of nine-inch pistols, by old Kuchenreuter, a smaller brace, by Manton; and three or four hunting knives, of various sizes and construction. On either side the door, which led to the bed-chamber, stood a small slab or table, the one arranged with inkstandish, portfolio, presse papier and all the apparatus of the scribe; the other covered with powder-flasks and shot-pouches, screw-drivers, dog-whips, drinking-flasks, and, in short, every thing a sportsman could require, not thrown about at random, but all displayed symmetrically, and bright and free from dust. The walls were hung with several excellent line engravings, from sporting subjects, by Lanseer. The floor was carpeted with a grave but rich Brussels, which was not unpleasantly relieved by the deep crimson curtains and cushions of the massive old-fashioned settees and sofas, with which the room was bountifully furnished. A large round centre-table, with a crimson cloth, supported a tall brass reading-lamp, and was strewn thickly with portfolios of good engravings, an annual or two, the Spirit of the Times, and the last numbers of the Turf Register, with several English Sporting Magazines, and other periodicals; but it was now pushed back from the fire toward the large, soft-cushioned sofa which occupied the whole length of the opposite wall, and its place taken for the nonce by a small trivet, on which stood an antique salver, with a coffee pot and sugar dish of richly chased and massive silver, a cut-glass cream jug, with a small stand of liqueurs, two tiny glasses, and two coffee cups of Sevres China. A pile of hickory logs was crackling and flashing cheerfully upon the hearth; a pair of wax candles were blazing on the mantel-piece, the superannuated Russian setter, to whom Tim had alluded, was dozing on the rug; and, heedless of the neighborhood of her natural foe, a beautiful, soft, tortoise-shell cat sat purring on the arm of Harry Archer's own peculiar settle. Such was the aspect of the room, which Heneage, fresh as he was from London and all the finished comforts of English country-houses, in the first month of his first visit to America, pronounced the very acme of perfection, as a bachelor's establishment. “Wait till you see my stables, and my kennel, my quail-house, where I save them through the winter, my my little flower-garden, and my dairy, and my ice-house. We have turned Jacks of all trades, Timothy and I. And now, with the exception of my old woman, for—this is a very moral country, and I am, you know, a very moral man—to save my character, I got the ugliest and oldest cook in all America—upon my soul I sometimes fancy she must have been in the ark with Noah!—with the exception as I say, of my old woman, you have seen all the members of my menage. She cooks and makes the beds, and cleans the chambers, as she persists in calling the bed-rooms, being of course a Yorkshire woman—Tim would have died had I got even a Northumbrian—and Timothy is butler, and stud-groom, and valet, and game-keeper, and, of late, I believe head gardener; and that imp, Dick, who drove you up, with an extraordinary negro genius, who never takes his clothes off from one year's end to the other, or sleeps in a bed, summer or winter, preferring the hay-loft at all seasons, do all the work of the house, garden, kennel, stable, and of my little farm; just twenty acres, Fred! on which I feed two Alderneys, and fatten yearly a dozen or two of right black-faced Moor mutton.” Meantime the friends discussed their coffee, and puffed their favorite cheroots, and, meeting now for the first time in many years, chatted of many things, and called old scenes to mind, and asked and received tidings of many an ancient friend, and passed, in short, two hours as pleasantly as could have been desired if they had planned it, until the door was opened, and Timothy thrust in his sleek black head at the aperture, informing them that “T' sooper was ready noo, and wad be cold if they waited ony langer”—a piece of information which brought them to their legs with speed; and not them only, but Master Charon likewise, who, though he had been voted slow and superfluous in the field, had yet abated nothing in the keenness of his nose, so far at least as meal times were concerned, come as often as they might. The dining-room, which was precisely of the same dimensions with the library, was furnished with the same nice attention to details, the same harmonious taste, which imparted an appearance of luxury and richness to articles in themselves by no means extraordinary. The curtains and all the furniture, as in the other room, were crimson, the hues of the carpet in some sort matching them; a large sideboard of black walnut faced the fire-place, glittering with fine cut-glass and small but beautiful selection of old-fashioned silver, among which shone resplendent a superb cup, or vase, won by the prowess of the owner at the Red House, against no few or mean competitors in pigeon shooting, and two tall richly gilded tankards, watching like sentries on the flanks of the array. The B 2 table was drawn up close to the fire, which blazed with a fierceness that would have been almost intolerable, but for a screen that intercepted a portion of its heat, and was covered by a cloth of dazzling whiteness, whereon was arranged a supper service with two covers, in a style so accurate and tempting as to have pleased the sagest gourmet, while the morocco armed chairs, which stood at either end, promised a world of voluptuous comfort. The whole room was one blaze of light, and nothing could by any means have been conceived more cheerful than the aspect of the whole. “Now, Fred,” said Harry as they entered, “I trust your drive has given you an appetite, for I have no doubt Timothy has got us something tolerably eatable. What is it, hey, Tim?” “Nay, sur, ay's sure ay canna tell ye; for ay's been sorting Measter Heneage's things loike, and suppering oop t'twa pointer dogs he brought wi' him.” “Well, well, take off the covers and let us see. Broiled wood duck here; which I can recommend, Fred; they are as good a bird as flies, excepting always the royal canvas-back—let me give you a half a one; with a squeeze of that lemon, and a dash of Cayenne, you'll find it more than passable. There, cover those cock up again, Tim, and put them by the fire—are those the birds I shot yesterday? Exactly; that's right!—let's see those side dishes—ha! cauliflowers à la creme, and stewed cellery. Now then, Fred, what wine? There's some dry still Champaign in ice there, if you like it; and some pale Sherry here, that I think good; there's claret in the cellar; but I think the weather's too cold for Bourdeaux—Port does not suit this climate; but I've got some Madeira that will do your heart good.” “Oh! Champagne, Harry, Champagne for supper always. Your Sherry and Madeira are dinner wines, me judice.” “I agree with you, Fred; open that long neck, Timothy. Well, now, what think you of the wood duck?” “Excellent—good indeed—but why do you call it wood duck, Harry?” answered Heneage, with his mouth half full of the tender juicy broil. “Because they live in woods, Fred; and perch, and build their nests in trees.” “Oh! humbug! that's a touch too much of a good thing, old fellow.” “It's true, though, every word of it. You'll find game here one thing, and game in England quite another, I can tell you, Master Fred—aye! and covert shooting here, in these wild swamps and wooded hills, a very different sort of matter from a Norfolk battu. The big glasses, Tim, the long-stemmed beakers!” he interposed; and his orders was speedily obeyed; and the rich dry Champagne stood mantling, with no cream, and a few bead-like bubbles only floating around the brim, in two tall half-pint goblets of Venetian crystal. “By George! but that is splendid, Harry,” exclaimed Fred Heneage, as the seductive liquor disappeared. “Yes! half a woodcock if you please.” “No half about the matter, Fred; they are but little chaps, these woodcocks of America—not half so big as ours. But then, they positively swarm here.” “Why aye!” responded Heneage, receiving the whole bird, which Harry sent to him, with all complacency. “Why aye! Frank Forester, whom I saw for an hour or two in New York, told me—by the way, I forgot to tell you that he says he will be here on Friday. Where will you stow him?” “O, I make point de fa?on with Master Frank. He will take Tim's room, I suppose; who will turn Dick out; that is to say, if he does not prefer a room at old Draw's, in the village. I often stow my supernumeraries there. What did he tell you anent the woodcock?” “Oh, I don't know—some wondrous yarn or other; I did not pay much attention, or believe one half what he said—something about killing them by hundreds in a day.” “Well, so we do; the commodore and I bagged last year, between sunrise and sunset, one hundred and fifteen.” “Not really! And how many shall we get to-morrow?” “Try another glass of Champagne, Fred, and then I'll explain. Do you think this too cold?” “No! perfection. A bit of that cauliflower if you please. Now, then, about to-morrow.” “Why, Fred, this is fall shooting, as we call it here; and, in the autumn, birds are not to be found in such swarms as in July—nevertheless, it is a very good year —there has been quite a sharp frost these last three nights, to the northward, and they are coming in fast. I have killed none to speak of yet, and not a gun but mine has been fired in the valley these two months. So I think we are sure of sport. I shall kill from twenty-five to thirty cock off my own gun to-morrow, and Frank would do nearly as much, if he were up here. You, I suppose will get fifteen—” “Cool that, by Jupiter!” replied Fred Heneage— “why, I can beat Frank Forester like bricks!” “You could—you mean to say—you could beat him three years ago in a Norfolk turnip field.” “Yes could I, or on a Scottish moor, or in an Irish bog.” “I dare say—I dare say,” responded Harry, very coolly; “but you see Fred, a Scottish moor and an Irish bog are vastly different things from a Yankee swamp, as you will find, before you have been out an hour to-morrow. The first requires, I admit, the wind and sinews of a mountaineer, the pluck of a prize fighter, and the endurance of a Captain Barclay,—the second cannot be braved with impunity but by one who can `bound from hag to hag,' as Scott has said it, `like any Bilhope stag;' but the unstable bottom, the fallen trunks, the mossy tussocks under foot, the tangled vines and thorny briars woven in strange inextricable mazes about your knees and thighs, and even up to your breast and face, the dense impenetrable foliage over head, the impossibility of seeing your dog half the time, although he may be on a dead point tea feet from you—the necessity of firing nine shots out of ten, even when pointed, as if they were chance shots—of killing above half your birds, if you kill them at all, by firing on an instinctive calculation of their line, seeing them only `with the eye of faith,' as poor J. Cypress, Jr. used to call it—all these things, and the farther fact that two at least of the winged game of these regions— the quail, namely, and the ruffed grouse—are the quickest and strongest on the wing, the hardest to hit at all, and the most difficult to stop by hitting, of any birds that fly—make the odds very great that the best English shot will bungle it cruelly for the first season; and if he shoots well on the second, I call him a right apt disciple. And so I say that if you could beat Frank like bricks three years ago, he can beat you three times as badly now. His first year he shot shamefully, though he, like you, had the advantage of beginning in the autumn, when most of the leaf was down. I, on the contrary, commenced in July, when every thing is in full leaf, and such a flush of foliage, as you cannot conceive from any thing you ever saw at home. Now Frank shoots at least as well again as he did when he left home, and you will not shoot half as well as you did, at least for the first year—after that you will improve at once, and if you stay here three or four seasons you will astonish yourself when you get home, or, what is the same thing, when you by accident get any open shooting.” “Well, it may be so—I suppose it is, if you say so, but I don't know. Did you ever shoot badly here?” “Not badly—no, Fred,” answered Harry, “badly is not the word at all—infamously!—I shot infamously the first year.” “And do you really shoot better now than you did at home?—you were a good shot always.” “So much so that I very often think it would be impossible for me to miss a shot at all in partridge shooting, or one in six in battu. But come, we have got through our game. Timothy, look alive, man—bring the caviare, and devilled biscuits, and what will you have by way of tipple, Fred?—a bowl of mulled wine, or some hot rum punch? I've got some very old pineapple rum; or simple whiskey toddy?—the Ferintosh is undeniable I tell you.” “Why, Harry, I believe the rum punch is the thing.” “Very well—see here, Timothy, hand this caviare to Mr. Heneage, and fill us out a thimble full a piece of that curious white cogniac; and look sharp, and bring a tankard full of water screeching hot, and a flask of the rum from the second locker, a bottle of Scotch whiskey, sugar and lemons, and the cigar box. Now then, take a bit of the biscuit, Fred, and a taste of caviare—wash it down with that brandy—that is a curiosity; white brandy is rare in this country, but I imported this myself. And now, when Timothy comes back, we'll transplant ourselves to the chimney corner— have a small trivet just to hold our glasses and materials, and blow a cloud till bed time.” Many minutes did not elapse before these preparations were effected, the supper table cleared, the smoking punch and toddy brewed to the several tastes of the companions, the choice manillas lighted, and a small cloud of thin gray smoke curling in lazy wreaths about the heads of either friend. For some brief space they sat in silence, both wrapped, as it appeared, in a voluptuous calm abstraction, the natural consequence perhaps of satiated appetite, aided by the soft influence of the soothing weed; but both in reality thinking, and that too rather deeply, on matters growing out of their late conversation. Harry was pondering in his mind whether of two beats would be preferable for to-morrow? the one being by far the better for woodcock, but in bad rotten ground and exceedingly thick coverts; the other much opener and easier shooting, but not by any means so favorite lying for the long billed birds of passage; while Heneage was ruminating on all that he had heard, and marvelling not a little, and half doubtful whether he was not the subject of some wilful mystification, touching American field sports on the part of his companion. After awhile, however, he raised his eyes to a large and fine oil painting which hung over the fire-place, and which, from the accidental position of both the argand lamps on one—and that the right—end of the mantel-piece, was clearly visible in its best light. At first, his eyes fell on it by mere chance, and then were riveted by the grand massing of the light and shadow, before he had so much as observed the subject of the painting. He was then on the point of speaking, and asking his friend something of the artist, when an idea struck him, and he examined it, not with a critic's only, but a sportsman's eye; for, like most of the decorations of Harry's shooting box, it was connected with those matters that were for the most part uppermost in the mind of the owner. It was a large and nobly executed piece—a view of a narrow woodland lane expanding in the foreground of the piece into an open meadow, where it was closed by a set of strong timber bars. The wood and winding lane were actually nature—the gnarled and mossy trunks of the large trees just gilded on their western edges by the ruddy beams of the declining sun, the rich autumnal foliage over head here opening to let in long penciled rays of living yellow lustre, there blackening into twilight shades, impervious to the strongest light; and the mossy greensward, checkered with slant gleams and long shadow, and the sandy lane most naturally varying from the brightest tints of ochre to the deepest umber, as it was touched by sunshine, or overhung by heavy foliage. The left hand foreground of the picture was occupied by a tall oak, its deep brown coppery umbrage casting a massive gloom over the earth below it, while here and there a flickering glance of gold glinted on its rough boll between the sere leaves. In the front of this, brought into strong and palpable relief, for it was in broad light, stood a stout-built gray pony, with a long tail and heavy tangled mane, looking out of the corner of his eye with a half vicious glance, as if more than half inclined to kick at a spaniel, which seemed to be tickling his forelegs by the feathery motion of his thick silky tail. A saddle lay ungirt by the dog, with its strappings, crupper and stirrups and surcingle, cast in disorder on the ground, as it had been flung down by the smock-frocked urchin who leaned against the rails, holding the bridle carelessly in one hand thrust under his frock, and watching the actions of the principal personage, a stout, athletic man, with shooting-jacket, game-bag, boots and leather leggins, who was employed, a little way advanced before the rest, in smoothing down the feathers of a superb cock-pheasant, which he was holding up by the neck with his right hand, its varying and gorgeous hues glittering and glowing in rare mimicry of life. A large hare and small rabbit hung by their heels from the top rails of the fence, while a great pile of game, composed of hares and pheasants only, was heaped up at the sportman's feet, his double-barrelled gun leaning against a post in the extreme right foreground, a bright and golden glitter falling upon the yellow bank, and the light foliage of the bushes just behind it, and sleeping lovingly upon the sere and faded herbage that lay below, with every blade of grass, and shivered stick, and small white pebble, laughing out all distinct and sharp in the soft sunset. No words, however, can describe, so as to convey an idea of its vraisemblance, the strong reality, and truthfulness, of that noble picture; and Harry Archer, as he observed his friend, whom he knew to be an amateur and connoisseur of no mean judgment or ability, said nothing, but, supposing only that he was admiring its very visible and striking beauties, relapsed into his own revery; from which he was aroused at length by a loud burst of laughter from Fred Heneage. Looking up, not amazed a little at this sudden interruption, he was encountered by an expression so funnily and joyously triumphant in the face of Fred, that he was constrained to laugh as he asked, “What now—what the devil's in the wind now, Heneage?” “So you've been humbugging as usual—stuffing me—at your old tricks—hang it!—but I'll pay you for it.” “Now what do you mean in the name of all that's wonderful?” Harry exclaimed, himself quite mystified. “I have not stuffed you; and, in truth, I cannot even guess what you are driving at.” “Oh! no—not you, I warrant you—here you've been cramming me all night about ruffed grouse, and quail, and wood ducks, and Heaven only knows what else; and making me eat snipe under the name of woodcock—though they were mighty large snipe I must acknowledge—just for the sake of cramming me that woodcock in America were not woodcock. I suppose you think I have never read about pheasant shooting in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and partridge shooting in Virginia and New York. But no you don't—no you don't master judge! I am not to be had to night.” C “Faith! but you are had pretty thoroughly. Oh! how I wish Frank Forester were here—but I'll tell him—I'll tell him if I die for it, and he shall cook it up for some of the magazines, that's poz. But how did you find out that you were had, Fred?” “Why, I tell you, I have read books about America, if I never have been here before, and I know that there are pheasants in Pennsylvania, and partridges in New York and Virginia.” “Well, well, I grant that—I grant that—but did you chance to read, too, that the partridge of New York is not the partridge of Virginia—and farther yet, that the partridge of New York is the pheasant of Pennsylvania and New Jersey? And farther, once again, that neither the partridge of New York nor the partridge of Virginia is a partridge at all—nor the pheasant of any place on this side the Atlantic a pheasant?” “No, Harry, I never did read that—and you may just as well stop stuffing me, when I sit here with the proof of your villany before my eyes.” “Where, Fred—where is the proof—hang me if I know where you are in the least!—where is the proof?” “Why this is too much! Do you think I'm blind, man?—there!—there in that picture!—don't I see pheasants there, and hares too?” “Oh! yes, Fred—yes, indeed!” shouted Archer, choking down a convulsive laugh, that would burst out, at times almost overpowering him. “Yes, that is it, certainly—and those are hares and pheasants—and that's a right smart Jersey trotter, I some guess—a critter that can travel like a strick—and the boy holding him—that's a Long Island nigger, now, I calkilate,—oh, ya—as! and that's a Yorker on a gunnin' scrape, stringin' them pheasants! ya—as;” and he spoke with so absurd an imitation and exaggeration of the Yankee twang and drawl, that he set Heneage laughing, though he was still more than half indignant. “No!” he said, when he recovered himself a little, —“no, I didn't say that—the boy is not a nigger.” “A white nigger, I some think!” responded Archer, still on the broad grin. “No, not a nigger at all—and that does not look much like an American fast trotter either—nor has that man much the cut of a New-Yorker.” “No. I should think not very much. Negroes are not for the most part white—and, as you say, American trotters have not in general quite so much hair about their fetlocks, or quite such lion manes—it might do for a Canadian, though—but then unluckily they are not apt to be white!—and certainly you might travel from Eastport to Green Bay and not meet a man with laced half boots and English leggins, unless you chanced to stumble on your most obedient; and as to the blue Leicester smock-frock, such as that lad has got on this side the Atlantic—but never mind, Fred, never mind. That grey cob is quite as much like Ripton or Americus, and that little fat-faced chaw-bacon is as much like a Long Island nigger, and that broad shouldered Yorkshire gamekeeper more like a New York gunner, than those long-tailed, green-headed, golden-breasted pheasants to any American fowl, be he called what he may. Why Heaven preserve your wits, Fred! That is an English picture, by an exceeding clever Royal Academician. Lee!—Fred, you must have heard of him! `A Day in the Woods' he called it, and a right good day's work he has made of it. Now, listen to me; there is not one wild bird or beast in America, unless it be a few ducks, that is precisely similar to its European congeners. The woodcock is a distinct variety, Scolopax minor, rarely exceeding eight and never eleven ounces—he is red breasted, and is in the northern states a summer bird of passage; coming early in the spring, sometimes before the snow is of the ground, laying, rearing his young, and going off when the winter sets in to the rice fields, and warm wet swamps of Georgia and the Carolinas. The bird called in the eastern states the partridge, and every where southward and westward of New Jersey the pheasant, is, in reality, a grouse—the ruffed or tipped grouse—Tetrao umbellus—a feather-legged, pine-haunting, mountain-loving bird, found in every state, I believe, of the Union, in the Canadas, and even up to Labrador. There are many other grouse in North America, of which none are found in the states except the pinnated grouse, or prairie fowl, formerly found in great abundance in Long Island, New Jersey, and the northeastern parts of Pennsylvania; though on Long Island it is now quite extinct, and nearly so in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. They are still killed on Martha's Vineyard, a little island off the coast of Massachusetts, where they are now very rigorously preserved; and in Ohio, Illinois, and all the western states, they literally swarm, on the prairies. The spruce grouse, a small and very rare kind, is found in Maine occasionally, and in a portion of New York, between the head waters of the Hudson and the Canada frontier. Four or five other species are found in Labrador, and on the Rocky Mountains, but none of these, though well known to the ornithologist, can be included in the sportman's list of game. The partridge of Virginia is the quail of New York; commonly known as perdix Virginiana—though of late there has been a stiff controversy as to his name and genus. It is proved, I believe, beyond cavil, that he is not exactly a quail, nor a partridge either, but a sort of half-way link between them; the modern naturalists call him an ortyx— a very silly name, by the way! since it is only the Greek for quail; to which he is in truth the more nearly connected. His habits are far more like those of the quail than of the partridge, and he should be called quail in the vernacular. If you want to get at the merits of this case, I will lend you a book, written by my old friend, J. Cypress, Jr., and edited by Frank Forester, in which you will find the controversy I have mentioned. These three birds we shall kill to-morrow, and you will be convinced of the truth of what I tell you. Properly speaking, there is no rabbit in America —the small gray fellow, who is commonly so called, sits in a form, and never burrows, nor does he live in congregations—while the large fellow, who is found only in the eastern states, and some parts of New York and New Jersey, turns white in winter, and is in fact a variety of the Alpine Hare. The first, I dare say, we may kill to-morrow, certainly not the latter. The snipe, moreover, which is called English, to distinguish him from all the thousand varieties of sandpipers, shore birds, and plovers, which are called bay snipe, indiscriminately, and from the woodcock, which the country folks call mud snipe, blind snipe, and big-headed snipe, just as their fancy prompts, is not—so say the ornithologists,—exactly the same bird as his English brother; although his habits, cry, feeding ground, and so forth, are exactly similar; except, by-the-by, that here he perches on trees sometimes.” “Heavens and earth, what a whopper!” interrupted Heneage. “Just so I told Sam Bradhurst when he told me so ten years ago, and ten days afterward I saw it myself, in company with Mike Sanford. Bill Roff, of Newark, knows it right well, and has seen them do so himself, and so does Frank!” “You be hanged!” answered Fred. “You think so now,” Harry, “but you'll know better one of these days. Meantime I have about finished my yarn. All I have got to say more is, that the only birds I have found precisely similar here and in England are the mallard and duck—the teal, which is called here the green-winged, in contradiction to our C 2 garganey, which these folks call the blue-winged teal. And now, ring the bell, and fill up a fresh glass of punch.” So said so done; and, ere the tumbler was replenished, Tim made his entry. “Now, Tim,” said Archer, “we shall want breakfast before day break—say half past five o'clock. Do you drink tea or coffee, Fred—oh, either—very well, then black tea, Timothy—dry toast—no hot meat— that cold quail pie will do. The double wagon, with Lucifer and Pluto, at six precisely—we shall want Dick to bring the nags home, and you to go with us. Some luncheon in the game bag—the flasks all filled. I will shoot over Sancho and Jem Crow and Shot to-morrow—do you understand?” “Ay, ay! sur,” answered Tim, and exit. “And now, Fred, this is your bed-room—all's right, I fancy—you shall be called at five to-morrow, and please the pigs, I'll let you know, and that before sunset, that a day's tramping in the swamps of Warwick is quite another thing from our friend Lee's `Day in the Woods.' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. COCK-SHOOTING. The skies were yet quite dark, when Frederic Heneage was aroused from the deep slumber into which, wearied with his long drive of the previous day, he had fallen the very moment his head touched the pillow, by the entrance of Tim bearing a mug of hot water, and a lighted candle. “Please to get oop, sur”—he exclaimed, as he opened the door, “ 't clock's strucken faive, an' Measter's amaist dressed enoo!” “All right Tim”—answered Heneage, thrusting his arms into the sleeves of a rich brocaded dressing gown, and jumping out of bed without a moment's hesitation. “I will be with him, in a quarter of an hour; what sort of morning is it?” “A varry naice un,” replied Tim.—T' frost's giving laike a little noo, and when 't soon's oop, it will be warm and pleasant.” No more words passed, Heneage proceeding to shave and make his ablutions with all an Englishman's fastidious nicety in such matters, and Timothy retiring, on hospitable cares intent. Within the quarter of an hour, however, for which he had stipulated, Heneage made his appearance in the breakfast parlor, fully equipped in shooting jacket, fustian trousers, and stout ancle shoes, and found the table covered and Harry waiting for him, the least in the world impatiently. “Well, Fred”—he cried, as his friend came in— “we have no time to lose, breakfast is ready. So sit down, and remember that you have got a hard day's work before you.—But what the deuce!—is this?— Have you too, of all men, got into the Frenchified style of dandy trousers for shooting in, instead of honest old corduroys and boots or leggins? Well, you will suffer for it, I can tell you, before the day's out—we shall be knee deep twenty times in mud and water, before noon, and it has frozen sharp enough, I promise you, to make the water as cold almost as ice—you had better take off those confounded things, and put on a pair of my knee breeches and long boots—Tim will get you them in a minute.” “Oh! no—never mind, Harry—I shall do very well—there is no milk sop about me.” “Nor about me, I rather fancy; and yet last autumn I got such a fit of bronchitis after shooting a week with the commodore at Vernon in ice water, with ancle boots and leather leggins, that I had a near squeak for my life; and made up my mind never to shoot again in autumn without long boots, and them as nearly waterproof as good workmanship and Hawker's dressing will make them—But you must do as you will.” “I will try these to-day”—replied Heneage—“nobody dreams of shooting now a days in England except in trousers. It is too deuced troublesome buttoning boots and leggins.” “Quite true, Fred—it is troublesome—and in an English turnip field or stubble—say even in a preserved wood with trimly cut rides to walk in dryshod, with no thorns or briars to annoy you, trousers are just as good. On the moors they are better, for they are loose and confine the muscles somewhat less, though for that matter well made breeches do not bind at all— But you will soon find here, between the wet and boggy nature of the woodlands, and the infernal thorns and cat-briars which render the brakes almost impenetrable, that some more substantial protection for the shins is needed, than a mere fustian trouser leg, even if you laugh at wet feet; which, by the way, you cannot long do in America with impunity.” “We will see—Harry—we will see.—In the meantime, give me another cup of the Bohea—and a corner of that pie, what is it made of?—it looks very good!” “It is very good—it is I think the best pie in the world, a fat rump steak at the bottom, a dozen hen quails, a score of hard boiled eggs, and a handful of red pepper pods. It is an invention jointly claimed by myself and Frank Forester. The pepper pods were his idea—and a great improvement they are too.—But holloa! there comes Dick with the drag, and the dogs. He is before his time a few minutes; put the blankets on them, Dick,” he added, opening the window and speaking to the lad, “and drive them round the ring, we will be ready in five or ten minutes. Ring the bell, Heneage, there's a good fellow; I want to speak to Timothy.” A moment had not passed before Timothy made his appearance, no longer rigged in his neat plain livery coat, but wearing a long round-jacket of black velveteen, with stout breeches and leggins of Yorkshire cord, and a large game bag slung across his shoulders. “Tim,” said his master, “go and tell Mrs. Deighton, that we will dine at six o'clock, and ask her what she means to feed us on.” “I can tell that without axing 't cook,” responded Tim. “She's boon to have venison soup, and 't big perch, Tom Draw sent us oop, barbacued, and a roast leg of mutton, and boiled partridges.” “Boiled partridges!”—Heneage interrupted him— Boiled! Good Lord! is it possible that you have turned heathen, Harry; or has Tim taken `his morning' a thought too strong?” “Neither—Fred—neither!—They are the best things you ever tasted, larded and boiled with cellery sauce.” “Partridges?—exclaimed Heneage—Partridges?” “Yes partridges—that is, partridges as they call them here—but in reality, as I told you last night, ruffed grouse!” “Worse and worse by heavens!—Boiled Grouse— Hear it not, shade of Colonel Thornton—Hear it not Captain Ross, or my lord Kennedy—you who did whilom admit this recreant to your society—Hear not the excess of his villainy—By all the gods! Boiled Grouse!” “We will not discuss them now, Fred—but if you do not discuss them, and that too with much gusto, when we come in at six o'clock—I will plead guilty to any possible enormity!—well what else Timothy?” “Roast woodcock, cheese, caviar, and red herrings!” “Bravo, Mrs. Deighton!”—replied Harry—“and what have you got to take along with us for luncheon?” “Ay'se gotten 't cauld toong 'at was maade ready 't last naight, and was na coot, and bre-ad and bootter, and 't twa quart wicker bottle full o 't breawn Sherry.” “Well—and the guns are in the wagon are they? and lots of powder and shot; caps and cards?” “Ay! ay! Sur.” “Well then, bring in our box coats, and my buckskin mittens—and we'll be off at once.” In a minute or two they were snugly muffled up, both of them, Fred Heneage in a pilot jacket, and boat cloak, and Harry in a huge boxcoat with a dozen capes; for the morning was still sharp and cold, although the first rays of the sun were beginning to steal up the sky from behind the eastern mountain, and Archer well knew that to begin shooting with cold hands and a shivering body was just the way to ensure a bad day's sport. They went out into the little hall, and there Harry mounted a head piece made of felt sitting close to the scull, with a strong projecting peak not much unlike an English huntsman's velvet cap; and as he saw Heneage putting on a neat London built castor, he cried out— “No! no—Fred—that will never do—if you will not allow me to clothe your nether man, you must at least permit me to tile you. Why bless your heart, that natty Jupp of yours would be knocked out of all manner of shape, into a cocked hat as they say here, in five minutes, besides that you could not make your way through the first dingle in it. Here, Tim, fetch my other cap hither!—It hangs at the wardrobe end, next the window—There”—he continued, as Timothy made his appearance with the rough weather-beaten scullcap—“Put that on, my boy, and the deuce take the beauty of it!” “Well, if I must—I must”—answered Fred eying it somewhat suspiciously—“but it's a queer go!” “Never mind—never mind. Jump up; in front with me”—answered Harry, who had already taken the reins in his hand, and was standing beside the fore wheel of his trim shooting wagon. That was the very model of a dogcart, embodying all the excellences and conveniences of an English sporting drag, with the combined strength and lightness of the Jersey wagon. In front it had the high dash board—the raised seat—sufficiently raised to drive four horses from it handily—and the handsome lamps of a mail-phaëton, while behind it had a long close box body, with a seat for the servants at the back, large enough to contain four dogs and baggage for a month's journey. The whole was bedecked with fine bearskins lined with Brussels carpeting, and made at the same time, as warm and as handsome as a Russian sledge. Under these skins the dogs were stowed already, and Dick had taken his seat behind, while Timothy stood to the near horse's head until the gentlemen were in their places, them touching his hat with a gnosticall “All right”—he jumped into his place, and, Harry uttering a low whistle, the gay nags started off at a light trot, and soon brought them to the highroad. “You have a sweet pair of cobs here, Harry”—said Heneage, “are they fast? That black horse on the nigh side has the very cleverest action I ever saw”— “What Pluto?—no cleverer than Lucifer's I think— they step exactly together—No! they are not fast—I don't care about fast horses; it is no fun to me to drive a brute that hauls your arms out of the sockets at the rate of a mile in two minutes and a few seconds more or less.” “But I don't know what you mean,” answered Fred; “we are going along at a spanking space now—twelve miles an hour at least—don't you call that fast?” “Not here, Fred—not here!—nothing is counted fast that cannot go a mile within three minutes. It is to extreme speed in trotting, far more than to endurance or maintenance of pace, that the attention of American trainers has been directed; which is the more remarkable, that in their racing, bottom is the point particularly aimed at, somewhat to the sacrifice of speed. The great ambition of young men about town is to possess a pair of horses, or a single nag, that can give the go bye to every thing on the avenues, and go at a rate which it would bother a thoroughbred to beat on his gallop, for a mile or two.—For a long journey, these crack trotters are apt to be little worth—though there are of course, brilliant exceptions—and almost invariably they are cross made and ungainly; bearing upon their bits, and keeping a dead pull, that is really painful to the driver.—My team here, for I have four of them—the chesnut, you sat behind yesterday, and his match are my leaders—is what would be thought extraordinary at home—for I can drive it handily twelve miles within the hour, or twenty-four in two, for that matter!—without one of the four breaking his trot, and that without the whip—yet no one in this country thinks anything about them, except to wonder why `that Mister Archer, who spends such a heap of money on his horses, shouldn't have one raal trotter out of the hull lot.' Some such comments as these, are made on my stud every day, by the farmers. But look here— what do you think of this for cock-ground?” and, as he spoke, he pulled up at a little wooden bridge, which crossed a small brook, a nameless tributary of the Wawayanda creek, which lay about half a mile to the right at the farther side of the broad valley. To the left of the bridge looking up the brook, there was a long stripe of low thick covert, near half a mile in length, with a clump of dark pines at the farther end, and about an acre of dry thorny brake around them. To the right hand, following the downward course of the little stream as it swept off to join the river, was a continuous range of tall and moderately open woodlands, with a wide tract of boggy meadows interposed between them and the road, the fields interspersed with thickets of thorn, willow, and cedar bushes, and cut up by wide wet drains, lined with rows of sallows. “What do you think of that for cock-ground?”— he repeated, waving his hand in a semicircle round him—“there are miles upon miles, in that direction, of ground almost unexplored; and, I cannot doubt it, almost as good as that on which I am taking you to-day. Come jump out—jump out! there we commence operations.” Timothy, meantime had pulled out the guns in their woollen cases, handed them with their appurtenances to their owners, and was busily employed slinging his game bags, and a couple of supernumerary shot belts, across his sturdy shoulders, and hunting up his trusty blackthorn cudgel, among the buffalo robes, which filled the box of the carriage. D “Mun ay tak't looncheon alang, Measter Archer?” —he enquired—“or will't dram bottles be enough, 'till we coom back to 't wagon?” “Oh! the dram bottles certainly—where's mine?— what have you put in it? Ferintosh hey?—well that's right; and Mister Heneage has got”— “Pineapple rum! Harry—Timothy and I had a private confabulation on the subject, and I made, as I supposed you wished, my own selection.” “Of course—of course, Fred—now, Dick, you know where Aunt Nelly lives—by the third bridge down this brook? Very well. Wait for us there—they will let you put the horses up in the stable—you have brought oats along?—Exactly! feed them—but leave the wagon under the big oak tree there by the brook side; for I don't wish to go into the house—do you understand me?” “Yes, sir”—replied the lad, with a grin of intelligence. “Away with you then!”—said Archer, “and drive steadily; for they are rather fresh this morning.” “And, Dick, lad”—added Timothy—“after thou'st gotten doone sorting 't horses—build up a spoonk o' fire by 't ro-ad saide; and get 't cloth spread, and 't looncheon ready i' good stayle—and maind 'at them Goshen chaps doosn't eat it oop; as they did 't last taime i' soommer cock-shooting!” “No—did they—did they, Harry?—By George! that is too good.” “You would not have thought it so very good, I fancy, if you had been as thirsty as we were; and had found the cool champagne all gone. But never mind that now—for we must go to work. We will cross the fence here, and walk up to the far end of the brake, and drive it down. We shall kill twenty birds here; I have no doubt. Come in to heel, good dogs!” And, at his words, the three staunch and well broke setters came to his heel, and followed with grave composure. “Heneage”—said Harry—“I want you to notice and make friends with Jem Crow, the black dog there, for I mean him to hunt with you to-day. I will order him over to you, as soon as we get into covert, and if you will keep a good look to him, for the first half hour, and rate him, if he tries to steal away, he will work for you very well.—Now we will go in—be ready, for there will be a cock jumping up in a moment. It is cruelly thick for the first few yards, but after that it gets opener.” As he spoke they turned into the thicket, which was indeed at first exceedingly thick-set with alder bushes, and very rotten and unstable under foot—but in a moment they were through this, and stood on the opener and firmer ground within. “Now Fred”—said Harry, “go on till you come to a straight-cut ditch; jump over it, and keep close down its farther shore.—This place is so narrow here, that we can drive it all down at once; but as it gets wider I will bear over toward you, and you shall take the outer edge, and we will come round the meadow side afterward.” “Ay! ay! Harry!”—and he went on his way briskly; but ere he had gone ten paces, the three dogs all lying at a charge by Archer's feet, a woodcock sprung up out of a tuft of winter green, literally under his feet, and flew very fast with its sharp whistle in a straight line before him, rising up into the tree tops. Heneage was taken by surprise and startled, for the moment; but he recovered before the bird had flown ten yards, covered him handsomely, and knocked him over completely riddled with the shot. Not one of the dogs stirred. “Load your gun quick—that was done very neatly —Fred—call the black dog, as soon as you are ready, and he will go to you, and retrieve the bird. Look at it, and you will see that I told you the truth—he is at least one third smaller than our English bird, and red-breasted.” “Yes! by the Lord, and he began to sing as he got up”—replied Fred. “You did not tell me that Yankee woodcocks were in the habit of whistling before!—Ready now!—Here Jem!—Jem!—seek dead, good dog. The fine black setter raised himself partially up on his fore legs, and lifted his intelligent and speaking eyes to his master, as if to enquire, whether this stranger's order was to be heeded; and then, as Harry waved his hand with the words, “to him, Jem; go to him!”—he dashed away, through the brushwood, and in a minute was standing, in a beautiful position, on the dead bird. “Is he at point, Fred?” “Yes!” “Tell him to `Fetch' then.” “But suppose it is a fresh bird?” “If it is, he will hold his point—the devil could not make him flush one, after he has stood it! Bid him `Fetch'—you are losing time.” Exhorted thus, Fred Heneage did as he was bid; and the black dog moved onward warily, snuffing the tainted herbage, and in a moment picked up the bird, and began mouthing it very gently, as he set off to carry it to Archer. “Here, Jem!—fetch it here! Jem”—cried Heneage; but the dog seemed marvellously disinclined to surrender his prize to any one but his proper owner; nor would he do so till Harry rated him pretty sharply; after which he resigned himself, appearing to understand perfectly what he was required to do; and all the rest of the day he hunted very steadily before Heneage, though keeping an eye all the time to the movements of the other dogs, and backing them as often as they pointed. “Hold up—now hold up! Lads—whe-e-e-ew!”— And, with a shrill and tremulous whistle, Archer waved the brace of red Irish setters, Sancho and Shot, which were still lying at his feet, to the right hand and left. Away they darted, with the speed of light, in different directions, crashing and rattling through the dense brushwood; but, at the first sharp single whistle of their master, they turned instantly, and crossed each other, breaking their ground and beating at regular angles with beautiful precision. They had not beat thus far, before seeing Sancho slacken his gallop into a long steady trot, and raise his head high, snuffing the air, and feathering his stern eagerly, Harry cried out— “Look to! look to Fred—there are birds here!” The next moment, Shot, who appeared to understand the meaning of his companion's motions as readily as his master did, and who was drawing cautiously up toward him—turned his head around quite suddenly, and stood stiff as a marble statue upon a bird, which he had nearly passed. Almost at the same instant Sancho came to a dead point, upon the bird which he had winded; both standing within a circumference of ten paces, though on two several woodcocks. “Come up—come up, Fred!” holloaed Archer, poising his gun and holding his thumb on the cock of the right-hand barrel, and his finger on the trigger— “come up, quick—here are a couple of cock—toho! Shot—steady—Sir, toho!—Do you hear, Fred?” “Yes! yes!—but Jem Crow is making game here!” “Never mind that, unless he is at point—whistle him off, and come this way.” “Ay! ay!” And, in a moment, he leaped the narrow drain, and came forward quickly, the black dog cantering along D 2 behind him, until he saw the others at their point. There for a moment he backed them stiff—and then, as Heneage advanced, he crawled along upon his belly, as warily as if he was treading upon eggs, till he was now within six feet of Sancho, when snuffing the hot scent of the game, he too stood firm and steady— the three dogs now forming nearly the points of an equilateral triangle—each in full view of the other, and not exhibiting the slightest proof of jealousy or over eagerness. “Steady now—Fred”—said Archer coolly—“these birds will rise, it is ten to one, very awkwardly—for they are in the very middle of the dogs. Stand where you are, and I will flush them. Never mind me, I want you to get the shots to-day.” And he stepped up toward Shot, who was rather the nearest of the three to himself, the others standing nigher to Heneage, in such a direction as to drive the bird if possible out toward his friend. But he had judged rightly—for the bird lay extremely hard, being in fact directly under the dog's nose and seeing him, so that he was in fact afraid to rise. When Harry was, however, on the point of treading upon him, he flirted up almost in his face and flew off a dozen yards toward Heneage, when he twisted off short to the left again, and made a dozen quick zigzags among the close saplings, very much in the manner of the English tack snipe, beating round toward Archer's rear. Heneage fired his first barrel at him just as he turned, the first time, and missed him clean, the whole of his charge splintering the bushes two feet wide of the bird and nearly a foot above him as he turned. He was endeavoring to follow and cover him for a second shot, when the other bird, flushed by the report, rose before Sancho, giving him, what, had he not been embarrassed between the two, would have been a very fair shot; catching sight of it suddenly he altered his aim and discharged his remaining barrel. Meantime Archer, perceiving that he had quitted the first bird, which had by this time got a good way off, and was pitching high and wild toward the end of the wood, by which they had entered, raised his gun very coolly. The cock was diving, at the moment he levelled his piece, through an exceedingly thick growth of young saplings which had been laid by the snow and would have almost turned his shot, had he then fired. But his quick eye at once detected an opening in the brake, a few yards in advance, which, although not above six feet in breadth, the bird must cross in a moment. As his wing glanced against the sky; the trigger was drawn; the gun flashed; a cloud of feathers streaming down wind, and the bird still impelled forward, though quite dead, by the rapidity of his past flight, told how correct had been the accurate although instinctive aim of the keen sportsman. But all this Archer saw not, for certain, as he drew the trigger, that his bird was killed, he turned short round, cocking his second barrel as he did so, to look after the other cock, at which Heneage had emptied his gun. As he expected, he was still on the wing, and nearly forty yards off in the tree tops, but as quick as light, he fired a snap shot, and turned him, likewise, over, dead as a herring. “I was sure you would miss that bird, Fred”—he said almost simultaneously with the report of his gun— “It was ten to one against you, when you tried to change your aim. I believe I have seen a hundred birds missed in precisely the same manner. The first was not your fault, for he dodged just as you pulled upon him.” “Did you kill him?” “Yes!” “Where is he, Harry? he must be a long way off.” “I do not know exactly—for I did not see him fall, I turned so quickly to mark this fellow.” “How do you know you killed him then?” “How do I know?—a pretty question, faith!—why I know that he was in range, I saw him fairly and I know, I killed him. I can tell you no more. Whereever I can see a bird, I can always tell you whether I have killed him, or, if I have missed him, how I did so, and generally why. Where you shoot with the eye of faith, not seeing but believing, it is a different matter! Now I am ready, Heneage!—You can bag that last bird for me as you go on—beat straight forward as you are doing, and try to mark whatever birds you do not kill.—I will go and find that fellow, and then overtake you.” He whistled his dogs after him, as he ceased speaking, and walked away rapidly in the direction of his first bird, but long before he had got half way to the spot where it had fallen, he heard the full round reports of his friend's Purday, both barrels fired in quick succession—the next moment the warning shout of “Mark! mark cock! mark, Harry!”—reached his ear—he turned short about, and, as he did so, he just caught a glimpse of the bird in question darting over his head, and not ten feet above it.—With the speed of thought, he again wheeled round, and again only in time to catch one glimpse of his wing, as he alighted in a little tuft of fern within fifteen paces. Both dogs had seen him and both now stood firm. Two steps, and the cock got up quite silently, and was stealing off down wind when the whole charge overtook him, and keeled him over, on the margin of the boggy streamlet. He was bagged in a moment; but more than a quarter of an hour was consumed, ere he could find the first bird, and when he did at last retrieve him it was almost by accident; for he had been caught in the forked branches of a dogwood bush, as he fell; and it was only the peculiar manner in which Sancho snuffed the air, and reared up once or twice on his hind legs, that directed his master's attention to the place, where his bird hung suspended felon-like by the neck, in middle air. Meantime, three single shots and two double from the right hand side of the covert, assured him that Heneage had found game, whether he could deal with it or no; and Harry stepped out joyously to overtake him; but ere he did so, two more shots resounded, and half a minute after each, a woodcock crossed him to the left—the first was in fair distance, and he bagged him—the second was quite out of range, and him he marked down by the meadow edge. When he came up, Heneage was standing in a willow brake, up to his knees in mud, perspiring profusely, with his face and hands very much scratched and torn, and swearing like a trooper. “What is the matter, Fred? what the deuce ails you?” The answer was another violent outbreak of swearing.—“Who the devil!” he said—“ever could shoot in such a cursed hole as this—the deuce a feather can I touch!” “How many have you killed?” “None!” “None?”—exclaimed Harry—“that is bad—why you must have fired—let me see, three double and five single shots since I left you—have you really killed none at all?” “None to speak of”—replied Heneage a little sulkily —“only four birds, out of eleven shots!” “Where are the others—those that you missed.” “I don't know—they went off there away, to the left hand.”—“I can find them, then,” said Archer— “and now, never fear, you shall get birds enough. Come back here—there is a fine fresh spring under this oak—take a good horm of rum and water, and make it pretty stiff—you had better; and wash your hands and face; and rest till you get your breath.—It is not so bad after all—we have got eight birds in a little over half an hour—and we shall get all the rest.” The drinks were duly received and imbided; and Fred recovered his breath, and his temper; and the friends were soon afoot again, and ready to proceed. “Bear out now to the left, till you are quite clear of the brake and in the open meadow—Fred”—Harry cried to him, “walk a few yards ahead of me, and look out you, for all that cross you! I will not fire at any but those which go inward. Are you outside yet?” “Ay! ay! Harry.” “Then move on! Toho! here is a dead point—By the big cedar, Fred—I will flush him to you—Toho! Shot—mark—mark—there he goes!” He crossed out, instantly, as he rose; and flew along the woodedge right before Heneage's face, and he dropped him cleverly—within ten yards another cock was sprung, driven into the open, and bagged by Fred in the same manner. Then Archer killed a clever double shot in the brake as they flew inward, and, after he had gathered those, missed one in a very boggy thicket, sinking over his knees just as he pulled the trigger, and shooting six feet over him; but the bird pitched outward, and Fred Heneage cut him down a quick snap shot, just as he was turning in again. “Wiped my eye cleverly Fred”—said Harry—“but I believe you will have to come, and give me a hand; for I am bogged here hard and fast—and have my doubts, if I can get out by myself. Here it goes! yes! I can—that will do; by George!—here's another point, look to—mark! mark! a couple!” This time Fred killed a double shot, and Harry a moment after a single bird, which flew like the others outward, but Heneage was loading, and Harry knew it. By this time they had reached the point of the swamp; and accordingly they turned back, up the opposite side of the streamlet, picking up at every few yards the scattered birds which they had driven across, and some which had been feeding on the fresh ground. When they were about half way up the covert, Harry, who was still on the outside, called out to him —“Look to, now—all the three dogs are drawing; I fancy it must be a bevy of quail running—toho!—they are all stiff now! Fred, where are you?” “Here!”—and, as he spoke, a prodigious rushing followed. The dogs were pointing at a thick stripe of tussocky bog grass, and out of that, with a vast rush and flutter, a fine cock ruffed grouse rose, and flew across the trees to the inside of the covert.—Harry of course fired at him, for he was his shot; but Fred, who was fluttered by the row he made, fired, unluckily, at the same moment. The bird fell dead enough, and so far all was well; and the next moment a second fluttered out and crossed the open meadow, and that Fred likewise dropped; but a third and fourth followed, directly after the second, while Fred was loading, and Harry unable to get a shot at them for the thicket. Just as the latter had dropped his butt to load, a fifth bird rose; which went down to his rapidly recovered shot, and at the report, a sixth and seventh went off rapidly; Archer covering them as they did so with his empty gun. “There!” he said—as the last birds got off—“In all the years that I have shot, I never saw ruffed grouse lie like that before—we have got three but we ought to have had four, if you, Master Fred, had not fired at my bird!” “Confiteor—I plead guilty,” answered Heneage— “but shall we not follow them?” “No! it were of no use! they fly like devils, and take to the tree, for the most part, so that you cannot find them. We will go on to the end—we shall find three or four more cock yet.” And they did go on, and flushed five; whereof they killed two, Heneage missing a third, and the others getting up wild and going off without being shot at. “We shall get them as we go down again,” said Harry, “and then we will have some luncheon.” Two of these they got up, and bagged; but the third they could not find, though they beat for him far and near; and they had given him up, and were already out of the brake, and half way across the meadow toward the oak tree, under the shade of which they could see a bright fire blazing, and the table cloth spread on the mossy turf, when Timothy, who had left them some time before, hailed them from the roadside. “Look to you boonch o' brackens there anenst you— that last cock lit in 'em.” And almost as he spoke, with a quick flip flap—the bird rose and flew directly over Archer's head back to the alder gulley. Heneage fired at it when it was not ten yards from the muzzle of his gun; but down it came, over and over, 'till it was within two feet of the ground—then strange to say it rallied and flapped heavily along, both the friends watching it, as if it was on the point of falling every moment, 'till it was thirty yards off at the least, then gathering strength suddenly, it whirled up over the tree tops and away—when Harry pitched up his gun, and riddled it completely. “Fetch him, good dog Shot”—exclaimed Harry— “But hang me if I understand that—but we shall see directly.” The dog brought in the bird, and lo! the truth was apparent in a moment. Heneage's shot, going like a ball, had cut the bill clear off close to the head of the bird without ruffling a feather else. And but for Harry's shot he would have got off to die by inches of starvation. “I am glad I killed him, poor devil”—said Archer —“Well, we have done pretty well.—That is twenty seven woodcock, and three ruffed grouse we have bagged—and it is scarce eleven o'clock yet—but we breakfasted so early that I for one am hungry.—So now for the cold tongue, and the sherris sack!” “I am all for that too. What shall we do after luncheon?” “Bag twenty or twenty-five more cock and find five or six bevies of quail.—How many of them we shall kill depends almost entirely on circumstances—Take the caps off your gun and lay it down—now for the cold tongue, and Master Timothy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">E CHAPTER III. A NEW APPEARANCE OF AN OLD FRIEND, `LIKE A BULL-DOG.' There was a green nook by the road-side, close to the wooden bridge over the small brooklet down which Archer and his friend had been shooting. In this nook hard by the fence grew a huge oak tree, overshadowing the better part of an acre of ground, with a chrystal spring bubbling up from among its tortuous roots, and welling away silently through the greener grass which bordered its course, and falling into the rivulet, just where it rippled out from the arch of the rustic bridge. Under this canopy of the oak, not a leaf of which had yet changed its hue under the influence of the early frosts, a snow-white cloth was spread upon the grass, its four corners carefully secured to the ground by the weight of as many smooth gray pebbles collected from the bed of the little stream. Upon this cloth were displayed in tempting array, a cold buffalo tongue, a loaf of fresh homemade bread, a dozen pats of golden hued Orange county butter in a stone cooler, and a plate of crisp hot anchovy toast. A set of travelling castors, a couple of silver plates with knives, silver forks, clean napkins, and two capacious wine glasses completed the array; a small canteen of Russia leather, from which this neat service had been drawn, stood open by the spring, in the bright basin of which a bottle of pale sherry was set to cool; and a bright fire of dry hickory wood was glancing on the green at the other side of the tree. Ay'se varry glad thou'st coom, sur”—exclaimed Timothy, as his master and Heneage approached, and set down their guns, having first duly removed the caps, against the oak tree.—“Ay was amaist afeard 'at you were gane to be ahint taime! For t' anchovy toast is joost ready, and 't wad ha' been spoiled cle-an, an you'd tarried a bit langer.” “It would have been your own fault, if it had, Tim, for you did not tell me you were a going to make any; but since you have, and we are all in time, so much the better,” said his master—“I could not think why the deuce you had lighted a fire.” “Whay ay thoot ay'd joost make t' dogs a soop o' gruel, laike. Sae ay borrowed 't auld airm pot frae Aunt Nelly, and boiled twa hanfulls o' t' oaten meal wi' a little salt for 'em. And then ay bethoot me o' t' anchovies. Measter Heneage laiked 'em weel, ay remember lang syne.” “So I did, Tim,” said Heneage, laughing, “and so I do now, Tim. How the deuce though come you to remember that?” “What ails me 'at ay suld forget 't?—Measter Archer never forgets ought, not he.” “And so you think that you are bound to be like master, like man, in all things? Hey?” “Nay! nay! ay'se not sooch an a fule as that, by a varry deal, Measter Heneage.—But, coom, coom, gentlemen, t' toast is getting cauld, when all's said and de-an.” Exhorted thus, they wasted no more time; and in truth in those short winter days time was a precious commodity; and accordingly as they sat down, Harry Archer pulled out his gold stop watch, and looking at it, said, “Just eleven, Fred, by Jove!—I can allow you only a short half hour. For we have nearly four miles more to go, and our best ground to beat yet.” “I am content, Harry,” answered Heneage, sedulously masticating a slice of the crisp toast. “Devilish good anchovy this—a glass of sherry, if you please Tim.” “Well, Master Fred,” said Harry, sipping his glass of the pale high flavored dry wine, “what have you got to say for yourself now, anent your absurdities of last night?—You have killed two birds of our Yankee game already. Or three kinds if you please, in two birds. Look at this fellow,” he continued, pulling out the ruffed grouse from his pocket. “This is the partridge of New York and New England; the pheasant of New Jersey, and the South. Do you think, he looks very much like an English pheasant with his green neck, flame-colored breast, and long barred tail.” “Not very like a whale! Harry,” answered Fred, trying to laugh, but bothered a little, notwithstanding. “Quite as much like a whale as like a pheasant. Look at his legs feathered to the ancle, and this long tippet, whence he derives his name. In the breeding season he sets this up like a ruff, and spreads his tail like a turkey cock, and makes a drumming noise, that you can hear half a mile off, and—but I suppose you don't believe that.” “Oh! yes I do”—said Heneage, quickly. Oh, dear yes!”—“And do you believe that woodcock here—” “Yes! yes! Good Heaven! yes, I believe everything! everything that you like to say!” “You have become very credulous all of a sudden,” said Harry, looking at him keenly. “Of course I have. Do not I know that if I shall presume to doubt any yarn, the most fearful that it may please you to concoct, I shall be seized, and dragged before the world like a bull-dog.” “Like a what?”—exclaimed Harry. “G—d! I wad na laike to seize a bull-dog, let alone dragging him afore 't warld!”—said Timothy, who was looking on, and drinking with eager ears every word that fell from their lips. “Like a bull-dog, to be sure à la Hargreaves!” replied Fred, delighted to change the subject, in the first place, and not ill pleased, in the second, to put Archer in the hole for a minute. “Hargreaves!” said Harry still at fault, “I don't take in the least.” “Is it possible, that you have not heard of the Weatherbit and Old England controversy, at the last Derby?” “Oh! yes of course, what was I thinking about.” Harry answered; “but I don't recollect any thing about a bull-dog,” he added, after a moment's reflection. “The devil you don't”—shouted Fred—“How any man, that read it, could possibly forget it, I cannot conceive. I heard it, and it very nearly killed me. My sides were sore with laughing six weeks afterward.” “But what was it?—Good Lord! tell me.—D—n you, now, don't begin laughing;” he continued, as Heneage flung himself back on the grass in convulsions. “Why hang it! how strange that you don't remember,” replied Fred, as soon as he could recover himself. “I tell you I saw Hargreaves leap up on the chair, in Tattersall's, immediately that Gulley left it, and exclaim, pale with rage and almost stuttering with fury, “that he thought it exceedingly hard `he should be seized and dragged before the world like a bull-dog, by Mr. Gulley.”' “Measter Goolley”—exclaimed Tim, “ay'se a warrant him, he's t' varry man to seize a bull-dog; if 't 's to be de-an at all—or any oother varmint. I kenned Measter Goolley brawly, ay seed him faight Gregson, yance. It's lang syne—but he did 't laike—” E 2 “Like a bull-dog of course”—interrupted Heneage. “But to resume; at every second sentence, he introduced `seized like a bull-dog!' `dragged in, like a bull-dog!' 'till at last, I could stand it no longer, but shouted `go it! go it, like a bull-dog!'—I wish you could have heard the roar; grave as the subject was, it lasted full five minutes, since that time, I do every thing `like a bull-dog!” “Excellent! excellent! Fred,” cried Archer, laughing furiously. “I shall do every thing `like a bull-dog,' too. The word must be introduced and rendered current. But come, come, we must lose no more time. Take another glass of sherry, and let us be off.” But they were not destined to get under way, quite so quickly, for just as they were about to rise from their seats, the hard gallop of a horse was heard, coming across the grass field behind them, and before they had time to turn their heads, a superb chesnut thoroughbred with a bang tail, came flying over the fence not ten yards distant from their table cloth, with a loud and cheery whoop of its rider. “That must be Frank, or the devil!” exclaimed Harry, as he looked up from the glass which he was filling—“nobody else would come tearing over fences in that fashion—” “`Like a bull-dog!”'—interrupted Fred—“But it is he, sure enough. How are you, old fellow?” “And what the deuce brought you here to-day? We did not look for you before Friday at the earliest.” “Why, look you here, old fellow,” answered Forester, “when I found that Master Fred had come up to give the birds a turn, which you have promised all the season to save for me, I thought that, if I did not come and look after them myself, I should be minus at the end of the week. So I packed up my trunk, and sent it by the Erie railroad. Saddled Bright Selim, and went on board the Highlander with him, last night at five o'clock—slept at Newburgh, and galloped over hither with my gun slung upon my shoulder, in shooting toggery as you see me. I only stopped to ask Tom Draw to dine with you to-day— which I found you had ordered already—took my bitters with him, would not stay for breakfast, and am as hungry as—” “A bull-dog!” interrupted Heneage again, whereat Timothy, who thought the repetition very funny, burst into a furious laugh. “I don't see the fun of everything being like a bull-dog!” “Everything is like a bull-dog, Frank”—said Harry. “Is it? I am agreeable”—said Forester, who had seated himself by the table cloth, which the others had deserted, and had already finished four large slices of tongue, two pounds of bread, and half a pint of sherry —“some more tongue, Timothy, and another glass of wine—“very agreeable I am—and I dare say everything is like a bull-dog; but I can't see why, for my part.” “Specially Massa Hargreave! Frank”—said Archer, in a ludicrous nigger tone; and as soon as he spoke Forester, who never missed anything absurd, remembered the point. “Oh! yes! yes!” he replied—“was not that good. I suppose he will be called Bull-dog Hargreaves always now!” “It is a great pity he had not lived in the time of Cromwell that he might have been called at full length `Seized-and-dragged-before-the-world-like-a-bull-dog Hargreaves.'—That is a thoroughly puritanic and very uphonious name”—said Heneage. “Oh d—n Hargreaves! come along”—said Harry, who was getting tired of this, and had taken up his gun. “I'm perfectly agreeable” said Forester, emptying the last drop of sherry—“so, d—n Hargreaves!— Have you the least objection, Fred?” “Not the slightest”—answered Heneage—“except that I think he has d—ned himself enough in all conscience.” “Well! God bless Measter Goolley any ways”— interposed Tim—“He desarves 't, joost for dragging oot t' bull-dog.” “Well said Tim!” cried Harry Archer, “and now, look here! pack up the traps and direct Dick to the end of the crab tree swamp. Hang all those birds up smoothly by the loops in the game-bag, put it into the wagon, and then follow us down the woodside.” “Like a bull-dog!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER. IV. AFTER LUNCHEON. Well, lads, and what have you done this morning, in the way of sport?” asked Forester, as they walked across the grass field, toward the covert. “Twenty-two cock, and three ruffed grouse,” answered Archer. “By George! that is good work. How long have you been at it? How did Fred manage them?” “Since eight o'clock”—said Harry—“and devilish well, I assure you; to answer both your questions in a breath.—Fred has shot better than ever I saw a new one, in this country.” “No, no, Harry”—answered Heneage—“I tailored them very badly for a while.” “I cannot call that tailoring”—said Archer— “Henry Toler himself could not kill every bird in that brake; and when that is said, it is as much as saying that an ordinarily good shot would do well to kill half—and, to tell you the truth, I did not expect to see you kill one in five; seeing that this is your first day. But, after that bad bit, you shot like a workman. If you improve in proportion, you will give both Frank and myself a tug to beat you next season.” “Who is Henry Toler?”—asked Fred Heneage. “The best shot in America!” said Frank Forester. “And I think, that means in the world,” added Harry quietly. “The devil you do?” asked Heneage—“Do you think the best shots here can beat our best shots at home?” “I think they can beat our best shots here, at American game and in American covert.—The latter, as you know already, is harder than English covert; and, if we find quail, as I think we shall, in the crab-tree swamp, you will make acquaintance with the hardest bird to kill, that flies on earth.” “Indeed?” “Yes! indeed.” “Did you ever shoot with Henry Toler? can he beat you?” “No. Yes.” “Did you ever see him shoot?” “Once—Pigeon from the trap. He would shoot No. 8 shot, which is three sizes too small, and they figged all his birds.—In spite of that, he killed every bird. But they fell out of bounds, and he was beaten.” “Did you ever see him shoot game?” “Never Mr. Cross Examiner.” “How then do you know that he can beat you.” “Because I have shot with half a dozen men, whom I can barely beat, or whom I cannot beat, and they all admit that Henry is their master, not their match.” “That is a reason?—Is he a good fellow?” “Wait, 'till you meet him, with your knees under my mahogany.” “I am answered.” “As how?”—asked Frank Forester. “Because Harry must be marvellously changed, if any but good fellows put their knees under his mahogany.” “He is marvellously changed then—don't you know that Lord George says the only reason he and I, and Tom Hutchinson, and Howe, and Bill Porter, like one another, is because we are such a set of d—d disagreeable beasts!—But halloa! look at that—the dogs are all standing.” “By George! so they are. It is quail too! They are basking in the bog grass by the fence side, and will lie like stones.” The ground, which they had now gained and which was Harry's chosen spot of spots, was a long range of boggy meadows, skirting the streamlet down which they had been shooting all the forenoon, intersected here and there with drains, and interspersed with lines of willows, thick thorny brakes all overrun with cat briars, and clumps of evergreen cedar. The margin of the brook was lined on the hither side by a broad verge of thick alder coppice, and on the farther by a wide tract of wet and swampy woodland. At a little distance from the stream the ground became firm and the soil dry, and here among the tussocks—the long grass of which, even in the heaviest storms, bears the snow up from the ground, forming long galleries under which the quail live unharmed upon the seeds and berries that have fallen from above—bevies are in almost all seasons very abundant. In this dry meadow land, where not a bush was to be seen, within a hundred yards, the three dogs were standing, as stiff as graven images. The black dog, which had found the birds, was close upon them. His nose was pointed directly downward—his head cocked knowingly on one side—his full hazel eye, glaring with that peculiar expression, which tells how hotly the maddening scent is streaming up into the sensitive nostrils of the sagacious brute— his lip covered with slaver, so eager was his excitement—his hind leg lifted, and his fine silky flag erect, and stiff as it were carved in iron. The red setter Sancho, who stood next, and but a short space behind him, caught but a little of the hot steam which so wondrously excited his companion; to a sportman's eye his attitude told everything. He had approached as nearly as he dared, and with his whole body stretched out to the utmost, his snakelike neck elongated, his eye fixed, and his nostrils audibly snuffing up the tainted air, he stood rigid as his mate, but not erect as he—for the deep soft fringe of his belly was within an inch or two of the withered herbage; his fore leg was bent; and his red stern, with its snow white tag, stretched out nearly into one line with head neck and body, which all seemed to be drawn forth to their utmost length, as if to near the game as much as possible without moving forward. The third dog, the liver and white spotted setter, was backing thirty yards at least from the other two, having been quartering his ground toward them, when they came on their point. “How do you know that they are quail, Harry?”— enquired Heneage, as they stepped hastily forward to the tuft of higher grass by which the dogs were standing. “By the nature of the ground, Fred. It is too dry to hold cock there!—and partly by the attitude and action of the dogs. I can generally guess very correctly what bird is going to get up, where I can see the dogs fully. These little chaps are close under Jem Crow's nose, and Sancho has a snuff of them too.—They will lie, as I said before, like stones; and though they offer a very easy shot in the open, they make such a flutter and hubbub as they get up, and they get up so closely, that I would bet ten to one you do not kill a double shot, be as cool as you may. It requires more practice to get used to them, than to any bird I know.” By this time, they had come up to the very place where the dogs were standing; and Frank, at a gesture of Harry's which he well understood, stepped forward a few paces to the right, in order, if possible, to head the birds off from the thorny covert on the banks of the rivulet. “Now, Fred, look out,” said Archer, “I will flush them,” and with the words he walked forward a little way, the black dog still keeping his point, and the red setter backing him, steady and true as steel. So hard did the birds lie, that Archer was actually abreast of Jem Crow's nose, yet not a quail had risen. Turning his head, he waved Heneage forward, and as he came up, uttered a low whistle. Jem pricked his ears, and the silky hair bristled a little on his back, but he would not stir. The red dog crawled up on his belly, until his nose was parallel with that of his companion, and then stood immovable. Meanwhile the liver and white setter Chance, stole up at a slow and guarded trot, as if he were treading upon eggs, until he also struck the scent, a little way behind the others, when he came to a full point also, though less resolutely than the two leaders. “Whe-ew! Hold up good lads!—Hold up!” And thus exhorted, but most reluctantly and gingerly, all the three crawled about two paces forward— and again stood dead—and no words could induce them to advance another foot. “Is not that pretty, Heneage?”—said Archer— “What can be steadier than that? Now I will flush them”—and, suiting the action to the word, he stepped up briskly to the dog's noses, trampling the long grass noisily down under his heavy boots— Whir—Whir-r-r-r-r! Impeding one another, for an instant, crossing, and fluttering their wings with rapid and tumultuous haste, a large and well-grown bevy rose under his very feet; and, as is not unfrequently the case, dividing into two squads, wheeled to the right and left, one to the coppice across Forester's face, the other and larger division to the open meadow before Heneage. Well warned as he was, and confident of his coolness, Heneage discharged his first barrel missing handsomely before the farthest bird was ten paces from him; F and even Archer, cool old hand as he was, half raised his gun with a tremulous and uncertain hand to his shoulder.—It was but a momentary impulse, however, and he looked steadily on until Heneage fired his second shot, killing the old cock of the bevy neatly at twenty yards—then choosing two birds in the act of crossing, he cocked his gun, as he raised it, pulling his trigger as it reached his shoulder; and then, before the two birds, for the charge cut down both, had reached the ground, easing the but a trifle, cocked and discharged his remaining barrel, knocking a third bird over at long distance. Then, dropping the but of his piece to the ground, he raised his hand to shade his eyes from the strong sunlight, and cried, “mark—mark them, Fred; they will all drop in the open meadow, where we can get every bird.—There”—he continued, “three are down by that bunch of rushes—and—that is it, I have them! —the whole lot on this side of the drain by the willow hedge. Now, Frank, what have you done?” “Knocked down a brace, though one, I fear, is only wing-tipped—and marked five or six down into the thorns beside the blighted cedar.” “Hold a moment, then, till I have loaded. If I am not mistaken, there is another quail left here under Jem's nose—he seems to be pointing, though he is down to charge!” And in fact when you looked closely at the face of the sagacious brute, as he lay close, where, with his fellows, he had couched instant, without waiting orders, at the reports above his head, it was evident that his master had not miscalculated his intelligent meaning. His eye was still set—his brow knotted into a rigid frown—his nostril wide distended. “Are you ready, Fred?” “Ready.” “Do not move. I will flush him to you. Do you kill him, I will not fire.” And leaning a little forward he brushed the long bog grass with the muzzle of his gun, when up jumped the bird, and crossing Heneage was covered deliberately, and killed neatly. “That will do—there are no more left here. Now, Frank, whistle Jem Crow to you.—Go to him, sirrah, go!—He will soon find your birds.” “I have got the first,” answered Forester.—“Here Jem, Jem Crow—good dog”—and with much less reluctance, than he had shown before in joining Heneage, the handsome black setter trotted away obedient to a voice, which he knew second to his master's only. Within a few moments Chance and Sancho had found the five birds, which had gone down to Heneage and Archer; and just as they were bagging the last, they heard Forester cry, “Ha! dead—Jem dead! have a care!—Fetch him!” “That is well”—exclaimed Harry—“seven birds for the first rise.—We shall get the whole of this bevy.—Upon my word! you are shooting very well, Heneage!” “Coming a little into it, old fellow.—But which way now?” “I want you, Frank”—shouted Archer, “a council of war! Halloa! what the deuce can be bringing Tim across the meadow at this rate?—Gad! how he twitches his short fins over the tussocks. I am afraid something is the matter! What is it, Tim?” “Please, sur,” responded Timothy, stopping short at the hail, “you did na tell me what's to be dean wi' Measter Forester' horse. T' boy canna maind him, and draive horses doon to t' crab-tree swamp at yance!” “Lord bless me, I did forget. Well! you must ride him down the road, and leave him with the boy and come in at the lower end to join us.” “Varry well, sur”—responded Tim, and vanished, running back even faster than he came, unwilling to lose a minute's sport. “Now Frank,” said Harry—“what is to be done? We ought according to all rule to hunt up those birds in the coppice first, for it is ten to one that we shall not find those which dropped in the open meadow if we go to beat for them now.” “Not find them!” exclaimed Heneage in astonishment—“Not find them! why I can go within half a yard of the spot where they dropped.” “I don't care, if you can go within half an inch, you can't find them, if you go now.” “You need not stare, Fred”—said Frank Forester, “this is one of his cranks—he believes, or affects to believe that quail can retain their scent at pleasure.” “And do you?” asked Heneage, in some wonder. “Not I, indeed! not one word of it.” “Well never mind” said Archer, somewhat impatiently, “we have no time to talk about that now. On the other hand—the thorns are in our regular line of beat, and to come back here will lose half an hour— We have got to beat that corner at all events, for there will be from six to ten woodcock along those willows.” “Oh! let us go to them, first,” said Heneage, “what do you say, Frank?” “In course, I say so. I will bet two to one we find the birds directly.” “In what, Frank?” “In what you will!” “Ponies?” “If you please.” “Done!” And, without another word, throwing his dogs off to the right and left, waving his hand and encouraging them with his cheery whistle, away strode Harry, in the middle, toward the rushes into which the first three birds had been marked. “There they lie, close to that tuft. Some of them, not a yard asunder”—said Heneage to Forester. “Well, you will see the dogs point them directly.” But it was no such thing. For scarcely had he spoken, before Jem Crow and Sancho, meeting from opposite directions, quartered the very spot, both dogs passing within six feet of the rush clump, at a long gallop, their heads erect, whipping their flanks with their feathery sterns, but without evincing the slightest consciousness of game, and without moving a bird. Archer looked round to them, with a smile and a wink. “That is the very place”—said Heneage. “No, no!” said Forester, “it cannot be.—Is it so, Archer?” “Yes! to a yard!—But I want to prove this fact to you.—I will call in the dogs, and get them down to it, and make them hunt it out, inch by inch!” And he did so; and the three dogs, worked the spot over and over, at his bidding, snuffing, as it seemed, every blade of grass, but moving nothing. Ten minutes, were perhaps spent thus, in vain; and they moved forward to the drain, Harry saying— “Now you shall see. Nine birds went down by this drain, and we shall not find them any more than the other three.” Nor did they. But as they neared the drain, along which several willows grew rank and luxuriant, the thick grass broke off, unable to grow beneath the shade, into large isolated tussocks, and beyond them the soil was bare and very moist, with here and there a few water flags and large colt-foot leaves. “We shall find cock here, lads”—said Harry— “Jump over the fence, Frank, or they will dodge us.” They paused to give him time to do as he was F 2 directed, and, while they were standing still, in order to do so, the red dog, coming up rapidly, took a flying leap over one of the single tussocks, the very last one, and instantly came on a dead point in the open ground, with his head toward the fence, and his stern toward the tussock he had just crossed. “Toho! where are you, Frank? There is a cock before him in the fence, close to the low willow, the third from the crimson maple. Do you hear?” “Aye! aye!” “Then look to!”—and as he spoke, he walked forward with Heneage to the point. Just as they came up to the tussock, however, over which Sancho had leaped so cleverly, and within a foot of its base, Heneage trod on a tuft of short grass, and close to his toe—Whir-r! up jumped a quail. It took him so completely by surprise that he blazed away too quickly, and missed it; but Harry cut it down, before it had flown ten yards farther. “That was a quail, not a cock!” shouted Forester, behind the willows, having heard the rush of his wing, and distinguished it from the flip flap of a timbler-doodle. “I told you we should find them!” “He did not point this—Heneage trod it up. He is on his point still.—Be quiet.” As soon as they had reloaded, and while Jem Crow was retrieving the dead bird, Archer said to his friend in a low voice—“Did you see that?” “Yes! the dog's fore feet literally grazed the tuft in which the bird lay, as he jumped the tussock.” “Precisely—yet he did not scent or stand him.” “And did—does stand—for you see he has not moved—a woodcock, which is a bird of far weaker, and more watery scent than the quail. Will you believe, when you have seen?” “It does look queer, I confess!—See, Jem has got the bird.” “Bring him hither, good dog. It is a young cock! you can distinguish the males by their white chaps; the cheeks of the females are reddish yellow. Now, Frank, are you ready?—I will flush him! Hie cock! cock! Purrh!” Flip-flip-flap! the bird rose in the thicket. Bang! and a stream of feathers which drifted down wind, over the willow-tops, told them that Forester had done his duty. “Mark! mark! Fred, to your right! there goes another. Cleverly done.—That was a good shot”— he added, as Heneage cut him down just as he twisted in toward the fence. “Come over again, Frank, the dogs are making game, toward the meadow edge.” And Forester obeyed, and, out of the long grass, where they had seen the quail alight, near the drain edge, they killed seven cock over dead points. One bird, the last at which they fired, was hit very hard, but flew nearly half a mile, before they marked him down near a single cedar in the open ground. “By the way,” said Archer, “there is a little spring and a boggy place yonder, I should not wonder if we find two or three more long bills there. Do you remember, Frank, we killed nine there last autumn, on a frosty morning late in the season.” “To be sure I do”—said Frank, “it is a prime place for them to feed.” And they bagged four there accordingly, the crippled bird, and three fresh ones; and just as they were about to turn, the liver and white dog ran in upon a small bevy of eleven quail, and flushed them out of distance; for which he got a sound thrashing. “Mark them, Frank!” “I have marked them, they are down in the thorns near to the six I marked in, before. But pretty lads, you are, to mark! these are the birds, which you swore dropped yonder—when in fact all of them came on, except that single fellow, which you killed. Whew-y, whew-y, whew-y. The small and plaintive chirrup of a running bevy, came down the wind as he spoke, from the very rushes in which they had scarce half an hour before, knocked up and killed eight woodcock. “Do you hear that? do you hear that?” cried Harry exultingly. “Now they have moved—now the dogs will find them at once! Come on—come on!” And, wending their way hastily back, they had scarce reached the drain and the willows, before all the three dogs stood at once, on three different birds; and, to be short, they found and bagged the eight quail, which they had seen alight, out of the self same bogs, among which three men and as many first-rate dogs had been plunging and threshing about, for the better part of an hour, so short a time before. “I will not ask you to believe,” said Harry, “unless we find the first three by that single rush clump.” They did find them, and killed two, Archer missing the third with his second barrel. “Now do you believe that quail can retain their scent?” “Yes.—It is proved,” said Fred Heneage. “No—I don't,” said Frank Forester. “Of course not,” said Archer—“If either you, or Lord George Gordon, were ever, on a single occasion, to give in, after putting forth an opinion; I should turn Millerite, and believe that the world is coming to an end next April!” “But how do you explain it, Harry?” said Heneage. “can it be instinct?” “We will talk about that after dinner. Now let us follow up those bevies, and then find another.” Those bevies they did follow up, and nearly finish up, moreover; for out of eighteen birds which they had seen into the thorns, they bagged thirteen—one more killed which they could not find, and four getting off, one missed, and three not shot at. As they went down the swamp, they found two more bevies; but they flew at once into impracticable cover, dark pines over head, and swamp rhododendrons below, and they rendered a bad account of these, bringing to book eight, out of the two bevies. To make up for this bad luck, however, they came on a little plump of woodduck floating on a small lilied pool of black transparent water enveloped in the thickest covert, and shot four of them; beside bagging ten more woodcock, and a brace of ruffed grouse. The sun was nearly setting, when they emerged from the crab-tree swamp, and found Tim and the horses quietly awaiting their arrival. A cool spring was at hand, and the flasks of Ferintosh and Jamaica were in demand instantly; then they told up their game, and found the whole day's bag— most glorious bag indeed—to consist of no less than forty-three woodcock, thirty-six quail, five ruffed grouse, and two couple of woodduck. “Now then” said Harry, when the flasks were exhausted, and the game-bag filled to repletion, “now then, jump in as sharply as you please. For if we don't look out, we shall be late for dinner and get cursed grievously by old Tom Draw, who was never backward in his life, at coming forward.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. A VERY FAIR WOMAN; AND A VERY FAT MAN: “Get away lads!” sang out Harry, as he sprang to his box, lapping his whip up knowingly as he did so. Frank Forester had ensconced himself already in the back seat beside Timothy, who was employed in drawing the bearskins, which the coming frost rendered very acceptable, about their knees. Heneage sat in front at Archer's left hand, with the stout fur-lined apron covering his lap. The dogs crouched at their feet, easy and warm, on the soft sheepskin rugs. “Get away lads!”—and away they went, at the word, untouched by the whip, at full twelve miles the hour, their ears laid back upon their necks, now nibbling at each other playfully, now snatching at the long steel bits, 'till the bright curb chains rang and jingled; while the well-made smooth running wagon followed them almost noiseless over the limestone road. Dick followed on `Bright Selim' at a slashing gallop —no slower pace of the thoroughbred would keep way with the spanking trot of the chesnut geldings. There is no lovelier scenery on earth, than that through which the homeward road of the sportsmen lay, along the northern slope of the Warwick mountain; with a mile's breadth of soft velvet meadows stretching out green and gentle to the left, the bright waters of the Wawayanda, flashing in golden reaches to the level sunbeams far on their northern verge, and beyond the stream a long range of many-colored woodlands, half veiled by the purple haze of autumn, and the blue summits of Mount Adam and Mount Eve soaring, distinct in their dark azure, against the cloudless sky of autumn. On the right, rose the mountain side continuous, ridge above ridge of leafy knolls with misty hollows intervening, until, a mile or more aloof, it terminated in a crest of gray and splintered crags, on which the westering rays dwelt lovingly. Along the slope of this romantic chain the narrow country road ran sinuous; now diving into some fairy glen, through which a nameless rill trickled over its many-colored pebbles; between blocks of granite overrun with wild vines, and trunks of still verdant oaks; now climbing some bold hillock whence the view reached for miles and miles over the verdant champaign to the faint line of the Shawangunk hills, darkling against the bright horizon. As the wagon mounted the brow of one of these little hillocks, a female figure turned into the road, from a bye path, perhaps a hundred yards in advance, mounted on a beautiful balck horse with a long tail and mane; and cantered along gently, without looking back, or appearing to notice their approach, in the same direction as they were proceeding. As soon as he observed the presence of the fair equestrian on the road, Harry gathered his horses up a little, and held them well in hand, in order to avoid alarming her by coming up too quickly in her rear. It was evident at a single glance that she was a lady; for though she was riding all alone, there was that in her whole dress and air, as she sat her spirited horse, which distinguished her at once from the ordinary country lasses, in their large sun bonnets and calico skirts. She wore on her head a neat beaver hat, with a long veil of brown barége floating over her left shoulder, and was dressed in an admirably fitting habit of rifle green broad cloth, the long close waist, tight sleeves, and ample skirts of which set off the exquisite proportions of her round slender waist, her broad falling shoulders, and the full contour of her form, as they came up behind her. That which struck Heneage the most forcibly, however, was the easy grace with which she managed her horse, evidently inclined somewhat to be skittish, the firm squareness of her seat, and the lightness of hand, with which she by turns humoured and controlled his mouth. Taking it for granted, from the unconcern which Archer manifested at this fair apparition, that he must know who she was, Heneage was on the point of enquiring, when suddenly a large brindled mastiff sprang out, from the yard in front of a cottage, with an outburst of fierce and savage baying, and dashed full at the head of the black horse. Terrified at this fierce assault the fiery black wheeled round so violently, as would have unseated any less skilful equestrian, and yerked out his heels spitefully at the dog. Then catching sight on a sudden of Harry's wagon, the approach of which he had not heard, he reared bolt upright, pawing the air with his fore feet, so that it seemed as if he were in danger of falling backward. But with unusual fearlessness and presence of mind the fair rider slacked her rein, and laid the ivory handled riding whip, which she carried, repeatedly and sharply on his flanks. With a great bound he alighted on his forefeet, and again lashed out his heels viciously, and would have reared again—but Heneage, who had instinctively freed his legs from the bear-skin-apron at the first attack of the mastiff, leaped out of the wagon, almost before Harry had pulled up his horses, and had the black firmly by the head, in less time than it has taken to describe it. Two or three fruitless struggles he made, snorting and panting, between fright and anger; but the young man humoured him so judiciously, while he held him with a grasp like that of an iron vice, and spoke to him so gently, and in horse-language so intelligible, that he was mastered in a moment. “Oh! Mr. Archer,” said the girl, “how can I ever thank your friend enough; I believe he has saved my life, for I am sure I must have fallen, if he had reared once more.” “Oh! dear no, you would not, Miss D'Arcey”— replied Archer, taking off his hat, “I never saw any one sit a horse so well in my life; and I flatter myself, I am judge, you know. But Fred has always been a lucky dog, and this is the greatest coup of all! allow me to present Mr. Frederick Heneage”—he added— “Miss Maria D'Arcey.” As he looked up to bow, Fred Heneage saw her face for the first time; and much as he had been led to expect from the grace and symmetry of her person, and from the exquisite melody of her low silver voice, all that he had expected fell far short of the reality. A fair high forehead, pure and transparent as white alabaster, eyebrows and lashes black as night, fringing eyes of the brightest and most laughing azure, a little nose slightly retroussée, lending both glee and archness to the bright rich face, lips red as the above carnation, a clear fair complexion with a warm rosy flush dawning through it, and a profusion of soft sunny nut-brown hair, falling down in a flood of mazy ringlets, on either side her face, quite to the shoulders. Such is a bare description of the features, which met the ardent gaze of Heneage, as he raised his head, and uncovering his curly light brown locks bowed gracefully and lowly. But no words will describe the light of intelligence and soul which informed those fair features—the mingled expression of mirthful artlessness, and deep sensitive G thought, which rendered that fair young face so wondrous beautiful and dazzling. There was something in Heneage's eye, as it met hers, that made her blush slightly for a moment; and seeing her confusion, he was in turn somewhat embarrassed, and, for once in his life at fault for words; when Harry relieved them both, by begging her to take a seat in his phaeton, and allow one of his men to ride her unruly horse homeward. “I will engage to set you down at your own door in five minutes,” he added—“pray let me have that pleasure.” “What! dismount like a recreant and own myself conquered,” she replied laughing. “Oh fie! Mr. Archer, I fear you are but a false knight, after all, giving me counsel, which were I to follow, you would despise me utterly—counsel, which you know to be wrong! If I were to dismount now, Daisy would never let me get upon his back again—naughty Daisy,” she added, patting the arched neck of the black, which having recovered now from its affright, bridled and whinnied conscious of her voice. “Besides, if mamma were to hear of this suddenly, she would never let me ride out alone again; and then good bye to all my dear romance!—no! no! I will gallop Daisy home, and whip him for his impudence well, too”—she added. “The only kindness you can do me farther, is to let Timothy—how do you do Timothy?—I forgot you before—drive away that horrid dog.—Look at him, he is waiting to fly at me again.” “Jump out, Tim; jump out, man; and knock that brute on the head, with a big stone.—Oh! Mr. Reed,” he went on, as the owner of the dog came out of the cottage, “It is too bad your keeping such a savage beast, as that, unchained.” “Well—yes—he is some savage”—drawled out the man, in a careless tone—“Cesar, git in doors, you!” “Some savage! hey?” said Harry, half laughing, half indignant—“I should think he was. Here he was all but the cause of Miss D'Arcey being thrown from her horse, and perhaps killed just now?” “Well—I did see that he skeart the hoss some.” He made answer. “Well—you shall see something else too, Mr. Reed—you shall see that I will shoot him the very next time I come up the road, if he flies out—” “No! no! you will do nothing of the sort,” said the girl laughing, “unless you want to quarrel with me. I will have no ill feeling between you and Mr. Reed. There is no harm done; and he will keep his dog fastened up in future. He would have been quite as sorry as yourself, Mr. Archer,” she added with a sly glance, “if I had been hurt.” “Well, he should ha' been tied up; that 'are ar' a fact”—responded the man, about one degree less sulky than his dog, yet moved, in his own despite, by the witchery of her manner. “All is right then,” she said, laughing again, “and I will say good night, with many, many thanks”— she added, looking toward Heneage. “By the by, if your friend had not helped me so nicely, I don't believe I should have spoken to you, Mr. Archer; you have behaved very badly. It is above a month since you have been to see me—but I am afraid, I must forgive you now. Good night!” And with the word, she turned her horse's head back to the road, put him into a canter, and gradually increased his pace, plying him pretty smartly with the whip, 'till he was almost at full speed. At about a quarter of a mile's distance, she turned off into a cross road, and was lost to sight. “How beautifully she rides! what a lovely girl! who is she, Frank; who is she?” “She is the second daughter of a Colonel D'Arcey, who died some years ago on the Western Frontier. Her mother, who lives about two miles from `the Box,' is one of the most delicious old ladies in the world; and a great friend of mine. Maria has an elder sister, a nice girl too in petite santè. But look you, Fred, I must not have you falling in love with either of them.” “I am not a very falling-in-love-man,” said Fred laughing; “But I cannot see why not. She seems to me a very loveable sort of person; and I can afford to love any body I like, thank God! why not, Frank?” “Because she has got a brother, a lawyer in York, who is just as unloveable a sort of person, as my fair friend is loveable, and you have no idea yet how loveable she is.—He is as hard, as crabbed, and as narrow-minded a snob, as ever you met withal. He tried hard to hinder me from darkening his mother's doors, within which he is a perfect domestic tyrant, until he discovered, in the first place, that I was not a marrying man, and had no thought of the delicate Julia, or the fair Maria; and, in the second, that he could not quarrel with me, unless by being guilty of impertinence so gross as to earn evil consequences.” “But why—why in the devil's name! is he so vicious?” “He is naturally a brute in the first place—in the next, he is a bigoted fanatic—in the third, a violent ultra Native American, and hater of all d—d foreigners —and, to conclude, a howling demagogue, who makes vast capital by declaiming against British influence, British tyranny, and British gold. I verily believe, he would rather see his sister married to an American counterfeiter, fresh out of the States' prison, than to an English gentleman of wealth, accomplishment and honor. He is a choice specimen of all the worst points of his countrymen—thank God! a very rare— I hope, a solitary specimen!—But, as I said before, I must have no falling in love, Fred.” “I don't know,” said Heneage laughing; “I never thought of such a thing before; but now that you have told me all this, it alters the matter very much.—The spice of difficulty, perhaps the spice of danger, flavors the dish of matrimony, marvellous well, men say—I think—I think—I will fall in love with her.” “There is many a true word spoken in jest;” said Harry Archer gravely—“But I would rather give a hundred pounds, than see this jest come true.” Just as he uttered these last words, they reached the top of the hill, on which the gate of the shooting box opened; and descried, coming up the opposite side of the ascent in his large two horse wagon, the renowned Tom Draw. His large double seated wagon of a bright green hue picked out with black, was almost entirely concealed in the mass of buffalo hides, among which, occupying almost the whole width of the front seat, the fat man sat sublime. His horses, full sixteen hands in height, the one a magnificent red roan, the other an iron gray, breasted the steep hill, with arched crests and high round action at full ten miles the hour; and, as Harry was wont to say, but for the trifling difference in their color, few gentlemen in any country could boast a handsomer or better matched pair, not to say as good travellers, as that of mine host of Warwick. But the man—the fat man! A volume would scarce suffice to describe his outward man; a library would fail to convey a just idea of the excellencies, the oddities, the humors of this most worthy, most original, most happy of characters. Wrapped in his ample overcoat of drab pilot cloth, with buckskin mittens on his hands, and a huge fur cap on his thick iron-gray locks, beneath which shone out, beaming with mirth, and gayety and genuine good humor, the broad expanse of his ample and handsome G 2 face, Fred Heneage, who had heard of him both from Harry, and Frank Forester, but who had never seen him, thought he had never beheld such a mountain of flesh. His clear brown eye beamed with unutterable humor, beneath the pent house of his thick shaggy grizzled eyebrows, giving expression by their well marked line, to a broad and expansive forehead. The nose was small and well-shaped—but the mouth, the mouth, was the great feature of the bold, manly, lion-like face—the mouth, telling a world of character—with its arch dimples, full-fraught with merriment and mischief at the corners—its firm well-cut curve speaking of energy and resolution and a will of iron—and the full, rich-red nether lip betokening a little—yet not a very little either—of voluptuous, perhaps sensual taste. As he sat in his wagon, perched on the high soft cushion of his easy seat, with all the lower part of his person enveloped in the warm buffalo robes, the effect of his enormous size was in some sort concealed, or at least diminished; inasmuch as the breadth and rotundity were not now contrasted with the want of height; which, when standing, rendered his size more conspicious. Still, as he measured the vast breadth of his shoulders, and suffered his eye to fall over the regular protuberance which swelled outward from his chin downward in fair round proportion, Fred looked enquiringly at Harry, and said, “Jest apart, do you mean to tell me that huge animal can shoot—can walk?” “I never saw a better shot—I have rarely walked with a stauncher walker. He is not fast of course, but where the ground is solid, he is unwearied. And without any exception, he is the most thorough and best sportsman I know anywhere.” “The deuce! How tall is he?” “About five foot six, and measures round the place where his waist should be, five foot nine, thus being literally larger round than he is long. His thigh is bigger in girt than my chest, and I am not exactly a baby. He weighs three hundred and forty-two pounds, or in horseman's weight, with which you are of course more familiar than with pounds, twenty-four stone six pounds. And, by Jove! his heart is as large as his whole body. Upon my word! it is no exaggeration to say he is all heart.” “Not a bit of exaggeration,” said Frank Forester— “I really love Tom.” “He is an extraordinary fellow indeed,” said Harry, and I value him very highly, for his sterling and excellent qualities, independent of his social and entertaining disposition and humor. How are you, Tom? How are you?” he exclaimed, as they arrived within hail, exactly opposite to the gate, which Timothy jumped down to open. “How be you, boys? how be you?” shouted the fat man, in a deep rich joyous tone, which bespoke his hearty and jovial character. “I'm pretty smart, now the cool weather's come. What sport to-day?” “Very fair, Tom;” replied Archer—“very fair, indeed; not quite as much as you and I have done in old times—but very fair as things go now a days; about ninety head, I think in all, and half of them woodcock.” “That's not so slim any ways.—Least ways, not so slim for you boys, when you harn't got old Tom along with you. For you carn't mark quail no how—not one on you, worth a cuss—nor shoot them, nuther. Least ways, Frank carn't, by G—!” “Well, and whose fault was it, we hadn't old Tom, with us?—Did not I send you word to come over to breakfast, and bring your cannon, and that brute Dash! you are getting lazy in your old age, or playing possum, you old hippopotamus.” “Hippo—hell!” answered the fat man.—“Come, git them little sorrel scrubs o' yourn out of my way, or I drive over you, torights, and smash you into nauthen. Git on! Forester's kind o' dry. His little jaws is sticked together for want o' mystening—or else he's so drunk he carn't speak.—Git on dew! I want's a drink myself.—I harn't drinked only wunst since I left hum.” “Once? how the deuce did you manage that? where did you get a chance to drink.” Jem Decker's asleep up the road yonder, under the big black walnut; and I see a black stun jug by him. I guessed he'd drinked it pretty well down, for he was 'mazin hard and fast I tell you. And I thought if so be he waked up and found any left he'd be doin himself a mischief likely—he's the G— damnedest critter when he's drunk—so I jest pulled old Roan up, and got out and hitched! Then I took up the jug and shook it jest to judge like how much there was in, you know.” “And how much was there, Tom?” “Only a little mite I tell you—a pint maybe, or a trifle over. Well! when he heard the liquor—chuck, chuck in the jug, like, Jem he stirred, and turned over on his back, and seemed oneasy kind o'—so I made no more work, but jest drinked it up—” “And left the jug empty, I'll be bound—you old heathen!” said Forester. “What! do you think I'd steal?”—replied the fat man, with a mighty show of indignation.—“No, no, I made a fair change with Jem—no one can say I stealed it—and what I left instead o' the old apple Jack 'ill do him a plaguy sight more good, when he wakes and finds his biler jest as hot as h— and hotter.” “What did you leave instead, hey Tom?” “First best fish oil!” replied Tom with a monstrous explosion of merriment—“It did smell some, I reckon —but Jem's not particullar, and I doosn't begrudge him the smell no how.” “You give him the smell in!” said Forester, when he could speak for laughing, “well, that was fair any how. Rather above the bargain, hey?” “Well, I don't know”—said Tom. His apple jack stinked some too. I guess 't warn't the first time there'd been fish oil in the jug—and I warnts a glass of Archer's old Jamaiky to wrench my mouth out. Git on dew—whip up them scrubs, or I'll be a top on you down the hill.—Git on, boys, dew?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER. VI. A GOOD FEED, DULY DEFENDED! “Now, Timothy,” exclaimed Harry Archer, as he dismounted from the seat of his wagon at the door, “run in, and see what o'clock it is; and then ask Mrs. Deighton if dinner will be punctual.” “It's haaf paast faive, sur,” answered Timothy from the hall, “and t' dinner ”ll be upon t' teable at six, and no mistaek!” “That's well—for I'm as hungry as a hawk”—said Archer. We shall have just enough time to make ourselves comfortable, Fred. Where the deuce do you mean to stow yourself Frank?” “Oh! never fear. I have arranged that with Timothy —I shall take possession of his room to-night.” “Very well—now lose no time lads; for Mrs. Deighton's six is sharp six you'll remember. Look here, Tom, you will find this week's Spirit here, and the last Turf Register, can you amused yourself with them, 'till we get fixed, as you'd call it, I suppose?” “Yes! yes”—answered Tom, “I'll amuse myself, I promise you; but it won't be with no sperrit but Jamaiky sperrits—them's the best sperrits for an arternoon. Come, Timothy, you lazy injun, where are you snoopin' off to, cuss you? Git me the sperrits and ice water—your master haint got sense to order up no licker.” “If you have not got sense to order what you want in my house, I am not bound to find you in brains.” “The rum will find his brains, I'll warrant it,” said Forester, “for I am certain whatever brains he's got, are in his belly.” “Sartain!”—responded Tom—“Sartain they be— that's why its sich a nice, fat, round one.—No head wouldn't hold my brains! a stoopid little know nauthen, like you be, may keep his small mite o' brains in his head, though it beant no bigger than a nutshell—but it does take a belly, and a good, rousin', old, biggest kind o' belly, to hold mine.—And the rum will find them torights, and sharp them up too wust kind, I reckon.” “You do not make much toilet, Harry, I presume,” asked Fred, as he sauntered away toward his bed-room, after staring at old Tom in a vain attempt to make him out, for half a moment. “Just as you please about that, Fred. This is liberty-hall. But I do always dress for dinner even when I am quite alone.” “The deuce you do! That must be a monstrous bore!” “Have you known Archer so long,” asked Frank Forester, “and not discovered yet that his greatest pleasure in life is boring himself.” “It's very well his greatest pleasure in life aren't in borin' other people, as you calls it,” interposed Tom, who was growing a little crusty at the non appearance of the ardent—“Least ways I know whose is—hey? Little wax skin?” “I do not find it so,” continued Harry, without taking heed of the bye-play between Forester and old Draw, who were forever sparring one with the other— “on the contrary! I think life is not worth having if we strip it of the decencies; and, living as I do in the country, three fourths of the year, and more than half the time alone, I find there is much more danger of becoming somewhat slovenly and careless, than of being over nice. When you don't meet a lady three times in a year, or a man who shaves above twice a week, unless on special occasions, it is easy enough to degenerate into a mere boor.—I at least will keep clear of that. Some folks think it manly and knowing to assimilate themselves to the roughest and the rudest of the rough and rude, because they chance to live in remote rural districts, I am not one of them.” “I don't think no one will find fault with you for that, no how,” interposed Tom, “no one who knows you. The darned critter's allus dressed as neat as a new pin. And his dinner table, oh h—l, its just like a jeweller's shop in Broadway.” “Yes—and of that more anon—I have been attacked for that too, before now.—But we'll talk about that, while we are feeding; hey Tom?” “I'm willin' so as you aren't over long a dressin'.” “Well, here comes the Jamaica for you; and I will not be a quarter of an hour.” Nor was he; for in a little more than ten minutes he returned, neatly attired in a puce-colored cut-away coat, white waistcoat and black trousers, as natty and well-dressed as possible, but without a shade of foppery—the thing which of all he most abhorred—perceptible either in his exterior or his manner. A moment afterward Frank Forester made his entree, and as usual his practice was as different from his principle, as anything in nature could be. To judge him from his talk you would have supposed that a red flannel shirt and tow trousers, were his ultimatum and beau ideal in the way of dress, yet forth he came, very fine—to say the truth, a little too fine!—so fine, indeed, that it required all his remarkably good looks and quiet manner, to redeem his attire from the charge of being kiddy at least, if not tigerish. He wore the full dress blue coat of his old corps— the first dragoons—a crack royal regiment, which he had left but a year or two before—with its richly embossed gold buttons, and black velvet cuffs and collar. His shirt was rich with open work and mecklin lace, and fastened in front by enamelled studs of exquisite workmanship connected by slight chains of Venetian gold. His crimson velvet waistcoat was adorned with garnet buttons, and his trousers of Inkson's most elaborate cut, fitting his shapely leg as if they had been made upon it, displayed his high instep très bien chausseè in a black gauze silk stocking, and patent leather pumps. Tom Draw stared somewhat wildly, at this display, of which he certainly had never seen before even the counterfeit presentment; and, though he was rigged himself in his best swallow-tailed sky-blue, canary colored waistcoat, and gray inexpressibles, he began to think, as he afterward expressed himself, that he had nauthen on him no how, barrin' his skin, and that rayther o' the thinnest, and the dirtiest at that. Scarcely was Frank well established in Harry's best arm-chair, before Fred made his appearance in a plain snuff-colored dress coat, and the rest of his garb quiet, dark, and unpretending. “Why what's all this about, in the name of wonder?”—he exclaimed, looking at Frank attentively. “Only a little of the heavy dragoon breaking out, Fred,” answered Archer, it does so periodically—like the fever and ague—and like it, thank heaven! it is not catching. If I were to live a thousand years I never should forget the first day I saw my gentleman in this country.—He was walking up Broadway, arm in arm with poor Power who had just landed on his second visit to this country.—They had two of the narrowest pinch up hats—Tom Duncombe's, only more so! —stuck in the most jaunty style on the opposite sides of their heads—each had his outer hand, as they swaggered along arm in arm, stuck in the hind pocket of his coat, and the skirt well brought round on the opposite hip—each, to complete the picture, at every second pace, gave the genuine sabretash kick with the outer H leg—unluckily in poor Power's case it was the right leg—but that made no difference in life—and then the toggery! Only conceive Master Frank, in a bright pea-green body coat, with large basket buttons of solid silver—a crimson cachemire neckcloth—elastic tartan pantaloons, a little tighter than his skin, alternate checks, each check two inches square, of black and the brightest azure, and to conclude, more chains and spurs and iron boot heels—more clash and clang, in walking along the street, than there are to be found in a squadron of cuirassiers. By Jove! It was inimitable!” “What did you do, Harry?”—asked Fred laughing, while Frank tried to grin, though not with the best grace in the world. “Do? Bolted to be sure! what would you have had me do?—I would not have spoken to him in the street in that rig for any sum! I was not very well known in New York myself at that time, and I saw old Hays on the other side of the street quietly contemplating my friend there, with a cool confidential nod of the head, and wink addressed to his own other eye—as who should have said, `Aha! my fine fellow, it will not be many days, before you and I shall be better acquainted!' ” What exclamation or asseveration would have followed can never now be known, for just as Forester stood up, not a little nettled, Timothy threw the door open, and said, “T' dinner's upon t' teable, please sur.” And thereupon Frank's face relaxed into a mild and placid smile, and drawing Tom's arm under his own, “Allow me the honor,” he said, “Mistress Draw, to hand you into dinner.” “No you don't little wax skin—no you don't—not through that door no how, we'd git stuck there, boy,— and they'd niver pull us out; and we'd starve likely with the smell o' the dinner in our noses, and the champagne a bustin' under our eyes out o' the very bottles to be drinked, and us not there to drink it. No, no, we'll run no resks now.” And with the words they passed into the dining-room, arranged as on the previous evening except that, for two covers, four were now laid on the white damask cloth, and that a pair of tall silver wine coolers occupied the centre of the table with the long necks of hock and champagne flasks protruding. At the left of each guest, stood a pint decanter of delicate straw-colored sherry; and at his right, four glasses, a long stalked beaker of old-fashioned Venice crystal, a green German hock glass embossed with grapes and vine leaves, a thin capacious sherry glass with a curled lip so slender that it almost bent as you drank from it, and a slim-shanked shallow goblet for Bourdeaux or Burgundy. There was but one comestible, however, on the table, a deep silver tureen, with a most savory and game-like odor exuding from the chinks of its rich cover. “I would have given you some raw natives to begin with,” said Harry, “knowing how much Tom likes them, but we can't get the crustaceous bivalves up hither with distinguished success, until the frost sets in.” “I'm right glad on't, by the Etarnal!” exclaimed Tom, “nasty, cold, chillin', watery trash! jist blowin' out your innards for no good, afore you git to the grist o' dinner—what kind o' soup's that, Timothy?” “A soup of my own invention”—answered Harry— “and the best soup in the world me judice.—Strong venison soup, made as we make hare soup at home— a good rich stock to begin with, about ten pounds of the lean from the haunch brayed down into the pottage, about a dozen cloves and a pint of port, and to conclude, the scrag of the neck cut into bits two inches square, done brown in a covered stew pan, and thrown in with a few forced meat balls when the soup is ready. You can add if you please, a squeeze of a lemon and a dash of cayenne, which I think improve it. It is piping hot; and not bad I think.” “I have tasted something of the kind in the Highlands, at Blair of Athole,” said Frank Forester. “I have not,” replied Harry. “The Scotch venison soup, is made clear, and though a capital thing, I like this pureè better.” “So do I, Harry,” said Fred Heneage—“and I should think by the gusto with which you speak of it, that you not only invented, but made it.” “You'd think just about right, then,” answered Tom, as he thrust out his plate for a second ladle full. “He and I did make the first bowl of it, as iver was made. And it tuk us a week—yes, a fortnight I guess, before we got it jest right. I will say that for Harry! the darned critter, is about as good as bringing game up right on the table, as he is at bringing them down right in the field.” “Yes! and for that very thing, I have been assailed,” said Harry laughing, “as lacking the true spirit of a sportsman, as not enjoying the thing in its high ennobbling spirit, as not a pure worshipper in heart and intellectual love of the divine Artemis, but a mere sensualist, and glutton, making my belly a god, and degrading my good gun into a mere tool for the slaves of Epicurus!” “Treason! high treason! name the rash man! Hold him up bodily to our indignation!” “First let us drink!—That pale sherry is delicate and very dry. Will you have champagne, Tom?—No— very well—Here is a health then to C. E. of the Buffalo Patriot.” “C. E!—Who the devil is C. E?”—cried all three in a breath. “Alias, J B.” “And who then is J B?” “The man wot stabbed me in the tenderest part— which he, I suppose, would say is my abdomen?” “Are you in earnest, Harry?” “I am gravely in earnest, when I say that he taxed me seriously, though sportively, with all that I have stated.—He said that, in my admiration of good things, in dwelling on the melting richness of a woodduck, or the spicy game flavor of a grouse, in preferring a silver plate whereon to eat my venison, to an earthern trencher, in carrying out a bottle of champagne and cooling it in a fresh spring for my luncheon, instead of trusting to execrable rye or apple whiskey, I prove myself degenerate and no true votary of the gentle woodcraft. He is afraid that I cannot rought it!” “Is he, indeed?—Poor devil!” “He don't know much then, no how, that chap!” answered Tom, as he went largely into the barbacued perch, which had taken the place of the pottage— “Least ways he don't know much, if he thinks as a chap carn't rough it becase he knows how to eat and drink, when there's no need of roughing it. I've seen fellows as niver had seen nauthen fit to eat nor drink in their lives, turn up their darned nasty noses at a good country dinner in a country tavern, where a raal right down gentleman, as had fed allus on the fat of the land, could dine pleasantly. Give me a raal gentleman, one as sleeps soft, and eats high, and drinks highest kind, to stand roughing it—and more sense to C. E., next time he warnts to teach his grandmother.” “How do you like this fish?” “Capital—capital?” “Well, all its excellence, except that it is firm, lies in the cookery.—It is insipid enough and tasteless, unless barbacued.” “Then you were wise to barbacue it.” “And how should I have learned to barbacue it; if I had not thought about such things. No, no boys—I H 2 despise a man very heartily, who cannot dine just as happily upon a bit of salt pork and a biscuit, and perhaps an onion, aye! and enjoy it as well, washed down with a taste of whiskey qualified by the mountain brook —or washed down with a swallow of the brook unqualified—as he would enjoy canvass-back and venison with champagne and Bourdeaux.—Who cannot bivouack as blithely and sleep as soundly under the starlit canopy of heaven as under damask hangings— when there is cause for dining upon pork, and for bivouacking.—But there is one thing, boys, that I despise a plaguy sight more—and that is a thick-headed fool, who likes salt pork as well as canvass-back and turtle.—Who does not see any difference between an ill-cooked dish swimming in rancid butter, and a chef d'æuvre of Carême or Ude, rich with its own pure gravy? and yet more than the thick-headed fool, do I abhor the pig-headed fool, who thinks it brave forsooth and manly and heroical withal, and philosophical, to affect a carelessness, which does not belong to him, and to drink cider sperrits when he can drink Sillery sec of the first growth! And that being said, open that champagne, Timothy.” “So much for C. E?”—enquired Forester. “No no!” exclaimed Harry, eagerly—“I deny any such sequitur as that, C. E. is a right good fellow—or was, at least when I knew him—It is a weary while ago since he supped with me in New York, the very night before he left it—never I believe to return—at least since then I have never seen him—and many a warm heart has grown cold, and many a brown head gray in the interim. But when I knew C. E. he would never drink bad liquor when he could come by good— and right well did he know the difference—and by the way, while vituperating me for my gourmandize, he shows that he is tarred a little with the same stick. He abuses me for saying that the woodduck is as good a bird as flies, except the canvass-back, asserting that the blue-winged teal is better.” “Out upon him!” exclaimed Forester—“the blue-winged teal is fishy, nine times out of ten.” “Aye! Frank—but he is speaking of the teal on the great lakes; and I dare say he is right. It is to the fact that he is the only duck seen on the sea board, who eschews salt water and salt sedges that the summer duck—for that is his proper name—owes his pre ëminence over all the other wild fowl of this region.— Now, as the blue-winged teal, or Garganey, is in the same predicament on the lakes, I think it very questionable whether in that country he may not be as good, nay better than my favorite.” “Are you in earnest? Do you think that the diet of ducks makes so much difference in their quality,” asked Heneage. “So much? It makes all the difference.—What renders the canvass-back of the waters of the Chesapeak, the very best bird that flies; while here, in Long Island sound, or on the Jersey shore he is, at the best, but a fourth rate duck.—The wild celery, which he eats there, and which he cannot get here, for his life.” “A roast leg of mutton?—by no means a bad thing, Harry”—said Fred Heneage—“when it is old enough and well roasted.” “This is six years old,” answered Archer—“Black faced, Scotch, mountain, of my own importation, my own feeding, and my own killing. It has been hanging three weeks, and, by the way it cuts, I believe it is in prime order—done to a turn I can see that it is. Will you have some?” “Will a fish swim?—Where is the currant jelly?” “On the side board. I don't consider currant jelly orthodox with mutton, which is by far too good a thing to be obliged to pass itself for what it is not.” “I agree with you,” said Frank—“I hate anything that is like something else.” “Of course—all good judges do. That puts me in mind of what Washington Irving once told me, that he never ate clams, by any chance, because he was quite sure that they would be oysters if they could!” “Excellent! excellent!” said Fred and Forester, both in a voice; whereupon Tom added, “They carn't come it though—stewed clams is not briled iseters!” “No more than mosquitoes are lobsters, which was John Randolph's sole objection to the insects.” “And do you really prohibit currant jelly with roast mutton?” “I don't prohibit anything—but I don't eat it, and I think it bad taste to do so. Venison I think the only thing that is improved by it. Canvass-back ducks I think it ruins. Nor should I think C. E's plum jelly with grouse, one whit better. The sharpness of currant jelly is very suitable to the excessive fat of English park-fed venison; but with any lean meat I think it needless, to say the best. There is but one sauce for any kind of gallinaceous game, when roasted, whether his name be grouse, partridge, pheasant, quail, or wild turkey.” “Right, Harry, and that is bread sauce.” “And that is bread sauce; made of the crumb of a very light French roll, stewed in cream and passed through a tamis, one small white onion may be boiled in it, but must be taken out before it is served up to table, a lump of fresh butter as big as a walnut may be added, and a very little black pepper. Let it be thick and hot, and nothing else is needed; unless, indeed, you like a few fried crumbs, done very crisp and brown.” “Open that other flask of champagne, Timothy— Tom's glass is empty, and he begins to look angry. Will you take wine with me?” said Heneage, who had hit Tom's feelings to a hair. “In course, I will”—replied Tom joyously, “when Harry gits a talking about his darned stews and fixins, he niver recollects that a body will git dry.” “Pass it round, Timothy,” said Harry—“that's not a bad move of old Tom's by any means. I believe I was riding one of my hobbies a little hard. But it provokes me to see the good things, which are destroyed in this country by bad cookery; and it provokes me yet worse, to hear hypocrites and fools talk as if it were wrong for the creature to enjoy the good things designed for his use by a good Creator.” “It is about as rational truly as to assert that it is impious to plant a tree or cultivate a bed of exotics in order to make finer a view naturally beautiful; because Providence did not plant them originally there.” “Yes! Sartain! yes I go that,” said old Tom, who was always death again humbugs, as he would have said himself—“or wicked to wear breeches becase natur did not fix them on our hinder eends in the creashun. I do think, too, though I niver hearn of it 'till Archer come up this a-way, and larned us how to eat and drink, as bread sauce doos go jist as nat'rally with roast quails, as breeches on a—” “Shut up you old sinner,” said Harry laughing. “Here come the ruffed grouse, larded and boiled, for boiling which Fred so abused me this morning.” “He won't abuse you, when he has once tasted them,” said Forester. “It is the best way of cooking them.” “Well—yes—they bees kind o' dry meat, roasted; but then I don't find no great faults with the dryness— specially when one's got jist this wine, to wrench his mouth with arter.” “They are good—with this celery sauce especially.” “As is bread sauce to roast, so is celery sauce to boiled game—Q-e-d.” “There is a soupçon of onion in this also, is there not?” “Just enough to swear by—do you think it too much?” “I did not say a taste, I said a soupçon—are you answered?” “There aint no Souchong in it no how—nor no Hyson, nother. He'll be a swearin' it's Java coffee next”—said Tom, waxing again somewhat wrothy. “He is thirsty again,” said Frank—“what shall it be; I say hock after this boiled white meat.” “Right, Frank, for a thousand!” said Harry, “and after the woodcock, which Tim is bringing in, we'll broach a flask of Burgundy.—Hock with your white game, Burgundy with your brown! But hold, hold! Timothy, Mr. Draw will not touch that hock—it's too thin, and cold for his palate.” “Rot-gut!”—replied Tom—“None o' your hocks nor your clarets for me—there aint no good things made in France except champagne wine and old Otard brandy.” “Well, which of two will you have, Tom?” “That 'are champagne 's good enough for the likes of me.” “Oh! don't be modest, pray. It will hurt you!” “What this here wine?—not what I've drinked on it, no how—I could drink all of a dozen bottles of it, without its hurtin' me a mite.” The woodcock followed, were discussed, and pronounced perfect; they were diluted with a flask of Nuits Richelieu, so exquisitely rich and fruity, and of so absolute a bouquet, that even the hostility of fat Tom toward all French wines was drowned in the goblet, thrice the full of which, mantling to the brim, he quaffed in quick succession. The Stilton cheese, red herring, and caviare, which succeeded, again moved his ire, and were denounced as stinkin' trash fit for no one to eat but a darned greedy Englishman; but the bumper of port again mollified him, and he said that if they ate them cussed nasty things jist to make the wine taste the better for the contrast, he didn't see no sense in that, for it was mazin' nice without no nastiness afore it. The devilled biscuits he approved mightily, as creating a wholesome drought, which he applied himself to assuage by emptying three bottles of pale sherry to his own cheek, while the three young men were content with one double magnum of Chateau Latour. But when he emptied the third bottle he was as cool and collected as if he had not tasted a single drop, and was half disposed to run rusty, at being summoned into the library to take a cup of coffee and an old cheroot—but here again his wrath was once more assuaged by the curaçao, of which he drank off half a tumbler, and then professed himself ready for a quiet rubber, while Tim was gittin supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE QUADRUPEDS' QUARTERS. There had been a very heavy shower during the night, but it had cleared off bright and cold before morning broke; and now, as the sun rose cloudless in the pearly and transparent sky, no view can be conceived more beautiful than that which lay before the eyes of Heneage, who had arisen early, and stood gazing over the landscape from the porch of the shooting box. The summits of the Warwick hills, round-headed, bold and vast, cut sharp and clear, with all their wooded outlines, in dark purple masses against the lucent sky; beneath this massive screen, sparkling with dew, and gay with ten thousand gorgeous hues, the noble woods beyond the little river, concealed the level fields which spread their gentle undulations to the foot of the distant mountains. Nearer yet to the eye, in the middle ground, the wild rocky bank fringed with its feathery junipers, and carpeted with glossy leaved azalia, was veiled by the thin mist, which seethed up, white as snow, from the bed of the rushing torrent, to be dissipated, long ere it reached the upper air, by the increasing power of the sunbeams. In the foreground the smoothly shaven lawn, as green as an emerald, and almost as bright from the lustre of the quick glancing dew-drops, sloped away gently from the portico to the stream's margin, broken by two or three clumps only of rare exotic rhododendrons, and one large osier basket full of roses of all colors and varieties, with a luxuriant honeysuckle entwined about its handle. Heneage stood there perhaps ten minutes, looking out with a well pleased eye, and framing to himself, half unconsciously, ideal pictures of some such solitude as this to be his “dwelling place,” “With one fair spirit for his minister,” while Archer's favorite tortoise-shell cat, which had followed him out of the parlor, was rubbing its glossy sides against his leg, and purring loudly though unnoticed. While he was still gazing at the little landscape, discovering some new charm every moment, and yet wondering within himself whether Harry did not find it very lonely all by himself there in the winter, a quick firm footstep resounded on the hall floor behind him, and Archer's cheerful voice crying aloud, “The top of the morning to you, Master Fred. I had no notion that you were such an early man. Why the sun is scarce out of bed yet.” “Oh! yes, in the country I like to be moving early; besides I thought you breakfasted about this time.” “Never, before eight, unless when I am going to make an early start and a long day's shooting. And never at all, when Forester's up here. Timothy tells him all sorts of lies about the time, but it is all to no purpose; the little devil knows instinctively what o'clock it is, even with the window shutters closed, and nothing can induce him to get up in what he calls the night.” “And you classed me as being in the same category, hey?” “To say the truth, yes! and I half believe this fit of early rising is only accidental. Perhaps the fair Maria's charms have banished `nature's soft nurse.”' “You be hanged!—If the truth must be told, it was the infernal racket that your fat friend kicked up, when he was starting, not metaphorically, but literally, in the I night, that aroused me. Where the deuce did he sleep? and what took him away this morning? I thought he was going to stay and shoot with us to day!” “He slept upon the sofa in the library—he went away to get his gun and Dash, and his shooting toggery. How did he rouse you? I did not hear him.” “Roaring like a bull for his bitters! what the devil! are bitters, old fellow?” “Oh! you will learn that soon, if you cultivate Tom. By the way, what do you think of him?” “Think!—By the Lord! He is far beyond all thinking about. If he were not alive now, I should be quite certain that Shakspeare must have made Falstaff after him; as it is, I fancy, nature must have made him after Falstaff.” “All but the cowardice, I grant you—but the old dog is pluck to the back-bone.” “How did you make him out?” “I discovered him—and it is not the act of my life of which I am the least proud. I expect that I shall go down to history, at least, side by side with Columbus, Vasco di Gama, and such like worthies, as the discoverer of Tom Draw, the great American original.” “He is indeed an original!” He is the original—the only original I have ever met with in the United States. It is an odd thing, and I cannot account for it, but original and eccentric characters appear to me to be the growth of old countries. But come, Tom will be back to breakfast soon, and by that time Frank will be afoot, and bellowing for his breakfast, of which he will eat more than any two people in the room, while swearing all the time that he has no appetite. Do you like to walk round, and look at the stable and the kennels?” “Of all things. I have been wondering where they are placed; for there is no glimpse to be seen of any out-house.” “This way; I will show you; they are close by, though hidden by my trees and trellices.” The cottage stood, as it has been described, midway the slope of the hill which arose very rapidly behind; with an open grove of tall white oaks and hickories growing close down to the rear of the building, and sweeping off in a long receding curve from either of the angles, to the right hand and left, a few scattered trees only, dotting the lawn and flanking the ends of the cottage. A few yards only within the thick wood, at each extremity of the house, a tall latticed screen composed of rough gnarled branches, unbarked and fresh from the forest, wound away in irregular lines until it was lost to sight in the aisles of the woodland, covered with ivy and parasitic creepers, such as thrive in the shade. This rustic fence, which was at least eight feet in height, and covered with perrenial verdure, completely effected the concealment of the out-buildings, while it was in its turn so far hidden by the outskirts of the grove, as to give no appearance of regularity or artificial stiffness. Opening a small doorway in the fence, not far from the gable of the house, Harry led his friend into a narrow gravel walk, which wound for a short distance in and out among the tall trees and then entered a little court, immediately behind the cottage, covered with smooth white gravel, and having in the centre a large tank four or five feet deep by twelve in diameter, full of beautifully clear spring water, which rushed into it continually from a stone spout with a sweet gurgling sound, and passed out again by an aperture below the lip of masonry without ever overflowing it. In this tank there stood half a dozen submerged flower pots containing water lilies of different colors and varieties, their broad glossy leaves floating upon the transparent surface, and affording a grateful shadow to the gold and silver fish with which it was stocked abundantly. In addition to these finny sparklers, a dozen or two, at least, of beautiful tame summer ducks were dipping and disporting themselves on the clear waters, or preening their feathers on the brink, while on the gravel of the courtyard twenty or thirty little snow-white bantams were strutting about proud of their feathery pantaloons, and as many pink-eyed fan-tailed pigeons were circling amorously, one about the other, making the air vocal with their low plaintive cooing. When Harry entered the little enclosure, pigeons and summer ducks, and bantam fowls, all came crowding up around him for their share of the handful of peas and corn, with which the pockets of his shooting jacket were provided. “This is my poultry yard, what do you think of it, and my little pets?—Why, Peter, you impudent little villain,” he added, “are you not ashamed of yourself?” as a pretty white pigeon, after circling two or three times about him, fluttered up, and alighted on his shoulder. “They are very nice, and very pretty,” said Fred. “But I must confess that I hate pets.—It is so disagreeable to have them killed and eaten, after you have been playing with them, and coaxing them.” “Killed and eaten!” do you suppose that I am such a Goth. No, Fred, the greatest cruelty I commit to these little folks is to devour the eggs of the bantams, the squabs of the white pigeons before they have emerged from their boxes, and the young of these summer ducks, which, as soon as they are able to take care of themselves, are kept away from the water, and fed in separate coops, in the other yard, upon celery. None of these breeding people are ever destined for the kitchen. In the other court, which is under Mrs. Deighton's especial superintendence, there are never less than a dozen woodduck, and as many capons, cooped and waxing fat. But thither I never enter in. But come, we are losing time; this is the way to the stables.” And with the words he opened a second door near the pigeon house, and passed with his friend into a larger court yard, neatly paved with cobble stones, having, like the first, a large tank in the centre continually fed by the same bright streamlet. This court, unlike the other, was surrounded on all sides by buildings, between two of which was an arched gateway, with a large folding porte cochère, and as in the little poultry yard through which they had come on their way, everything was as clean and neat as a lady's drawing-room. There was not a particle of litter or rubbish to be seen; no odoriferous goat was there, no fox chained to his rank kennel, no terrier prowling about, snapping and troublesome, the only quadruped in sight being a large tabby cat, blinking with her half closed eyes, and purring to herself in silent satisfaction, as she lay basking in the full sunshine on the top of the horse block. Exactly facing them as they entered was a long building consisting of an open carriage house, with an arched colonnade of unbarked cedar posts in front, with a hay loft above it surmounted by a small clock-house with a weather cock and vane—at either end, projecting some twelve feet in advance of the carriage house, was a wing of twenty feet front, with a door five feet wide of stout oak studded with nail heads, and a handsome window. Each of these wings, which were only of a single story, had an open cupola above it with moveable venetian blinds, admitting a free circulation of fresh air. Toward the right of these wings Archer took his way, and lifting the heavy latch, entered a passage six feet wide by twelve in length, neatly paved, with a large stable lamp swinging from the roof. To the right of this was the grain room, its window I 2 protected by a wire grating, and all the walls, floor, and interior of the binns lined with sheet iron. “All snug and tight, Fred,” said Harry, as he pointed it out to him—“no rats or mice here! Pretty good oats,” he added, taking out a sample. “The best of North Rivers, but they are light as compared with ours at home. These are what they call very heavy here, nine and thirty pounds the bushel.” “The devil! do you call that heavy!” “Yes! Faith! exceeding heavy!—We have none of your fifty pound oats, we don't manure liberally enough for that, but come—here are the prads.” He threw open the second door, and the stable was before them, a square space of twenty feet, with four stalls occupying the whole length of the wall facing them—four stalls handsomely filled by the round powerful quarters and square docks of four as spicy cobs, as ever did their mile in three minutes—two blacks and two bright glossy chesnuts. Their sheets of clean white holland, their woollen blankets checked with a yellow line, bordered with blue, and with blue initials, their poitrels of the same, and their hoods, knowingly folded back over their gay surcingles, were the perfection of cleanliness and good taste. The floor paved with bricks set edgewise was actually redolent of cleanliness. The beds were laid down with a neatly plaited border; and over every stall hung an elaborate wreath of straws destined to allure any wandering fly—vain destination, for the deuce a fly was to be seen or heard in that abode of nattiness. The horses had been fed and littered down, and the venetian blinds were therefore closed, but enough of light penetrated, with the air, through the shutters of the ventilator in the roof to allow all the details to be seen even to the smallest. As they came in one of the black cobs turned his head and whinnied; and at the sound the others rattled their blocks and running halters, and looked with some token or other of recognition, at their master. “Ah! you rogues, I must not forget you,” said Harry, and turning back into the grain room he brought a few bits of carrot, which lay ready to his hand in a barrel, and fed them severally, clapping their smooth and well-groomed necks, with this choicest of equestrian dainties. “Where is your hay—Harry? you have no loft overhead I see!” “No! indeed.—The hay is over the carriage house. There is no greater mistake in the world than to put your hay and grain over a stable, where all the fetor and ammonia must rise and impregnate the food with insalubrious stench.—No, indeed, nothing but the fresh air above, and a constant change of that. Now then, let us go to the other wing. See, here,” he continued, as he entered it, “here is my harness and saddle room, with a furnace and boiler for hot water—and here,” passing through the vestibule—six feet, by twelve, like that on the other side, “Here are the boxes for the thoroughbreds.—This is Frank Forester's `Bright Selim,' and a beauty he is with his rich chesnut coat and mouse-colored muzzle, and that is my `Bay Trojan;' you have not seen him yet. Tell me, Fred, did you ever see a finer quarter, a more richly shaped gambril—a more sloping shoulder. What a round barrel too! and look at his chest! Plenty of room for the bellows in that chest, hey, Fred?—Good arm, short cannon bone!—What fault can you find with him?” “None, by the Lord! He is a superb colt. How is he bred?” “By Priam, out of Betsy Richards by Sir Archy. There is no better blood in America.” “He ought to run.” “He would, I have no doubt.—But he has never been in training. I bought him young at a very big figure, for his shapes, and as I cannot afford the luxury of racing, I have eschewed training him.” “You were wise, I suppose—yet I think I should have risked being tempted.” “Not I. I want him for a riding horse, not for a racer; the two are incompatible.” “Even so. Where are the dogs? Let us have a look at them, and then to breakfast.” “This way then.” And leaving the stable court by the side door, they went out into the oak grove, through which they walked a couple of hundred yards to the skirt of a green meadow, and there they found the kennel. It was a neat wooden building of two apartments, the outer one paved with brick and opening upon a green court some twenty yards square, with a branch of the little brook, which was dammed above to supply the poultry yard and stable, meandering through it. Within was a second room furnished with wooden beds supplied sparingly with clean wheaten straw, and a stove in the centre, protected by a grated fender or cage reaching nearly to the ceiling. The dogs—two brace and a half of superb setters, two black with tan spots above their eyes—two red, of Lord Clare's famous Irish breed, one liver and white spotted—and a brace of strong Blenheim spaniels— were rolling and playing on the grass, or swimming in the little stream, all looking fresh and vigorous and healthy. “I give them a bit of fire at night, poor brutes, in this autumn weather.—It is hard to send them shivering to a cold bed after a stiff day's work in the cold water of our swamps.—Besides, a dog lasts as long again, when he is well cared for.” “Perfectly right, Harry—I never saw a more complete establishment for its size. But where are my pointers?” “I was afraid they might get to fighting, so I had them put into a spare lodging which I have for puppies or bitches. Here it is, by the boiling room.” “And very well they look, poor lads,” said Fred— “Good dog Don! good dog Punch!—should not you like to go out, old fellows?” “You shall take them out one of these days, Fred; we will go down and shoot quail in the open fields in South Jersey—they will tell there. But hark! there goes the breakfast bell, and as there is a broiled wood-duck, celery fed, fresh reeking from the gridiron, it behoves us neither to let him grow cold, nor bide the brunt of Frank Forester's fine morning appetite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOW BEFORE. Harry's prediction was well nigh accomplished, would have been altogether, had they suffered five minutes longer to elapse before they turned homeward from the kennel; for, when they reached the dining-room Frank was established, as large as life, at the breakfast table, with half a woodduck on his plate, a cup of black tea at his right hand, and Timothy at his elbow, grinning from ear to ear at some one of his favorite's witticisms. “Just as I thought, Fred,” exclaimed Harry—“all the broiled duck gone, I'll be bound.” “Only half, only half of it, Harry, and I sent word to Mrs. Deighton to put the other on the gridiron at once, just to save time.” “Wonderful!” said Archer. “What's wonderful?” “That Frank Forester should have thought of anybody but himself, so long as there was anything good before him?” “Do you call this good?”—he replied, holding up a morsel of the juicy broil on the point of his fork. “Not having tasted it, I cannot say. I should bet upon it though, by the way you are tucking into it.” “One must eat something.” “There's a cold quail pie on the side board, a buffalo's tongue, and the sirloin.” “Yes—but they are cold.” “And so the duck is bad is it, Frank?” said Fred Heneage, sitting down to the well covered board.—“I had rather not take your word for it.” “Not bad exactly—a thought underdone perhaps!” said Forester, who never praised anything. “Not exactly!” said Fred—“upon my word, it is delicious. Is this the bird you and the Patriot-man are fighting about.” “Skirmishing!—only skirmishing! I wish he would send me down a few brace of his sand-hill cranes, or a few couple of the blue-winged teal on which he brags so confidently. I dare say, as I observed last night, they are more delicate on the fresh water. Ha! what is this?” he continued, as the boy Dick brought in a pretty little note, upon a silver waiter, and presented it to his master—“who brought that, Dick?” “Mrs. D'Arcey's man, sir.” “Ha! you're in luck, Fred; it must be an invite. Exactly!” he continued, as he opened the note, and skimmed the contents—“compliments, Mr. Archer— this evening—coffee—happy to see his friend Mr. Heneage, Mr. Forester too—Ha! ha! that's not so bad, upon my soul!—`if it were any use to ask him, but as I have quite made up my mind never to do so any more, pray tell him from me that I beg he will not fatigue himself, by coming to what I think I can hear him calling that terrible old woman's tea fight.”' “She's not a terrible old woman at all—I'll be hanged if I ever said so”—exclaimed Frank, energetically—“not a bit of it, she's a very good old thing indeed, an excellent old thing!—I'll go for one, Harry, that's a dead fact!” “No, will you, Forester, indeed?” said Archer; “that's something new for you, such a woman hater—” “Lady hater fine lady hater! if you please, Master Harry,” yes I do most cordially detest your genuine New York fine lady, that's a fact, who is much too genteel to know anything, or do anything, or even open her mouth to say anything—whose highest idea of society is to gather eight or ten grinning counter-jumpers, without one idea beyond the tie of a gold and silver cravat, about her; whose highest ambition is to have a more elegant pocket handkerchief than Miss Tare-and-Tret; who says `sir' at every sentence, giggles at every word, and if a man of sense speaks to her, looks on it as an act of great presumption on his part. I do hate ladies, as they call themselves, but a good honest, open-hearted, frank, natural, very woman, I adore, I revere, I—” “Hold hard—hold hard, Frank,” said Harry laughing, “if all these raptures are intended for my little friend Maria, they are thrown away pitifully, for she is bespoken!” “Tush! tush!” laughed Forester, in answer—“a little saucy, blue-eyed, curly-pated chit, like that, a woman!—a school girl more likely, fit only to be marking samplers—no! no! it is the dear good old thing, I mean. Upon my soul, if it were not for having those two great awkward bouncing misses calling me Pa, I dont know but what I'd put it to the touch, To win or lose it all, as gallant Montrose said or sang of old.” “It would be to no purpose, she would not have you, Frank.—But what say you, will you go indeed? What say you, Fred?” “Indeed will I”—said Forester, “I would not miss my game of piquet, for a thousand, with my venerable lady love.” “We can hardly refuse, I should think”—said Heneage, sipping his tea, and affecting to speak indifferently, as if he did not care a farthing whether they went or not. “They must know that we can possibly have no other engagement, here in the country.” “Oh! you need be under no restraint about that,” said Harry, casting a waggish glance toward Forester, “we are under no rules of strict formality here in the first place; and, as I give dinners now and then, they cannot tell that I am not expecting friends. So, if you think it a bore, as I dare say you do, for there will be no one but the two girls and ourselves, except the old lady, you can stay at home with fat Tom and myself, and let Frank go to `the Elms' alone.” “Why, do you not mean to go?” asked Heneage. “Just as you please,” answered Harry, determined to let it rest with Fred himself. “I thought, by your manner, you did not care about it, except as a point of ceremony, in which case—” “What the deuce is the sense of all this coquetting and nonsense?” said Frank Forester, half laughing, half provoked, “you both of you intend to go, as you know perfectly well; and, as there is no reason why you should not like to go and flirt with two very pretty girls, I cannot conceive why you don't say so. Look, here comes old Tom, rattling across the bridge with his big nags, and we have no time to lose if we are to shoot to-day, sit down quick, and write your acceptance.” “That is soon done,” said Harry, going to the writing table, and inditing a note, which as soon as it was finished, he handed to Dick, saying, “give that to John, and hark you, tell Timothy to let him have a horn of whiskey—and then I want to speak to Timothy.” There was a moment's silence, while they were lighting their cheroots, and then Archer began again. “I've been thinking, boys, that it will be our better way, instead of taking luncheon with us, and coming back to a late hot dinner, which will lose us lots of time, as we must be home to dress at seven o'clock, to have a regular cold dinner sent out to the Eagle rock at four o'clock, by which time we shall have got through the cream of our shooting. What do you say?” K “A capital plan by Jove,” said Forester—“but is there time to get up a cold dinner?” “That quail pie has not been cut—and the inroad on that sirloin is small—there is a cold tongue, and a Strasbourg patè de foix gras, and sardines, if that will serve you.” “What you say right is perfectly true.” “Then hark you, Timothy, Dick will go with us to the cover, and bring the carriage back. You will pack up all the things that I have named, with all else requisite for a regular good cold dinner—take lots of salad along with you—and by the way, you may take a pot and boil some potatoes. Four bottles of the dry champagne, two of the pale sherry, and the brandy for Tom, and let all be ready at four punctually. We will go in Mr. Draw's wagon; and I shall want the two black horses at seven before the big wagon—I am going to pass the evening at the Elms. “Aye! aye! sir—ay'se hae 't all raight, ay'se oophaud it!” responded Timothy; and at the same time Draw's stentorian voice thundered from without. “Come look alive, or I'll be arter you torights, you darned eternal snoopin' laziest sort o' critters?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE ELMS. The Elms, like Harry Archer's Shooting Box, from which it was but two miles distant, had been originally a mere country farm house. It was now, if such a paradox be permissible, at once far more and far less pretending, than the snuggery of that worthy. Far more pretending as a house, far less pretending as a place. For though it was at least three times the size of Harry's box, and could boast its music-room, its conservatory, and its half dozen of spare bed-rooms, it had neither the parklike woods, extensive lawn and wild shrubberies, nor the capacious offices and outbuildings, which rendered the other so complete, as a bachelor's menage. It was a low long irregular stone building, the windows of which had been altered and enlarged into venetian doors of plate-glass, with several additions of rooms and bay windows, thrust forward here and there without any regard to the original design, giving it a quaint and picturesque aspect, which was greatly increased by a broad green vernandah running around the whole house, and following all its salient corners. The house stood, as is unfortunately the case with most rural buildings in this country, within twelve or fourteen feet of the roadside, and, consequently, there was no space for any shrubbery, or ornamental garden between the low green fence and the verandah, which was completely overrun with vines and sweet-scented creepers. In front, however, of that low green fence bordering the gravel causeway of the high road there stood, what in older countries would have been esteemed a rare and invaluable ornament to the most lordly dwelling— five Elm trees of that beautiful variety, which lend so rare a charm by the long aisles of their weeping verdure to some of the New England villages. Behind the house, at the distance of a few hundred feet, the same clear brook which ran through Archer's grounds flowed deep and placid, dividing a beautiful terraced garden, with trim hawthorn hedges, and many a bowery alcove, from a soft green meadow bordered with weeping willows. It was in a room overlooking this flowery slope; a room with a low ceiling and two old-fashioned embrasures with deep bay windows, that the three ladies were assembled, awaiting the arrival of Harry and his blythe companie. Nothing could be plainer than the furniture, pretty chintz sofas and settees, and tables of domestic woods, oak and curled maple highly polished; but at the same time nothing could be in better taste, more elegant or more indicative of the usages of the best society. Nothing appeared to be designed for show; nothing but seemed to be placed there for daily use, from the cabinet piano forte, and handsome harp, to the embroidery frame, the water color drawing half finished on its easel, the prettily bound books scattered in bright profusion on the tables, and the superb exotics blooming in rare porcelain vases, the only costly ornaments of that pleasant room. Nor was the aspect of the ladies, who sat there expectant of the coming guests, other than that which a man of the world would have expected from the mute evidences of taste and high refinement. The older lady, who was indeed far more advanced in years than could have been supposed from the appearance of her younger daughter, and who wore her own silver hair smoothly braided across a clear and solid brow, under a snow-white tocque or turban, was one of those fine aristocratic relics of times now almost forgotten, which we so seldom meet in this sordid every day world of ours. Her figure was still fine and graceful, though bowed somewhat by years and yet more by cares and sorrows; but her features, which had been once eminently handsome, although the flashing and vivacious light of happiness and hope had for ever left them, although the fresh hues of youth had faded, never to bloom again on her pale transparent cheek, were still high and noble, and unaltered in their expression of every generous thought and every gentle sentiment that can adorn a woman. The elder daughter, who, though extremely pretty, was somewhat delicate in health, and of feebler constitution than her fair joyous sister, was lying with a shawl thrown across her knees upon a couch beside the wood fire, which the keen air of the autumnal evening rendered agreeable, while her mother read aloud in a rich harmonious voice one of Longfellow's noble ballads, lowering the magazine at times, to make some passing comment, or criticism, more deep than would be generally looked for from a lady, upon the exquisite art which lay, concealed by yet greater art, in the seeming simplicity, and apparently unpremeditated numbers of `the Belfry of Bruges.' Meanwhile, Maria looking a thousand times more lovely, than she had appeared, when she half captivated Fred Heneage in her close fitting riding habit, with her rich auburn ringlets now falling in long soft masses over the dazzling contour of her dimpled falling shoulders, her fairy waist spanned by a broad blue sash, and all the wavy outlines of her rich rounded figure enhanced by the full draperies of her muslin dress, was K 2 flitting to and fro, employed in some gentle household duties, dispensing light and music from her sunny eyes, and the low tones of her soft voice, wherever she turned her steps. The lamps had not been long lighted, and were burning in their opaque globes of ground glass with that faint and uncertain silvery lustre, which is so much more delightful in a small room and domestic circle, than the bright glare of many lights, when the roll of carriage wheels might be heard approaching the outer door, and stopping short under the Elm trees. “Here they are at length,” said the elder lady, “I had almost given them up.” “I had not, then, Mamma,” said Maria, “for Mr. Archer is the most punctual person in the world; and always keeps his word. I am sure too, that something has happened now, more than usual, to delay him.” As she spoke, Archer entered the room with Forester and Fred Heneage, the latter of whom, as a stranger, he introduced to Mrs. D'Arcey, who met him with an extended hand and a pleasant smile, and said some gay good-humoured words in reference to the service he had rendered Maria on the previous day, which led to a response in the like tone from Heneage; and, in a moment the whole party were as much at their ease, as if they had been acquainted for a year. It would not, however, have required the acquaintance of a year to discover that Archer's face was a good deal paler than usual, and that his manner—his who was under all ordinary circumstances so calm and impassive—betrayed the remains of some powerful excitement. Maria, who had turned to him, while her mother was greeting Heneage, saying “you are a truant again, Mr. Archer, and again I have had the task of defending—” stopped short in the middle of her sentence, and interrupted herself, crying with something like anxiety of manner, but trying to appear in jest. “But good heaven! what is the matter with you? your lips are as pale as if you had seen a ghost, and your hand is trembling, you who never tremble at anything. Are you ill—will you have some wine?” “If he is trembling, my dear ladies,” said Forester, who though also somewhat fluttered, maintained his ready wit and gay impudence unaltered—“he can reply to you exactly in the converse of poor Bailly's reply to his executioners.” “What can you mean, Mr. Forester?” “He can say, it is not with cold, ladies, but with fear!” “Upon my word! you are too bad. But he will kill you for it, I am certain, and that is a comfort.” “Kill me, indeed!—I should like to see him try it.” “Oh! yes, I dare say. I have no doubt you are a great coward, Mr. Forester,” said the elder girl, “because you are such a braggart—now I, who am such a poor weak wretch, am in reality much braver than Maria, who is always laughing at danger—when she is really afraid of every thing.” “I!”—exclaimed Maria—“why, Jane, what a story! I am not afraid of anything.” “What do you say to a cow, Maria?” said Archer, who was so much a privileged person that he always called the girls by their Christian names. “Oh! I forgot the cow”—answered Maria laughing —“I am afraid I must plead guilty to the cow.” “You are not in earnest!”—said Heneage, who seemed anxious to change the conversation. “I am, indeed; do you despise me very much? If you do, I can't help it; for I always tell the truth, and I am a little bit afraid of a cow—but only of a cow—of nothing else I assure you.” “Of a horse you are certainly not afraid,” said Heneage, in a lower voice, and with one of those deep glances, dwelling upon her lovely and ingenuous features, full of the warmest admiration.—“I never saw so perfect a horsewoman.” “Ah! now, you have some bad end in view,” she returned with a smile, shaking her head—“since you are beginning to flatter me on my weak point, but I see your drift and it shall not succeed.—You want to divert me from my previous question, what was the matter with Mr. Archer, that he looked so strangely; and what Mr. Forester meant by saying it was fear.” “It is a very strange thing, Miss Maria D'Arcey, that so truthful a young lady as you are, can give no one credit for truth but yourself.—I meant, as I always do mean, just simply what I said—that it was with fear not with cold that Mr. Harry Archer, the object of your intense solicitude, is shaking like a weathercock in a northeaster, and as pale as a sheet.” “And I don't believe one word of it”—she answered, glancing from one to the other of the party, of whom Heneage appeared considerally the most confused— “but I must know—I will know. I am a spoiled girl, am I not Mamma?—and I always have my own way, do I not?” “Generally, I believe, Maria,” said her mother, with a fond glance at her lovely child, “but in this case, I must confess as great a curiosity as yours.—For I do not think Mr. Forester is quizzing altogether; and yet I do not believe, any more than you, in Mr. Archer's being afraid. There is something strange in all this, and you had really better tell us, or we shall all of us fancy, that it is something stranger that it really is.” “The only way is to ask Mr. Archer directly,” said Maria, “for I don't believe he knows how to tell a story.—Is it fear, Mr. Archer?” “Which made me pale?” answered Harry with a grave smile—“I am afraid that, even at the expense of jeoparding your good opinion, I must reply `aye!”' “Fear!” exclaimed Maria emphatically.—“Fear, and you!—Then it was not fear for yourself I am certain.” “I think you for your certainty—it was not.” “Pray tell us now, and no more mystery”—said Mrs. D'Arcey—“for we are too impatient to give you any coffee till we are relieved from suspense, and I know Mr. Forester wants his revenge of me at piquet, and he shall not be gratified, 'till you have told us.” “Well, if I must, I must,” he added—“But first let me tell you not to be alarmed, for no harm has been done at all, though there was certainly a good deal of danger, enough as you see to frighten me some hours ago, so that I have not yet fully got over it.” “Oh! tell us! tell us!” “Well, we set out to shoot this morning, if you must know, up the valley of what they call the black creek, up to the Eagle rock, which, if you remember, overlooks the stream from a considerable height, and has a fine view over the mill-pond above, and the dark channel hemmed in by the rocks below. Timothy was to meet us there with some cold dinner in order to save time, after which we proposed to drive home so as to have leisure to dress coolly, and come to you punctually. But the fates ordered it otherwise—we had a fine day's sport, reached our appointed place, made a good dinner and were smoking our cigars calmly on the rock, a hundred feet above the stream, which was quite clear and shallow, with the big boulder stones all bare and dry in its bed, when all on a sudden, we heard a deep hollow moaning sound, and a great gush of white muddy water came surging down the channel, bearing a quantity of broken timbers down before it. We were on our feet in a moment, all suspecting what had happened, though by no means suspecting to what extent—that the mill-dam had given way. A few steps brought us to a place whence we could see; and surely enough the dam, at which some clumsy mill-wright had been at work, had given way —there was a wide breach in it even then, and the waters were widening it every moment, and what with the roar of the cataract, and the crash of the beams and the sullen gurgling of the great eddies in the pool below the wheel, and down the channel, I never saw or heard a more frightful scene in my life. We had not stood there five seconds, before the door of the mill was thrown open, and poor old Dame Anderson, the miller's wife, came rushing out of it with her gray hair streaming in the wind, and screaming for help in mortal terror. At first I could not see the danger; but she had doubtless felt the yielding of the timbers, for she had scarcely reached the middle of the small wooden bridge which crosses the mill-race from the door, before one after another, with crash and groan, the lower timbers settled down into the torrent; the mill was swept down the fall over the rocks; and, after blocking the passage for a moment or two, and damming the waters back to the foot of the fall, was broken into a thousand fragments, and swept piecemeal down the stream. In the meantime the poor old woman's situation was truly perilous. The first arch of the bridge had been swept away with the house, and by the shock the ends of the planks, which join the shore, had been loosened, so that the centre on which she stood alone remained entire, and that swayed perilously to and fro among the whirling eddies. I turned away and ran as hard as I could to the boat which lay moored not ten yards distant, trusting that I might stem the current above the broken dam, and so rescue her—but I had not taken ten steps before I heard a wild yell, and in an instant the bridge fell, and she was plunged into the water and carried over the fall, in less time than it has taken me to tell you.” “Great God!—How terrible!” “But you saved her—you saved her—I know, you did, Mr. Archer,” exclaimed Maria, her bright eyes glistening with enthusiasm—“I know you saved her! say that you did.” “She was saved,” replied Archer, gravely—“God be praised for it! but it was not by me.” “Oh! go on, go on, Mr. Archer. I do not wonder that you were shocked, not afraid. Afraid is not the word for what you felt, at all. Go on, and tell us.” Happily the waters were so heaped in the gorge below, that the fall was now not above two feet high instead of being ten or twelve, so that the poor old woman was swept over it unharmed; and yet more happily she had caught in her struggles a piece of timber, which partially supported her. Still she was in the most imminent peril, for the beam to which she clung was dashed every moment against the rocks and the loss of a minute would have rendered her case hopeless.” “But—?”—asked Maria, eagerly. “But, how I cannot tell you—for I cannot now conceive how the foot or hand of man could scale the rocks that wall that channel—Fred Heneage rushed to the brink, threw himself over it, and the next instant we saw him struggling in those fearful eddies.” “And he saved her?” “He did, indeed, and most gallantly!” “How fine! how generous! how noble!”—exclaimed the spirited and artless girl—“God bless you for it, Mr. Heneage—God will bless you for it.” And she burst into a flood of passionate convulsive tears. But mastering herself in a moment, she wiped them away, and cried, with a lovely smile breaking through them, like a sunbeam through an April shower—“See, what a little fool I am. But beautiful things like this always make me cry—and this is too beautiful.” “It was beautiful, indeed,” said Forester, who was affected in spite of his half assumed levity.—“And he as nearly lost his life by it as possible—for when we got down to the water's edge, though he had steered the beam and the old dame into the shallows, where she was safe, he had himself sunk quite exhausted.” “And would inevitably have been drowned,” added Heneage, who had appeared very much embarrassed during the whole narration, “if it had not been for the courage of Frank Forester and Harry Archer, who, though they make such a stir about a little thing on the part of another, never say a word about themselves. They dived for me in the pool three or four times and at last brought me up, alive as you see.” “And kicking!”—added Forester. “It is of no use to try to make a hero of me in the business,” said Harry—“I alone, have no share in the glory. Frank would have been drowned too, if it had not been for Tom Draw, who is stronger than a hippopotamus and swims twice as well, and lugged us all out—but it was Frank, who saved Heneage.” “Of course I must be dragged before the world like a bull-dog!”—exclaimed Frank. “Like a what?” “Heavens! what a simile.” “Never mind the simile,” said Frank, whose end was gained, when the subject of the conversation was changed—“but for heaven's sake give me some coffee, for it is cold that makes me shake, I assure you, I was much too hard-hearted to be afraid for any body but myself, let alone a very ugly old woman. Do pray give me some coffee Mrs. D'Arcey, and then let me beat you at piquet.” “After that, I do not very well know what happened,” wrote Frank Forester, in after days, describing subsequent events to a friend in England, “but when I had lost about seven successive games, I thought the room was very quiet; and, looking up, I perceived that Julia D'Arcey had fallen fast asleep, while Harry was sketching terriers' heads with a pen and ink on sundry sheets of note paper; and that Maria was sitting in an arm-chair, with her eyes very bright, her cheeks and neck very rosy, and her manner very tremulous, conversing in a very low tone with Master Fred, who was leaning over her, as he stood by the mantelpiece, and who had already broken into the smallest conceivable pieces a superb Louis Quatorze fan, and strewed the carpet with the fragments. “Seeing how the cat jumped, though I was very tired of being repiqued and capotted, I went on playing, `like a bull-dog,' 'till at last by the grace of heaven! Julia awoke from her nap, and asked us to go in to supper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">L CHAPTER X. A PALAVER. Three weeks had passed instead of a few days, since the arrival of Fred Heneage at the Shooting Box. Yet he had shown no indication of getting tired of the monotony of the Warwick Woodlands. It could not have been the shooting altogether, which attracted him in the first instance, that now detained him; for, although he did occasionally don the shooting jacket, and do his devoir among the quail and woodcock, he more frequently suffered those indefatigable Nimrods, Harry and Frank, to fill the ample bag unaided, while smitten with an unusual taste for solitary rides, he would back Harry's bay Trojan and loiter away afternoon and afternoon, day after day, among the lone green lanes that intersect those lovely meads and woodlands. It was, however, a little singular, that though he ever set forth alone, he more than frequently rode homeward in company—and that in which ever direction his horse's head was turned at starting; it was invariably at `the Elms,' that he drew bridle. In one word Fred Heneage was as fairly caught, as ever was any son of Adam by a pair of bright eyes, a delicate wit, and a soft heart. “In short,” said Frank to Harry as they came home one night from the hell-hole swamp with eight and thirty couple of Fall cock, and a brace of very tired setters, “in short, it is devilish clear, that within a few weeks more or less, we shall see him dragged like a bull-dog, before the hymeneal altar. I only wish he could have `the Duke' to give her away. He has given away a dozen or two of American girls this season, besides all the Britishers.” “It is no joke, Frank,” said Harry seriously.—“It is, as you say, quite plain that there is a strong mutual liking, and my good old friend is, as plainly, well pleased with it—but I think there will be mischief yet!” “How so?”—said Frank. “If Theodore D'Arcey comes back from Chicago before it is all arranged—aye! and all concluded too! —mark my words, it will be broken off. Had he been at home, it would have been at an end long ago; or rather it never would have begun. I wish he would speak to me about it.” “Why don't you speak with him?” “To say the truth, I am shy of it. He never gives me a chance, but seems to avoid the subject. Has he ever hinted anything to you?” “Never a word?”—said Forester—“do you think he has fully made up his mind about it?” “He must, Frank. He is too honorable a fellow to have carried it so far, unless he had done so. She is as much in love as he is, that is clear. By Jove. I wish I could do something to bring it to a close one way or other.” “Give a pic-nic—I will take care of Julia.—Do you pin the old woman, and he is sure to propose. People always propose at pic-nics.” “Egad! you are right enough there, Master Frank; but as yet, I hardly think it would do.” “Then why bother your head about it? Let every man manage his own mare, as the Scotchman has it.” “I don't know,” answered Harry thoughtfully. “I don't know; but I hardly see how I can do otherwise. Yet, I confess, I am more anxious in this matter, than ever I was in all my life before. Fred Heneage is not a fellow to be affected lightly by this sort of thing; and if it should go wrong with him, it will make his whole life wretched; and she too, she is a girl I can almost fancy a man's going mad for.” “Do you know, Harry, I have often wondered, so much of your time as you pass with them, that you have never—” “Frank! don't, for God sake! you hurt me!”— said Archer, in an altered tone, with an indescribable expression crossing his face, and leaving him very pale. Forester looked at him steadily for a moment, in great wonder, and then, very much embarrassed and half stammering, replied, “I beg your pardon, my dear fellow. Upon my soul, I did not mean—” “I know you did not, old friend”—answered Harry, hastily, “and I am but a fool. But let us speak of Fred.” “Ah! well!” replied Forester, collecting his ideas a little. “But I cannot see what you should be so anxious about. If they want to be married, they will be married of course. There is nothing to hinder them.” “Her brother! Frank.” “What the deuce! can he do in the matter. Or if he could, why should he interfere?” “Fred is an Englishman.” “Pshaw! an Englishman of an excellent old family, of unblemished character, a steady fellow, with eight thousand a year in his own right, and one of the prettiest places in the West Riding! I never heard such stuff. As if he were not a match for any one in the world, let alone a little girl, with nothing under the sun but a very pretty face for her fortune.” “You do not know Theodore D'Arcey.” “No, God be praised for that same! But I have heard that he is a shrewd, clever, cunning man, with a sharp eye to the main chance. Now he must be none of this, but a fool or a madman, to refuse such an alliance for his sister.” “He is all that you have heard. Yet if he hear of their attachment in time, he will not only refuse but prevent it. He is a man, in my opinion, capable of anything that should not bring him into collision with the law.” “But why? men do not let their prejudices war with their interests; particularly such men as he. Why should he wish to hinder it.” “Because it is not for his interest that she should marry an English gentleman. To have her the wife of an American millionaire, a New York hunks of a merchant, who had made six millions in ship chandlery or the like, who spells soap `sope,' and on the strength of the spelling, or the money, is president of some grand literary institution—that indeed would strengthen his hand mightily! or, if not that, the wife, of some political roarer, some puller of the cabinet strings!—or even, in default of all, to have her Theodore D'Arcey's beautiful sister! any of these things would add something to his own self-importance. To see her the wife of an aristocrat on the contrary—a feudal tyrant and oppressor—would cast a doubt on his consistency with the choice spirits of ward meetings, and bar-caucuses, whose `most sweet voices' he aspires to gain.” “A pretty pup! indeed! you describe him. But if all this were true. He is not the girl's father. How can he hinder it?” “The house in which they live—all, with trifling exception, that they have to live upon—is his!” “And would he resort to such measures?” “I believe him capable of resorting to any.” “It has a bad look.” “It has indeed. And to add to all the rest, he hates me with a hatred so deadly and so overpowering that, L 2 had he no other cause than that hatred, and his knowledge that Fred and I are friends, he would move heaven and earth therefore to thwart him.” “It has a bad look, as I said before. But, I still think you must let them bide their time—you will only make a mess of it, if you stir prematurely.” “I believe you are right. But look there; by Jove! Fred, those dogs are making game—it must be quail running. We have got time yet before it grows dark to use up the bevy. Step up quickly, man, they are running fast, and will scarce lie hard in this stubble.” “Toho! there they are staunch,” answered Forester; and they moved forward quickly. “Take heed sir.—Have a care, Sancho!”—cried Archer, sternly; as the old red dog drew forward a few paces uneasily.” “Be sure that you mark the birds if any go to your right hand”—as he spoke a large bevy rose at long distance, and towering up high against the darkening sky, loomed larger than their real size, in the fast falling twilight. Archer, unlike his wont, fired the first; for they got up wild, and were flying fast, and wheeling round Frank to the right. Whether the darkness was the cause, or the rapidity of his aim, he missed his first barrel, but cut down a bird with the second, out of the middle of the bevy; two or three of the other birds cringing and lagging in their flight, as the shot rattled on their wings. Forester discharged both his barrels, killing two birds with the first, and making a clear miss with the second. “All's right”—cried Archer, as soon as the shots had ceased to re-echo from the woodlands. “They are all down in the bushes along the little stream yonder, and it is so late in the evening now, that they will begin calling directly and running together.—Hark! they are at it, already.” “We had better get round by the crossing pole,” said Frank, “they are all on the farther side, and then we shall have them, as they rise, against the bright western sky, instead of their flushing toward that big blue hill.” “Right for a thousand, Frank.—But pull foot, man alive, for it will be dark in half an hour.” Five minutes had not passed before they reached the crossing log, which spans the little brook; the dogs bounded over it as briskly as though they had not appeared, half an hour before, to be utterly fagged out and spiritless. Frank followed them across the rough hickory log, but Harry stood firm with his gun ready on the near side. And it was very well that he did so, for Forester had not taken three steps on the farther bank, before both the dogs stood stiff, and three birds rose out of a thorn bush on the stream's brink. Then it was that Frank's sportsmanlike instinct told. For compelled as they were to rise between the sportsman and the red gleam, which was fast dying out in the western horizon, the birds afforded him a fair mark, and he keeled a brace of them over neatly right and left, while Harry cut down the third as he crossed him a beautiful quick shot.—Just as he fired, a fourth bird flushed, just at his feet, on his own side of the stream, and flew down it, pointing rather toward the dark eastern hill, and skimming very low, close to the surface of the brown withered grass. The shades of night blended so completely the colors of the game with those of the sere herbage, that even the keen eye of Archer failed to discern its outline; yet, though almost despairing of getting a shot, he stood attentive and on the alert, with his thumb on the hammer of his gun, watching the bright surface of the stream, upon which all the light of the sky seemed to be concentrated, with a faint hope that the bird might cross it. He was just lowering his but hopelessly, when at some twenty yards aloof, he caught the dark outline of a wing whirring across the bright and silent mirror. His gun rose quick as thought to his shoulder, a bright ruddy flash gleamed on the dusky scene, and the shot pattered like a hail storm on the tranquil reach of the brook. “Did you kill him, Harry?” “I don't know.—It was guess work.—But I think I did—yes! I did—I hear him flapping on the water. Fetch him, good dog. I have got him, Frank, and my first and your second bird.—Go on, be quick.” In a minute more three more birds rose, and two flying up against the sky were killed instantly. The third, hovering low along the ground, got off without a shot. Then two or three stole away like the last, unseen and unshot at, and detected only by the quick whir of their wings; and Archer was in the act of saying, “Well, Frank, I believe we must give it up; it has grown too dark altogether—” When one of the dogs ran in upon the mass of the bevy, and flushed them all up, terrified and in great confusion. For one second only their outlines were drawn clearly against the last glimmer of the sunset; but in that second's space four barrels were discharged almost simultaneously, and several birds fell, undistinguishable in the gloom. Some time was spent in searching for the dead and wounded, but at last, by aid of the sagacity of the dogs, four birds were brought to bag, and satisfied that there could be no more, and that these last were the result of a marvellous lucky chance shot, they gave it up. “This is almost running the thing into the ground, Frank,” said Harry. “Yes, almost.—But it was a very pretty little rally, while it lasted. How many did we get in all.” “Let me see. Two at the first rise, then four, then two, and now to conclude four, by good luck.—Six brace in all.” “To be added to nineteen couple of cock—not a bad day's work.” And as he spoke they crossed the fence into the lane, and strode out homeward, at the rate of five miles the hour. They had not walked far on their way, before the sound of a horse at a gallop came rapidly down the road behind them. “That is Fred, for a thousand!—I know the long stroke of the thoroughbred, too well to be mistaken.” Nearer and nearer came the clanging stride, and now was close upon their heels. “What ho! lads, is that you,” cried a joyous voice. “Nobody else!”—cried Archer. “I thought so. I heard you cannonading a while since; and was pretty sure that no one else could be so insane as to shoot after what the good people call early candlelight. What were you shooting, owls or bats?” “Quail, Fred. We marked a bevy down by accident, and used them up—” “Considerably—as old Tom would say,” added Forester. “By accident too, I should think;” said Fred. “Pretty much so I believe.” “But what is old Chance at? He has something in his mouth.” “The deuce he has!—Chance, Chance. Come here good dog,” cried Harry. “By George! Forester, it is another quail. We must have knocked down five at that last volley, and this old villain has found it, and carried it all this way, good dog! good dog!— poor fellow, Chance! poor fellow.” “Has not he bitten it?” “Not so much as a feather ruffed.” “Look here,” said Heneage, “I will canter forward and tell them to have dinner ready. For I am hungry in the first place, and in the second I want to talk to you a little while after dinner Harry, and then I have some letters to write.” “Do so,” said Archer. “I am your man,” and as he set spurs to the thoroughbred and galloped homeward at a rattling pace, Harry turned round to Forester, and nodded his head saying, “Ah! that is well at last—he wants to speak to me hey?—He shall have a word or two of my mind I promise you. Look here, old fellow, after the wine is on the table make some excuse or other to leave us to ourselves for an hour or two. I don't think he will unburthen himself before you.” “Oh! never fear—never fear. I'll respect your mysteries,” answered Frank; “but come, come let us step out now, or we'll never get home.” In spite, however, of that ominous prediction, many minutes did not elapse before they reached the white gate of Harry's neat demesne; nor many more before the friends were seated at the table in the well-lighted dining room, enjoying a pottage de gibier à la Meg Merrilies. Before he sat down, however, Frank turned to Timothy and said “it is seven o'clock now, Tim, I wish you would desire Dick to saddle `Selim,' and have him at the door at half past eight.” “What the deuce now Frank?”—exclaimed Heneage. “I promised to go down and have a jaw, and blow a cloud with old Tom, this evening. But I will be back before ten o'clock. No more was said on that score for Harry understood at once, and gave due credit to Frank's tact, and Fred Heneage thought how opportune it was that, Forester should be going out that evening. For he had not the slightest suspicion of his own transparency and fancied, like many other very clever people, that because he had been woodcocking, as Harry called it, or poking his own head into a dark corner, nobody could see his tail. The dinner was as good as usual, and went off if possible, more gaily than its wont. The soup was succeeded by a matelotte of eels a la tartar, a rib of roast beef, a couple of woodduck, and quails boiled with celery sauce. The champagne was deliciously cold, and as lively as the humour of the guests, all of whom was somewhat extraordinarily merry. Fred Heneage well pleased at the prospects of his love affair; Harry delighted at the accomplishment of his prospects, and not unsatisfied with the prestige which a love match would give to his Shooting Box; and Forester enchanted at having some thing whereat to laugh in his sleeve, besides a good subject for malicious witticisms in futuro. After his second glass of Latour, however, with a sly wink at Harry he withdrew, and in a moment they heard the pebbles spurned up by the heels of his fleet horse. An hour or two had passed before he returned, and when he did so, it was with an eye very moist and waggish, a cheek very rosy, a voice somewhat thicker than common, and a footstep which strove to conceal the slightest degree conceivable of unsteadiness, under a double allowance of jauntiness and elasticity. Harry and Heneage had by this time withdrawn into the library; and the former was sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, inhaling the fumes of his favorite cheroot, with a face of most humorous satisfaction with himself and all the world beside; while his friend was busy at the writing table, with two or three sealed letters before him, the fruit of his earnest industry. “Halloa! Frank, the old story,” exclaimed Harry —“Potations pottle deep.—Hey? old cider sperrits, I suppose.” “With two lumps of loaf sugar, a nail's breadth of lemon peel, not a drop of acid, and the least thought of arrack—” “Without any water, Frank?” “With just as much water screeching hot, as there is sperrit,” replied Forester. “Good stuff for a fuddle, Frank?” asked Heneage, looking up from his writing, merrily. “Excellent good.” “How about gittin' sober on 't, little wax skin?” inquired Archer, with a ludicrous imitation of Tom Draw's tone and manner. “About that,” returned Frank, “I'll tell you more to-morrow morning. But what the deuce is all this about?” he added in his natural tone, working his way, tack and tack, up to the writing table, and taking up one of the sealed letters. “To Thomas Colley Grattan, Her Majesty's Consul, Boston.—To Richard Pakenham Esq., Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Washington— To Messrs. Baring, Brothers, London.—Why what the deuce is all this—are you a candidate for office.— Why the devil don't you write to his Grace the Duke of Wellington, he is the head of the department Mat—” “And thereupon”—said Forester, in the same letter which has been quoted before, “I found myself mounted by that great robust beast Archer, and kicked into the hall, without being allowed to finish my sentence. When I poked my head into the room, which I did not dare to do for about twenty minutes, they were both laughing heartily, and invited me to a picnic to come off in three days at the Greenwood lake.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. A PIC NIC. It was a beautiful mild mellow Indian summer morning; one of those soft sweet days, which, when cold winter is stealing on apace, come like the visit of an angel, between the first sharp hoar frosts, and the stern weather that so soon succeeds them, visiting the last flowers of autumn with more than the balminess of spring, clothing the woodlands in a robe of more than summer glory. The Greenwood lake—sweet lake, unsung by minstrel lyres, yet worthy as blue Winandermere to be the immortal dwelling-place of deathless poets—the Greenwood lake lay broad outstretched beneath the clear and cloudless sky, pure and unbroken as a Venetian mirror of the brightest steel, with all its forest shores gleaming aloft in the unnumbered hues and unrivalled radiance, which autumn nowhere sheds with a hand so lavish as in the wild woods of America, and sleeping below, reflected to the smallest leaf, in the calm surface of those unfathomed waters. The skies were full of a soft hazy yellow light, soft as the sunsets of a Claude; and the great sun, larger and rounder than his wont, as seen through the gauzy medium of that rich mellow atmosphere, careered along more beautiful, if less sublime, wooing the waning year, like Danae, in a flood of gold, than when he scorched her in her prime, like Semele, by the intolerable glory of his unclouded godhead. The air was breathless, yet so pure and fresh, that the briskest breeze that ever fanned the ocean, came not more gratefully to the cheek and brow, than that M delicious calm; in which the aspen leaves, alone, might be seen to quiver, while all the foliage else hung motionless and voiceless. A dozen or two of snow-white gulls, unwonted visitants to those inland waters, were fanning the air with their broad pinions, or swooping down upon their finny prey with the speed of lightning; while afar off on a tall leaflless tree, sat solitary and superb, a huge bald-headed eagle, looking down over his demesne of wood and water, an undisputed monarch. It was a lovely scene indeed, and one well chosen for a party, such as that which was now preparing to embark on its smooth waters. For with his usual knack of rendering every thing of natural beauty, that the country contained, in some sort subservient to his own pleasure, Harry had built and launched a pretty little schooner of some twenty tons upon that sequestered lake; and she was now lying with her white sails hanging motionless in the dead calm, along side of a small pier or jetty composed of unbarked trunks of cedar projecting from the sandy shore into the deep clear waters. A man and a boy both neatly dressed in blouses and trousers of white linen, with broad brimmed straw hats, were lounging about on the pier, whence Timothy had just departed in Tom Draw's large box wagon, laden with the materials for erecting a tent, and all the batterie de cuisine, with which he had been despatched from home on the previous evening. It was still very early in the morning, so early that the sun had scarcely arisen twice the breadth of his own disc above the eastern hill, when the roll of wheels and clattering of hoofs announced the arrival of the company, and in a moment afterward the shooting phaeton drawn by the two fast black cobs, wheeled round the last turn of the wooded lane, steered by the knowing finger of Harry himself, and freighted with Fred Heneage and the two girls; while close behind, under Frank Forester's somewhat rasher pilotage, the swift-footed chesnuts whirled along the light wagon, at a rate that was a little too much for Mrs. D'Arcey's nerves, although, to do her justice, she endured it with exemplary resignation. The boy Dick followed as best he might, at a long hand gallop, upon his master's bay thoroughbred, from which he sprang to the ground, touching his hat with one forefinger, as Harry pulled up his smoking cobs, on the smooth sand at the head of the lakelet. “Halloa! Teachman, how's this?” asked Harry of the boatman, before he had so much as risen from his seat, “are we going to have it dead calm all day long?” “No, Mr. Aircher, I guess not,” answered the stout retainer—“I reckon we shall have a breeze down here torights, when the sun gets a trifle higher. The air's been kind o' breezing, oncet and agin, on the hill-top yander, and I did think as how it was a goin' to blow very fresh. No, no, 'taint a goin' to be calm long here. See—there it comes now;” he added, as the woods on the summit of the hill began to tremble gently. Then, with a long heaving shudder of the many-colored foliage, the gust stole down the mountain slope, until wave after wave, the agitated tree tops swayed in successive undulations like the breast of the awakening ocean. Down it came, sweeping freshly over the deep green meadows, bending the twinkling grass and the gay wild flowers, and making the solitary trees in the hedgerows quiver and find a tongue. Then the white sails flapped loudly, and swung to and fro, and the long red cross pennant streamed out to its full length, and the brisk gale sang merrily among the cordage. In that one second's space, the whole scene was changed. The bosom of the bright lake, which lay but a minute since one great and lustrous mirror, was now all broken up into a thousand tiny wavelets—the rich gorgeous colors which slept there, distinct and palpable reflections of the autumnal trees, were all confused and scattered in the twinkling of an eye, though still as gay and glittering as ever; while on the top of every puny undulation, a mimic crest of spray flashed like ten thousand diamonds in the sunlight. “How beautiful! how beautiful!” exclaimed Maria D'Arcey, starting up with her hands clasped in ecstacy, and her fair face radiant with admiration and delight— “how very nice of you to think of bringing us hither, Mr. Archer. Oh! do look, do look, mamma—look, Julia, at that huge bird, how he sits on that bare branch motionless, and in defiance of the wind, while the whole tree rocks under him.” “You have a quick and observant eye, Maria,” said Archer; “that huge bird, as he sits upon yon quivering pinnacle, would be a subject for the pencil of Audubon, and your description would do well for the letter-press. Do you know what he is?” “Some bird of prey, I am sure. A fishing hawk, is he?” “He is your country's emblem, lady fair,” said Heneage, laughing, “or I am much mistaken, though I never saw one before.” “He is, indeed, a bald-headed eagle.” “I wish I were within rifle distance of him,” said Forester?” “You would not shoot the noble bird, Mr. Forester?” “Would I not?—I never killed an eagle yet!” “Nor a sheep, I fancy,” replied Archer; “and yet I do not suppose you have much desire to kill one.” “Do you mean to say that you would not shoot that fellow if you could?” “I don't know what I might do on the spur of the moment, I would not deliberately. And yet,” he added, “I should like to wing-tip the fellow. I would give a good deal to have a tame eagle. But come, we are losing time. Let us get the awning up, and help the ladies on board. Sit still for a few minutes, girls. Stand to the horses' heads, Dick. Now Jem, now Teachman, look alive. Yo-hoa! boys.” In less than five minutes, a pretty awning of blue and white canvass in broad stripes, was raised over the open space abaft the cabin, soft cushions were arranged on the seats, and a carpet spread on the floor of the cockpit. The tack of the mainsail was triced up, and the boom hauled up a little, so as to swing clear of the ridge of the awning. “Now step on board, if you please. Help Mrs. D'Arcey, Frank. Jump on the gunwale, Maria, give me your hand; that's it. Welcome on board `the Princess Royal.' Now, Teachman, you must help Dick to take the horses back to the tavern. We will push off, and get her under way without you, and then lay to. You can paddle out to us in the bark canoe.” “Are the rifles on board, Teachman?” asked Forester. “Is there anything to eat or drink?” enquired Heneage. “To be sure there is,” answered Maria, “can you suspect Mr. Archer of such ungallantry as an intention to starve us.” Oh no, sister, he does not care in the least about us; he is only thinking of champagne punch or something of the kind. Don't you think so Mr. Forester?” “I think you cannot help being ungrateful, because it is the nature of womankind to be so,” answered Forester. “That is not answering my question.” “Well then, no. That is answering it. I think all he had in his mind was ministering to the voracious appetites of those most voracious of all earthly—I beg their pardon—heavenly beings commonly called fine ladies. Will that suit you?” M 2 No it will not, you atrocious wretched creature,” cried Maria. “Then I think all that you have left in his head, is a desire to attend to the smallest comfort of one fair lady in particular.” And he accompanied his words with a glance so humorous and meaning, that while her sister laughed merrily, Maria turned away conscious that her cheeks were burning far too brightly to endure observation. Meanwhile all were on board, the moorings were cast off, sail after sail was trimmed, and within fewer minutes than it has occupied to describe it, the gay pleasure boat was dancing away from the shore over the sunlit waters, dashing the foam with merry music from her sharp bows, and leaving a long wake of froth behind her. The merry breeze sang in her vocal riggings, and blew out the white ensign of old England at the peak, and the long red cross pennant at her main, twinkling and flashing in the lustrous air like a forked tongue of pure flame. Away they dashed past wood-crowned isle, and rocky headland, with the white gulls swooping and soaring round them, no fairer and scarce fleeter—now scaring the woodduck or the green-winged teal from some reedy shoal beneath some islet's lea, now catching a glimpse of some shy deer, which had come down the winding path under the dark green hemlock, and through the crimson-spired sassafrass, to drink of those crystal waters. The time itself was so joyous, and so delicious all the influences of the brisk mountain air, the gorgeous sunlight, the blue ripples of the lake, and the redundant foliage of the many-colored forest, that had they been careworn and melancholy voyagers, their spirits must have been raised and enkindled by the mere accidents of nature. But as it was with minds all harmonized in their general tastes, all ready to be pleased themselves, and eager each to please the other, words cannot describe the mingled tones of sentiment and mirth, of deepest feeling and of reckless gaiety, which pervaded that happy party. Ere long the little bark swept up abreast of the tall thunder-splintered tree, upon the highest pinnacle of which the great bald eagle still sat sublime and fearless. His airy perch wavered at times so much, and bent so suddenly before the breeze, that it was difficult to believe it possible that he should long hold fast to that wind-rocked station. But never for one moment did the royal bird relax the strong grasp of his iron talons, or cease to gaze about him with a clear undaunted eye. Once or twice only, when the breeze blew most sturdily, he spread his wide vans abroad, and clapped them over his back, with a wild thrilling cry, as if he would have dared the storm. The swift pleasure boat was gliding now within fifty yards of the point of the rocky headland, whereon the tall tree grew, which had served him for his daily perch beyond the memory of man, perchance before the time, if all that is surmised of the extended age of this king of birds be true, when any white men trod the shores of America. Still he sat there serene and fearless, gazing down with far less of anxiety upon the merry group which passed along beneath his eyry, than they displayed as they looked wistfully on him, with eager eyes and throbbing bosoms. “How beautiful he is,” said Julia—“I fancy I can read in the yellow glare of his fixed eye, which I can see even hence, the fearlessness and pride of his wild nature.” “See! see!” cried Maria—“see how he claps his great wings; I wish I could see him take flight.—Shout at him, Mr. Archer—can not you scare him from his perch?” “I will try,” said Harry, “but he seems very bold. Give us a screech, lads, join in chorus!” And as he spoke, he raised his voice in a long wild hunting halloa, in which he was joined by Forester and Heneage, protracting the shrill cadence until the opposite hill sent back the cry from every rock and salient knoll in strangely blended echo. The wild bird spread his wings, gathered his mighty talons lazily under him, and fanned the air for it might be twenty seconds, poising himself right above the bare white pinnacle upon which he had been sitting. And they could see him bend his neck and turn his strong beak downward to gaze upon them, as if wondering what could be the intention of that unwonted clamor. But as the long whoop died away, and the tumultuous answer of the mountains faded out, fainter and fainter, and heard at longer intervals, as they receded into the far distance, the distrust of the eagle seemed to pass away likewise; and, as the wonted silence resumed its reign over the lonely lake, he folded his broad vans, and dropping his yellow legs, resumed his seat as calmly as if he had never been disturbed. During this little incident Forester, who was at the helm, had shifted it a little so as to make the boat lose her way, and remain for a few seconds nearly motionless. But as the bird settled down again upon his perch so boldly, he shouted, “By Jove! that is too impudent. He shall get out of that, or my name is not Frank Forester. Here, lay hold of the tiller Heneage.” And without uttering another word, or even waiting until his friend had relieved him at the helm he sprang forward, passed the ladies, and jumping lightly on the half deck caught up a rifle, which lay secured in beckets near the bows, and raising it to his eye took a long and deliberate aim. “Oh! don't, don't Mr. Forester,” cried Maria, bending forward her beautiful face growing pale as death, with her hands clasped together.—“Don't hurt that noble bird, I beseech you.” “You need not be afraid, Maria, he cannot hit him even by accident.” Frank drew the trigger, and as the piece flashed, cried aloud, “Nor would if I could, I only shot at the tree!” “And a capital shot too,” exclaimed Archer, as a piece of bark was stripped from the white limb not three inches below the eagle's perch, and whirled away by the wind. Even at this provocation the haughty bird appeared to be either too lazy or too bold to make a rapid or undignified retreat, but uttering the shrill clanging note of defiance, once more unfolded his dark pinions, and sailed away slowly for a few fathoms, when quickening his flight a little, he began to scale the upper air in a series of easy and graceful circles. But at the very moment when the bird took wing, while every eye was rivetted on the tree-top, to mark the effects of Forester's shot; while Heneage himself, whose hand had scarce yet grasped the tiller, was gazing upward, careless of his trust, a sudden flaw rushed down a gorge in the mountain side, and struck full upon the sails as the boat lay with her broadside shoreward. It was a sharp and sudden gust, and so vehemently did it fill the closely trimmed sails, that it careened her dangerously, and drove her so forcibly through the water, that the ripples burst over the gunwale, and overflowed the washboards. As she turned over almost on her beam-ends, Frank, who was standing carelessly forward with his rifle in his hand, was pitched clean overboard to leeward, and plunged with a heavy splash into the deep lake. “Her helm! her helm!” cried Harry, leaping impetuously aft. “For God's sake! mind her helm. Let every thing fly fore and aft! up with her—up with her—into the wind's eye!” There was a moment of real danger; and although it was but a moment—for the sheets were eased off in a second, and the lively boat came up to the wind, and all was safe in less than ten seconds after the flaw struck her—that moment was enough to distract the attention of every person from Forester, who, embarrassed by his clothes, and hampered by the heavy rifle of which he kept firm hold, had failed, though a light and powerful swimmer, to catch the channels of the boat as she went about. The eye of every person, except Maria D'Arcey, who, in that moment of real danger which had blanched the cheeks and closed the eye-lids of all on board, except those who were too busy to give fear a thought, had retained all her calm and feminine presence of mind. Seeing what had escaped the notice of the others, she had leaned over the quarter of the boat as it swept past Forester, sputtering and blowing the water from his mouth, and making violent efforts to reach her, and cast the end of a long scarf which she wore, of strong rich brocade, with so much coolness and adroitness, that it fell into his hand. With a gay smile and nod, even amid his own danger, he clutched it, seeing, for he too was perfectly unflurried, that the risk to the boat had already passed over; and was wondering whether she would have strength to hold on to it, against the force of the little sea which the flaw had knocked up, when to his great surprise and admiration, she cast the other end of it twice round a belaying-pin in the stern-sheets, and made it firm in a second. Another moment, and the flaw had died out, and the little vessel was rocking on the squabbling waters, becalmed and motionless, in a small land-locked bight. Just at this moment Harry missed him, and as he cried aloud, “Good God! where is Frank?”—that worthy made his appearance, scrambling over the taffrail with the long rifle still grasped in his right hand. “Here I am, Harry,” he replied, laughing, “small thanks to you for that same!” “And no thanks to you, Frank, that we are not all at the bottom of the lake!” answered Harry, laughing. “But, how the deuce did you get out?” “By nothing but Miss D'Arcey's fearlessness and ready wit!” said Forester. But words had been spoken in her ear of approbation dearer far to her than those, while the attention of the others was distracted by the re-appearance of Forester; for in the energy and excitement of the moment, Fred Heneage caught her hand, and whispered something in vehement low tones, which made her cheek turn crimson, but with no painful emotion, if one might judge from the quick glance of intelligence that was exchanged between them. Just at that moment her mother turned her head, saw what was passing, and looked away again with a half pleased, half melancholy smile. Then as she raised her eyes, she met Archer's penetrating glance, reading her mind as it were, and changing, as he felt himself caught in the fact, into a cheery, joyous look, which assured her that the thoughts of each were dwelling on the same subject. That interchange of glances, that bye-play of a moment, between those four persons, established instantly a sort of free-masonry between the parties, and it might be said that the object of the pic nic was attained. By this time Teachman had come up, paddling rapidly in the bark canoe, and with his aid, the sailing boat was speedily got out of the little cove, and stood across the lake until they reached the fishing ground or sunken island. Then they heaved their grapnels overboard, and while Frank retired into the little cabin to array himself in dry apparel, the others set to work in earnest fishing; and between laughing and chatting, and baiting the ladies' hooks, and pulling up every two or three minutes a fine broad backed yellow bass, or big sharp finned perch, the morning passed away rapidly, until at a little after two o'clock, Timothy's clearly blown keybugle was heard from the small bay wherein he had established his menage, pealing out with the well-known cadences of “Oh! the roast beef of old England!” “There goes our dinner-bell,” cried Harry, “stand by to heave in the grapnel. We must disturb you I fear, fair lady, and you Master Fred,” he added, stepping forward to the bows where the couple had been sitting apart under the shade of the foresail for the last hour; Teachman and the boy being moored in the bark canoe a hundred yards astern, catching more fish than the whole party. Maria started at his voice, and looked a little guilty; and then in an effort to cover her confusion, pulled up her line suddenly, which had been dangling in the water at its own sweet will, and which, when pulled up, proved baitless. Harry bit his lip, to restrain a laugh; and then pretending not to notice her embarrassment, crossed the bows toward Fred, saying, “Well, old fellow, what sport?” “Not much, Harry. In fact none—I have not had a bite.” To demonstrate which fact, incontinently he hauled in his line, which came up tight, and not without strong resistance, and lo! at the end of it, the finest fish that had been taken yet, an eight pound pickerel, which would not have been brought in so easily, had it not nearly drowned itself already by its unheeded struggles to escape from the stout drop-line. This was too much, and Harry burst into a loud laugh, for which Fred Heneage rewarded him by a sharp punch in the ribs, and a general burst of mirth followed; for those who did not know the joke laughed loud to make the others believe that they did, while those who did, laughed louder yet to prove that their “withers were unwrung.” Meanwhile the boat was under way, and they soon reached the sylvan nook, chosen by Harry's taste, many a day before, where Timothy had pitched their tent. It was a little bay with a white gravel beach, and a smooth slope of greensward bisected by a dancing rill, which fell down in the back-ground from a slaty rock in a beautiful and romantic waterfall. The narrow amphitheatre was girdled by dark hemlocks and rich feathery junipers, and over-canopied by an immemorial oak, under the shade of which the marquee was pitched, and the board spread with every dainty that the wood, the wild, the water could yield to Tim's cuisine, with wines from the sunny south, and fruits from the islands of the western sea, and every thing that would be least expected at such a sylvan meal. Light hearts make very moderate wit pleasant; and loving ones can find deep sentiment in common places, and poetry in running brooks, and much soft meaning in the rustle of the leaves, which to duller souls, unsharpened by the great magician's whet-stone, are mute things and voiceless. But there was much true wit, much real poetry of thought and words, much powerful and earnest though unstudied eloquence, brought out at that happy meal. For there were clear heads there and powerful intellects, if for the most part they displayed it not in the ordinary routine of society; and cultivated spirits and kind tender hearts. That merry meal went off, as all pleasure parties N should, and as so few do really go off, most merrily, and long left gay and happy memories in the hearts of all present. After the board was cleared, and the moderate cups sipped, they strolled forth, two and two, through the wild lovely wood-walks, so narrow that one pair only could walk abreast, to visit the well-head of the stream, on the bank of which they had feasted. And Forester, securing Julia's arm as if accidentally, while Harry gave his to the elder lady, Fred was enabled to monopolize his lady-love, and linger in the near, whispering those soft nothings, which are so dear to lovers, so dull to all the world beside. What Forester was about with his fair one the chronicler hath not recorded; but, from the constant bursts of artless laughter which rang from the generally quiet sister's lips, it would seem that he was as profuse of merry, as was his friend of soft, nonsense. Archer meanwhile, and mamma, conversed long, earnestly, and evidently with deep and serious interest; and at last the lady replied to some words which he spoke so low as to be inaudible except to herself only, “I promise you—I promise you. Indeed, if she wish it, it shall be so. Why should you doubt it? I have no desire but for her happiness. If she say yes, it shall be so.” “And soon?” asked Harry. “And soon,” she replied, “though I do not see why you should be in such a hurry.” “Oh! my dear madam,” he replied, laughing, “you know I cannot have my Shooting Box degraded, for whole weeks together, into a nursery for tame lovers! Besides,” he added, more seriously, “I think when such things are to be done at all, they were best done, like all other terrible things, quickly.” “I believe you are right, Mr. Archer. It shall be as soon as they please.” “You promise me that?” “I do.” “Honor bright! Remember, I may claim your promise in a way you dream not of,” he answered. “Claim it, as you will; it is a promise, with that one proviso.” “Oh! that, my dear lady, is a proviso no longer. She has said `yes,' I am certain, half an hour ago. Look there, if you please.” And with the word, he pointed through a little opening in the trees, commanding a turn of the winding path, about fifty yards behind, and as many feet below them, along which Heneage was sauntering slowly with Maria, his arm encircling her slender waist, and her eyes upturned to her lover's face, with all the beautiful confidence of a pure youthful heart. No more was said then, and the homeward drive through the beautiful autumnal woods by moonlight, was very silent; for no one felt inclined to break in by words upon the calm and thoughtful happiness which had succeeded to the day's lightsome merriment. But when the ladies had been set down at the Elms, and when the friends alighted from the wagon, at the door of the Shooting Box, Heneage grasped both the hands of Archer in his own, and said, in a tone somewhat husky with emotion, “God bless you, Harry, you are the best, and I am the happiest fellow living.” “I trust you may be so. Heaven grant it,” replied Archer, solemnly, and something like a tear, unwonted and unbidden guest, twinkled a moment on his eye-lash. “And now, mark me; that you may be so, act quickly. Maria has said yes, mamma has consented, yet—mark my words, if Theodore return before you two are one, there will be a row yet.” “Good Harry, `I lack no spur To prick the sides of my intent.”' “See then,” said Archer, laughing, “see then, old friend, that you `Live not a coward in your own esteem, Letting I dare not wait upon I would, Like the poor cat i' the adage.' But come, we can't stand here all night; and here comes Forester. Let us go in. I see there is a good fire burning in the library; and if I do not broach the choicest batch of Burgundy to-night on this side the Atlantic, then call me a false fellow, and no true Etonian.” “Hurrah!” responded Frank, pulling up the one horse wagon at the door, at the same moment— “Hurrah! Eton against the world, fellows. Floreat Etona!” “We will have that anon, and two or three other toasts I wot of, in some nuits Richelieu, such as the stern old cardinal would have pardoned Cinq Mars but to taste. Come in, boys. Take some rum, Timothy, and make yourselves a bowl of punch; we'll make a night of it to-night, if we never make another in my Shooting Box.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. A ROW. A week had crept away, and yet another was fast drawing to its close. How happily the weeks run on to those who trace their flight by hours of love and hope. All was arranged, all finally determined. The wedding day was named, the wedding dress was sent home, the wedding guests were bidden. Fred Heneage was full of happiness, too deep for words, revealing itself only in his unusual quietness of manner; Frank Forester was full of fun, evincing itself in the wildest jests, the maddest pranks conceivable. But Harry Archer was full of uneasiness. He was restless, excited, anxious; for ever counselling haste; and as unlike as possible to the calm impassive immovable man of deliberate and thoughtful action, that he was in his ordinary mood. Suddenly a new fancy or freak appeared to strike him, and after seizing Heneage one morning and almost compelling him to draw a thousand dollars from his agent in the city, he drove off with Timothy in the one horse wagon, and did not return until late at night, bringing home with him a new team of four powerful and wiry horses in prime condition, high steppers and fast travellers, though all of different colors, for one was a blue roan, one almost white, a third blood bay, and a bright chesnut to make up the tale. On no persuasion from his comrades would he explain his object in buying four new horses, having enough already; nor even to Frank Forester would he N 2 unburthen any part of his mind, merely saying with a forced laugh that “Good horses were a good investment.” Meanwhile the new comers were installed in the barn, and exercised together either by Timothy or Archer in person, until they went almost as kindly, and quite as fast as Harry's favorite team. The wit, however, of the Warwick saddlers was sorely taxed to turn out a set of four horse harness in double quick time; and the shooting drag was sent down to the blacksmith shop, the wheels new tired, the braces reinforced, and the whole machine thoroughly overhauled, and ready for emergency. Thus things went on, Frank laughing at Archer's serious mood, and Heneage too much occupied to perceive it, until the middle of the week preceding the appointed day. It might have been perhaps ten o'clock in the evening; the drawing room at the Elms was lighted only by the faint glimmer of a few dying brands, and by the uncertain moonbeams, which made their way through the white muslin curtains. And in that soft and pleasant light, half darkness and half glimmer, two persons sat alone on a broad settee in the embrasure of one of the deep windows. Fred Heneage and Maria D'Arcey. One of her beautiful white hands was clasped in his, and her fair head, with all its wealth of auburn curls scattered in bright disorder, rested upon his shoulder. They had sat thus for above an hour, scarce speaking at long intervals a few low whispered words, for their hearts were too full and too happy to find vent in speech. Silence was more congenial to their spirits, and each perhaps interpreted that silence, as clearly and correctly as if it had been the most glowing eloquence. Suddenly a dark shadow fell across them, as they sat in the moonbeams, projected from a figure, which passed rapidly athwart the window. Another moment and Theodore D'Arcey stood before them. A faint scream burst from Maria's lips, as she started from her lover's side; but trying to conceal her alarm, she said instantly, “Oh brother, how you frightened me!” “No doubt!” he answered, with a sarcastic sneer.— “People are mostly frightened, when they feel guilty, when they are caught deceiving.” “But in the present instance neither of these cases happen to apply,” said Heneage, rising and advancing cordially to meet him. “But since the suddenness of your arrival has quite startled your sister, allow me to make myself known to you. I am called Frederic Heneage—” “An Englishman sir!” D'Arcey interrupted him rudely. “Yes, Mr. D'Arcey, an Englishman,” replied Heneage, struggling hard to retain his composure before the insulting manner of the other. “I think, however, that by the suddenness of your arrival you must have missed the letters which I had the honor to forward to you, some days since, under Mrs. D'Arcey's enclosure, to Chicago. If such be the case, to prevent farther mistakes, perhaps you will favor me by going with me to find that lady who—” “As such is the case precisely,” returned Theodore D'Arcey in the most insulting manner possible, “to prevent farther mistakes, perhaps you will favor me by walking out of that door, Mr. Englishman, unless you prefer making a speedier exit by that window.” “Being in Mrs. D'Arcey's house, sir, by Mrs. D'Arcey's invitation, and with her full consent in a few days to call her daughter my wife, I shall undoubtedly not leave the house unless at her bidding.” “You will not leave it.” “Certainly not.” “Then by G—! I will throw you out of it.” He made a step toward Fred Heneage with his hand uplifted; and dark though it was, Maria could see her lover's face, even to his lips, turn ashy white, and his frame tremble with suppressed indignation. Then all the courage of her bright and artless character flashed out at once; and in a moment she stood between them beautiful, and severe in feminine authority. “Peace!” she said—“oh peace, Theodore—for shame, if not for fear—” “Fear!” he exclaimed almost fiercely—“I, and fear?” “Yes fear!” she answered—“fear of dishonoring you mother's house, of outraging your sister's feelings, of disgracing yourself, not him, not him—him you cannot disgrace—by this unseemly and unmanly violence.” “Ha! and pray what is he to you, that you should thus defend him—” “Defend him, I?” she answered, looking at him with a severe and fearless scorn. “Perhaps it may be well for you, that I am here to defend you?” “What is he to you, I say—what is he to you, minion?”—repeated Theodore more fiercely than before. “My promised husband!”—said the fair girl firmly, passing her arm through that of Heneage, as she spoke, “my mother gave me to him. I do not think there is any one, who dares try to sever us.” “Do you not? do you not, indeed?—Dare, too! much daring, I trow, in rescuing a sister from an English adventurer—perhaps,” he added with a fell scowl, “an English impostor. Let go his arm, this instant, or I will tear you from the scoundrel.” And emboldened by the composure and peacefulness of Fred's manner, he advanced, as if to seize her. But as he did so, casting his left arm about Maria's person, and making a half stride forward so as to bring himself between them, Heneage said slowly in those deep calm impressive tones, which, when adopted by passionate and fiery persons, betoken an earnestness of wrath and purpose more formidable than the most heady impulse, “I have borne, Mr. D'Arcey, with much insolence— I would bear with much more at your hands, hoping that better reason, if not better feeling, may come to the aid of one, whom I would fain conciliate, whom I hope one day to call, to esteem a brother—but by the God! who made us both, if you lay but one finger insolently on this lady, and I leave you but one bone unbroken, my name is not Frederic Heneage. And you shall call me, at your will, adventurer, impostor or—” “Did I not tell you so?” cried the fair girl, raising her head proudly, and gazing from the shrinking figure of her brother, to the fine form and noble features of her lover, “oh! Theodore, dear Theodore,” she added, changing her tone to one of infinite and most caressing sweetness, “cast this false pride away from you, give him your hand, ask his forgiveness for your mad humor—he will accept it—he will receive you yet as a brother; will you not Frederic?” But before either of the young men had time to answer, Mrs. D'Arcey anxious and much alarmed, but still dignified and wearing at least a calm exterior stood before them. “So madam mother!” exclaimed Theodore—“so this is your precious doing?” “Oh mother! mother!” exclaimed poor Maria, deserted now by all the pride that had sustained her— “save me! save us! Tell him you gave me to him! Tell him, that I shall be his wife!” “It is so, Theodore. Whatever come of it to me, she is his! I gave her to him, she shall be his wife!” “Dare you to brave me? Then I say she shall not— by G—! she shall not!” “My word is pledged, Theodore! dishonor yourself not, nor my gray hairs by this fruitless strife. I say she shall be his; and who shall judge between a mother and her child!” “Do you hear?—do you hear, Fred?” murmured the lovely girl, “dear, good, kind mother!”—and she half fainted as she spoke on that maternal breast, which had soothed her so often and so tenderly, yet never in so strange a crisis, of hope, fear, joy, and sorrow. “Now, sir,” said Theodore, once more advancing toward him—“there are no women now to part us.— Will you leave this house, or will you force me to compel you.” “At Mrs. D'Arcey's bidding—at yours never!” “Then, Frederic, I do bid you. My heart bleeds to do so”—said the venerable lady—“but to preserve peace here, and to preserve that ill-minded boy from the chastisement, he merits, I do bid you, leave us! But fear nothing—you shall hear from me—Maria shall be yours!” “I go!”—said Heneage calmly, taking up his hat— “you are quite right and wise, as ever. I go. Good night—Heaven be about you, Maria; we shall meet soon!” “Never!” shouted Theodore D'Arcey—“never, if this hand have to do butcher's work on you.” Heneage smiled on him with ineffable contempt, and howing to the ladies, repeated the words he had used before, “We shall meet again, soon, my own Maria.” And she raised her head from her mother's bosom, and made answer firmly. “When you will—where you will—how you will, Frederic Heneage. Shall I not, mother?” “I never broke a promise in my life,” replied Mrs. D'Arcey firmly, “nor will I do so now, cost me what grief it may, or suffering, or sorrow.”—When you will, Frederic Heneage, and where you will, except here, she shall meet you. This is my son's house, to my grief and shame I say it—to-morrow I will seek a place, where I may see my friends free and uninsulted. Till then, good night, and God bless you.” Heneage turned instantly to leave the room, but Theodore stood between him and the door, and squared himself as if to bar the passage, using the most insulting terms, and seeking to provoke a conflict. “The time may come when you shall rue this conduct, but not now, nor here! Pardon me, Mrs. D'Arcey,” he added, “I do this, but to escape a discreditable brawl.” And throwing the latticed window open, as he spoke, he sprang over the low sill, waved his hand to his mistress, and crossing the moonlit garden leaped the fence into the high road, and was lost in the darkness. “Noble, indeed!”—said the mother, as he departed —“a noble heart you have won, my own Maria. Make way, sir,” she added turning to her son, “make way—we leave you to your own evil thoughts!” And without farther notice, they passed out, and left him there baffled, and almost foaming at the mouth, in impotent malicious fury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. A RUSE. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed, after the sudden exit of Fred Heneage from the window of the Elms, before he rushed up the steps of the Shooting Box, although they were nearly two miles apart, and entered the library, wherein Harry and Frank Forester were sitting, engaged in a game of chess, with a bottle of claret and a pair of half pint goblets at their elbow. He was as pale as death, brow, cheek and lip; but on his forehead the big sweat drops stood `like bubbles on a late perturbed stream,' and his whole frame shook violently with the effects of the great anger he had so manfully controlled. “Great God! Fred!”—exclaimed Archer—“It is as I expected. Theodore D'Arcey has returned!” “He has!” replied Heneage, throwing himself into a chair, and covering his face with his hands. Archer rose from his seat, and walked up and down the room hastily for several minutes, before he spoke a word; then stopping short, he poured out a full glass of claret, swallowed it at a mouthful, and, resuming his seat, said in a quiet though anxious voice, “Tell us all, Fred, that we may know what to advise.” “I never thought to bear as much from any living man, as I have borne this night,” said Heneage gloomily, “I hardly know if, in honor, I can bear it.” “Did he strike you?” “Strike me! what do you think of me, Archer? Strike me! no man strikes me, and lives one hour to tell of it! no, God be praised! he did not strike me— but that is all that he did not.” “Well, tell us, Fred. Do not be excited, but tell us all. We will have you righted, be things as they may.” Quietly and deliberately he now related every thing that had passed, omitting not one word, extenuating nought, nor setting down anything in malice, while, breathless in surprise and anxious interest, Harry and Forester sat listening. When he had finished his narration, he raised his eye to Archer's face, and asked quietly, “Have I done well? Is all lost?” “Impossible to have done better. I only wonder how you could have borne it. I only wish that I could be sure of acting as you have acted, in the like emergency. Lost! no, by George! all is won, if you will but do as I would have you!” “How would you have me do?” “Run away with her. There is nothing else for it.” “I do not think she will consent to it.” “Yes! she will, with her mother's consent—I can get that. In the first place, it is the only way to escape a scandal, and a fracas. In the second, he may, I fancy, give you some trouble legally, for she is not of age; and he is, I believe, a trustee or guardian, or some such thing, of some property that will be hers.” “Damn the property!” “Yes! damn the property as much as you please, but do not damn your chance of getting Maria!” replied Archer, coolly. “In the third place, it is his game to force you into a personal row, perhaps into a duel, which would destroy your chance for ever.” “What is your plan, then?” “I foresaw all this. That is the reason of my buying those new horses. Now we will send Timothy down the road with the new team to young Tom's, in O the valley of the Ramapo, over the mountain, and I will make old Tom Draw drive my old team down to Hackensack, and leave me his big roan and the gray colt. These, with a pair of leaders which I will get of Bill Welling, the stage-driver, will carry us over the Long Pond mountain to our first change, as well as the lighter and faster horses; and if we can get so far unpursued, we can reach New York easily enough, and get the business done in ten minutes.” “But if we should be pursued!” “If we should, we cannot at least be overtaken before we have got our first relay in the traces—for I would not allow him to stop me in the road; and even if he should come up with us at Tom's, why I will stop him there, if I have to thrash him to his heart's content. But he cannot overtake us, if we manage matters well, until we reach Hackensack—and I think he eannot even then.” “But if he should?” “If he should?—Why then we shall have old Tom there!” “Old Tom! and what in heaven's name, has old Tom got to do with it?” “Tom is very fond of Theodore!” answered Harry. “Yes!” interposed Frank Forester, “Tom does set great store by him. Tom's your man in that matter.” “How so?” “A little ruse, Fred! nothing more, upon my honor! It has just come into my mind, and must succeed. But it will be the better way, that you should know nothing about it.” “I do not see! no, no. It will never do. I will stay here. I will go to his house to-morrow, and claim her openly, and bring her away, in spite of him.” “And then he will strike you, or spit upon you,” replied Archer, “in fact, force you to fight him, and you will—” “Shoot him, as I would a mad dog!” “It would serve him very rightly, I confess. But, except in Ireland, shooting her brother is not exactly the way to woo a sister. Here it would, of course, lose her to you, for ever. No, no. Be calm; listen to me. I will pledge my existence, if you will be quiet, that all shall go rightly.” “Yes! yes! old fellow!” said Forester; “leave it to us. Harry shall have a quiet palaver with the old lady to-morrow; and she will settle every thing. Old Tom shall be down at Hackensack, with a trap for the lawyer ready set. I partly guess what Harry would be at. We will have such a glorious gallop through the old woods, as never was recorded yet in the Spirit; Dick shall precede us on bay Trojan, to have the relays ready; and I will ride behind you upon Selim, with the marking irons; and egad! if there's any shooting to be done, I'll have a crack at the son of a gun myself. I owe him two or three.” “Yes, do, Fred Heneage, do be ruled,” said Archer, “only put yourself entirely under my guidance, avoid that scamp, and stay quietly at home for two days, and I will pledge you my honor, she shall be your wife before the third evening. Did I ever deceive you, Fred?” “Never, old fellow. I will do it! Upon my word I will. I put myself into your charge solely.” “Run out, Frank, run quickly. Have Lucifer put to the light wagon, and fetch Tom hither instantly; take no excuse, but bring him!” “Consider him brought!” said Frank, leaving the room without a moment's hesitation. “Ring the bell, Fred. Hand me that note paper, and the pen and ink. Aye! that is it?” By the time he had got the writing materials, Tim Matlock made his appearance. “Is black Joe about Tim?” asked his master. “Ay, reckon he's i' t' hayloft, Measter Archer. He was in here a piece sin, for a drink o' t' whiskey, and then he said 'at he was varry sleepy, and he's been gane an hour or better.” “Can you find him?” “Ay'se oophaud it.” “Away with you, then. Stay, Mr. Draw is coming to supper; order a broiled bone and some fried oysters instantly.” “Aye, aye, sur.” The note completed, which Harry would not suffer Fred so much as to see, the black genius, whom Archer had described as never sleeping in a bed, or pulling off his clothes, from one year's end to the other, made his appearance, grinning from ear to ear, and pulling his woolly forelock with a hand as big as Goliah's. “The whiskey, Timothy.” The flask was at his hand in a moment. “Now, look here, Joe, if you answer me five questions straight, without boggling or dodging, a tumbler full of this. And if you do what I tell you cleanly, and without a blunder, five dollars!—Will you do it?” “Try to, Masser Harry?” “Who are you sparking now, Joe?” “Golly, Mass—” the negro burst out with a horse laugh, but mindful of the whiskey, checked himself instantly, and after a strange convulsive explosion, in which he stifled his risibility, he replied, “Missie D'Arcey' Phillis, now, Masser Harry.” “I thought so,” replied Harry, with a nod of self-approbation; “and when can you see Phillis, Joe?” “Mose any time, Masser Harry.” “To-night?” “I guess so, Masser Harry.” “Does Phillis like young Mr. D'Arcey.” “She hate him wuss nor pison. Why Gor-a-massy, all e niggar hate him, 'cause he never 'spectful nohow!” “Exactly. Then, go and find her, and if you let any one see or hear you, 'specially Mr. D'Arcey, do you understand me?—I'll be the death of you.” “Understand berry well, Masser Harry.” “Give her this letter, and tell her if she will give it to Mrs. D'Arcey to-night, without letting any soul find it out, I will send a new yaller calicker, and a five dollar bill.” “I'll do't, Masser Harry.” “How can you at this time of night?” asked Heneage, doubtfully. “Nigga whistle, Masser Heneage, Phillis come amose any time.” “That's it,” said Harry, “bolt your whiskey—cut your stick. Here comes fat Tom.” And with the word, in came fat Tom, amazed at the tale which Forester had partially revealed, but full of glee and promise.” “Well done, boy!” he exclaimed, “she's the all-fired prettiest gal in old Orange, and the finest any how. I'll fix that, Harry. Jest as you reckoned—I'll fix that down to Hackensack. He didn't say I parjured myself in court at Goshen, for nauthen. I'll fix him, or my name arn't Tom Draw. You shall have her, Fred. You shall have her, boy. But I'm as hungry as h—now. Where's supper, Timothy?” And with those words, the council ended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O 2 CHAPTER XIV. THE RUN—IN. At about two o'clock on a dark gray misty morning, the second after Theodore's fracas with Heneage, the shooting wagon might have been seen, had there been eyes on the alert to see it, standing on a piece of soft turf by the roadside, about a hundred yards distant from “the Elms.” None of its lamps were lighted, but in every other respect it seemed to be in readiness for an immediate start. The driving seat was covered with box coats, and the whole interior strewn, and the after seat piled up with an unusual profusion of buffalo and bearskins. Four powerful horses, Tom Draw's old roan and the gray colt at the wheel, and a pair of wiry-looking active bays on the lead, were harnessed to it. The cold hoar frost was falling in a heavy dew, and the horses had been carefully defended from its effects by a good blanket thrown across the loins of each. At the head of the leaders, stood Harry Archer, duly accoutred for a journey, with long boots rising to his knee, a brown sack overcoat, and a Canadian fur cap, and beside him Heneage, as well provided against the inclemency of the night. Not far from them, leaning upon the saddle of a fine thoroughbred, his own stout favorite Bright Selim, stood Frank Forester, playing, without thinking what he was about, with the buts of a pair of nine-inch duelling pistols, which peeped from the holsters at the saddle bow. His horse was likewise blanketed, and hooded; and Forester himself booted and spurred like a dragoon, and covered by a sort of pelisse, like that of a hussar, and like it richly furred though not braided. Few words passed between them, and those few in whispers; but it was easy to perceive that the men were anxious and impatient, if not disappointed in some expectation. “It must be three o'clock, Harry,” whispered Heneage. “Not yet—it struck two, about half an hour ago—I heard the Warwick clock.” “And they should have been here at one.” “Something has delayed them; fear not, they will be here, anon.” But another hour passed, and there was no sound or voice of any one approaching, and the night was already beginning to waste toward morning. “Stand to the horses, Forester,” said Archer, who was beginning himself to grow uneasy—“I will creep forward and reconnoitre, they may have mistaken the direction.” He was gone about twenty minutes, and returned quite disconcerted. “I have been round the house,” he said, “on every side, there is not so much as a mouse stirring. What o'clock is it? Have you heard the last hour strike?” “No, but it must be hard upon four.” “It is past four by heaven!” said Heneage, striking his repeater. I know her window, I will go and knock at it.” And he would have put his words into execution, had not Archer held him back. “You shall do nothing of the kind. It would ruin all—some casual accident may have prevented them to-night, and no alarm given, to-morrow it may be as well accomplished. Besides, I do not give them up yet.” “I do, almost,” said Forester. “It will be light in an hour.” “Not light exactly. But the day will have broken.” “You must not risk being discovered here.” “Certainly not. If they are not here by five we must be moving.” Another slow half hour dragged away, and long pale streaks of light were checkering the eastern sky, and Harry had already taken off the blankets and thrust them into the boot, preparatory for a start, when a slight sound reached his ear, as if the clap of a distant door. “Here they come, I believe, at last. Stand fast all, I will go see.” And in a moment he returned leading Maria accom panied by her mother and an old nurse. The fair girl was in tears and greatly agitated, and Mrs. D'Arcey whispered in Archer's ear, that she had been obliged to go almost beyond persuasion in order to prevail on her to set out at the last moment. Forester, seeing at a glance that there was no time to lose, lifted the nurse into the carriage in a moment and wrapped her comfortably in the furs. But it needed a little gentle force from Heneage himself, to separate the weeping girl from her scarce less agitated mother. “I give her to you, Frederic. God bless you—be good to her!” “May God so deal with me, if I ever give her cause to repent this measure,” said Heneage solemnly. “Amen!”—responded Archer. Another moment, and she was safely seated by the side of the old and affectionate domestic, and Heneage sprang to the seat in front, while Archer grasping the reins firmly, stood, for a moment, by the forewheel, impressing upon Mrs. D'Arcey the necessity of seeming unconcerned until the discovery of Maria's absence should be made, and then of being greatly frightened and astonished. “I am but a poor actor,” she replied, “but I hope you will be far enough hence, before anything shall be discovered.” “I hope so,” answered Archer—“but it is well to be provided against any fortune.” “I cannot get my horse's hood and body clothes into the boot,” said Forester, “what shall I do with them?” “Roll them into a bundle, and pitch them into that alder coppice. They will stay there till we return.” “Aye! aye!” said Frank, and in a moment he was in his saddle. “Good night! God bless you, Mrs. D'Arcey,” said Harry, lifting his hat and springing to the box—“we must begone. We are too late already.” And with the words, he gathered the reins gently up, and, giving a low whistle, the horses started altogether; and he moved off as quietly as possible over the smooth roadside turf. But it was not destined that they should get off undiscovered, for in a moment Mrs. D'Arcey let the heavy gate fall from her hand, in her agitation, and it closed with so loud a clang that half a dozen dogs set up their shrill clamor simultaneously, and directly afterward the fugitives might hear a window raised, and a sharp voice ask who was there. “Get away lads!” said Harry; “there's nothing for it now but legs! We have got a good half hour's start though—that is one comfort—before they can get to horse and follow! Get away, you old roan! no shrinking now, lads!” Whist! whist! whist! And the double thong plied by that stout and knowing arm sent them, full fifteen miles an hour, with the sparks flashing, and the pebbles glancing from their heels. They dashed through Warwick village with such a clang and clatter, that every sleeper was awakened, and every window thrown up in a moment; and the loud baying of the mastiffs gave note of their proceedings a mile or more away. Over the bridge they thundered, and up the long ascent toward Bellevale—they plunged into the deep woodland on the old hill-side, where the shadows lay as black as night. Now they have passed the hamlet, scaled the bald scalp of Bellevale mountain, and as they paused a moment on the brow to breathe the panting nags, the great sun rushed up to the left above the eastern hill, and all was light and glory. “So far, so good,” cried Archer, merrily to Frank. “They can scarce hold that pace. Can you see anything behind us on the road?” “No,” replied Forester, looking back eagerly. “But I cannot see far—the shadows are still thick in the valley. I would lose no time, Harry; that blue horse of Theodore's is very fast as well as stout; and if they put him to the light sulky, he may overhaul us.” “Right, Frank. I only stopped to breathe them. Now don't be frightened, dear Miss D'Arcey—this is a steep descent; and I am going down it, as if the devil kicked me!—but there is not the slightest danger—so pray don't be frightened.” “I am not in the least afraid,” she answered, with a smile; for the excitement of the rapid motion, and the sporting spirit which in some degree is native to every human breast, had overcome her agitation; and her bright eye, flushed cheek, and lips apart, showed that she almost enjoyed the race. “Get away, lads!” and away they went, down the mile-long descent, over a dozen rough and broken jogs, with the stout wagon thundering and bounding at their heels, as if it was the merest plaything. With a less careful and experienced whip than Harry, it would have been a perilous attempt to descend that mountain side at such a slashing pace. But he was a thorough workman, and knew his wheel horses so well, that the danger was greatly modified. Still, as if to prove that such things may not be done with impunity, just as they reached the turn at the bottom of the hill, the near leader trod upon a rolling stone, and went down instantly upon his head and knees. Fortunately, Archer had taken them well in hand a minute before, and their pace was greatly slackened, so that holding the wheelers back with a steady pull, his quick finger picked the fallen leader up, in a second; and they were on again, without losing much of their way. They had not gone ten yards, however, before it was apparent that the horse was dead lame, and could hardly drag himself along. “Lord! how unlucky!” exclaimed Harry, pulling up. “Jump down, Forester; take the ribands, Heneage. We must take that brute out, and rig a unicorn team; lucky that I have got spare reins in the tool box. Look alive, Frank!—Look alive, by George! I think I hear wheels on the hill top.” It was not above ten minutes, before, by dint of working and quick wit, the four-horse team was converted into a unicorn, and the poor lame leader tied to a tree at the roadside. As Harry resumed his seat, he said in a low voice to Forester, “keep near us, Frank; I am sure they are close at our heels; if these nags cannot get us up the hill, we must put Selim on the lead, along with that brute.” Frank listened for a moment, and then nodded his head, saying, “You are right; but we have a mile's start yet, or better.” Then, just as Harry set his team to work again, he added, with a significant glance, dropping his right hand toward his holster. “His horse?—hey, Harry—?” “For God's sake, no! not for your life!” exclaimed Harry, seriously alarmed. “Just as you say,” replied Frank. “But I think it would be the easiest way.” “No! no! we can do without that. If we can once get up this hill before him, he can't catch us this side Hackensack.” On they went—on! plying the Iash—no time to spare whip-cord or horse-flesh. They crashed over the wooden bridge that spans the feeder of Long Pond; they passed Wright's little tavern, and there Harry pulled up for one second. “Wright! Wright! Holloa! I have left a lame horse on the road—send back for him, and keep him till I come.” “Aye! aye! sir.” “Whist! whist! whist!”— Down came the double thong again upon the wheeler's flanks, marking them gridiron-wise; now the long lash flies out, and the leader springs as if a snake had bitten him under the collar. Away! away—they strain up the long slope—they spin through the turnpike-gate. “Forester pays, close behind us!” “All right, Mr. Archer.” They gain the hill-top, and again pull up by a little spring-head on the mountain's brow. “That bottle, Heneage; and the sponge—they are in the locker at your feet. There jump out, and unstrap the leathern bucket from the perch!” “Have we time?” “We must make time.” And with the rapid coolness of a practised groom, Harry spunged out their mouths, and drenched them with the powerful Scotch ale, and rubbed their heads and eyes carefully. Just as he had got through the job, Forester, who had lagged behind, came galloping up like the wind. “Drive! drive!” he shouted—“D'Arcey is within a quarter of a mile with that blue horse striding out at sixteen miles the hour, and two horsemen with him.” “Never fear, never fear. It is all down hill work now, we will beat him easy, and it is but five miles to our first change. Take a little wine and water, Maria, you look pale—help her Heneage—get away now. See how the drink has freshened them.” And through the green woods they rushed on, up gentle slopes and down steep pitches, the whoops of their pursuers as they yelled to their horses, ringing in their ears. Fast they went—faster yet the enemy gained on them. “Is the axe handy?” asked Frank coming along side. “Yes, under your feet, Heneage; give it to him,” replied Harry. “For what?” inquired Heneage. “Give it to me, never mind!” answered Forester; and reaching out his hand he received it without slackening his pace. Another minute, they rattled over a crazy wooden bridge crossing a brawling brooklet, whirled round a woody corner, and lost sight of Forester. “If Frank has time; we are safe now,” said Harry, easing the horses up a steep pitch as he spoke. “Time to do what?” “Listen!” And the clang of an axe was distinctly audible, and then a heavy rushing sound and a splash, as of a beam falling in the water. “All's well! all's well! excellent, Frank!” shouted Archer. P But as he spoke there came the sharp crack of a pistol shot; and Harry turned as pale as death. It was but for a moment, however, that his alarm lasted, for the quick clash of Selim's hoofs, and a loud whoop of defiance in Frank's cheery voice, reassured him. Before they had gone half a mile he overtook them laughing heartily. “I have given them a quarter of an hour's work,” he said, “and D'Arcey looked so blue when he saw the bridge broken, that I could not refrain from giving him the masonic sign, thumb to the nose, you know, fingers extended, and twirled with a rotatory motion! It was too bad, I confess; and I came near paying dear for it—for he treated me to a pistol shot—but lord help him, D'Arcey never could shoot anywhere, as our friend Colonel M`Carthy has it. I had half a mind to show him that I could; but I refrained from pure regard to our fair lady here.” “Here we are at the saw-mill—now we are on good plain road, and only two miles from our change.— This is the valley of the Ramapo, is it not beautiful?” said Harry, wishing to keep up the excitement.—“Now get out the key bugle; we must give Tim warning to have the nags ready. That is it? can you blow Heneage? No. Give me hold then, and do you tool these fellows in, they will not be sorry to get to their journey's end. What shall I give you, Miss Maria, God save the king or Yankee Doodle?” “The Rogue's march! I should recommend;” said Forester. “You be hanged!” and as he spoke, he raised the instrument to his lips, and the delightful notes of “the young May morn is beaming, love” rang far and wide over wood, road, and river. A long wild whoop replied to them; and in ten minutes more they wheeled up to the front of young Tom's tavern, where stood the new team, bright and in tip-top condition, each with his blanket on, and a man by his head, Timothy superintending all, and young Tom waiting with a gallon of iced milk punch and tumblers on a huge wooden waiter. The punch was discussed, a joke or two cracked, the tired team out, and the fresh team in, in less than three minutes. But just as they were starting, Harry's eye caught the face of one of the men who had helped to change the horses. “Holloa M`Tavish, what are you doing here?” “Got a drove of horses from Ohio, Mr. Archer.” The man answered. “Bad luck to it!” whispered Harry to Heneage. “That is the flying Dutchman, he has some racers for a thousand; and D'Arcey can get a relay, if he will pay for it.” “Here he comes—here he comes”—shouted Forester, who had now backed Bay Trojan, and at the same moment the sulky came in sight with the blue horse straining every muscle, but almost reeling with fatigue, black with sweat, and embossed with foam. “I don't care sixpence for him” replied Archer, putting his horses all together to a fine square trot. “This new catch team will do their fifteen miles an hour, all together, without breaking. It is but eighteen into Hackensack; we shall be there in an hour and a quarter.” “He will catch us there.” “If he do, he will catch a Tartar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. WON IN A CANTER. The sharp work was over, and the race won, as all fancied; but still Harry relaxed nothing of his skill, or his horses' speed. For without worrying them at all, he kept them all at three parts speed, on a beautiful high trot, holding enough in hand to spare for a puff, in case their pursuers should come up. “These horses perform beautifully,” said Heneage, who was now growing easier in mind. “Yes. Very fairly, for a catch team. That blue roan has a nice cat-like, easy gait. He can go seventeen miles the hour, and does not look as if he were doing ten. The white horse snatches at his bit a thought too much, and the sorrel bores. But they do very well—very well, as I said, for a catch team.” “You were lucky to catch such a team, at so short a notice.” “You mean to say that you were. It was no luck to me, for I don't want them. As for the rest, I always know where there are good horses, and what will buy them. These cost me a pretty figure.” “How much?” “They spoiled the face of a thousand dollar bill, I assure you.” “Well, you shall be no loser, Harry, if we win. I shall want four horses to take home, and show them in the Park what Yankee trotters can do—” “To win a Yankee wife!” said Archer, with a sly glance at Maria. “I will give you a thousand for them, at all events.” “No, you won't!” “Why not? I will, I say. You shall not be a loser, for my nonsense.” “Hold! hold hard, Fred; do you call this nonsense? No, I won't sell them; I mean them for a wedding present to one Mrs. Frederic Heneage; do you know such a lady?” While they were chatting thus, they had left the valley of the Ramapo, left Garry Bamper's and New Prospect, left the bright stream that turns Zabrisky's mills, and his snug cottage far behind them. They had clomb the first pitch of the Red hills, and could see Hackensack lying in the broad vale, scarcely four miles away. At this moment Forester, whom they had not seen since they left young Tom's, overtook them at a gallop. “He has got a horse,” he cried, as he came within ear-shot, “from the flying Dutchman, and a remount for both his men. I waited on him all the way, and he is now nearly up with us—not half a mile off.” “On horseback, or in the sulky?” “On horse—and a devilish good horse, too!—It was only on a distance, that the Trojan can leave him.” “Are his men up with him?” “Not quite—a quarter of a mile behind.” “All right—keep near us.” “He will overhaul you.” “Not yet, not yet,” replied Harry, flanking his off-leader, “Go up to your traces, sirrah!—not yet. I cannot afford to let him overhaul us quite yet.” And he put his horses all into a gallop down a gentle declivity, where the road was hard and even. In a few moments, however, they got into deep sand, and the nags fell into a trot. D'Arcey came in sight, and, when they were yet a mile or two distant from Hackensack, he rode up alongside. “Stop! stop!” he shouted. “To whom are you speaking, sir?” asked Archer, P 2 keeping his horses to their work, but without quickening his pace. “Stop instantly?” repeated Theodore, thrusting his hand into the bosom of his riding-frock, “or I will shoot your leader.” Without saying one word, Harry Archer put the reins into Heneage's hands—“Keep them just there!”— then stooped and drew one of the long-barrelled Kuchenreüters from a holster, under the box, cocked it quietly, and then turning to D'Arcey, who, notwithstanding his threat, had not drawn his pistol, said calmly— “You are a lawyer, Mr. D'Arcey, and know what right a man has to deal summarily with one who stops him on the high-road with threats. You have fired once at our party this morning. Now, sir, if I chose it, I might shoot you, without fear of consequences, through the head—but, upon my honor, you are not worth the powder and shot. Frank Forester, ride close to his bridle-rein—that is it—keep just there. Now, if he draws his pistols, knock him off his horse with your iron hunting-whip.” D'Arcey looked round for the support of his men, but although in sight, they were too far off to assist him, and he reined up his horse to await their aid, with a bitter oath. “I'll pay you for this, ere you are fifteen minutes older. We shall meet in Hackensack.” “I hope so,” replied Archer. “Now for the keybugle. I must let old Tom know that we are coming. I think Yankee Doodle will be the best now, to cheer the gentleman up a little.” And with the words, he blew the strain up clear and shrill, and met his reply instantly, in such a stentorian roar from the lips of old Draw, although at half a mile's distance, as drowned the sounds of the vocal brass. Five minutes more, and they pulled up under the long Dutch porch of Vanderbeck's neat tavern, where Harry's own team, the blacks and chesnuts, were ready in their neat clothes, and pawing the ground, eager for a start. The fat man stood on the step of the bar-room, in his element; but his face fell a little, as he saw that there were no pursuers in sight. “How's this? how's this? boys”—he shouted; harn't he had heart to foller. Darnation, that's bad. I'd a-played a merry hell with him—if he'd comed down. Harn't you heard on him?” “Indeed have we,” said Archer. That chesnut on the near lead, Joe. He would have caught us beyond young Tom's, if Forester had not broken the bridge!” “Who-whoop! who-whoop! By the Etarnal; did he though?—did he break down the bridge?—he's a peeler, is little wax skin anyhow. But you harn't seen him since? hey?” “Not ten minutes ago. He bought a fresh horse from the Dutchman, and overhauled us on the Red hills, and threatened to shoot my leader.” “Consarn his hide on him! Did he, though? Wait jest a little, Aircher, dew, and see how I'll fix him off.” “Have you got it all made right?” “Sartain. I made the afferdavit, and Squire Breawn, he gin me a warrant slick away, to hold him for a thousand. Mike here has got the warrant.” “Can't he get bail, here?” “I guess not—he harn't got no friends no how— unless so be, Mr. Aircher, you bids Vanderbeck bail him.” “I don't think I shall do that,” said Archer laughing. “Now to make all sure, Forester, you must stay back here, and if Tom's warrant fail, or he gets bailed which I think he can't, swear your life against him, and bind him to keep the peace.” At this moment D'Arcey and his two men gallopped up, just as Archer was going to ascend his box. “We are in time,” he shouted. “Seize the horses by the heads, Peter.” And as he spoke, he leaped to the ground, and was dashing forward, when old Tom threw his hat into the air with a prodigious whoop, and leaped down in front of him. “I parjured myself didn't I, you etarnal thunderin' liar? He's your man, constable, lay hold on him.” “Is your name Theodore D'Arcey, sir,” said the other man, approaching him. “What if it be?” he asked hastily. “You are my prisoner, sir,” he replied, laying his hand on his shoulder, “unless you can give bail for a thousand dollars, to answer Mr. Draw's charge of defamation.” “It is a d—d trick—help me here, Dick, Peter; I'll hold you harmless.” “I charge you in the State's name, assist me”— shouted the constable to Archer, holding D'Arcey with a firm gripe. “Stand back, stand back, man; keep the peace,” cried Archer, as the men pressed on to rescue Theodore. “Nay, then, take that!” And suiting the action to the word he dealt the fore-most a flush blow in the face, which hurled him to the ground, helpless and motionless; while fat Tom seizing the second by the scruff of his neck, as he termed it, and the seat of his breeches, hurled him over his head, as cleanly as if he had shot from an engine. Resistance was in vain, and seeing that it was so, D'Arcey began to parley. “We will cut all this short, in a moment, Sir,” said Harry “step with me into the next room, sign a full consent of your sister's marriage with my friend, which you cannot prevent—make a virtue of necessity—shake hands with Heneage, who is a right good fellow, and will forgive and forget—ride back to my place, spare us all farther trouble, and let the whole affair end as it should, by a quiet wedding at the Elms.—Then I will be your bail, or at least will indemnify a bailsman for you here, and will get Tom to withdraw his suit. Come, let it be a bargain.” “Oh! do brother—do dear Theodore.” “There is my hand,” said Heneage cordially. “And I'll say nothing about that cursed bad shot you made,” said Forester laughing. “And you may say that I'm parjured jest ten times a day if you will”—said Tom, “'taint much slander no how”—he added in a low voice, “seein who it comed from.” “I will see you all at the devil first,” said he spitefully. “May be you will”—said old Tom, “consid'rin that you'll go there sartain—but we'll see you in the stone jug fust. Come constable, do your dooty.” “Do you wish time to find bail, sir?” “I can find none here; I must send to the city.” “No need for that, Mr. D'Arcey,” said Forester tauntingly, “we shall be back this afternoon, and we will let you out then, when you can do no more harm.” “Oh brother!” exclaimed Maria, looking tenderly at him, with clasped hands. But seeing by the expression of his face that some bitter, perhaps brutal reply was coming, Harry spared her the pain of hearing it, by putting his beautiful fresh team to the trot. In less than an hour, they reached the ferry, with the nags all fresh and lively, and all in good spirits, for Maria, convinced that her brother would suffer no inconvenience beyond a temporary detention, was now well disposed to treat the whole matter as a joke. Their glee was augmented too by the arrival of Frank, who came up with them at Hoboken, laughing so that he could hardly sit in his saddle. “He is jugged”—he cried—“fairly jugged, and that old devil Tom is sitting at his cell door, plaguing him—I would not be in Tom's shoes for a thousand if he should get out—I believe he's gnawing the bars to get at him. If I were you, Fred, I would look before I leaped.—These things run in the blood. I dare say she'll beat you before three weeks are over.” “I certainly would beat you,” answered Maria, shaking her little hand at him, “if I could reach you.” “Of course you would. That is woman's gratitude. Because I broke the bridge for you, and got shot at by that bungling fellow! I dare say he'll have me indicted too, and jugged myself for defacing the highway.” “We'll hold you free from damage,” said Archer— “but, here we are, at the foot of Barclay St.—What o'clock? only half past nine by George—fifty miles over such roads, in four hours, is going. Whither now? To the Globe?” “Oh! yes, to Blancard's certainly.” “And a cab thence to the mayor's office,” added Harry. “I wish I could go with you thither,” said Forester, “but I have urgent and immediate business.” “The deuce! what is that?” “Oh never mind! I will be here when you get back.” “Here we are—then.—How do you do, Blancard? —These ladies to your best private parlor—my horses to the stable, and a good four wheeled cab directly.” “Directly, Mr. Archer,” said that prince of hosts, bowing and smiling, and showing the beautiful girl the way up stairs, marvelling greatly what could be in the wind, but too discreet to say a word or ask a question. It was barely eleven o'clock when Fred and Heneage, after handing Maria and her old companion into the cab, jumped in themselves, and drove away to what the papers call the hymeneal altar; curiously represented by a mayor's mahogany desk, with a rum looking genius in very foggy spectacles, cracking most lamentable jests, and looking as if begot by an owl of a methodist parson, as the officiating priest. At twelve o'clock they returned, happy man, happy bride. And then it was apparent what had been Fred's urgent and immediate business. For after they had sat with the ladies about ten minutes, Blancard himself entered discreetly, and begging pardon for the interruption, informed Archer that his presence and that of Mr. Heneage was earnestly requested in another room. “Good Heaven! what can it be?” said Heneage. “Some of Frank's folly I'll be bound,” said Archer. And sure enough when they reached the other room, there round an amply furnished board, with Burgundy beyond account, champagne punch creaming in a vast bowl, hock almost frozen in its silver coolers, the Globe's unrivalled Sercial and every drinkable that can be named or dreamed of—there stood, with bumpers ready filled, waiting their cue from Forester.—There stood—the boys! The Tall Spirit, towering above the rest, with his blue eye and handsome face beaming with deviltry and good-natured malice—the bald benevolence of the Doctor's classic head—the thin lips of long Massachusetts wreathed into a pleasant smile—the fine and manly beard of Tom Hutch—the waggish, devil-may-care, rakish cut of my Lord George Gordon—and, at the head, flanked by Sully on one hand and Kendall on the other, Frank Forester in all his glory. “The Lord have mercy on us!” cried Archer solemnly. “Health and long life and happiness!”—cried Forester, draining a potent draught and flinging the empty glass over his head. “Health and long life and happiness! Hurrah!” and amid the roar of voices and the clang of breaking beakers, due homage was performed to Heneage and his beauteous bride. “One more toast!” shouted Forester.—“The match maker!” “The match maker! Hurrah! may he make many such.” “It takes you, hoss!” said the Spirit, slapping Harry on the back. “Why yes, Bill”—answered Harry—“we can do some things at MY SHOOTING BOX.” THE END.</field>
