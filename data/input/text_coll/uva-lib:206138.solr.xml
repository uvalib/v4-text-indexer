      <field name="fulltext">The Art Deco Book in France The 1985 Lyell Lectures by GORDON N. RAY edited by G. Thomas Tanselle Editor's Introduction When Gordon Ray delivered the Lyell Lectures at Oxford in 1985, he chose as his subject the Art Deco book illustrations and bindings produced in France in the 1920s. This topic was not a surprising choice, for he had previously written magisterial annotated catalogues, largely based on his own collection, of British illustrated books from 1790 to 1914 and of French illustrated books from 1700 to 1914. His Lyell Lectures formed a natural continuation of the latter and gave him the opportunity to express his views on still another area in which, through his collecting and research, he had become expert. He accompanied his lectures with 183 slides, the majority of them in color, and those illustrations are in fact the reason that the lectures have not been published until now: the expense of producing so many illustrations was too daunting for the publishers that Ray approached. Today a happy solution to this problem is available in the form of digital presentation on the internet, and Ray's work is now being offered in a combination of printed and electronic forms. The verbal text of his lectures is printed in the present volume (supplemented by eight plates, showing striking examples of the work of the major figures discussed), and all of the available illustrations are being published on the website of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, at {http://etext.virginia.edu/bsuva/artdeco}. Numbers placed in the margins of the lectures refer to these illustrations, which are correspondingly numbered on the website. (The online illustrations are provided with detailed captions, which are also printed in a numbered list following the text of the lectures.) One may profitably—and pleasurably—read these lectures without recourse to the illustrations. But naturally Ray's incisive judgments gain greater force when one can see what he is talking about, and the ready availability of the internet to most readers will, I trust, make the process of viewing the illustrations scarcely more burdensome than if they were presented as a section of plates in the present volume. I As matters turned out, Ray had only a year and a half to live after he delivered his Lyell Lectures, and they are his last major piece of work. Although they are not his masterpiece, they are certainly a triumphant and elegant coda to an astonishing body of work. And they reflect in mature form the subtlety of judgment and breadth of knowledge that he always displayed. Most of the audience at Ray's lectures in 1985 would have been aware of his distinction as a scholar and a collector and would have recognized his eminence as a statesman in the intellectual and cultural world. I think it is in order here, therefore, to sketch Ray's life and career, so as to provide present and future readers of these lectures with some sense of the personal background from which they emerged. Gordon Norton Ray was born in New York City on 8 September 1915, the son of Jessie Norton and Jesse Gordon Ray (who represented an Indiana limestone company), and grew up on the Chicago north shore, graduating in 1932 from New Trier High School in Winnetka. Looking back, years later, on his education, he recalled that the excellence of New Trier caused him to regard some of the courses he took as a freshman at Indiana University as a disappointment. (He added that his undergraduate years preceded the dramatic rise of Indiana University under his friend Herman B Wells.) In 1932 his parents had moved to Bloomington, where both the university and their new company were located: the Independent Limestone Company had been founded in 1927, with his father as president, to quarry stone from the land owned by his mother's family. (It was income from this company that later allowed Ray to build his collections, and he accepted the presidency of it in 1974.) Ray graduated from Indiana University in 1936 with A.B. and A.M. degrees in French literature, having been elected to three honorary societies, Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Gamma Sigma, and Phi Eta Sigma. From Indiana he moved to Harvard for graduate work in English literature (holding an Austin Scholarship in 1937-38). After receiving another A.M. in 1938, he settled on Thackeray as the subject for his doctoral dissertation and went to England in the summer of 1939 (on a Dexter Travelling Scholarship) to search for material. Up to that time Thackeray's descendants, respecting the novelist's wish to have no biography, had denied all access to the great mass of his papers. But Ray's visit to Thackeray's granddaughter, Hester Thackeray Fuller, came at a propitious time: the family had decided to select a scholar to work on the papers, and Ray seemed to Mrs. Fuller the right one. He was promptly appointed editor of the Thackeray letters and thus became the envy of graduate students (and their advisers) throughout America. A decade later Richard Altick, writing his account of the glamor and fascination of literary detective work, The Scholar Adventurers (1950), called this episode "One of the most spectacular success stories in recent literary scholarship"; and through Altick's book Ray continued to be a hero to later graduate students. His work on the letters was inextricably linked with the disruptions of war. He had arranged for the microfilming of the letters before leaving Europe at the outbreak of war in 1939, and he performed much of his editorial work on them (and on the material already in the United States) before his own entry into military service. First he completed his dissertation on "Thackeray and France" and received his Ph.D. in 1940; he then stayed on at Harvard for two years as an Instructor in English (1940-42), assisted in the summer preceding the first year by another Dexter Scholarship and in the seventeen months from July 1941 by two Guggenheim Fellowships. By the time he was ordered to active duty in the United States Navy on 1 December 1942, he had completed his edition of the letters; and he turned his voluminous manuscript over to his adviser and friend Howard Mumford Jones, who undertook to read proofs and check references for him. Ray's forty months in the Navy (to 23 March 1946) included two and a half years in the Pacific aboard the aircraft carriers Belleau Wood (April 1943-September 1944) and Boxer (April 1945-March 1946) and service on the staff of Vice Admiral Donald Duncan; as a fighter director and radar officer, he advanced to the rank of Lieutenant, earning seven battle stars and a Presidential unit citation. His war years made a deep impression on him and were the subject of many later allusions: a model of the Boxer still sat on his office desk at the time of his retirement. The first two volumes of The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray were published by Harvard University Press in 1945, while Ray was still in the Navy. His discharge in the spring of 1946 allowed him to take over the proofreading from Jones beginning with the middle of the third volume, and the third and fourth volumes appeared in 1946. This four-volume work was a superb achievement, presenting a vast amount of new material in a form that still stands as a model of documentary editing. The next chapter of Ray's career was set at the University of Illinois, where he moved as Professor of English in the autumn of 1946 and remained until the end of June 1960. During the six months between leaving the Navy and settling in Urbana, he had held a third Guggenheim Fellowship (awarded in 1945), enabling him to return to Mrs. Fuller's London house for further work in the Thackeray papers there and in other English collections. The fruits of this research were a series of distinguished publications on Thackeray: two editions (a facsimile, with his introduction, of the Morgan manuscript of The Rose and the Ring in 1947 and a gathering of Thackeray's contributions to The Morning Chronicle in 1955), a critical study based on the lectures he delivered at the Lowell Institute in February 1950 (The Buried Life: A Study of the Relation between Thackeray's Fiction and His Personal History, 1952), and, finally, in 1955 and 1958, the two massive volumes of his life of Thackeray (Thackeray: The Uses of Adversity, 1811-1846; Thackeray: The Age of Wisdom, 1847-1863), which constitute—as Bradford A. Booth said in introducing Ray's 1964 Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge lecture—"one of the indisputable masterpieces of literary biography in our time." Ray also wrote an introduction to Thackeray's Henry Esmond for the Modern Library (1950) and in 1954 began a long association with another series of classics, serving for seventeen years as general editor of the Houghton Mifflin Company's Riverside Series and arranging for the publication of some eighty titles in it (one of them, in 1960, being his own edition of H. G. Wells's The History of Mr. Polly). This productivity is all the more remarkable in the light of the administrative duties he accepted at Illinois, serving as Head of the English Department (1950-57) and then as Vice President and Provost (1957-60). He did, however, have three interludes away from Illinois: in 1948-49 (after spending the summer of 1948 as a visiting professor at the University of Oregon) he was a Rockefeller Post-Service Fellow and a member of the United States Educational Commission in the United Kingdom, which established the Fulbright program; in 1952-53 he was Berg Professor of English and American Literature at New York University; and in 1956-57 he held a fourth Guggenheim Fellowship, to begin work on several projects relating to H. G. Wells (including a biography). In September 1956, just after that Fellowship began, his father died, leaving him (his mother having died in 1954) with a large block of Independent Limestone Company stock and thus a considerably increased annual income; as a result he declined the monetary part of the Guggenheim award. He was also in a position to enlarge the scope of his collecting, and he began concentrating on English illustrated books; but he had already accomplished impressive feats of collecting, both for himself and for his university. His collecting had begun in earnest when he was abroad in 1948-49, inspired by the sight of Michael Sadleir's collection of Victorian fiction (which was for him, as he said in a 1964 autobiographical essay for The Book Collector, "a revelation"). From then on until the end of his life he made visits to England and France nearly every summer searching for books; and until 1957 those trips also produced major acquisitions for the University of Illinois Library. While he was building for himself notably comprehensive collections of English and French literature from 1789 to 1914 (including manuscript, as well as printed, material), he was securing for the university massive archives and whole collections of books (the papers of two important publishers, Richard Bentley and Grant Richards, in 1951 and 1952; the Tom Turner library of 8000 volumes of twentieth-century English literature in 1953; and the papers of H. G. Wells, amounting to 60,000 items, in 1954). Anyone who buys books by the roomful (as he once did in a shop in Penzance) is bound to achieve rapid celebrity in the antiquarian book world, and his book-buying trips of the 1950s have become legendary; but he also added to the Illinois holdings by the systematic purchase of individual titles, increasing the total by several thousand volumes each year. These purchases in turn affected his own research: his interest in H. G. Wells, reflected in his last Guggenheim application, was obviously related to his bringing the Wells papers to Urbana; and three books resulted, two of them editions that appeared while he was at Illinois (The Desert Daisy in 1957 and—with Leon Edel—Henry James and H. G. Wells in 1958) and the third, much later, his biographical study H. G. Wells &amp; Rebecca West (1974), an account of the love affair between Wells and West based on Wells's letters to her and Ray's conversations with West. In 1959 Henry Allen Moe, then Secretary General of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, offered Ray (with whom, as a four-time Fellowship recipient, he had become well acquainted) the position of Associate Secretary General. Ray accepted, made arrangements to move to New York during the summer of 1960 (his books to be placed on newly constructed shelves lining the walls of a river-view apartment at 25 Sutton Place South), and began work at the Foundation on September 1st. Eight months later, following Mrs. Simon Guggenheim's decision to relinquish the title of President and Moe's election to that office, Ray was named Secretary General; and in 1963, when Moe left at the age of 69, Ray was elected president (and trustee) and thus became on July 1st the second principal administrative officer in the Foundation's thirty-eight-year history. During the twenty-two years of his presidency (until his retirement just before his seventieth birthday in 1985), he saw to it that the Foundation maintained the standards of excellence for which it had become known, adhering unswervingly to the policy of awarding Fellowships only to individuals who had significant accomplishments to their credit and who showed promise of making further contributions. His views on this matter and many others were expressed in a series of widely read annual reports, each one an essay characterized by the lucidity and incisiveness with which he could treat complex issues. In his time the Foundation awarded $96,000,000 to 8100 Fellows. Ray's position at the Foundation gave him a vantage point from which to have a possibly unrivaled view of the scholarly, scientific, and artistic worlds, and his role as adviser to the learned community grew steadily larger during this period. Some idea of that role can be suggested by a recitation of the institutions on whose governing boards he served: the Foundation Center (196268; vice chairman, 1963-65; chairman, 1965-68), Grolier Club (1963-86; president, 1965-69), Modern Language Association of America (trustee of invested funds, 1966-85), Smithsonian Institution (1968-85; chairman, 197085), Pierpont Morgan Library (1970-86; vice president, 1974-86), Rosenbach Museum and Library (1972-81), American Council of Learned Societies (treasurer, 1973-85), Rockefeller University (1973-86), New York Public Library (1975-86; honorary trustee, 1984-86), Columbia University Press (1977-82), Winterthur Museum (1977-85), and Yaddo (1979-85). This list leaves out some two dozen other committees, commissions, and advisory boards relating to higher education and libraries, several of which give him particular pleasure—such as the visiting committees to the Harvard University Library (1966-85), the Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1977-86), and the Lilly Library (chairman, 1979-86); the council of the Fellows of the Pierpont Morgan Library (1962-66; chairman, 1965-66) and of the Friends of the Columbia Libraries (1970-86; chairman, 1973-86); and the board of the American Trust for the British Library (treasurer, 1980-86). He was also frequently (some three dozen times in the 1960s and 1970s) asked to speak on ceremonial occasions, such as the opening of important conferences or the dedication of new library buildings, and some of those addresses—particularly those surveying the state of the humanities and of the rare-book world—have become celebrated. All the while, the honors poured in: election to the Royal Society of Literature (1948), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962), the American Antiquarian Society (1971), the American Philosophical Society (1977; vice president, 1986), and the Roxburghe Club (1982); the award of the University of Evansville Medal of Honor (1970), the Sir Thomas More Medal for Book Collecting (University of San Francisco, 1973), and the Joseph Henry Medal (Smithsonian Institution, 1980); and thirteen honorary degrees, from Monmouth College (Litt.D., 1959), New York University (LL.D., 1961), Syracuse University (Litt.D., 1961), Tulane University (LL.D., 1963), Indiana University (L.H.D., 1964), Duke University (Litt.D., 1965), University of California (LL.D., 1968), University of Illinois (Litt.D., 1968), Columbia University (LL.D., 1969), Northwestern University (Litt.D., 1974), University of Southern California (LL.D., 1974), University of Pennsylvania (L.H.D., 1978), and University of Maryland (Litt.D., 1982). During his Foundation years, Ray's activities as scholar, teacher, and book collector continued unabated. He accepted a professorship in English at New York University in his third year at the Foundation (1962-63) and taught popular courses there (and directed dissertations) in Victorian literature every year for the next seventeen, becoming Professor Emeritus in 1980. (He also spent a summer during this period—in 1969—as Beckman Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.) His generosity to his students, welcoming them to his Foundation office and offering them the use of materials from his collection, became widely known, and many of them have recorded their indebtedness and appreciation. The focus of his own scholarship in these years, and of the collecting that inspired it, was English illustrated books of the nineteenth century and French illustrated books and bindings from 1700 through the 1930s. (At the same time he was impressively expanding his holdings of literary manuscripts.) By 1976 he was ready to display the English items, and in March and April of that year the Pierpont Morgan Library mounted a major exhibition on the subject, drawn almost exclusively from his collection and accompanied by the publication of his large volume The Illustrator and the Book in England from 1790 to 1914. Six years later (from April through July 1982) the Library held a similar exhibition of his French materials, in connection with which he delivered the Library's Franklin Jasper Walls Lectures (4, 6, 11 May) and published his two-volume work on The Art of the French Illustrated Book, 1700 to 1914. These two exhibitions and their associated publications represent the culmination of his life as a scholar-collector. There are few collectors of any period who could provide, almost single-handedly, material of such quality (including drafts and proofs) for two exhibitions of such breadth; and there are fewer still who could write about their fields with such scholarly depth and stylistic elegance. These two books, which demonstrate the interconnections between scholarship and collecting, are masterpieces of trenchant commentary, revealing time and again his comprehensive knowledge of the history of book illustration and his lifetime of reading in the literature that inspired the illustrations. They are monuments as solid in their field as his Thackeray work is in Victorian literary study. To those monuments he was able to add a "small sequel" (as he called it) that he had long planned: the invitation to deliver the 1985 Lyell Lectures provided the occasion to survey French Art Deco books, bringing his analysis of French bookmaking up to the chronological limit of his own collection. The fortunate timing of these lectures seemed to epitomize the well-regulated nature of his whole life. He liked order and routine, but there was always room in his carefully controlled schedule for the entertainments he enjoyed— such as, in Urbana, his weekend excursions by train to New Orleans; and, in New York, his quiet hours at the Grolier Club reading booksellers' catalogues (probably no other member in recent times used the Club library so regularly). In his earlier years, he was athletic, engaging in basketball, baseball, handball, bowling, and tennis, and he remained all his life a devoted follower of sports: in New York he often invited groups of friends to baseball games; he held a season ticket to the Knickerbockers' basketball games; and he was known to decline social events in favor of games on television. He was an avid reader of detective stories (amassing a fine collection of them as a by-product) and a steady attender of movies; and he apparently remembered them all in considerable detail, just as he seemed to keep straight the plots and characters of all the major (and many minor) novels of English, French, and American literature. His range of allusion was thus astonishingly wide; and, although he sometimes revealed his impatience with small talk, he was an engaging conversationalist, alternating anecdotes with pronouncements, bemused detachment with magisterial gravity. (His obituary in the London Times was particularly apt in describing him as "a man of solid and authoritative presence, and of considered and consequential speech.") To some people he appeared formidable at first, but many have reason to know how approachable he could be. His formality and reserve, however, often made it difficult for colleagues and friends to feel that they knew him well, even while they were drawn to him by his charm, his sense of humor, and his balanced and sympathetic concern for their problems. No doubt more people experienced his conversation over a meal than in any other setting, and his love of good food was probably his best-known diversion. He made a point of inviting many Guggenheim Fellows to lunch, sometimes at the Century Association but equally often at a favorite restaurant (San Marino, La Toque Blanche, La Petite Marmite, Le Chantilly); on summer trips his visits with book dealers were punctuated at midday by lunches with Fellows who were spending their Fellowship periods abroad, and those gatherings at the White Tower, L'Étoile, Le Crillon, and La Tour d'Argent became part of the lore that Guggenheim Fellows share. Ray was a tall man, with a large frame, and always handsome, but the trim figure of his youth and early middle age ultimately yielded to the daily regimen of rich meals. He lived as he wished to until the end, but during his last five or six years he experienced some of the problems that excessive weight can cause. When he died of a heart attack in his apartment on the morning of 15 December 1986, his affairs were—characteristically—in order, his will having designated the Morgan Library as the repository for his collection of manuscripts, drawings, and some 15,000 books. Few scholars could have had more reason to feel satisfied with their accomplishments. Gordon Ray left some projects unfinished, as anyone with a lively mind is bound to do; but he had produced four major works, which will be read long into the future, and had lived a life that influenced many other lives, a life that will be a continuing model and an object of respectful wonderment for those who contemplate a career in literary scholarship. II The story of Ray's Lyell Lectures begins in the autumn of 1981, when the electors of the James P. R. Lyell Readership in Bibliography at Oxford selected Ray for the 1984-85 year, a decision conveyed to him by Rosemary Schwerdt on 5 October. When he wrote his acceptance letter on 29 October, he indicated his preference for the Michaelmas term (autumn) and said that his topic would probably be "The Art Deco Book in France"—"but," he added, "I may change my mind." By the time of their next correspondence, in July 1983, he had altered his preferred date to the Trinity term (and the days of 6, 8, 10, 13, and 15 May 1985 were soon thereafter confirmed), but he had not changed his mind about the content or title of the lectures. Indeed, he was already working in earnest to prepare himself for writing, though his general knowledge of the subject was formidable to start with. He made lists of illustrated books that he should consider, drawing on his own collection and on information gleaned from reading auction and dealer catalogues and the secondary literature. He also brought the subject up with knowledgeable friends: in November 1983, for example, he held productive conversations with the New York dealer Lucien Goldschmidt and the Boston collector Peter Wick. His regular lunches with David Kirschenbaum of the Carnegie Book Shop were as fruitful as always, and his almost daily visits to the Grolier Club provided opportunities for reading some of the reference books he did not possess. The knowledge of private collections that he gained through his network of book-world acquaintances is symbolized by his use, near the end of his fourth lecture, of a letter of Laboureur's "mounted in a copy of Le portrait de Dorian Gray owned by a New York collector" (p. 84). Because his own collection did not include all the books he would need (as had very nearly been the case with his studies of earlier French and English book illustration), he began corresponding with curators of some of the major institutional collections and arranging to visit their premises. Before making a Foundation trip to California in April 1984, for example, he wrote to Michael T. Ryan, then Curator of Special Collections at Stanford, to make arrangements for examining some of the books in the Morgan A. Gunst collection; and on 17-18 April (besides seeing Guggenheim Fellows and advisers) he took notes on those books, placing an order for twenty-one slides (five of which were among those he eventually used). The following month he corresponded with Ralph Franklin, then director of the Beinecke Library at Yale, specifying some of the books he wanted to see in Frank Altschul's collection (having prepared himself the previous November and December by talking with Franklin and by asking Marjorie G. Wynne, Research Librarian at the Beinecke and an old friend, to send him copies of the Altschul catalogue cards). Characteristically, he also asked Franklin to arrange a lunch while he was there, to be held at Mory's on 24 May and to consist of Rutherford Rogers (head of the Yale library system), Donald Gallup (the famous curator of the American literature collection), Marjorie Wynne, and Franklin himself; and he got in touch with Gordon and Mary Haight, who invited him to dinner on 23 May. He worked at the Beinecke on 23-25 May, focusing on Altschul's superb assemblage of Schmied items, though he took notes on other books as well; his resulting order for slides totaled thirty-five, all but two of which were used in his lectures. During the summer and fall of 1984 he concentrated on collections in New York. He had recently become acquainted with Charles Rahn Fry, a young collector who had been elected to the Grolier Club in 1982 and whose collection of books illustrated by the stencil process called pochoir had been the subject of a Princeton exhibition the same year. After the two met at a Grolier gathering in March 1983, Fry sent Ray a letter listing his favorite Art Deco pochoir books, and Ray then knew how important Fry's collection would be for his research. Dinner and an evening devoted to looking at Ray's books ensued in April, and a month later Fry finished preparing a "distilled" list of his collection. In August Ray asked Fry to deposit some fifteen volumes from this list at the Morgan Library, and in the end he used eighteen illustrations from these volumes. Fry continued to furnish material dealing with pochoir, and Ray showed his appreciation by giving Fry a copy of Les rencontres de monsieur de Bréot (1919), with pochoirs by Bonfils that Ray praised in his first lecture. (Fry died prematurely in September 1990, and his collection was purchased by the Princeton University Library.) Later in the summer and in the early fall, Ray explored the holdings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he was at the time a member of the visiting committee for the Watson Library there), taking special interest in two volumes illustrated by Barbier and four illustrated by Laboureur. (When the nine slides he requested were presented to him by William Bond Walker, head of the Watson Library and a fellow Grolier member, Ray reciprocated by giving the museum an album of fifty Gavarni lithographs entitled Masques et visages, par-ci, par-là.) And at the Columbia University Library (where he was chairman of the Friends), he located two relevant pochoir volumes and had two slides made from them. During the fall, he also examined in New York several books held elsewhere: in October the Harvard copy of Verlaine's Fêtes galantes with illustrations by Barbier was deposited at the Grolier Club for his use (and from which he had two slides made); and in November five Laboureur volumes from the collection of Dr. Jack Eisert of Tarrytown (which Lucien Goldschmidt had told him about) were deposited at the Morgan Library for his inspection (and yielded four slides for the lectures). The richest institutional holdings in New York were in the New York Public Library (an institution, two blocks from Ray's office, of which he was a trustee), and in November he arranged with Donald Anderle, then in charge of Special Collections, to see four books illustrated by Laboureur. By the end of January 1985, as he wrote to Anderle, he was concentrating on the last lecture, devoted to bindings. On 19 February he made the first of several visits to the library for the purpose of looking at binding designs, especially the important album of Pierre Legrain's maquettes in the Spencer Collection and the bindings that Legrain designed for Florence Blumenthal. His various visits to the library resulted in a total of twenty-eight slides that he selected for use in the lectures. In many ways, however, the most important New York collection for his purposes was his own. (In the second paragraph of the opening lecture he refers to Francis A. Kettaneh's collection as the "backbone" of the 1968 Grolier Club exhibition entitled "Art Déco: French Illustrated Books, Drawings, Bindings, and Objets d'art of the 1920's," described in the Club's Gazette for June 1969; what he does not say is that his own collection provided thirty volumes for that exhibition.) During the early months of 1985 he deposited some fifty of his books at the Morgan Library for photographing by David A. Loggie (the Morgan's photographer, whom Ray paid directly as an independent contractor). Ray's letter to Loggie accompanying one batch of books in March began, "You will begin to think that my needs will never be satisfied." In all, Ray used sixty-nine slides from his own collection in illustrating his lectures. As he was examining books in many locations and making notes on them, he was also drafting segments of his lectures, so that his judgments would be written up while the books were fresh in his mind (though his memory for bibliographical detail was remarkable). By April 1985 his first typescript, extensively revised by hand, had been retyped by Jean Gaylord, his Guggenheim Foundation secretary. His text was ready for delivery, though he made a few revisions by hand on his reading copy of the final typescript, as well as marginal notations indicating such details of presentation as when the lights should go off for the showing of slides and back on again. Ray arrived at the Randolph Hotel in Oxford on Sunday, 5 May, and was joined that evening for dinner by Alan Bell and his wife. The next morning he met with the projectionist at the lecture room in the St. Cross Building in Manor Road before lunching at Wolfson College with Julian Roberts of the Bodleian Library. At 5 p.m. that day he delivered the first lecture to an audience of about seventy-five that included such old friends as the scholar Kathleen Tillotson and the Thackeray heir Belinda Norman-Butler, who— after the sherry reception that traditionally follows the first Lyell lecture each year—had dinner with Ray at the Randolph. The festive spirit of the day was further enhanced by the arrival of telegrams from Charles Fry and Charles Ryskamp. (One regret was the absence of his old friend Simon NowellSmith, the Lyell Lecturer of twenty years before, who sent him a note later in the week explaining that he had not felt up to attending.) The week and a half proceeded smoothly (except for a problem with the slide projector, necessitating its replacement after the second lecture), and Ray's characteristically full social schedule surrounded the lectures themselves. On the days in between the lectures he had lunches with Guggenheim Fellows who were working in England—on the first Tuesday at L'Étoile in London and on the other two days (Thursday the 9th and Tuesday the 14th) at Elizabeth in Oxford. His evenings offered a succession of dinners with book-world friends—such as Richard and Mary Ellmann on the 7th, Robert Shackleton (formerly Bodley's Librarian) at All Souls on the 8th, John Carey at Merton on the 9th, Shackleton again at home on the 10th, and Bent JuelJensen on the 13th, plus a Bodleian dinner at Wolfson College on the 15th, after the final lecture and concluding sherry party. (In all, as he wrote to Mary Woodring of the Guggenheim Foundation on the 16th after settling in at the Connaught in London, he "was entertained at lunch or dinner at six colleges.") The weekend after the third lecture was spent in the country seeing Robert Burchfield at Sutton Courtenay and Colin Franklin at Culham. Visits to Oxford bookshops filled some of the weekday mornings, and a session at the Bodleian on the 13th was referred to in his lecture two days later. When in the fifth lecture he says, "I had better conclude by explaining why I have not discussed Paul Bonet," he added in the margin, "particularly since I discovered Monday that the Bodleian contains four splendid examples of his work given by Albert Ehrman." At the beginning of that final lecture, according to the notation he had inserted on his reading copy, he said, "Thanks for the cordial welcome I have received—and for the attentive reception accorded these lectures." He was not merely expressing conventional sentiments, for there is good reason to believe that a great deal of appreciative enthusiasm had been conveyed to him by various members of the audience. After all, no comparable treatment of his subject had previously been attempted in English, and the background he brought to it, as the audience would have recognized, made him an ideal person for the task. As he put it in the first lecture, "My perspective is that of a collector who for many years has endeavored to find out as much as he could about French illustrated books of the last three centuries" (p. 20). Indeed, he thought of his subject as an "episode in the history of book collecting" (p. 21), though of course recognizing at the same time "the importance of Art Deco in the evolution of styles" (p. 20). He had skillfully organized the material to fit the required five-part structure and to present both a broad overview and a detailed treatment of a few major figures. The opening lecture sketches the relation of Art Deco to livres d'art in general and their collecting in the 1920s, and then it examines what he calls "the anticipations of Art Deco illustration during the 1910s" (p. 33) in publications relating to design, fashion, and the theatre and in books illustrated by Robert Bonfils. The next three lectures are devoted, in turn, to three major artists, George Barbier (1882-1932), François-Louis Schmied (1873-1941), and Jean-Émile Laboureur (1877-1943). And the final lecture takes up Art Deco bookbinding, focusing on Pierre Legrain (1889-1929). By the end, listeners had gained (as readers can now gain) a sense of the movement as a whole, as well as the contributions of the major figures, the shapes of their careers, and the processes they employed. Although a considerable secondary literature on the Art Deco book existed when Ray wrote, it was almost entirely in French, and much of it dated from the 1920s. Indeed, Raymond Hesse's two general surveys appeared in 1927 and 1928, and the chief catalogue of Schmied's work also came out in 1927; and the monographs on Barbier and Laboureur in the series "Les artistes du livre" both appeared in 1929, as did Rose Adler's album of contemporary bindings. Clément-Janin's work on illustration and Crauzat's on bindings came shortly thereafter, in 1931 and 1932. A few significant works (like Carteret's extensive treatment of book illustration in 1946-48 and the basic catalogue of Legrain in 1965) did appear later, but not in sufficient quantity to affect the generalization that much of the writing important for Ray's purposes (both in periodicals and in books) had appeared more than half a century earlier. As for writing in English, the 1976 memoir of Schmied by the California printer Ward Ritchie stands out as a possibly unique instance of a specialized book in English on a French Art Deco book artist. Ray points out at the beginning of the last lecture that Victor Arwas in his 1980 Art Deco gave only passing mention to illustrated books, though he did pay attention to binding—a fact that symbolizes the treatment of Art Deco illustration in English. Ray's lectures show a mastery of the secondary literature through 1984 (including dealers' and auction-house catalogues), and his surviving notes indicate, not surprisingly, that he had read considerably more material than he referred to in his text. But, as he says in the first lecture, his main source was "of course" the books themselves. His judgment of those books is what makes his lectures important, and would have made them important even if there were not such a shortage of wide-ranging studies written with the perspective of time, especially in English. The stately movement of the lectures makes the choice of books seem almost inevitable, but in fact the ones he selected were the product of a long process of surveying hundreds of books, as his many handwritten lists and notes reveal. Given the very limited edition-size of most of the relevant illustrated books and the uniqueness of individual bindings, the task of locating the material he needed to see was a challenge; and the fact that his remarks rest on such a broad base (including original drawings, special printings, and maquettes) is in itself a significant accomplishment. His final choices and his critical discussions of them reflect a keen eye, trained over many years. If he does not engage in formal analysis as much as one might expect, his characterizations of artists' styles do reflect an understanding of (and include commentary on) the technical processes they were employing. And he never loses sight of the fact that he is dealing with book-related art: he is always alert to the differing effects of vignettes (surrounded by text) as opposed to full-page plates, and he regularly considers whether a given artist's work is illustrative or decorative (and, if the latter, whether it is allusive or purely abstract). He also brought to his subject a thorough knowledge of French literature (having received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in it), enabling him to make perceptive comments about the match in certain instances between literary work and illustrator; and knowing the place of each illustrated scene in the structure of the work being illustrated allowed him to evaluate the artists' choices of scenes to depict. He was able to say, for example, that the verbal works selected by Laboureur were "invariably idiosyncratic, usually laconic, and often ironic" (p. 68) and that Laboureur's illustrations for Colette's L'Envers du music-hall were "as bleak as his author's text" (p. 76). Similarly, he could point out that Barbier's designs for Verlaine's Fêtes galantes "are full of fantastic touches without warrant in the poet's text" (p. 42), and he could generalize that Barbier was largely "a decorator rather than an illustrator" (p. 44). With Ray's background, Barbier's designs for theatre costumes took him back to a passage in Gautier's Mlle. de Maupin (p. 42). Schmied, he realized, "abandoned representational illustrations" for Vigny's Daphné, since the novel's primary concern was "the metaphysical speculations which filled the Emperor's mind" (pp. 57-58). His fluency in French served him well in another way, too, for it permitted him to use his own smooth translations of any comments he wished to quote from these artists or from writings about them. His translations are careful (occasionally interspersed with bracketed English words to show what he had inserted or bracketed French ones to show what he had translated), but they are never pedantic or awkward. He did leave a few quotations untranslated, if he thought the French phrases were significant in themselves or if the passages were from poetry—but apparently he translated even those when he delivered the lectures, for handwritten translations of them were added to his reading copy. Ray's wide reading was of course not limited to French literature and the other works chosen by Art Deco artists, and his discussions are enlivened, and illuminated as well, by various asides and allusions. The way of life of Schmied and his "entourage" reminds him of that of Mr. Wardle and his family in The Pickwick Papers (p. 61). Laboureur's depiction of a luxurious hotel in Valéry Larbaud's 200 chambres, 200 salles de bain causes him to speculate on what Laboureur might have done with Arnold Bennett's Imperial Palace, published three years later (p. 81). The combined work of Laboureur and André Gide in the 1929-30 edition of Les caves du Vatican conveys the kind of "light-hearted mood" that would have resulted "if Eric Gill had undertaken to illustrate Stevenson's New Arabian Nights" (p. 82). And when he finds Schmied's vignettes in one of J.-C. Mardrus's translations from the Arabian Nights "oddly reminiscent of Bewick in placement and conception" (p. 64), he is drawing on his knowledge of English illustration of an earlier time; or when, speaking of a binding on Daphnis et Chloé, he notes that "Legrain's aggressive geometry clashes radically with Bonnard's cloudy drawings" (p. 97), one knows that he has Bonnard's whole career in the back of his mind (for Bonnard figured prominently in his catalogue of earlier French illustration). He also calls to mind how other artists had illustrated the same works as the artists he is concentrating on: his discussion of Laboureur's designs for a 1930 edition of Maeterlinck's La vie des abeilles contrasts them with Carlos Schwabe's illustrations for a 1908 edition of that work (p. 82), and he compares Laboureur's burins for the 1927 edition of Giraudoux's Suzanne et le Pacifique with the engravings of Jean-Gabriel Daragnès in the 1928 edition (p. 83). Earlier he had noted that Barbier's illustrations for Les liaisons dangereuses were "as comprehensive and effective" as any since those of Monnet and Gérard for the 1796 edition (p. 45). His prose throughout has the directness and clarity that were traits of all his writing. There is a deceptive simplicity to his statements, for their lack of grammatical complexity never suggests superficiality. Indeed, only a deep knowledge of the subject could lead to such unhedged assertions as calling Schmied's Daphné "the Art Deco book par excellence" (p. 57) or describing Barbier as "the most haunting of Art Deco book artists" (p. 35). Knowledge of all of Barbier's work leads to identifying costumes that "belong to Barbierland rather than to history" (p. 40). There is a formality in Ray's writing that mirrors the formality of his personality, but his sense of humor and his wry amusement at human foibles are also in evidence here. He characterizes the Cercle Lyonnais du Livre, for instance, as a group "whose members would not have appreciated any radical departure from the conventional" (p. 56); he describes a statuette of a naked dwarf in one of Barbier's drawings as "dissipated yet vestigially fashionable" (p. 38); and he remarks on the interest shown in "almost any elaborately decorated binding of the 1920s, no matter how inferior its quality" (p. 85). Ray's lectures, in short, are authoritative, perceptive, elegant, and witty. They were polished by the time of their delivery, and Ray did not feel that they required any further work. While still in Oxford (on 13 May 1985) he sent a note to J. P. W. Roper (Rosemary Schwerdt's successor as secretary of the Lyell electors), indicating that he would give his typescript to Julian Roberts after the final lecture. "I regard it," he said, "as being in publishable form." Although the text was indeed in publishable form, the cost of producing the numerous illustrations was too much for the three publishers Ray got in touch with during the eighteen months before his death—though he was aware of only the first two rejections (from Oxford University Press, which had the right of first refusal, and from Dover Publications, which published the 1986 reprints of his catalogues of English and French illustrated books), for the letter of rejection from the London office of Yale University Press was dated two days after his death. If Ray were publishing these lectures today, he might perhaps add a few references to publications that have appeared since 1985, such as Sylvain Laboureur's four-volume Catalogue complet de l'oeuvre de Jean-Émile Laboureur (Neuchâtel: Ides et Calendes, 1989-91), Mauro Nasti's Schmied (Venice: G. Tamoni, 1991), and Yves Peyré and H. George Fletcher's Art Deco Bookbindings: The Work of Pierre Legrain and Rose Adler (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2004), published in conjunction with an exhibition at the New York Public Library drawn primarily from the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, which Ray had visited and refers to in the fifth lecture. He might also cite a substantial Legrain exhibition catalogue, Pierre-Émile Legrain (Paris: Galerie Jacques de Vos, 1996) and some of the numerous exhibition catalogues devoted to Laboureur, as well as general works like Alastair Duncan and Georges de Bartha's Art Nouveau and Art Deco Bookbinding: French Masterpieces, 1880-1940 (New York: Abrams, 1989) and Roger Devauchelle's La reliure: recherches historiques, techniques et biographiques sur la reliure française (Paris: Éditions Filigranes, 1995). And he might mention the catalogues of some of the many notable post-1985 auctions of Art Deco books, such as the long series of Hôtel Drouot catalogues (beginning in 1991) devoted to the collections of the illustrious publishercollector Henri M. Petiet, who died in 1980 (and who published one book, Toulet's Les contrerimes, that turns up four times in Ray's slides); or the Hôtel Drouot sale of books from the Succession Paul Bonet on 1 June 1990; or the two sales at Sotheby's in New York on 2 June 1995 and 25 June 2001, drawn from the holdings of a New York collector (who wishes to remain anonymous) and containing splendid examples of the work of the figures discussed in Ray's lectures. Ray thought that prevailing prices were high in 1985, noting that Parisian dealers had set their prices "as usual at a point just below that at which no customer would consider buying" (p. 20); and surely some further sarcasm would have been forthcoming as he contemplated the higher levels (sometimes reaching well into five figures) that have since been achieved. But it is hard to see anything substantial that he would have felt the need to revise. His judgments grew out of the examination of such an extensive array of books that he is unlikely to have encountered others (however much he may have admired them) so absolutely compelling as to have demanded inclusion in preference to examples already selected. His work has not been superseded as a compact and reliable survey. And the quality of his evaluations will give these lectures a secure place in the future study of their subject. Sources, Treatment of Text, Acknowledgments Sources. The surviving papers relating to Ray's work on these lectures fall into five categories: (1) correspondence with officials at Oxford, friends, and librarians— the last group of letters including some of the lists of books he wished to see and some of his orders for slides; (2) holograph notes made at libraries and at home while examining primary and secondary material, along with holograph lists of books and preliminary drafts of scattered paragraphs; (3) a partial first typescript, with extensive holograph revisions; (4) multiple copies of the final typescript, including the one annotated for use in delivering the lectures, which shows that the last illustration and the associated comments were added at a late stage (six of the small revisions made on that copy were actually incorporated into the typing of most of the other surviving copies—a situation reflecting the fact that the typing had been done on a magnetic-card typewriter and that small alterations could therefore be made without the need for retyping the unaltered text); (5) photocopies, occasionally annotated, of secondary material. As Ray's literary executor, I have all these papers in my possession at present. The slides that Ray used in the lectures, except for ten that are apparently lost (1.6, 1.9, 2.6, 2.12, 2.33, 3.13, 3.16, 4.40, 5.1, and 5.20 in the list of illustrations below), are now the property of the Pierpont Morgan Library, where Ray's entire collection of books, manuscripts, and art is housed. Ray's own comments on his sources appear in the lectures on pp. 20-21 and 89-90. In my introduction, I have incorporated, as section I, a slightly revised version of the biographical sketch that I originally wrote as part of the introduction to a collection of Ray's essays, Books as a Way of Life (New York: Grolier Club and Pierpont Morgan Library, 1988), a volume that includes a checklist of Ray's writings. Treatment of text. I have followed the text of the final typescript as revised in Ray's hand for delivery, with two classes of exceptions. (1) I have not accepted those revisions clearly intended only for oral delivery, such as those aimed at speeding up the reading (deleting first names, shortening titles, omitting dates) and those with direct reference to the occasion (such as thanking the audience or noting his visit to the Bodleian, both of which I have quoted in the introduction above). (2) I have made some four dozen alterations of my own, only ten of which go beyond the correction of typographical errors or the adjustment of formal features for consistency: I have substituted "A year" for "Two years" at 23.28, "before these words were published" for "however" at 24.26 (in order to recognize the discrepancy between the date at the end of Clément-Janin's text and the printing dates of the two volumes as given in the colophons), "several" for "six main" at 25.15, "former" for "latter" at 32.27, "leaves" for "pages" at 59.25, "vignette" for "plate" at 63.25, "the last" for "these" at 79.11, and "fewer" for "less" at 22.26 and 84.10; and I have inserted "these" at 82.29. The documentation remains in the form Ray used, except that arabic numerals have replaced roman and some inconsistencies have been regularized— primarily his inconsistent citation of page numbers (sometimes in parentheses in the text and sometimes in footnotes that consisted solely of page numbers where no author or title reference was needed: all such page references are now in the text). The list of secondary works cited and the list of illustrations have been added; they do not exist in any form in Ray's papers. Acknowledgments. Gordon Ray would have wanted to thank the Oxford officials who handled the arrangements for his visit (including Rosemary Schwerdt and J. P. W. Roper) and the staff members of libraries where he worked, including Julian Roberts (Bodleian), the late Kenneth A. Lohf (Columbia), the late Robert L. Nikirk (Grolier Club), Colta F. Ives and William Bond Walker (Metropolitan Museum of Art), Anna Lou Ashby, Paul Needham, and Charles Ryskamp (Morgan), Donald Anderle (New York Public Library), Michael T. Ryan (Stanford), and Ralph Franklin and Marjorie G. Wynne (Yale)—as well as Eleanor M. Garvey and Roger E. Stoddard, who arranged for a Harvard book to be deposited at the Grolier Club for his use. He would also have given special thanks to the late Charles Rahn Fry for the loan of many books and for other kindnesses, including a reading of the typescript; to Dr. Jack Eisert for the loan of five books; to the late Lucien Goldschmidt for much advice and for reading the typescript; and to the late Jean Gaylord, his secretary at the Guggenheim Foundation. No doubt he would have acknowledged still other persons whose help I am not aware of. My own thanks go, first of all, to the following institutions and individuals for permission to reproduce—on the website of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia and (in several instances) in the present volume—the images made from material in their collections: Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library (Jean Ashton); Houghton Library, Harvard University (Hope Mayo); Pierpont Morgan Library (Charles E. Pierce, Jr.); New York Public Library (David Ferriero, H. George Fletcher, and Thomas Lisanti); and Stanford University Library (Roberto G. Trujillo and Sean Quimby). I also thank Dr. Jack Eisert for permission to reproduce four illustrations from books in his possession. For help with questions regarding permission or citation, I thank Eileen Sullivan (Metropolitan Museum of Art), Rebecca Warren Davidson (Princeton University Library), and Vincent Giroud and Ellen Cordes (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University— which, through the good offices of Vincent Giroud, provided newly scanned images to replace Ray's slides). (For the specific illustrations that come from each source, see the index to the list of illustrations below; more detailed credit lines accompany each image on the website and each plate in this volume.) For generous assistance of various kinds, I wish to record my indebtedness to Anna Lou Ashby, John Bidwell, Justin Caldwell, Stephen C. Massey, Constance McPhee, Paul Needham, and J. Fernando Peña. Finally, I give particular thanks to four individuals at the University of Virginia who played major roles in helping this work reach publication: Matthew Gibson and Cindy Filer Speer of the Electronic Text Center, who oversaw the careful transfer of the slide images and captions to the Bibliographical Society's website; Elizabeth Lynch, assistant to the editor of Studies in Bibliography, who— in addition to her usual expert proofreading and checking—performed the tasks of matching each slide with its discussion in the text, verifying the vertical and horizontal orientation of each image on the website, locating further information about many of the books from which the slides were made, and writing a preliminary draft of the list of illustrations; and David L. Vander Meulen, editor of Studies in Bibliography, who gave his characteristically detailed and perceptive attention to this work. Plates in This Volume (following page 24) PLATE 1.

      <field name="fulltext">The Art Deco Book in France 1. The Livre d'Art OF THE 1920S I should begin by explaining my choice of topic. Three years ago I wrote a two-volume survey called The Art of the French Illustrated Book, 1700 to 1914, which was published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Pierpont Morgan Library drawn largely from my own collection. In my Introduction I noted that the terminal date had prevented me from dealing with my Art Deco books, which I hoped one day to make "the basis for a small sequel to this history" (1: xxxi). These lectures form the promised sequel. Once I set to work, however, I discovered the drastic inadequacy of what I had collected. Now, notable Art Deco books, especially in decorated bindings of the period, have never been readily available for examination even in France. Since the dispersal of the late Francis Kettaneh's collection, which provided the backbone of the Grolier Club's exhibition of French Art Deco illustration in 1968, they are still less accessible in the United States. But I persisted, and with the assistance of various institutions and private collectors, I have managed to cover the field. My particular indebtedness is to the Spencer Collection in the New York Public Library, the Frank Altschul Collection at Yale, the Morgan Gunst Collection at Stanford, and the remarkable assemblage of books illustrated by the pochoir process still in the process of formation by Charles Rahn Fry of New York City. These holdings will allow me to display and comment on much unique material in the form of drawings, proofs, and especially bindings. I can at least claim that my subject is a timely one. The rediscovery of Art Deco in general, which has been proceeding with increasing fervor for at least 15 years, has gradually made its impression on book collecting. For some time past collectors and institutions concerned with French illustrated books and fine bindings of the 1920s and to a lesser extent the 1930s have found themselves in competition with enthusiasts from the art world who seek these volumes as examples of the Art Deco style. A book created by Schmied in a binding by Cretté with a lacquered panel by Dunand or Jean Toulet's Contrerimes illustrated by Laboureur in a binding by Rose Adler now seems as worthy of a place in their collections as does a cabinet by Ruhlmann or a glass figurine by Lalique. When enterprising auction houses recognized this development by including illustrated books and bindings in their Art Deco catalogues, collectors of Art Deco objects pushed prices to a level that was often several times as high as that to which bibliophiles were accustomed. So it has come about that notable Art Deco books are now vying with the most esteemed livres de peintre at the top of the international auction market. These developments have had their impact on rare book sales generally. Parisian dealers, while setting their prices as usual at a point just below that at which no customer would consider buying, remain unexcited. Having dealt continuously with illustrated books of the 1920s since these volumes began to appear, they have their considered views regarding such wares. Moreover, they know how extensive the reserve supply of them must be. Among dealers elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, however, there has been a disposition to move these books up to the level established at Art Deco auctions. This practice would be legitimate enough, given the importance of Art Deco in the evolution of styles, if the material so offered in fact represented it. But most French illustrated books of the 1920s were largely untouched by Art Deco, just as many decorated morocco bindings of the period were executed by craftsmen who continued to work in an earlier tradition. Moreover, a considerable proportion of the abundant productions of the time, including some of the most elaborate and pretentious, were ill-conceived and poorly carried out. Deprived of the sheltering cloak of Art Deco, most illustrated books of the 1920s require to be appraised individually, with drastically lowered expectations. In view of these conditions, a survey of the field, however tentative and incomplete, would appear to have some practical usefulness. My perspective is that of a collector who for many years has endeavored to find out as much as he could about French illustrated books of the last three centuries. Concerning the volumes of the 1920s the sources of information for the most part are contemporary with the period itself, since these books haven't as yet attracted much attention from modern students. The only general survey remains Raymond Hesse's Le livre d'après guerre et les sociétés de bibliophiles, 1918-1928 (1928). Also helpful is volume 7 (1929), devoted to the book, of the Rapport général de l'exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes, Paris, 1925. For illustration the standard work is Léopold Carteret's Le trésor du bibliophile: livres illustrés modernes, 1875 à 1945, 5 volumes (1946-48), though Clément-Janin's Essai sur la bibliophilie contemporaine de 1900 à 1928, 2 volumes (1931-32) is more enlightening from a critical standpoint. On fine binding during the 1920s there has been modern work of importance, but the only comprehensive treatment is still E. de Crauzat's La reliure française de 1900 à 1925 (1932). Then there are the several periodicals of the period devoted to books and book collecting, particularly Le bibliophile, Byblis, and Plaisir de bibliophile, and more marginally magazines of broader scope like Art et décoration and Arts et métiers graphiques. All of these have proved useful, but of course my main source has been the illustrated books themselves. I propose to limit my account of the Art Deco book in France to the 1920s, or at least to the years 1919 to 1930. This decade was its heyday, the years which saw the appearance of most of the best work of its representative masters. Moreover, the period saw the reemergence of the livre d'art, as the fine illustrated book for collectors was then called, on a quite unprecedented scale. This crescendo of production led to notable achievements as well as deplorable follies and concluded with a catastrophic debacle. I shall thus be dealing with a self-contained episode in the history of book collecting, an episode which embodies some of the elements of high drama. The world of fine illustrated books before the first World War was flourishing but limited. Its requirements were met by perhaps 15 publishers, and its clientele hardly extended beyond a few hundred collectors, most of them well-to-do men of affairs. Prominent on the scene were the Societies of Bibliophiles, under whose aegis were published many of the best books of the time in editions of from 75 to 150 copies. A relatively small number of illustrators, printers, and binders served the needs of what in the perspective of later developments came to seem almost a closed circle. Nonetheless, superb books appeared, though it is true that a few of the most outstanding were published by outsiders such as Ambroise Vollard.1 1. See Gordon N. Ray, The Art of the French Illustrated Book, 1700 to 1914 (2 vols.; New York and Ithaca, 1982), 2; 372-382, 497-498. The conditions imposed by the first World War laid a virtual embargo on the publication of livres d'art. The apparatus that produced them fell apart, the collectors who acquired them had other preoccupations, and even the materials necessary to their making, like fine paper, were not available. Nonetheless, people went on reading, and by Armistice Day four years of scrubby volumes on bad paper had built up a powerful longing for decently produced books of any sort. Looking back in 1929 Georges Grappe remembered how "a sort of mysterious enthusiasm seized upon the elect and made them cherish the Book with an almost ferocious tenderness, that symbol of `values' which, more than all others, were at risk during the bitter conflict."2 2. Grappe's introduction to Très beaux livres . . . composant la bibliothèque de M. R. Marty (Paris, 1930), p. ii. This is the auction catalogue for a sale at the Hôtel Drouot on 1013 February 1930. Among bibliophiles this passion took the form of a hunger for livres d'art, which the small available reserve of pre-War volumes could not begin to assuage. So it happened that there poured into this once restricted preserve what ClémentJanin described as "a torrent of books under which the largest private libraries are being submerged."3 3. Essai sur la bibliophilie contemporaine de 1900 à 1928 (2 vols.; Paris, 1931-32), 1: 7. The hectic aspects of Paris during the 1920s which caused the decade to be called les années folles will figure in my chronicle chiefly as they are reflected in the work of George Barbier. Yet the temper of the age does much to explain the conditions which governed the publication of livres d'art. If rampant prosperity combined with a post-War release from inhibitions to encourage the pursuit of pleasure, these factors stimulated as well an eager desire for luxurious possessions, among them fine books. Nor did bourgeois prudence provide an effective check, since the soundness of the franc was an open question. One observer estimated, indeed, that the public for livres d'art grew ten-fold after the War.4 4. Grappe, in Très beaux livres . . ., p. iv. Clément-Janin discerned three kinds of enthusiasts in this "prodigious development" of book collecting: (1) major collectors prepared to spend 1000 to 5000 francs on a livre d'art limited to 150 copies or fewer, (2) middle-range collectors who would pay up to 500 francs for a book limited to not more than 500 or 600 copies, and (3) lesser collectors able to spend 40 to 100 francs for mass-produced illustrated books in editions of not more than 3000 copies (2: 152-153). Not only were these new collectors numerous and diverse, for the most part they were also undemanding. As long as the mandatory features of the livre d'art were present—special paper, illustrations, and a limited edition—they were easily satisfied. Attracted by this large and ready market, publishers multiplied apace, and so did the books they published. Among those protesting against this incontinence was the art critic Jacques Deville, who permitted himself the following tirade: New publishers are springing up like mushrooms. So much for the time in which they formed a closed corporation of learned men. Publishing has opened itself up to some 50 bold apprentices who throw themselves into the career without the faintest notion of the difficulties which must be surmounted to achieve success: seeking out the illustrators among artists, finding texts which suit them; ensuring that they realize the value in these texts while respecting their own originality; laying out the plan of the book, its architecture, and its decoration; locating suitable materials—paper, inks, colors—and checking prices the while; choosing the printers and craftsmen who will put these materials to use and supervising their work in detail. . . . [Before the War Edouard Pelletan had claimed that a notable publisher could leave behind him "a renown equal to that of great artists."] No such ambition stirs many of these new publishers who dream of money, not reputation. Unrestrained by modesty—or by taste, knowledge, and conscience— they abandon themselves to a flood of publications which swamp the market. Their only preoccupation is to sell.5 5. Quoted by Hesse, Le livre d'art du XIXe siècle à nos jours (Paris, 1927), pp. 149-150. With the field of book illustration so vastly enlarged, many new artists were drawn into it. These recruits were of uneven quality, as Raymond Hesse demonstrates from the example of books with original wood engravings, for some years after the War the kind of illustration most in favor with collectors. Though illustrators like Louis Jou, Carlègle, and Hermann-Paul produced work of distinction, wood engravings, which can be printed conjointly with text, were also the least expensive adornment that was acceptable in collectors' books, and when publishers avid for profit employed journeymen artists, untrained in the craft, the results were usually lamentable (pp. 150-151). In his book of 1927 on 19th and 20th century livres d'art, Hesse drew a devastating picture of the contemporary publishing scene. A year later, when he wrote a volume entirely concerned with the post-War book, he had been led by further study to this more balanced comparison of the pre-War and post-War book: The two periods differ as an English garden does from a virgin forest. In the one: order, method, reason; in the other nature, color, noise, confusion. You walk through the first in entire safety—nothing unexpected but no monsters or wild beasts; in the second, besides unfamiliar and splendid landscapes, you run the constant risk of falling into some mudhole.6 6. Le livre d'après guerre et les sociétés de bibliophiles, 1918-1928 (Paris, 1928), p. 12. One final element in the collecting scene of the 1920s needs to be considered, the extent to which it was affected by speculation. Like other valuable objects, livres d'art could be seen as a hedge against inflation. As in our own time, a collector who bought on publication a book which subsequently became rare and valuable could sell it for a profit. But a dealer writing in 1927 explains why such transactions were rarely carried out systematically. Collectors soon discovered that the price at which a dealer would buy a book from them was only a fraction of the price at which he would offer it for sale. Unless they could afford the time and money required to build a library worthy of dispersal at auction, where prices approximated the market level, the apparent appreciation of their collection was hard to realize. Again, dealers themselves rarely purchased livres d'art in quantity. They were expensive, and they could not be returned for refunds like ordinary editions. Without a large capital, stockpiling was not feasible.7 7. See Yvonne Périer, "Mises au point," La jardin du bibliophile, Christmas 1927, pp. 44-48. It seems likely that the effect of actual speculation on the rare book market of the period has been exaggerated. Yet this is not the whole story. Even if the possessors of livres d'art were not conscious speculators, they went on collecting in part because they had more faith in their books than in a declining franc. This judgment seemed to be confirmed in 1928 when the franc was devalued by 4/5ths (from 19.3 to 3.92 cents) yet the value of livres d'art did not diminish. So it was that, despite uncertainties and reverses, the growth of book production and collecting continued unabated. As late as 1928 Clément-Janin expressed "an absolute faith in the persistence of the movement which has carried book collecting to its current flourishing state." To his mind its soundness had been demonstrated during the great monetary crisis wherein was achieved "that profound transformation, that union of the aesthetic and the financial, . . . [which] makes contemporary book collecting durable" (2: 197, 199). By the winter of 1930-31, before these words were published, the world-wide depression heralded by the Wall Street crash of 1929 had struck France as well. In the first issue of Le bibliophile for February 1931, Marcel Valotaire wrote despairingly of "this crisis of the livre d'art, the very idea of which weighs heavily on the mind as much of collectors as of printers, publishers, and book-sellers" (p. 31). It had been discovered that in these desperate times the world of rare books was doubly vulnerable. If automobiles ceased to sell, it was because the market was saturated, not because the product was unsatisfactory. The years since the War, however, had seen an absurd multiplication of alleged livres d'art, the work of untrained publishers, designers, and illustrators. While money was plentiful, undiscriminating collectors had freely bought these regrettable productions. But now the book trade was faced with a comprehensive failure of confidence, with an accompanying "disgust, disdain, repudiation by purchasers in the face of the poor, or at least doubtful EN ÉCOUTANT SATIE 1920 MODES ET MANIÈRES D'AUJOURD'HUI Pl.

On the collapse of the rare book market and its consequences, see also Jean Bruller, "Le livre d'art en France: essai d'un classement rationnel," Arts et métiers graphiques, 26 (15 November 1931), 41-66. During the early 1930s, as publishers and bookdealers failed, illustrators and printers went without work, and collectors saw the value of their holdings reduced to a fraction of their cost, these recriminations became commonplace. Despite a substantial improvement in the conditions of rare book production and collecting in the years before the second World War, the reputation of the illustrated books of the 1920s never entirely recovered from the debacle of 1930-31. The history just rehearsed makes it evident that any survey of the livres d'art of the 1920s must begin with the question: what proportion of these hundreds of titles (well over a thousand, indeed, if demi-luxe volumes are included) deserves attention today? The answer is, a considerable number, for if the period produced many bad books, it also produced many good ones. At the risk of seeming arbitrary, I propose several categories of worthy survivors. Pride of place must be accorded to livres de peintre, though in fact the decade saw the appearance chiefly of lesser works of this kind. Only in 1929 and 1930 did the splendid series of major books with original graphics by great painters, the glory of 20th century French book production, really get under way. Charles-Louis Philippe's Bubu de Montparnasse with etchings by Dunoyer de Segonzac was published in the former year, Apollinaire's Calligrammes with lithographs by de Chirico and Eugène Montfort's La belle enfant with etchings by Dufy in the latter.9 9. See W. J. Strachan's survey in The Artist and the Book in France (London, 1969), pp. 50-62. It should be noted that collectors in general were hardly more welcoming to the livre de peintre in the 1920s than they had been before the War. The set of their minds on this topic is exampled in some remarks of Marcel Valotaire, then one of the most knowledgeable and influential of writers on the livre d'art. He wrote of the designs of Laboureur that they are decorative in their drawing, decorative in their rendering. They are not painter's engravings—an abomination in a book!—, they are the engravings of a graphic artist, established with that solid balance which is the most substantial tie between image and type-page: in a word they are perfect illustrations.10 10. Laboureur (Paris, 1929), p. 44. Then there were the established illustrators who resumed their careers after the War. The most distinguished was Maurice Denis, who pursued his serene course with a series of books in which his enchanting drawings were engraved and printed in color with perfect fidelity by the Beltrands. Also notable were Edgar Chahine, Paul-Émile Colin, Georges Jeanniot, Charles Jouas, Auguste Leroux, and Bernard Naudin. To these may be added Charles Guérin, a master of lithographic illustration who came into prominence just after the War. Chahine and Jouas also played important roles in the revival of etching. Notable among the colleagues who joined them in displaying the scenery, the architecture, and to a lesser extent the people of France, sometimes working alone, sometimes banded together in the publications of the Société de Saint Eloi, were Auguste Brouet, P.-A. Bouroux, André Dauchez, Pierre Gusman, and towards the end of the decade, Albert Decaris. Original wood engraving was even more central than etching to the livre d'art, not only in the illustrations of such men as Carlègle and Hermann-Paul, but also in the more comprehensive contributions of three artist-craftsmen who had been trained as wood engravers, FrançoisLouis Schmied, Louis Jou, and Jean-Gabriel Daragnès. The three latter were the leading architectes du livre of the time, that is to say workers capable by themselves of creating all the components of a livre d'art. As colored illustrations came gradually to predominate over those in black and white in the middle and later 1920s, the ascendancy of Schmied and George Barbier was confirmed, the former as the master craftsman of wood engravings printed in color, and the latter as the supreme color stylist, whether his designs were rendered by engraving or by pochoir. Guy Arnoux, Pierre Brissaud, Umberto Brunelleschi, Pierre Falké, Paul Jouve, Georges Lepape, Charles Martin, André-Édouard Marty, and Sylvain Sauvage also stand out for their work in this line. A number of artists took as their starting point the rejection of the literal detail favored by most pre-War illustrators. Instead they turned to quick, vivid sketches of contemporary life, often accompanying texts by such new novelists as Francis Carco, Jean Giraudoux, Pierre Mac Orlan, and Paul Morand. In this group were Gus Bofa, Chas Laborde, Dignimont, and Vertès. Literal realism was equally repugnant to the artists who imposed individual styles of calculated distortion on their subjects. Laboureur was preeminent here, though he had found a formidable rival in Alexeieff by the end of the decade. Though the best work of all of these artists still deserves the collector's attention, my consideration must be limited to those among them in whose books the Art Deco style is most pronounced. The three lectures following will accordingly center on Barbier, Schmied, and Laboureur, with a final discourse concerned chiefly with Pierre Legrain, the master of Art Deco binding. Along the way there will be some discussion of related figures of lesser importance. Since the incontestable mark of Art Deco in the livre d'art was its emphasis on decoration as opposed to illustration, Schmied's early work, in which the representational element is minimal, offers its purest exemplification. In his later books Schmied supplements decoration with illustration, though he rarely allows the latter to predominate. Abstract decoration was not to Barbier's taste, but throughout his work representational subjects are subordinated to decorative treatment. No doubt his designs are sufficiently striking in conception, but they make their impression above all by their decorative values. The connection with Art Deco of a third kind of livre d'art, which I shall represent through Laboureur, cannot be made so directly. The book had an important place in the great Exhibition of Decorative and Industrial Art held in Paris during 1925. The criterion that dictated the choice of examples to be shown, however, was not so much their decorative qualities as their modernity. Article IV in the general rules of the Exhibition provided that only works of "novel inspiration and real originality"11 11. Quoted by Crauzat, La reliure française de 1900 à 1925 (2 vols.; Paris, 1932), 2: 175. were to be admitted. The French illustrated books displayed had been chosen primarily to demonstrate the variety of techniques and talents of the day. In reviewing these selections the anonymous author of volume 7 of the Rapport général of the Exhibition, that devoted to the book, offers some enlightening comments. While according Schmied more space than any other book-artist, he is at pains to point out at length the surprising ways in which the decorative spirit had affected the vision of other illustrators. "This influence has its part in the tendencies [of the time] towards distortion, in all the liberties that an artist takes with his subject, in the increasingly symbolic character of the design." Moreover, as the pace of modern life grows increasingly rapid, it has to be set down with the briefest of notations. "Accessories are suppressed, the design is reduced to the minimum of lines needed to render it visible at a glance."12 12. Rapport général de l'exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes, Paris, 1925, 7 (Paris, 1929), 51. Laboureur, better than any other bookartist of the 1920s, exemplifies these characteristics. With decorated bookbinding we are back on firmer ground. The work of Pierre Legrain, like that of his numerous imitators, was assertively decorative in nature. Indeed, fine binding during this period was dominated by the growing ascendancy of the Art Deco style after its appeal was demonstrated in the Exhibition of 1925. With these generalities out of the way, I can turn at last to the books themselves. My concern during the balance of this lecture will be the steps by which Art Deco book illustration emerged during the years before 1920. If the War had not intervened in 1914, it seems likely that Art Deco would have made its impression on book illustration without further delay. All the elements necessary to its development were in place when the guns of August imposed a five year intermission on this kind of artistic activity, as on nearly all others. The groundwork had been laid by three kinds of publications: design portfolios, magazines and albums devoted to high fashion, and albums about the Ballets Russes or otherwise concerned with dance and the theatre. Finally a few illustrated books had been published in which the main features of Art Deco were already to be found. It will be noted that the names of certain artists recur again and again in the account which follows of these varied productions. Perhaps Art Deco is displayed in its purest form in the design portfolios of the 1920s. Their plates were executed by pochoir, that is to say, they were illuminated—to use the word favored by Jean Saudé, the master of pochoir—by water color or gouache through the use of stencils. In conception and layout these portfolios can be traced back to the celebrated Grammar of Ornament by Owen Jones, which appeared in 1856. An important intermediate work was Eugène Grasset's La plante et ses applications ornementales, published in two series in 1896 and 1898. Where Jones had endeavored to classify and illustrate every type of ornament, Grasset turned from man-made inventions to natural forms. His plates, which were drawn by his students, continue Jones's arrangement of several patterns to the page, and they are sometimes varied by the superimposition of objects decorated with these patterns (a vase, a 1.1 pitcher) or shaped in their image (a candlestick, a chair). In the plate shown (first series, plate 66) the object is a mosaic bookbinding. Grasset's portfolios are a monument to Art Nouveau, exhibiting the various possibilities of flore ornementale. E. A. Séguy's Floréal of 1914 1.2 also takes its departure from the plant, but as may be seen from plate 17 its designs are adapted with such verve and freedom that the Art Nouveau element has virtually disappeared. Moreover, its pochoir plates, with their subtle gradation of color, exist in a different world from the process reproductions of Grasset's book. A plate (plate 19) from a representative Art Deco portfolio of the 1920s affords a suitable conclusion to this topic. 1.3 Natural objects are still the basis for the drawings in Edouard Bénédictus' Variations of 1923, yet they tend increasingly towards abstract forms, and Saudé's pochoir work, which makes use of a wide gamut of colors including silver, is even richer than that in Floréal. I shall not be returning to design portfolios, for they can hardly be regarded as illustrated books. It should be stated, nonetheless, that they are both numerous and dazzling. In comparison with their variety and brilliance, indeed, much Art Deco illustration seems pallid and constrained. And of course their large format makes them particularly attractive for exhibition purposes. The first landmark in the high fashion tradition which led to Art Deco illustration was Les robes de Paul Poiret of 1908. The great couturier, who had left Worth's in 1904 to establish his own firm, was already famous for the uncorsetted freedom of his novel creations, which women everywhere found distinctive and flattering. In commemoration of his success Poiret commissioned Paul Iribe, one of his many artist friends, to prepare a luxurious album devoted to his work. Iribe focussed 1.4 attention on Poiret's gowns by rendering them in pochoir against rudimentary backgrounds of black and white. There is no pretence on the part of the artist that the figures presented are anything but models. Three years later appeared a still more sumptuous sequel called Les choses de Paul Poiret vues par Georges Lepape. When Poiret asked Lepape to undertake the volume, the young painter brought him four designs, charming in their simplicity, but also intended to depict models. These are reproduced at the end of the album. After he was shown Poiret's creations, however, he was asked to give his fancy free rein, with varied and engaging results that go far beyond a fashion parade. None of his drawings is like any other in conception, but all are linked in style. Lepape renders even better than Iribe the supple elegance that was Poiret's trademark, yet his most striking design is devoted to another 1.5 house specialty, the turban. As Poiret had predicted, the album made Lepape's reputation. These two albums had been devoted to a single couturier, if admittedly the best known. La gazette du bon ton, which began to appear in 1912 and continued until 1926, though with an intermission of nearly six years following the outbreak of the War, took the whole world of fashion as its province: Doucet, Paquin, Worth, and the rest, as well as Poiret. At the heart of each issue were 10 pochoir plates, but there were also essays, intended to amuse rather than to inform, on various articles of apparel, on the accoutrements of high life, indeed on choses d'élégance in general. There was a monthly review of theatrical costumes and settings, as well as a column of gossip devoted to fashion and good taste. The text of these pieces was made attractive by pochoir vignettes executed as carefully as the plates. In sum, the magazine represented a way of life, however rarefied and specialized. Lucien Vogel was already known as the editor of Art et décoration when he decided to launch a magazine which would accomplish for his epoch what the Journal des dames et des modes had done over the years 1797 to 1839, also with colored plates as its chief attraction. Seeking bold and daring collaborators who would see the world with fresh eyes, he looked especially to young painters, and he found the nucleus of his staff in Pierre Brissaud, Georges Lepape, and André-Édouard Marty, who had studied together at the Atelier of Fernand Cormon. Their characteristic note of neo-dandyism was caught many years later by a fellow student, Jean Dulac. Remarking that "their personal elegance, like that of their designs, drew willingly on the past, while not taking it very seriously," he went on to recall that "it was a time when there was a growing preoccupation with putting into all the details of life a note of curious research, when the word amusing tended to replace the word pretty. . . . A cult of literature of the past, a decorative sense, a half-joking wish to imbue everything with an artistic intention, [and] a sometimes ironic taste for the portrayal of polite society made up the program of these young artists."13 13. Quoted by Marcel Valotaire, "Jean Dulac," Byblis, 8 (1929), 111-112. There were other collaborators, among them Barbier, Brunelleschi, Arnoux, and Martin, to whom Dulac's words apply with equal force. La gazette du bon ton from its origin was one of the most soughtafter of fashion publications. Its success, of course, was owing principally to its plates, which are not only records of the dress of the time but also fresh and attractive compositions in themselves. Sometimes they have a 1.6 dramatic element as well. In Lepape's design, "Le jaloux: robe du soir de Paul Poiret" (April 1913), a pretty girl is wooed by an admirer while her elderly protector clenches his fist in rage. The vignettes in the text 1.7 are often true illustrations, as is the case with the scenes from Boris Gudonov with which Marty illustrates an article on the Ballets Russes of June 1913 (pp. 246-247). Altogether, the style and format of La gazette du bon ton presage what the Art Deco book would become when freed from the fashion straight-jacket. A second significant fashion publication of the period was the almanac Modes et manières d'aujourd'hui, a slim annual with 12 pochoir plates. Each of its three pre-War volumes had a different illustrator: Lepape in 1912, Martin in 1913, and Barbier in 1914. Their drawings are more ingeniously elaborated than those for La gazette du bon ton. 1.8 Indeed, "L'Ilot" (plate 7) in Barbier's volume may more properly be compared with his depiction of the ballet, "Le spectre de la rose," of the same year, so little is his focus on the bathing dress displayed and so much on the scene of impending seduction. The essentially literary nature of Barbier's talent is witnessed by the ease with which Henri de Régnier invented an accompanying narrative for each of his designs. The imposing pre-War albums devoted to dance and the theatre were inspired for the most part by the Ballets Russes, whose Parisian triumphs had begun in 1909. George Barbier haunted these performances, to which in 1913 and 1914 he devoted collections of drawings, the first concerned with Nijinsky, the second with Tamara Karsavina. These albums have a prominent place in ballet history, but their strongest interest lies elsewhere. Subordinating the opulence of the ballets' productions, but conveying their strangeness and mystery, he concentrated his attention on the principal dancers. As his fellow spectator and devotee Paul Drouot observed, he showed, not gods in their accustomed mythological roles, but "young men and women raised to divine status by their ravishing beauty. You can feel them live, that is to say, love, desire, leap; they are nothing but muscles, supple exertions, nerves, moments of rest between violent gratifications."14 14. Quoted by J.-L. Vaudoyer, George Barbier (Paris, 1929), pp. 25-26. Nijinsky was the particular object of Barbier's admiration. Like Francis de Miomandre, who wrote the introduction to his Dessins sur les danses de Vaslav Nijinsky, Barbier saw him as unique among artists, "of another essence from ourselves." In his 12 pochoir plates he showed Nijinsky to be as much a mime as a dancer, adapting himself even in physical appearance to each new role. So the stalwart Ethiopian slave of 1.9 "Sheherazade" became the elusive boy of "Le spectre de la rose."15 15. I have used the English edition of Barbier's album: Designs on the Dances of Vaslav Nijinsky, translated from the French by C. W. Beaumont (London, 1913). Album dédié à Tamar Karsavina is Barbier's early masterpiece. Its cover design pays homage to Beardsley, another master of decorative art, and its 12 pochoir plates depict Karsavina in her principal parts. That their purpose is again to stir the emotion and delight the eye of the 1.10 viewer, not to document the performance, is demonstrated by "Le spectre de la rose," glimpsed at the moment when the phantom lover, of whom the young girl has dreamed after the ball, is about to disappear as the rose drops from her hand. Even more lavish are two further albums, Les masques et les personnages de la comédie italienne, which was published in 1914, with 12 pochoir plates by Brunelleschi, and Sports et Divertissements, in which the score by Erik Satie and 20 pochoir plates by Charles Martin are dated 1914, though the album seems to have appeared at a later date. In his masked figures from an imaginary commedia dell'arte troupe Brunelle- 1.11 schi emphasizes costume and setting. As "Arlequin" reveals, they are highly decorative. Much more idiosyncratic is Sports et divertissements. Satie invites the reader to approach the fantasies of music and design which make up this work in a smiling mood. To discourage pedants who decline to do so, he begins with an "unappetizing choral," into which he has put "all that he knows about tedium." Martin's elegant, mannered drawings for the scenes of sport and pleasure suggested by Satie's compo- 1.12 sitions are in the same mocking, light-hearted vein. Witness "La balançoire." The result is a creation which both in spirit and in style might date from 1924 instead of 1914. Finally, there were a few significant illustrated books in which the Art Deco style already predominates published in 1914 or earlier. Francis Jammes' Clara d'Ellebeuse, illustrated by Robert Bonfils, appeared in 1912; Balzac's Le père Goriot, illustrated by Pierre Brissaud, in 1913; and Le cantique des cantiques and Makéda, reine de Saba, chronique éthiopienne, both illustrated by Barbier, in 1914. Bonfils, Barbier, and Schmied also had major books in progress on which they were able to work intermittently during the War. Otherwise nothing significant was to come of the preparations that have been described until the end of the decade. Indeed, the production of collectors' books of any kind over the next four years was minimal. For the soldier-artist, even one who found inspiration in war-time conditions, only the simplest means were available. Yet Laboureur, for example, worked out his cubist style in makeshift albums of wood engravings like Types de l'armée américaine en France (1918) and Images de l'arrière (1919), where he found satisfaction in glimpses of characters from the A.E.F. and the behind-the-lines activities 1.13 of Allied soldiers. Witness a scene of black dock-workers in the former album. Meanwhile, the publisher Meynial had revived the almanac with the publication on Christmas day 1916 of the first volume of La guirlande des mois. This small book is better described as a war-time keepsake than a publication of high fashion, since soldiers back from the front share 1.14 Barbier's five pochoir plates with elegant ladies. There is even an Art Deco battle scene (p. 40). In its miniature way La guirlande des mois is a livre de luxe, but when Meynial replaced it with Falbalas et Fanfreluches in 1922, it was not without a deprecatory allusion in the final volume to "the artistic character of a publication produced during the War."16 16. La guirlande des mois, 1921, pp. 136-137. If a World War had been the least propitious of all settings for illustrated books, peace-time, when it came, promised to be the most propitious. For Art Deco books Robert Bonfils was the artist who led the way out of this prolonged period of arrested development. Some notice of his early work will thus form a fitting conclusion to this account of the anticipations of Art Deco illustration during the 1910s. Though unconnected with the Gazette du bon ton—he had, however, studied at the Atelier Cormon—Bonfils provided between 1912 and 1919 in five graceful and unpretentious volumes a model for the kind of elegant and colorful illustration that the artists of that journal were to achieve in their books of the 1920s. Perhaps because of its seeming slightness, Bonfils' work as an illustrator, in contrast to his work as a designer of bindings, has not yet received its due. After his apprentice years in Paris, Bonfils occupied himself with painting, sculpture, and especially the decorative arts. A friend of those days described him as "a tall young man, naturally affable, restrained in gesture, with a grave and musical voice." He passed his days "looking about him, plucking the flower from everything, with an elegant nonchalance. He did not think it frivolous to paint his reveries on the leaf of a fan."17 17. Léon Deshairs, "Robert Bonfils," Art et décoration, 55 (January-June 1929), 33-34. From these casual beginnings he went on to a notable career in the decorative arts which extended to designs for porcelain, clothes, fabrics, even tapestries. But the principal focus of his activities was book illustration and binding design. A man of broad culture, he fell into the habit of drawing in the margins of his favorite poems and stories, and when he turned to book illustration, he thought of his designs as a continuation of this practice. His first book of importance was Francis Jammes' Clara d'Ellebeuse of 1912. Its success led in 1913 to commissions for Henri de Régnier's Les rencontres de monsieur de Bréot and Gerard de Nerval's Sylvie, the latter from the distinguished publisher François Bernouard, hailed by Raymond Hesse as "one of the inspirers of the great `decorative arts effort of 1925' " (p. 146). The war deferred the appearance of these books until 1919. Verlaine's Fêtes galantes with Bonfils' designs appeared in 1915, and "Lover's" Au moins soyez discret in 1919. Sylvie had engravings printed in three colors; the other four volumes were illustrated by pochoir over wood engravings printed in a single color. Having selected slight but agreeable texts, often with 18th century settings, Bonfils was under no obligation to individualize the figures in them or to present these figures in scenes of dramatic conflict. Instead he could use their activities as occasions for the sympathetic decoration of his pages. He did this for the most part through vignettes, sometimes serving as simple ornaments, sometimes of ampler proportions. Effortless improvisations in appearance, they represent in fact the nicest calculations regarding the best means to achieve his ends. Moreover, he delighted in subtle combinations of color, which are bright and lively, but 1.15 never garish. For such an approach pochoir was the ideal process. Witness the washes by which Clara d'Ellebeuse is portrayed in her big sun-hat as she looks out into the morning light (p. 11). Bonfils' mastery of decora- 1.16 tive patterns is exampled in his headpiece to the first chapter of Les rencontres de monsieur de Bréot (p. 1), preparing the way for Régnier's account of a private theatrical performance. Two albums of the period are of particular interest because they show Bonfils working through plates rather than vignettes and as an inventor rather than a commentator. The seven pochoir plates of Divertissements des princesses qui s'ennuient are perhaps his most ambitious drawings, on a scale and accorded a fullness of treatment unmatched elsewhere in his work as an illustrator. Their subject is the amusements of three young ladies at a country house. In keeping with his epigraph from Mallarmé, "Princesse, nommez-nous berger de vos souris," Bonfils treats them with indulgence, but does not disguise the languor of their luxurious lives. Still, it is the opportunity for piquant yet harmonious Art Deco com- 1.17 positions, such as "La promenade" (plate 1), which chiefly interests him. The volume allotted to Bonfils in Modes et manières d'aujourd'hui is dated 1920 on the title page, though it did not appear until 1922. Its 12 pochoir plates are more fully developed than is usual with the artist. They have no theme, but their emphasis is rather on manners than on fashion, almost leading one to question Robert Burnand's insistence that "no designer is less documentary than Bonfils."18 18. "Robert Bonfils: peintre, illustrateur, relieur," Byblis, 8 (1929), 51. Among the aspects of post-War French life presented are the singing of the "Marseillaise" at a theatre, bargain day in a department store, and a family in mourning which watches a military parade from a balcony. Like the other plates, 1.18 the evening party of "En écoutant Satie" (plate 11) is an exercise in perspective. After 1928 Bonfils illustrated few books. His time was given over to his students at the École Estienne, where he was Professeur de Composition Décorative, and to the writing of a learned manual on La gravure et le livre, which was published in 1938. One may regret that this book is devoted almost exclusively to technical matters, though the author's predilections emerge when he praises original graphics, with their life and spontaneity, as a quick way "for the artist to fix his emotions" (p. 102). Bonfils is one of the most innovative and delightful of Art Deco illustrators. Appreciation of his slim, elegant quartos is bound to increase. 2. George Barbier My subject today is George Barbier, the direct inheritor of the tradition of pre-1920 illustration traced in my first lecture. By epitomizing the more refined fantasies of the Parisian world of pleasure during the following decade, he became the most haunting of Art Deco book artists. From a consideration of Barbier's career I'll proceed to a discussion of pochoir, the stencil process which he supported by employing it, despite the prevailing disapproval of bibliophiles, in several of his major works. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, the most reliable source for what little information is available about Barbier's early years,19 19. George Barbier (Paris, 1929), volume 10 in the collection "Les artistes du livre published by Henri Babou. relates that he was born in Nantes on 10 October 1882 of a good bourgeois family. After leaving school, where he took the drawing prize year after year, he studied design with local artists. Vaudoyer speculates that the old buildings of the city to which Auguste Lepère was to pay tribute in Nantes en dix-neuf cent must have awakened in him a sense of the past, just as the paintings of it well-stocked museum, where Watteau and Ingres were represented, mus have nourished his artistic vocation. He found a patron in A. Lotz Brissonneau, a leading industrialist of Nantes who was later to compil the standard catalogue of Lepère's etchings and wood-engravings. By 1908 Barbier was in Paris, working with Jean-Paul Laurens at th École des Beaux-Arts.20 20. In the other chief essay on the artist, "George Barbier, costumier des muse Plaisir de bibliophile, 19-20 (1929), 134-147, Clément-Janin is evidently mistaken in placi his coming to Paris in 1911, though both writers had information from Barbier himself. He haunted the Louvre, applying himself particularly to the collections of Greek antiquities. When Vaudoyer me 2.1 Barbier in 1910, he found him to be "a tall, elegant blond young man quiet and reserved" (p. 8). Indeed, Vaudoyer took him for an Englishma especially since he then signed his drawings "E.-W. Larry." At his firs exhibition at the Boutet de Monvel gallery during the following year hi water colors were grouped by categories which matched his predomina interests: Greek dancers, dancers from the Ballets Russes, and "Belles d Moment." Pierre Louÿs, who wrote the preface to the exhibition's catalogue, praised Barbier for having captured the Hellenic spirit with n taint of Roman influence. "Not one of his figures could appear on a authentic Greek vase. But they are part of the same line. It is not im tation, it is continuation."21 21. Quoted by Vaudoyer, p. 17. Barbier was now fairly launched on his career. We have alread seen how his Ballets Russes albums, his depictions of "Belles du M ment" in the Gazette du bon ton, and his earliest illustrated books had brought him recognition. If the War delayed for some years his wider success, he was at least able to add to his already extensive knowledge of the dress of past eras and to work on the illustration of further volumes which were eventually to achieve publication. Indeed, it is unnecessary to carry this biographical summary further, for Barbier's pattern of life was permanently established. Recognized as one of the master decorators of the time, he found his services in demand in many fields, but his specialties remained theatrical costumes and settings and above all book decoration. Three years before his death Clément-Janin wrote: "It is by the book that George Barbier has succeeded with the great public. The book is the most powerful transmitter of fame. The most warmly welcomed exhibitions don't attract the attention accorded to a successful book" (p. 146). Of the many titles in Barbier's bibliography it will be necessary to restrict discussion to the most considerable. Those published during the decade of the War have been cited in the previous lecture. Beginning in 1920 his major books were: Le bonheur du jour, 1920 Falbalas et fanfreluches, 5 volumes, 1922-1926 Albert Flament, Personnages de comédie, 1922 Pierre Louÿs, Les chansons de Bilitis, 1922 Maurice de Guérin, Poèmes en prose, 1928 Verlaine, Fêtes galantes, 1928 Marcel Schwob, Les vies imaginaires, 1929 Choderlos de Laclos, Les liaisons dangereuses, 1934. Mention will also be made of the albums in which his work for the theatre is reproduced and of representative titles among the several demi-luxe volumes, typically issued in editions of 1000 copies, to which he turned his hand. The 16 engraved plates of Le bonheur du jour, ou les grâces à la mode, which were colored by pochoir, are among the largest and most carefully meditated of Barbier's designs. So ambitious was this album, indeed, that it took him from 1920 to 1924 to complete it to his satisfaction.22 22. Nine of its 16 plates date from 1920, three from 1921, and four from 1924. A study both of fashion and of manners, it was offered to those who like to link the present with the past by comparing them even in so frivolous a matter as costume as well as to inquiring observers of the current scene. Barbier begins his introduction with a selective summary of fashion illustration from the 16th century on, finding a specific predecessor for his own work in Horace Vernet's well-known recrod of first Empire costume, Incroyables et merveilleuses, published about 1814: The period was very like our own, for fear heightens pleasure. These dandies [incroyables] and their ladies [merveilleuses] danced at Tivoli, the allies crowded the galleries of the Palais Royal, the doors of gambling halls and houses of ill fame stood ajar. . . . In our time a similar impatience fills the dancers. Couples, softly embracing, sway to the fluid rhythm of the tango, keeping time to raging cymbals. By showing the dress, the accoutrements, the interiors of his age, Barbier expected to catch its spirit as well: The pages that follow are intended to evoke the ostentatious pomp of the year of peace 1920, . . . everything that glitters, everything that burns, everything that at once annoys and pleases. . . . You will find here lacquer furniture, pekinese dogs, jade rings, and rivulets of pearls, nothing will be neglected that might please you, for we humbly solicit the approval of the frivolous and the indulgence of the wise, seeking to please the one and to amuse the other. (pp. 1-2) On the title page one of Barbier's distinctive cupids holds a cornucopia from which pour such trifles as powder puffs, gloves, fans, and masks. The early plates emphasize fashion on the pattern of Incroyables et merveilleuses, though the manners of the day are not neglected. The artist's mention of a "hermaphrodite couple" is borne out by the contours and coiffures of the figures in plates 1 and 5, "Les alliés à Versailles" 2.2 and "L'Amour est aveugle." Plates 6 to 9 offer stunning "interiors in the taste of the day, walls lit-up, shadowed mirrors, irresistible divans, veiled lights, rooms invented for idleness and pleasure by a decorator-poet, 2.3 charming and uninhabitable." In "Minuit! . . ou l'appartement à la mode" (plate 7), one should not fail to notice that it is a book by DeQuincey which has brought the young lady to her state of comic alarm. 2.4 The design is thus the natural prelude to "Chez la marchande des pavots" (plate 8), in which androgynous opium-smokers of 1920 offer a langorous contrast to the robust dandies of 1814 evoked by Barbier in his Intro- 2.5 duction. The magnificent lacquer screen of "Le goût des laques" (plate 9) distracts attention even from the plate's silver and golden gowns and jade and pearl ornaments. In his final designs, composed in 1924, Barbier goes well beyond the plan with which he began his series. No longer content with intimate interiors, he now shows the spectacle which society 2.6 provides for the public, at the beach in "Au lido" (plate 14) and at the 2.7 break-up of an evening party in "Au revoir" (plate 16). Put on their implications, these panoramas epitomize the ambiguities of a little world whose arrogance matches its elegance. Closely associated with Le bonheur du jour, both in date and in conception, is Falbalas et fanfreluches, almanach des modes présentes, passées et futures. These five volumes, which appeared between 1922 and 1926, were the publisher Meynial's lavish peacetime sequel to La guirlande des mois. They contain 60 pochoir plates, as well as a decorative cover design and an amusing title-page vignette for each volume. 2.8 Seeking to preserve for himself complete freedom of choice, Barbier 2.9 took all costume for his province. No doubt contemporary France would most often claim his attention, but he was at liberty to "ransack the ages and spoil the climes." The Comtesse de Noailles, who introduced the first volume, told the artist: "You want us to travel together, you, your readers, and I, into the hidden and always changing land of dress, and I gladly admit that fashion, with its audacities, its fantasies, its reticences, has the same possibilities as a voyage around the world, that it teaches like history, sets us dreaming like the seasons, softens, delights, saddens through love like poetry" (1: 4). This is surely the perspective from which to appreciate Falbalas et fanfreluches, despite the assertive frivolity of its title, for the designs go far beyond its promised frippery and frills. Each plate is a carefully developed tableau, though on a scale much less ambitious than in Le bonheur du jour, which has points of interest beyond its brilliant depiction of costume and setting. Barbier's usual subject is a love scene, some piquant situation which he can enliven with the freshness and sensual appeal of youth. Indeed, in his historical plates, which range throughout Europe and North America, he rarely chooses any other. Typical is 2.10 "Gentils propos" from the volume for 1922, placed in 19th century Czechoslovakia. The majority of Barbier's drawings are devoted to the France of his own day, and among them are to be found some memorable inventions. 2.11 Consider "Le soir" in the volume for 1926. The subject is a jazz-age couple before a lacquer screen, but the viewer's attention is fixed on the nearby statuette of a naked dwarf, dissipated yet vestigially fashionable, rendered in the manner of the African sculpture which was then at the height of its vogue. The plate has a broader humor than Barbier usually allows himself. The best known plates of Falbalas et fanfreluches are those depicting the seven deadly sins in the volume for 1925. Here one finds a great theme of western iconographical tradition made at home in Barbier's special world. "Anger" shows a modish couple quarrelling in a formal garden, "Envy" is displayed by a maid regarding her mistress as 2.12 she steps from a Rolls Royce, and "Gluttony" is etherealized into "La gourmandise." Falbalas et fanfreluches was the last of Barbier's books to reflect contemporary life directly. This part of his work will always have a special value for the unique way in which it catches the tone and mood of les années vingt. Yet one understands why he ceased to follow this path. Vaudoyer said of Barbier as an artist that he was not "interested in human beings as they are, but as they were, as they might be, if not as they ought to be" (p. 11). Selective as his view of the present had been— only the most seductive figures, only the most elegant dress and decor— the modern world still imposed a constraint upon him. "In the dark backward and abysm of time," his choices were limitless. No doubt it was a relief to him to forsake observation for revery. Certainly his mind was filled with available images. All his life he had frequented museums, antique shops, and bookstores. He had the history of costume at his finger tips. The two volume catalogue of the sale of his library offers striking testimony to his inexhaustible curiosity and wide-ranging connoisseurship.23 23. Catalogue de la bibliothèque de feu M.

The 19th century is there in abundance, both with regard to books, where Gustave Doré was a special favorite, and albums of lithographs, where Gavarni stands out. As one would expect, there are substantial sections on the dance and on costume. When Barbier applied himself to brief surveys of the history of costume illustration or of the pochoir process, he had no need to go beyond his own shelves to write them. Most illuminating for the student of Barbier's work, however, are the parts of the catalogue, by far the largest, devoted to 20th century illustrated books and literary first editions. In his introduction Jean Giraudoux speaks warmly of Barbier's quick eye and generous admiration for talent among the workers of his own time. So one finds most of the outstanding illustrated books of the Belle Époque, with particular attention being paid to Maurice Denis, Auguste Lepère, Louis Legrand, and LucOlivier Merson. Across the Channel Aubrey Beardsley, Charles Ricketts, and Lucien Pissarro are fully represented. Among Barbier's favored illustrators of the 1920s were such early associates as Guy Arnoux, Pierre Brissaud, Charles Martin, and André-Édouard Marty, as well as Alexeieff, Chas Laborde, Daragnès, Pierre Falké, Laboureur, and Schmied. The literary first editions include substantial runs of Gide, Giraudoux, Louÿs, Henri de Régnier, and Valéry. Throughout, the books are in collectors' condition. Indeed, Barbier's copies of those in which he himself was concerned are often in decorated morocco bindings by Canape, Cretté, or Marius Michel, with much added material in the form of water colors, proofs, and manuscripts. A motivating force behind Barbier's habit of taking pains with all aspects of the books which he illustrated was his comprehension from his own experience of what collectors value. Of course Barbier drew on these extensive materials as an artist rather than as a scholar. Carteret argued that his retrospective designs appealed to "a public fond of reconstructions which captured the tone of fashion in different epochs."24 24. Le trésor du bibliophile: livres illustrés modernes, 1875 à 1945 (5 vols.; Paris, 194648), 3: 178. Yet it seems absurd to regard plates such as those in Falbalas et fanfreluches with headings like "Switzerland, 18th century" or "Antilles, 19th century" as so many contributions to the understanding of past modes of dress. The artist used his timetravelling as a means of confining his imagination to particular circumstances which would yield a satisfactory drawing. The resulting compositions belong to Barbier-land rather than to history. The year 1922 saw the appearance of two books illustrated by Barbier which had their origin before the War. Of all literary texts Les chansons de Bilitis by Pierre Louÿs enjoyed his most persistent devotion. These prose poems, which purported to be translations from the Greek of songs composed by a poetess of Sappho's time, were published in 1894. In 1910 Barbier adorned Lotz-Brissonneau's copy of the 1898 edition with 65 water-colors, 26 of them full page, signed "E.-W. Larry." In a letter to his patron, after affirming his devotion to ancient Greece, he remarked of Louÿs' work: "It is all licentiousness and beauty and I would have wished in my drawings to convey something of the sensuality and color with which he animates these perfect poems."25 25. See the remarkable catalogue Livres illustrés 1900-1930 from Slatkine Beaux Livres (Geneva, 1980), item 43. Commissioned by Pierre Corrard to provide illustrations for a major edition of Les chansons de Bilitis, Barbier immediately set about further drawings, but Corrard died in 1914, and his widow finally published the book in an edition of 125 copies in only 1922. A handsome quarto, remarkable for its layout and typography as well as for its illustrations, which were engraved by Schmied and printed in color, it might have vied with Schmied's Le livre de la jungle as an example of the sumptuous realizations which lay within the grasp of post-War bookmakers if it had appeared three years earlier. Certainly it contains Barbier's most varied studies of the female form. 2.13 Two examples must suffice: "Les trois beautés de Mnasidika," in which a nymph tells of the sacrifices she has made to Aphrodite for her lover 2.14 (opposite p. 72), and the dance of the flowers (opposite p. 148). It is interesting to compare with the latter Barbier's original drawing, dated 2.15 1914, one of many mounted in an album which accompanies the Altschul copy of the book at Yale. Still a third series of illustrations by Barbier for Les chansons de Bilitis appeared in 1929. Featuring an extended text, acquired at the auction sale of Louÿs' manuscripts, it has 54 engravings on wood printed in color by Pierre Bouchet.26 26. Carteret, 3: 180. Since only 25 copies were printed, it has remained virtually unknown to collectors. Personnages de comédie of 1922 is a still more considerable accomplishment than the edition of Les chansons de Bilitis of the same year. 2.16 Indeed, its 12 large plates, engraved by Schmied and printed in color by Pierre Bouchet, are rivalled in Barbier's work only by those in Le bonheur du jour. Albert Flament's text of 1914 is a diffuse meditation, halfwaking and half-dreaming, which takes as its point of departure the great roles of the world theatre. Barbier's vignettes have a general relevance to the theme of acting, but most of his plates, at least one of which dates from 1916, are simply magnificent decorative compositions. Thus 2.17 Phaedra is mentioned by Flament, but not the equally evocative Greek sorceress who receives homage from her creatures in an earlier design. Perhaps Personnages de comédie is best regarded as a demonstration of the cumulative richness which could be achieved by the combined talents of Barbier, Schmied, and Bouchet. If six years passed before the appearance of Barbier's next major book, this does not mean that he had forsaken illustration in the interval. His practice was to spend years over each project, returning to it from time to time as the spirit moved him. It is true, however, that between the end of the War and the later 1920s much of his time was claimed by theatrical design. This new career began with Rostand's Casanova, performed at the Bouffes-Parisiens in 1919. Barbier's costumes and scenery are recorded in an album of 1921 called Panorama dramatique: Casanova, illustrated with 24 pochoir plates executed by Jacomet. Other successes followed, and for a time he was the most sought-after costume designer in Paris, recognized as the theatrical artist who better than any other had captured the mood of the age. His work through 1922 may be seen in an elegant album called Vingt-cinq costumes pour le théâtre which appeared in 1927. Edmond Jaloux's discerning introduction suggests how Barbier helped to transform the mundane atmosphere of the pre-War Paris theatre, with its bourgeois settings for well-made plays, into "a kind of many-colored dream" (p. 14). Jaloux found that Barbier's extraordinary costumes—which were more than costumes, indeed, since they seemed to have the power of imposing on the actors who wore them a state of mind suitable to the roles they were playing—had been perfectly described nearly a century before in Gautier's Mlle. de Maupin: His personnages are from no time and no country. . . . Their costumes are the most extravagant and fantastic in the world. . . . It is a taste not exactly English, or German, or French, or Turkish, or Spanish, or Tartar, . . . though it includes a little of what every country has that is most graceful and most characteristic. (pp. 14-15) 2.18 Typical of Barbier's creations are Don Juan in Rostand's La dernière 2.19 nuit de Don Juan and Paulette Duval in the sumptuous ballet Le tapis persan. From the theatre Barbier proceeded to the music hall, the vastly larger resources of which enabled him to achieve effects "of unbridled fantasy and opulence" in such works as "Le légende du Nil" and "L'Eventail de diamant" at the Folies Bergères.27 27. Marcel Valotaire, "George Barbier," The Studio, 93 (1927), 409. The year 1928 saw the appearance of books illustrated by Barbier set in the two periods where his imagination moved most freely, ancient Greece and 18th century France. In Maurice de Guérin's Poèmes en 2.20 prose he returned to mythological themes, specifically to the story of the centaur and the bacchant (p. v), in an elegant volume for which Pierre Bouchet engraved his drawings on wood and saw to their printing in color and Schmied provided the "maquette typographique." Verlaine's Fêtes galantes was a more important undertaking. Some of Barbier's drawings for this collection of poems, including that for the frontispiece, go back to 1920, and a number of others are dated between 1923 and 1925. In their large scale and ornate elaboration, indeed, they bring to mind his plates for Le bonheur du jour. To study them is to be reminded that Verlaine's poems for this volume, the second which he published, are said to have been inspired by his reading of the Goncourts' L'Art au dixhuitième siècle with its celebration of the pastoral paintings of Watteau, Boucher, and Fragonard. For the most part Barbier's depictions of the gallant life of the time have an open-air setting. Perhaps the characters 2.21 Barbier assembles in his plate for "Clair de lune" (p. 3), the first poem in the collection, best epitomize the "chosen landscapes" by which he tried to realize Verlaine's dream-like visions. Barbier's designs are full of 2.22 fantastic touches without warrant in the poet's text. In "Les ingénus" (p. 27), for example, the lovers amusing themselves in a park on an autumn evening do not include the fawn receiving the attentions of the lady by the pool. Fêtes galantes is the most frequently encountered of Barbier's major books. Strictly speaking, indeed, it has to be regarded as a demi-luxe edition since Piazza published 1200 copies. Some 225, however, were issued on special paper with one or two suites of the plates, thus raising them to collector's status, and the 25 of these with original drawings are of course in a class by themselves. Marcel Schwob's Vies imaginaires of 1929 might have been written on purpose for Barbier to illustrate, so directly was it calculated to appeal to his temperament and his way of proceeding. The author selected from history 22 figures whose personalities and stories he found piquant, most of dubious, some of criminal, reputation. Among them were Petronius, Paolo Uccello, Captain Kidd, and Burke and Hare. Barbier's drawings, engraved on wood and printed in color by Bouchet, show how taken he was by Schwob's subjects. They include headpieces, initial letters, and tailpieces, as well as plates devoted to the 12 figures who interested him most. While preserving the settings and costumes of their times, he makes 2.23 them all inhabitants of an elegant, ambiguous country in which conventional expectations are invariably disappointed. In a frontispiece the muse of intimate history gazes into a globe and dictates what she sees to a cupid. Passing by the heretical brother Dolcino, who can be taken as a 2.24 mocking commentary on the saints depicted by Maurice Denis, Clodia 2.25 accompanying her brother to a Roman brothel (p. 44) and Pocahontas meeting Captain John Smith (p. 126) may be singled out among the book's Art Deco tableaux. This concludes the roll-call of Barbier's substantial books, except for Les liaisons dangereuses, reserved for discussion in another context, but something must also be said of the demi-luxe volumes which he illustrated. The most interesting of these is René Boylesve's Le carrosse aux deux lézards verts of 1921. Here one admires not so much the eight plates as the scores of smaller designs with which the text is decorated, thus following the pattern for demi-luxe books recently established by Robert Bonfils. His vignettes provide a sprightly commentary on this 18th century fairy tale, enhanced as they are by Saudé's brilliant demon- 2.26 stration of the possibilities of pochoir. The beginning of chapter 4 provides a typical opening. Four of the five titles which Barbier undertook between 1924 and 1931 for Mornay's series, Les Beaux Livres, are tales by Henri de Régnier, also with 18th century settings. They hardly require comment, since their sparse pochoir illustrations are overshadowed by his drawings for Les 2.27 liaisons dangereuses. More attractive is Gautier's Le roman de la momie of 1929, thanks in large part to the harmonious engravings printed in color by which Gasperini rendered the artist's designs. Barbier seems to have welcomed the opportunity offered by Gautier's Egyptian setting to rival the middle eastern subjects which preoccupied Schmied at this time. My account of Barbier the book-artist has emphasized the extent to which he was a decorator rather than an illustrator. He did not see his work as an interpretation of the successive phases of the text before him. Instead he found in each subject which he isolated from the text an opportunity for creating a single perfect design. Paul Valéry's quatrain has often been quoted: Tandis que mon vague ramage Parle des mythes dans l'abstrait, Barbier les capte d'un pur trait, Vainqueur du néant par l'image!28 28. Catalogue de la bibliothèque de feu M. George Barbier, lot 420. The quatrain was written by Valéry on a blank leaf in Barbier's copy of Maurice de Guérin's Poèmes en prose of 1928. In seizing this image, no labor was too arduous for him. Indeed, ClémentJanin relates how "he delighted in minute details, hardly to be suspected, which yet had their place in the impression made by the whole. `Why,' asked one of his students, `do you put into your water colors those touches which no one sees?'—`But I,' he answered, `I know that they are there' " (p. 136). To this search for perfection Barbier brought formidable resources of knowledge as well as talent. Yet no artist was ever less of a pedant. In describing a visit to his atelier, Vaudoyer found a symbol for the relation between his learning and his art. Three of its walls were given over to precious objects of all sorts, Barbier's choice among the creations with which earlier craftsmen had served beauty, and the world of art had celebrated luxury and fantasy. The fourth wall was curtained beneath a skylight. Barbier sat facing it, behind a table holding his brushes and paints, "forgetful of the concerns of sedentary life. He no longer sees anything in front of him but his own dreams. Before catching them in flight for perpetuation on Whatman or Canson, for a moment he watches them pass on the great screen of the sky among clouds and sunbeams" (p. 48). Nor did his labors end with his drawings. He saw each of his books through to its completion, supervising all aspects of its planning and production. Clément-Janin wrote near the end of Barbier's career: He is the publisher's constant collaborator; . . . he supervises the composition of colored inks, as well as their application on the page. The title pages . . . are always designed by him, at least for the éditions de grand luxe. . . . But his participation doesn't end there. He also directs his interpreters, the wood engravers. His water-colors, executed with precious skill, must not lose this quality under the graver of an unskilfull craftsman. Printing also demands particular care. To render these sumptuous materials, these velvety blacks, these deep blues or reds, these delicate pinks, the bloom of flesh tints, these insensible gradations of tone, everything between gold and platinum, often requires innumerable trials. It is on this condition that the illustrator is reproduced without being betrayed. (pp. 144-145) What this absorption in the details of production added to Barbier's work can be shown from his last major book, Les liaisons dangereuses. That he would turn his attention to Choderlos de Laclos' great novel of sexual intrigue was inevitable. Eighteenth century France, particularly during the decades before the Revolution, had become his favorite country of the mind. In this instance, moreover, he was prepared to illustrate his text rather than to use it as a point of departure for decorative compositions. His imaginative involvement with the novel's subject can be traced back at least to 1920, when he contributed to La guirlande des mois certain "fragments found in the papers of the late Marquis de la Caille" (4: 33-45). Entitled "L'Amour de plaisir ou le plaisir d'amour," these are the mordant reflections of a cynical libertine who might have been Laclos' Vicomte de Valmont. In 1929 and 1930 he made 20 large drawings for the novel, as well as a number of smaller drawings for vignettes and decorations. Though Barbier did not neglect the opportunities for decorative treatment of setting and costume which the novel provided, he for once submitted willingly to the straight-jacket of the illustrator, maintaining the major characters in keeping and presenting all the big scenes in its intricate plot, even when, as in the duel between Valmont and the Chevalier Danceny (2: 192), they were well outside his usual range. The resulting drawings were as comprehensive and effective as any conceived for the novel since Charles Monnet and Mlle. Gérard collaborated in their classic illustrations of 1796. Unfortunately, there was the usual delay between the completion of Barbier's designs and their appearance in book form. Barbier died in 1932, and when they were published two years later, the absence of his guiding hand was everywhere apparent. The publisher, Le Vasseur, declared that the dead artist had put into the book "the best of his talent, of his personality: all his art, all his knowledge."29 29. Prospectus, p. 2. Nonetheless, he allowed himself to print 720 copies, an edition so large as to necessitate the use of mechanical process to reproduce the artist's designs, the colors apparently being added by pochoir. They were also reduced in size. The damage can be assessed by a comparison of the original drawings30 30. Those cited are among the six in copy number 1, which is in my possession. with 2.28 their reproductions. Consider the vignette facing the title page of volume 2.29 2. Barbier's line is so distorted as to impair its firmness. The harmony of his color scheme is disturbed; there is no hint of red in the mermaid's hair, and her scales are blue instead of green. Even more injurious are the changes wrought in Barbier's larger compositions. As reproduced, Barbier's conception of an early and relatively innocent visit by the Marquise 2.30 de Merteuil to the bedchamber of Cécile Volanges (1: 136) is deprived of its sensuous grace. Throughout these two volumes, even where there is no actual misrepresentation, the bloom is gone. In consequence this edition of Les liaisons dangereuses has never enjoyed the favor that its drawings merit. Barbier was a supreme decorative designer, whose art centered on the human figure, displayed in a thousand different settings and costumes. He had the faculty, as Valéry wrote, of embodying myth through images in such a way that workers in mere words could only look on in awe. These images are beautiful, but their beauty is of an enigmatic kind. In Barbier's library were 12 volumes illustrated by Edmund Dulac and 10 by Arthur Rackham between 1906 and 1918 (lots 223-224). Yet, despite their common preoccupation with color, to describe Barbier as a Rackham, even if not for the nursery, would be utterly misleading. In fact, he embodied the temper of the 1920s in much the same way that Beardsley did that of the 1890s. He was drawn to erotic themes, particularly of an ambiguous nature, and his sensibility enabled him to present them, through both male and female figures, in a powerful and haunting way. These figures make an impression beyond their sensual appeal. In an essay on Casanova's memoirs Barbier described "the soul of Venice" in the great adventurer's time as "at once avid and exhausted, raging and desperate, and, under the rouge already putrefying."31 31. In his 1921 album Panorama dramatique: Casanova, p. 4. The equivocal nature of the sophisticated society of Barbier's time is similarly conveyed by his compositions. Indeed, this is perhaps his truly original note. No account of the French Art Deco book can afford to pass by pochoir illustrations, which surely constitute the field of liveliest activity among today's Art Deco book collectors. Consideration of this process may appropriately be associated with George Barbier, even though the drawings for most of his major books were rendered by wood engravings printed in color. Pochoir was used in much of his early work, as well as for Fêtes galantes and Les liaisons dangereuses, and in the 1920s such former colleagues of his on the Gazette du bon ton as Arnoux, Brissaud, Brunelleschi, Lepape, Martin, and André-Édouard Marty were among the illustrators with whom that magazine was most prominently identified. Moreover, Barbier became a champion of pochoir in its struggle for acceptance among publishers and collectors of livres d'art. In assuming this role, he wrote, he was settling a debt of gratitude, for my first drawings were reproduced by the master colorist Saudé, with a fidelity which I found astonishing. First prints, like first loves, are the most beautiful of all; the artist then feels, through the rendering of his work, a little of the delight of a young woman, on the eve of her debut in society, who looks in the mirror and finds herself made beautiful. This is a joy which passes quickly.32 32. "Pochoirs," Arts et métiers graphiques, 3 (1 February 1928), 162. We may open the topic with Jean Saudé's Traité d'enluminure d'art au pochoir, published during 1925 in an edition of 500 copies. Now itself a major collector's book, it is no mere technical treatise. Instead it is at once a manifesto asserting the claims of pochoir and a demonstration through its own illustrations of the appropriateness of pochoir for the livre d'art. Saudé's text is prefaced by tributes from several admirers. Particularly to our purpose are the remarks of Édouard Bénédictus, several of whose design albums had been colored by Saudé. He claimed that it was Saudé's accomplishment "to make known certain new artistic forms, such as the highly sensitive works of modern artists, which without his methods, might have remained unfamiliar to us because they could not be reproduced, or indeed might have come to us radically changed in photomechanical copies" (p. 2). He also emphasized Saudé's extensive range. In his hands pochoir "encompasses all forms of art, old and new, in all areas of artistic and industrial activity, prints, miniatures, documentary works, catalogues, postcards, wall decorations, fabrics, and so many other things" (p. 4). In his own part of the book Saudé first concerns himself with the history of coloring by stencil, a subject which had become familiar to him during 30 years of craftsmanship, tracing it from the Middle Ages to the present. He then offers his social credo: that the decorative arts combined with technology can promote humanity's well-being by bringing beauty within the grasp of the multitude (pp. 26-27). Finally, he describes in detail, with due attention to the refinements which a master of the craft can introduce, how pochoir work is accomplished (pp. 35-64). First, the water color to be reproduced is photographed. After the colors in the original are analyzed, proofs of the photograph are lightly printed in a neutral tone, and each color is transferred to its individual proof. Cut-outs from very thin sheets of zinc or copper are made from these proofs. They are placed successively on the page to be colored, and the color is added through the cut-out by brush or other means. Saudé's example of this crucial step is "Les roses" by Mme. Beauzée-Reynaud, in reproducing which he employed 32 pochoirs. He shows the resulting plate as it appeared after 5, after 10, after 25, and after 32 of these stencils. For more complex water colors the number required could be much larger. Given the strict control which Saudé exercised over his workers, one understands why he could claim for pochoir that it is "the only process which, from the first impression to the last, best interprets the artist's original style." This is true of both large and small editions, he maintains, "though this kind of work is seen at its best in ouvrages de luxe" (p. 36). In his concluding pages Saudé lists some of the books containing his work with which he is best satisfied. The year 1925 was a turning point in the fortunes of pochoir as a process for illustrating livres d'art. Taken together, Saudé's Traité and his display at the great Art Deco exhibition caused influential voices to be raised in its behalf. The writer of the section on books in the Rapport général of the exhibition was impressed not only by the "rich polychromes" which he showed, but also by the "limited stock of tools" which had produced them. Operations which demand, in addition to the precise analysis of colors in the subject, experience, skill, and taste, make this mode of illustration an artist's calling as well as a mere technique of illustration. . . . Coloring by pochoir, as is demonstrated in the works which Saudé exhibits, lends itself to the artist's most subtle requirements. It is the natural complement to the livre de luxe in limited editions. (7: 49-50) In an article for The Studio of 1926, which for the most part was a summary of Saudé's treatise, Marcel Valotaire stressed "the important place which [pochoir] has come to occupy in the illustration of the French artistic book" and remarked that "This victory over the conservatism of the bibliophiles as to processes of reproduction is fully justified by the qualities themselves of the plates thus obtained."33 33. "The Pochoir Process of Colour Reproduction," The Studio, 92 (1926), 240. Barbier was equally decisive in an article entitled "Pochoirs" which appeared in 1928: "Certain critics profess to disdain pochoir as unworthy of the livre de luxe. For my part I think unjustified this exclusion of a technique which maintains a work of art in all its freshness, avoiding the often rather chilling transposition resulting from mechanical processes" (p. 163). Pochoir, or enluminure as Saudé preferred to call it, was practiced by other notable craftsmen, three of whom should be specifically mentioned. André Marty (not to be confused with the illustrator, André-Édouard Marty, who often employed pochoir for his designs) had been responsible for its renaissance at the turn of the century. He was succeeded by Daniel Jacomet, the master of facsimile reproduction of drawings by artists from Fragonard to Toulouse-Lautrec. Even the great lacquerist Jean Dunand attempted illumination, as we shall see in connection with Schmied. At the height of its employment, indeed, pochoir coloring became a considerable industry, just as the coloring of aquatints had been in early 19th century England. Nothing is prettier to see [wrote Barbier] than the atelier of a colorist, with its great skylights through which the light surges bathing the workers, many of whom are young women, busy with their graceful task. On the tables, pots of colors sparkle like bouquets, nimble hands fly from sheet to sheet, passing a brush moist with color over the stencils. What an engaging sight! What blissful work [it is] which calls for these quick hands, this smiling dexterity, this good taste so characteristic of [our] little Parisians. (p. 162) Though Valotaire celebrated the victory of pochoir over "the conservatism of the bibliophiles" and claimed that artists were turning to it from wood engravings or etchings printed in color, there remained a hard core of opposition to its use in the livre d'art. This may be exampled from the writings of three of the leading authorities of the time: Hesse, Clément-Janin, and Carteret, who typically made their distaste known by implication or omission rather than direct statement. This is true, for example, of Hesse's Le livre d'art du XIXe siècle à nos jours, in which books illustrated by pochoir are not discussed on the ground that they belong to the commercial rather than the bibliophilic realm.34 34. See his comments on pp. 6-7, 163, 167, 189. In his later Le livre d'art d'après-guerre he followed the same rule. Encountering Maeterlinck's L'Oiseau bleu, a book with pochoir illustrations by Lepape, he pulls himself up short: "but here we leave the livre d'art for the colored image" (p. 86). Clément-Janin ignores pochoir in his Essai sur la bibliophilie contemporaine de 1900 à 1928, even in chapter 11 devoted specifically to colored illustration. Carteret included few pochoir books in his detailed listing of outstanding titles in volume 3 of Le trésor du bibliophile. His judgment on the technique is implied when he writes that Barbier's work arouses enthusiasm "above all when the colors are rendered by engravings on wood by masters like Schmied, the Beltrand brothers or by Pierre Bouchet, capable of attaining perfection by the closest attention to the minutiae of the printing" (3: 178). The employment of pochoir in the livre d'art reached its apogee in the later 1920s, and it continued to be used with some frequency during the 1930s. When Le portique conducted a survey of the condition and prospects of the livre d'art after the second World War, the editors' conclusion was that, though the process had "already won the freedom of the city, being admitted under certain conditions," some influential publishers were inclined to insist on these conditions.35 35. M. Fleurent, "Où va la bibliophilie? une enquête du `Portique,' " Le portique, 2 (Summer 1945), 124. An account of pochoir in 1975, describing the ateliers in which it was still practiced, tells how it had come to be restricted to a few specialties, "le fac-similé de grande qualité, le tirage restreint, l'oeuvre de précision scientifique, la bibliophilie," with the result that it was reduced to the position of a "poor relation among present-day graphic arts."36 36. "L'Enluminure au pochoir, un art méconnu," Nouvelles de l'estampe, 21 (May-June 1975), 9-15. The reason for its lack of employment, however, was no longer skepticism about the process, but the excessive cost of hand-work of any kind. Particularly during the last ten years collectors have become increasingly interested in examples of pochoir coloring in all of its varied applications. There is also a lively demand for pochoir fashion plates, with their fresh and sparkling colors, among those seeking decorative prints to adorn their walls. In comparison with these markets, that offered by amateurs of livres d'art may be minor, but it is not inconsequential. Long since deflected from Barbier and Schmied, whose books illustrated with wood engravings printed in color have soared beyond their means, they can still pursue other notable colorists of the 1920s whose work was rendered in pochoir. Often published in demi-luxe editions of considerable size, these books have remained available as well as relatively inexpensive. The most attractive of such productions are the volumes of decorative illustrators like Arnoux, Brissaud, Brunelleschi, Lepape, Martin, and A.-É. Marty, who had collaborated before the War in La gazette du bon ton, and of later recruits who worked in a similar style like Pierre Falké and Edy Legrand. Since each had a substantial and distinctive career, they cannot be considered one by one. It must suffice to offer a few examples from their productions, chosen to reveal the variety of subjects which they attempted, the gamut of effects which coloring by pochoir could achieve, and the wide range of markets at which the resulting volumes were aimed, from popular works to livres de grande luxe. One of the handsomest of all pochoir books is Edy Legrand's Voyages et glorieuses découvertes des grands navigateurs et explorateurs français of 1921. This slim folio, which is fairly ablaze with illustrations on every page, bears no notice of limitation and was evidently published in considerable numbers. For that reason it was not regarded even as an édition de demi-luxe. Yet its bold designs and brilliant coloring make the free and unstudied handling of its pochoir work seem entirely fitting, remote as it is from Saudé's ideal. A representative page shows Jacques Cartier 2.31 relating his discoveries to Francis I. Legrand's most ambitious composition, a double page opening, depicts Lasalle taking possession of Louisiana, with the Indian tribes making their submissions. Much more restrained is Guy Arnoux's Les caractères of 1922, an album of 500 copies for which he provided both text and illustrations. As the title-page shows, the coloring is very much of the pre-War order, almost poster-like in 2.32 style. Pierre Falké's wood engravings colored by pochoir make his Robinson Crusoe, 3 volumes, 1926, one of the great books of the decade. Though they are dotted sparingly through the more than 900 pages of text, they give it a richness that could not have been attained by black and white illustration. This was a livre de grand luxe, published in an 2.33 edition of 151 copies. As the crucifixion scene (p. 230) shows, AndréÉdouard Marty's illustrations for Pierre Louÿs' Aphrodite of 1936 stand in complete contrast. Their purity and restraint make this book, of which there were 340 copies, a model of cool elegance. In the 1920s pochoir was often disdained by collectors swayed by accepted bibliophilic orthodoxy. In consequence publishers of livres d'art tended to prefer wood engravings or even etchings printed in color, particularly for éditions de grand luxe. This a priori prejudice has long since been dissipated, just as there is now general agreement that pochoir illustration is far more appealing than any form of mechanical process, with which it used to be lumped. But the question remains: what are the merits of pochoir as compared with wood engravings printed in color? We know that Barbier used the latter for most of his important books, Schmied for nearly all of his. One of the interests in the review of Schmied's work, the subject of the next lecture, will be the resources that he commanded in comparison to those available to the users of pochoir. 3. François-Louis Schmied The work of few book-artists has undergone such reversals of fortune as that of François-Louis Schmied. A Swiss who migrated to Paris as a young man, he had first to overcome the distrust with which the French tend to regard foreigners working among them. During the World War he enlisted in the army as a volunteer, where the grave injuries which he sustained caused a French critic to concede that he had "earned the right to be called one of us."37 37. P.-R. Roland-Marcel, "François-Louis Schmied, peintre, graveur et imprimeur," La renaissance de l'art, 11 (1928), 153. Even so success came to him only as he approached 50. A "decorator-born," as his friend Dr. Mardrus called him,38 38. J.-C. Mardrus, Catalogue des livres de F.-L. Schmied (Paris, 1927), p. 10. he then benefitted more than any other book-artist from the boom in livres d'art. Not only did he attract wealthy and distinguished patrons, but collectors generally joined with them in raising his numerous productions to the peak of contemporary esteem. Yet a residue of bitterness among rivals who had begrudged him his prosperity helped to make his fall from grace after the economic crisis of 1930-31 all the more complete. For decades his books, even in the most splendid copies, remained in disfavor, until the Art Deco revival of the past 15 years caused them to regain and perhaps surpass the position which they enjoyed in the 1920s. Since Schmied did not achieve fame until the early 1920s, relatively little is known of his early life.39 39. The chief source for information about Schmied's early years is Hesse's short chapter in Le livre d'art du XIXe siècle à nos jours, pp. 176-182. See also Carteret, Le trésor du bibliophile, 3: 190-196. Ward Ritchie, François-Louis Schmied, Artist, Engraver, Printer (Tucson, Arizona, 1976), provides by far the most useful account of his later life. The Genevan family into which he was born in 1873 intended him for a career in business, and it was only through application to artistic studies outside working hours that he found his first patron, the painter Barthélemy Menn. In 1890 his parents allowed Schmied to devote himself to original wood engraving under the tutelage of the Swiss master, Alfred Martin, who also trained Carlègle. From Martin he learned much about design as well, and in the Bibliothèque Municipale of Geneva he had made a profound study of typography and the layout of the page before he departed for Paris in 1895. Though he was employed in that city primarily as a reproductive engraver, he continued to draw and to experiment with original engraving printed in color. His innovations during the first decade of the new century included the printing of engravings in the manner of paintings with no separation of the colors by black lines and the extensive use of gold and silver in their backgrounds. Among those impressed by his work was Auguste Lepère, who had raised color printing to its seeming apogee in his editions of À rebours in 1903 and L'Éloge de la folie in 1906. "You are going to create truly rich engraving [la gravure riche]," he told Schmied. "I had a presentiment, while printing À rebours, of what infinite resources might offer themselves to the painter-artist who would have the courage to assimilate the craft of the printer-engraver."40 40. Quoted by Jean Guiffrey, "Les tendances modernes dans les livres de F.-L. Schmied," Byblis, 3 (1924), 95. It was a good many years before Schmied bore out this prediction. In 1911 one of the leading societies of bibliophiles, Le Livre Contemporain, commissioned a luxurious edition of Kipling's The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book. The animal painter Paul Jouve was selected as its illustrator, and Jouve turned to Schmied for engravings printed in color of his designs.41 41. Hesse, Le livre d'art, p. 133. As their collaboration developed, Schmied had a hand in drawing the illustrations as well as in their engraving. Both artists went off to the War, Jouve being mobilized, and Schmied enlisting in the foreign legion. Severely wounded in action at Capy on the Somme, Schmied lost his right eye and was invalided home with the military medal.42 42. Schmied's citation for this decoration is given by Clément-Janin, "François-Louis Schmied, peintre-graveur-typographe," Byblis, 1 (1921-22), 14. He was joined in Paris by Jouve who had been serving in Eastern Europe. The two resumed work on Le livre de la jungle, the printing of which was at last completed in November of 1918, though not without further vicissitudes during the bombardment of that city. As the first major livre d'art to appear after the War, Le livre de la jungle is a landmark book. Its layout and typography, though sober and dignified, are undistinguished, and its more than 400 large quarto pages seem under-illustrated when compared with Schmied's later profusion in this respect. Nonetheless, Jouve's drawings, as completed and engraved on wood by Schmied and printed in color on handpresses by Pierre Bouchet, are sumptuous indeed. It cannot be determined exactly what part Schmied had in the drawing of the illustrations. Hesse states that Jouve "furnished only 15 finished drawings out of 90. For the rest he provided only preliminary studies" (p. 178). The book in fact has 122 designs: 17 plates, 15 initial letters, and the rest vignettes in the text. No doubt the initial letters, which are often abstract, were largely Schmied's work. It would seem that he must also have been responsible for bringing to completion a number of Jouve's sketches. The plates, one for each of Kipling's 15 stories and two frontispieces, are printed on heavy paper in the manner of individual prints. For the most part these are large-scale studies of the principal characters in Kip- 3.1 ling's stories: Mowgli himself; Kaa, the rock-python; Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the mongoose; Toomai, the elephant; and the rest. Schmied rendered Jouve's designs with the same sort of attentive care that he had devoted to his own pre-War engravings such as "Le chateau d'Estaing" and "Le chataignier" which had so impressed Lepère.43 43. Clément-Janin, p. 12. The vignettes of Le livre de la jungle are as interesting as the plates. Perhaps because he engraved Jouve's designs in diverse styles over several years, Schmied anticipated not a few of the effects which he was later to develop for his own work. For each story there is a headpiece, an initial letter, and usually a tailpiece, together with four or five further vignettes. In the initial letters he made extensive use of gold in developing his Art 3.2 Deco patterns. We also find him using a gold background to silhouette Toomai the elephant against the sunrise (p. 133) and transforming a 3.3 landscape into an abstract pattern by reducing it to contrasting masses (p. 75). The illustrations to each of the stories have a dominant recurring figure and a consistent color scheme, thus providing for unity as well as variety. If it was Schmied's engravings which caused Le livre de la jungle to rank with Lepère's À rebours and the Fioretti of Maurice Denis and the Beltrand brothers in the annals of early 20th century book decoration, the success of its images as illustrations was owing to Jouve.44 44. See Camille Mauclair, Paul Jouve (Paris, 1931). He had been devoted to Kipling's Jungle Books from the time of their appearance in 1894 and 1895. Throughout his youth he had applied himself to the study of art and of animals. Though he had visited North Africa, his knowledge of the creatures he depicted in Le livre de la jungle was derived chiefly from European zoos and museums, and of course he had no first-hand familiarity with Kipling's Indian setting. Inevitably his conceptions for this early book, impressive as they are, seem relatively static. During the 1920s he was able to travel extensively in the Orient, and India, observing the wild animals that obsessed him in their native haunts, and in 1930 he illustrated for a second time La chasse de Kaa, one of the longer stories in Le livre de la jungle, as well as Pierre Loti's Un pèlerin d'Angkor. These two books may be considered out of chronological sequence, since there will be no opportunity to return to Jouve. The first offers an enlightening contrast with Le livre de la jungle and the second saw Schmied again engaged in rendering the artist's designs by engravings printed in color. Indeed, though Jouve's wider fame is as an animal painter, these volumes, together with several others which he illustrated between 1929 and 1937, give him an honorable place in the history of the Art Deco book. Of course, La chasse de Kaa is only one of the 15 stories in Le livre de la jungle. Yet it must be granted that Jouve's second presentation of the tale surpasses his earlier version in both vitality and sumptuousness. This time his drawings were engraved by Camille Beltrand and printed in color by Pierre Bouchet, who was also responsible for the volume's typography and layout. Jouve treats the creatures of Kipling's story with far more freedom than before. His designs impart a feeling of movement which testifies to the artist's liberating familiarity with their behavior in their habitat. Compare what he makes of Kaa's defiance of the monkeys (pp. 98-99) with his conception of the same subject in Le livre de la jungle. Jouve provides each page of the text with a wide decorative band, in which astonishingly varied patterns deriving from python's skin alternate with friezes of stylized jungle animals. For his part Bouchet shows what he has learned from his years as Schmied's master-printer. Witness the opening page of the text with its vast initial letter and lavish use of gold. Altogether, the book has a richness that rivals Schmied's early work. Un pèlerin d'Angkor was Jouve's final collaboration with Schmied.45 45. Schmied had provided the "decoration" for La Fontaine's Fables of 1929, in which Jouve's drawings were engraved under the direction of J.-L. Perrichon. On this occasion the painter's explorations of Indo-China led to his choice of a text. It is a quiet book, without the action or drama of La chasse de Kaa, nor is its decoration from the images and motifs of the country nearly so elaborate. Nonetheless, it has its own kind of charm, established in the opening double-page design of the ruins of Angkor in the twilight. When Le livre de la jungle was finally published in 1919, it brought Schmied wide recognition. During the previous year Léon Carteret had issued Léandre Vaillat's L'Hôtel-Dieu de Beaune, a small book illustrated with wood engravings printed in color from Schmied's own drawings. As he approached 50, he felt able at last to embark on a career as an architècte du livre, that is to say as an artist-craftsman who would undertake by himself to illustrate, to engrave, and to print livres d'art. Indeed, he entered into a contract with Carteret to assist in the marketing of his productions. This came to nothing when Schmied could not avoid incurring expenses which greatly exceeded the terms on which the two had agreed (p. 192). Nonetheless, Schmied had established himself in a modest atelier at 12, rue Friant, with Pierre Bouchet as his pressman and his son Théo, soon to become his leading workman. There he had the guiding hand in all operations from the planning of each new book to its printing on his single handpress. Ward Ritchie, who was his apprentice in 1930-31, has described the process by which a design became a page in one of his books. It was first "photographically reproduced upon the end-grain surface of a piece of boxwood." From this the engraver made the basic woodblock, proofs of which were placed on as many further pieces of boxwood as there were to be colors printed in the illustration. On one such, while I was working there, forty-five blocks were pulled for the forty-five different colors required to reproduce an illustration. From these, with the original painting always before him, the engraver would remove all of the wood except for the one color with which he was involved. . . . Printing of the blocks was a careful and tedious process. . . . For exact register the old handpress method of pins was used. . . . For each additional color impression it was only necessary to place the sheet on the same pin holes to get perfect register. . . . With the multiplicity of colors some of the sheets took almost a month to print. (pp. 21-23) Schmied's exclusive reliance on hand work of the highest quality made inevitable a prolonged period of gestation for each of his books. In the elaborate catalogue for an exhibition of his books held in New York during 1927, eight titles are listed as "in preparation," seven of which in fact appeared over the ensuing four years (pp. 97-98). His entire operation, indeed, was based on the attainment of perfection. Unless every detail represented his best effort, he could not justify the small editions (from 20 to 200 copies) at very high prices in which his books typically appeared. The earliest volumes to achieve publication from Schmied's atelier were three for 1922 for which he had engraved the designs of other artists and printed them in color. We have already encountered two of these, Les chansons de Bilitis and Personnages de comédie, with illustrations by Barbier. The third was Jean Goulden's Salonique, le Macédoine, l'Athos. Two further works with designs by other artists, Marrakech by Jérome and Jean Tharaud illustrated by Suréda and Rabindrinath Tagore's L'Offrande lyrique illustrated by Jean Berque, were published in 1924 and 1925 respectively. It will suffice to glance at the last three books before proceeding to a closer examination of the volumes of the same period which were entirely Schmied's work. There is no difference in the standards of craftsmanship between the two categories, but otherwise they are quite distinct. In the former Schmied was content to establish a pattern and carry it out consistently; in the latter the variety of detailed inventiveness which made him a master of book decoration raises them to an altogether different plane. Jean Goulden was a respected friend. He, Schmied, Jouve, and Jean Dunand joined together each year beginning in 1921 to exhibit their work in progress at the Galérie George Petit. This painter and enamelist had brought back from his wanderings in Greece after the War an impressive portfolio of drawings of landscape and old buildings, such as 3.6 "Athos: le monastère de Valopédie," which Schmied rendered so perfectly in his 45 large engravings printed in color as to persuade the viewer that he has the paintings themselves before him. Jean Guiffrey has described the procedure which allowed the engraver-printer to achieve the subtle variations by which he conveyed his sensibility: "On a flat tint, of soft coloration, the various tones come to merge in such a way as to produce the most varied and delicate harmonies. For the first time, in this book, Schmied printed on a metallic background, on gold or on silver, allowing it to show through in many places, thus imparting a dominant note to the general harmony of the image" (p. 96). The Tharauds' Marrakech held a special interest for Schmied since his father had lived for a time in Algeria, returning to Switzerland only after the revolt, and he engraved Suréda's drawings of North African scenery, people, and way of life with his usual care and elegance. Yet the book had been commissioned by the Cercle Lyonnais du Livre, whose members would not have appreciated any radical divergence from the conventional. Schmied was 3.7 able to present Jean Berque's highly mannered designs for L'Offrande lyrique in a livelier style. Here he had a free hand, since he was his own publisher, and both Tagore's mystical text, as translated by André Gide, and Berque's drawings made their appeal to him. While not among his most ambitious books, it is an engaging one. We may turn now to the volumes which made Schmied known throughout the western world, those in which he emerged as an artist as well as a craftsman. Flaubert's Salammbô of 1923 does not figure significantly in this category, since it is a small octavo, published in an edition of 1000 copies by Le Livre, for which Schmied merely made six drawings, engraved them, and printed them in color. Still, it offers a fine Art Deco 3.8 frontispiece. The Comtesse de Noailles' Les climats of 1924, on the other hand, is a major work. The subjects it set for Schmied were largely of Mediterranean scenery, and they had to be presented, as with Marrakech, in such a way as to satisfy the members of a society of bibliophiles, this 3.9 time Le Livre Contemporain. Within these limits, as "La messe de l'aurore à Venise" (p. 66) bears witness, Schmied succeeded splendidly. Indeed, one may regard Les climats as the book in which Schmied most appropriately invites comparison with Maurice Denis as interpreted by 3.10 the Beltrand brothers. Here is the opening plate from Denis' Carnets de voyage en Italie of 1925, a Sicilian scene engraved on wood and printed in color. It would be invidious to choose between it and the plate from Les climats, but it may be noted that in contrast to Denis' pastels, Schmied's more complex engravings are characterized by deeper colors 3.11 and much use of printed backgrounds of gold. In the copy at Yale Uni- 3.12 versity there is a special printing of part of a plate depicting ponds at evening (p. 6), pulled by Schmied for Frank Altschul, which demonstrates how the full resources of his artistry could produce something unique. If Schmied's distinctive contribution to Art Deco is hardly to be sought in Les climats, he made Alfred de Vigny's Daphné of the same year the Art Deco book par excellence. In an essay on fine printing for The Fleuron of 1924, P. J. Angoulvent found the best hope for the future in "the decorated book," and more specifically in the "abstractive power" to which Daphné bears witness. "Modern man," he argued, no longer seeks "descriptive painting or illustration," but instead "an intervention of the artist . . . to help him in bringing his feelings into harmony with those of the creator of the work."46 46. "The Development of the Book," The Fleuron, 3 (October 1924), 70-71. This short novel concerns Julian the Apostate in Daphne, the grove and sanctuary near Antioch, during the period just before his death. Though the struggle between on-rushing Christianity and dying paganism is presented with vividness, Vigny's primary concern is the metaphysical speculations which filled the Emperor's mind. Confronted by such a subject, Schmied in effect abandoned representational illustration except for three plates: a panorama of the starry sky above the columns and laurel trees of Daphne, an emblematic sun, and a single human figure—Julian himself in profile. The final exception is logical, for Vigny's book exists through the thoughts of this haunted ascetic intellectual. Otherwise Schmied suggests the content and spirit of Daphné entirely by abstract decorations. The volume was intended at first for still another group of collectors, this time the Société des Médecins Bibliophiles, but its costs were finally assumed by a single member,47 47. Hesse, Le livre d'art, p. 180. perhaps because the society felt that they were being offered something approaching a design portfolio when they wanted an illustrated book. Yet if Schmied's plan for Daphné was uncompromising, the volume as it emerged from his hand is anything but austere. Full of typographical audacities, it is also remarkable for the ingenuity of design and the dark, rich colors of its ornamentation. What first leaps to notice is its profusion of monumental initial letters. The most striking of these, indeed, turns out not to be an initial letter at all. Commenting on Julian's celebration of mind as symbolized by "the Word," the artist made use of a daring device, beginning his page with 3.13 the gigantic "V" of verbe, even though it occurs in the middle of a sen- 3.14 tence. In other ornaments, of varying shapes and sizes, Schmied offers a wide range of geometric inventions. Even the bands at the tops and bottoms of the early pages, which at first appear identical, are found upon examination to embody differing shot-silk effects. The brilliance and precision with which Schmied engraved and printed his designs are beyond praise. Silver is abundantly employed, as is a rich, glossy black. This last component, however, was to take its toll, for the special ink, mixed with linseed oil, which Schmied used to achieve it, eventually left brown offsets on the facing pages in most copies both of Daphné and of Le cantique des cantiques.48 48. See Ritchie, pp. 23-24. In Le cantique des cantiques, completed for Christmas of 1925 as Daphné had been for Christmas of the previous year, Schmied carried la gravure riche to its furthest reach. Since each of its 80 pages is different from every other, his compulsion to "load every rift . . . with ore" made this "precious casket" of a book, as Schmied's friend Dr. Mardrus called it (p. 33), as susceptible to detailed study as the most sumptuous illuminated manuscript of the Middle Ages or the Renaissance. The text of 3.15 Le cantique des cantiques is as concrete as Daphné's is abstract, both in the objects it describes and the images it employs—gardens and palaces, lilies and apples, doves and sheep. Reflecting Old Testament life at its most alluring, it offered a cornucopia of subjects for illustration. Schmied drew back only from the depiction of the human figure, limiting himself 3.16 to King Solomon and the maiden who describes herself as "black, but comely." If this meant that he hardly touched on the erotic potential of The Song of Solomon, he would shortly make good this deficiency in his Arabian stories. Nor is there any lack of purely decorative compositions 3.17 of a fresh and ethereal kind, often in vertical panels which look forward to Deux contes. Schmied seems to have organized Le cantique des cantiques with the opening as his unit, balancing blocks of type, designs, and the unprinted whites of the page in ever changing combinations. In comparison with Daphné his typographical experiments were minor. If initial letters are more numerous, they are also smaller, and hence no longer dominant. The suave color harmonies which hold the book together are lighter and warmer than any Schmied had previously employed. Indeed, they rival Saudé's pochoir work in their sparkling brilliance, without sacrificing the precision and authority which mark the best wood engraving printed in color. The book is as joyful as it is gorgeous. That Le cantique des cantiques represented a peak of accomplishment even for Schmied was recognized from its first appearance. Since only 110 copies were printed, it has always been in demand, particularly in decorated bindings designed by the artist, and the six copies with suites of the engravings in black and white and in color are now beyond anyone's aspirations. With the progress of the Art Deco revival, a market has developed even for individual leaves, much as in the case of illuminated manuscripts, as institutions and collectors had to recognize that the book itself may never come their way. By the end of 1925 Schmied had attained a commanding position among creators of the livre d'art. At the Art Deco exhibit of that year his display had included not only Les climats and Daphné but also elements of the as yet unpublished Cantique des cantiques. The writer who surveyed the book section for the Rapport général was impelled thereby to pay "special homage to the originality, the virtuosity, and the skill" which Schmied had shown in his wood engravings printed in color, "the most delicate adornment of the modern book," and to agree with Louis Barthou that "from one volume to the next, his art becomes . . . more intelligent and more profound, more vibrant with life and movement, more ingenious, more subtle, and fuller of color" (7: 55-56). There were similar tributes outside of France. A year later Henry L. Bullen described Schmied as "the greatest living master of the art of the book."49 49. Quoted by Ritchie, pp. 4-5. His maquettes for bindings, particularly those embodying lacquer panels by his friend Jean Dunand, were soon in demand, and as the years passed "he designed sets for the Théâtre Pigalle, tapestries for Gobelins, decorations for the liner Normandie."50 50. Ritchie, p. 15. Schmied's success made necessary a more ample locale for his work, and he accordingly removed to 74 bis, rue Halle, in a retired part of Paris towards the Porte d'Orléans. These premises have been described by Ward Ritchie as he found them in 1930: The studio on rue Halle, like most Parisian buildings in the older sections, was four or five stories high. The lower floor was devoted to the workshop. Facing the windows at the front of the building was a long bank extending the width of the room at which four or five wood engravers sat cutting blocks. Théo Schmied [his son] supervised this operation and sat at the far right, himself a very competent engraver. Behind them was the Stanhope hand press and the cabinets of type. . . . In the pressroom were four Italian Nebiolo [machine] presses. Up the stairs on the second floor was first of all the bindery. . . . Also on the second floor was the reception room and library. On the third were dining quarters, the kitchen, and sleeping rooms. The fourth floor was for Schmied's studio, which no one ever saw, at least I didn't. (pp. 14-15) This detailed account may be supplemented by the more general impressions of P.-R. Roland-Marcel, a journalist who had visited the rue Halle two years earlier: "Order reigned. . . . The furniture and decoration of the rooms conformed to a certain discipline unspoiled by stiffness. All was plain and solid, with a simple charm. It was a dwelling in keeping with the tradition of ancestors who had held firm beliefs, cut across by the taste for renewals favored by contemporary art" (p. 150). Befriended by Théo Schmied, described by Roland-Marcel as "a tall quiet young man in whom both the sturdy artisan and the humorist brimming with concentrated mischief was visible," Ritchie soon found himself a member of the extended family which Schmied made of his workers. "Schmied loved people," he relates, "and enveloped them in his great enthusiasm for living" (p. 15). There was much entertaining, not only in Paris but also at Schmied's house in the country. In return the staff made a hero of their master, with his imposing stature, his calm manner, his unfailing enthusiasm, and his legendary achievements. Ritchie quotes a tribute from Taskin, Schmied's chief assistant, which for all its Gallic floridity bears witness to the sincerity of their admiration and devotion. In fact the way of life of Schmied and his entourage, if one transposes it from France to England, brings to mind nothing so much as that of Mr. Wardle and his family at Dingley Dell in The Pickwick Papers. If George Barbier's sometimes bizarre visions derived from solitary meditation, Schmied's equally startling decorative innovations were composed in a setting of hard-working bourgeois contentment. Of course Schmied also led a public life in general society. His particular patron was Louis Barthou, a prominent political personage, but he numbered other celebrities among his familiar acquaintances. This part of his existence was not without its bearing on his commercial success, for such friends in many instances bought his books, and their support was important to him in maintaining his lavish way of life. By 1925, indeed, he had won the allegiance not only of French book collectors but also those of other countries. In 1927 he held a major exhibition on the premises of Arnold Seligmann at 11 East 52nd Street, New York City, printing for the occasion an opulent catalogue of his work, which is now itself in demand among collectors. The dealer later told Ritchie of the prices achieved by the volumes shown, "one with a special binding fetched $10,000 and others $4,000 and $5,000 each" (p. 25). Though Schmied still accepted commissions which restricted his freedom of action—books for societies of bibliophiles, for example, or volumes in which his contribution was primarily to engrave and print in color the designs of other artists—he could now experiment with entire freedom when he chose to do so. Among his boldest efforts was Oscar Wilde's Deux contes, which appeared in April of 1926 in an edition of 162 copies, with a further 20 copies in an English version entitled Two Tales. Not only was this volume published through the "friendly initiative" of a group of friends, which included Louis Barthou and Frank Altschul, but it was sure of a ready sale at a formidable price among the widening circle of collectors in whose eyes Schmied could do no wrong. The five large designs in this substantial quarto, one for the cover and two for each of the stories, are relatively conventional. That depict- 3.18 ing the statue of the Happy Prince is representative. But Schmied's chief concern was with his vignettes, one of which adorns each of his 54 pages of text. These are bands five-eighths of an inch across, the length of the page for "The Happy Prince" and its width for "The Rose and the Nightingale." Schmied made it clear that they are intended to illustrate as well as decorate by including a table which gives the subject of each 3.19 engraving. That the band beginning the second story represents "the student and the nightingale" would not be readily apparent without this assistance. Particularly in his designs for "The Happy Prince," however, he comes much closer to his objective; indeed, some of them rise triumphantly above the Procrustean limitations which he has imposed upon himself. Certainly Deux contes is a notable Art Deco book, the selective elegance of which stands in marked contrast to the sumptuous profusion of Le cantique des cantiques. Les ballades françaises of 1927, published in 162 copies for the Cercle Lyonnais du Livre, may be regarded as the counterpart from Schmied's machine presses of Les climats of 1924, which was printed on his handpress. For each of its 26 plates the artist began with one of Paul Fort's poetic tributes to the mountains, forests, plains, and seas of France, proceeding to impose on this conception a decorative pattern of his own 3.20 devising. In a typical design of a stream winding through a dusky wood he realizes the "eternal melancholy" which the poet had found in the scene. The plates are complemented by vignettes chiefly in the form of 3.21 bands which are much wider than those in Deux contes, vertical for the four section headings, otherwise horizontal. For Schmied, the typography and layout are relatively conventional. Though a supremely competent piece of bookmaking, Les ballades françaises cannot be counted among Schmied's more personal statements. When the printing of Les douze césars of Suetonius was finally achieved in December of 1928, one of Schmied's most prolonged enterprises was brought to its completion. The colophon records that "the plates and ornaments of the book were exhibited, along with the maquette of the text, at the George Petit gallery, 8 rue de la Sèze, in December, 1922." In the interval it may well have come to seem task-work to Schmied and his helpers. Nonetheless, the portrait frontispieces and emblematic tailpieces to the 12 chapters help to redeem its somewhat 3.22 crowded pages. The plate of Nero (before p. ccxiii) is typical. It will be remembered that Schmied also engraved and printed in color at the end of the decade two books with illustrations by George Barbier (Maurice de Guérin's Poèmes en prose of 1928 and Marcel Schwob's Les vies imaginaires of 1929) and two with illustrations by Paul Jouve (La Fontaine's Fables of 1929 and Pierre Loti's Un pèlerin d'Angkor of 1930). I have reserved for discussion as a group the eight books in which Schmied collaborated with Dr. J.-C. Mardrus. This somewhat mysterious savant, best known for his translation of The Arabian Nights, had much to offer the artist. Théo Schmied wrote in 1930: "There is a true Arabian Sheikh in my father. He found in the reading of Mille nuits et une nuit a savoury description of that eastern life. His tastes and that reading gave rise to his friendship with J.-C. Mardrus who revealed so much to him."51 51. See the introduction to Mardrus' Ruth et Booz. That Mardrus also appealed to the side of Schmied's mind which took satisfaction in the abstract decoration of Daphné is confirmed by the long essay which he contributed to the catalogue of Schmied's New York exhibition. After discounting the advertising function of this statement, the reader will find it by turns enlightening and impenetrable. Mardrus's comments on Schmied's individual books are sometimes valuable, since he had the advantage of working closely with the artist, but the philosophic pretensions of the context in which they are presented are less easy to accept. For Schmied, however, this sort of discourse was evidently of a piece with the profundities which he glimpsed in Mardrus's translations in La création and Le livre de la vérité de parole. At any rate, the first fruits of their alliance were a notable success. These were the three books which Schmied made out of Mardrus's translations from The Arabian Nights: Histoire de la princesse Boudour of 1926 and the two separate and distinct editions of Histoire charmante de l'adolescente Sucre d'Amour, both of 1927. In the Histoire de la princesse Boudour Schmied for the first time did not color his own designs. Instead he sent them for coloring after his originals to the workshop of the great lacquerist of the age, Jean Dunand, with whom he was also collaborating at the time on bindings. The story of Princess Boudour and Prince Kamaralzamân has a variety of erotic episodes and allusions, many of which are explicitly realized by Schmied. For the most part his 60 large 3.23 designs depict one or two figures, presented in the style of Persian miniatures, but there are also other subjects—a royal palace, a ship at sea, birds of prey. The text is ornamented with headpieces, bands, tailpieces, and initial letters, as well as smaller decorations in abundance, which en- 3.24 rich every page. In the vignette shown two supernatural figures dispute over Princess Boudour. In a page of text which includes a decorative 3.25 panel featuring a harp, it is related how an attendant sings to Kamaralzamân of the beauties of his Princess. Dunand's coloring endows this profusion of illustration and ornament with a freshness and limpidity which Saudé himself hardly surpassed. The book's limitation to 20 copies has had the effect of making it inaccessible even in the world's great libraries. Otherwise it would long since have become well known to amateurs of illustrated books. The Histoire de la princesse Boudour was followed in 1927 by Mardrus' translation of an unpublished story from The Arabian Nights called Histoire charmante de l'adolescente Sucre d'Amour. This tale of the adventures of an orphaned daughter is also of an erotic cast. Once more Schmied's engravings from his own designs were colored by Dunand. The limitation was to 25 copies, and a larger format and a more open type page were employed. There are 71 substantial designs includ- 3.26 ing a three-page foldout, in one panel of which Schmied portrayed himself in Arabian attire. With regard to the pages, approximately one in seven, where major decorations appear, the book rivals Le cantique des cantiques in richness, but in general it is less lavishly adorned than the 3.27 Histoire de la princesse Boudour. The vignette of the page shown depicts a garden against a turquoise sky, rendered by Dunand with all the precision and sparkle of the original. Confusion has arisen from the fact that Schmied published another edition of the Histoire charmante de l'adolescente Sucre d'Amour in 1927.52 52. Ward Ritchie was not aware of the first of the two editions. Extending this time to 170 copies, it has 13 plates and several 3.28 hundred smaller illustrations and decorations. Its most salient plate is the frontispiece, a representation of Caliph Haroun Al-Raschid in an Art Deco frame. Dominating the smaller illustrations are hundreds of vignettes, one at the bottom of each page. These are small engravings, 3.29 oddly reminiscent of Bewick in placement and conception. In the opening shown the verso depicts a moonlit garden, the recto a lotus flower. In general, this edition of the Histoire charmante de l'adolescente Sucre d'Amour, with its darker coloring and more sober effects, hardly rises to the level of its counterpart. One wonders if Schmied did not devise it to placate those clients to whom he could not offer copies of his grander book. La création of 1928 is one of Schmied's most imposing volumes, a folio with 41 engravings printed in color, including 12 large plates. In addition to the first three books of Genesis, as literally translated by Dr. Mardrus, and a genealogical tree of Adam's descendants, it includes a learned introduction explaining the conflicting accounts of creation which the work puts forward. Even Schmied addressed himself to no more demanding subject, and some gorgeous compositions resulted. 3.30 When compared with a grandiose conception like "Let there be light!" (opposite p. 6) or the making of the sun and the moon (opposite p. 18), however, it must be admitted that the artist's human figures seem relatively commonplace. Dr. Mardrus thought that Schmied's most "revealing" work as an illustrator was his own Livre de la vérité de parole of 1929 which he described as "a rendering in French of Egyptian hieroglyphics concerning life after death, texts which are the foundations of all civilizations" (p. 261). Eschewing any sort of historical reconstruction, Schmied chose instead to interpret the text as he had Vigny's Daphné, through largely abstract designs. For each of the book's 12 "portals," as Mardrus calls 3.31 them, he provided a plate. That shown is for the seventh of these section openings, the voice of truth speaking as a lotus. Since Schmied omitted his usual printed backgrounds of gold, platinum, or silver, the book is relatively somber. Dark browns predominate at the beginning, shading to lighter tones as the reader progresses. For Schmied it is an unusually austere work, but a harmonious one. Schmied's last three books with texts translated by Dr. Mardrus were all published in 1930: Ruth et Booz, Le livre des rois, and Le paradis musulman. In his introduction to Ruth et Booz Théo Schmied claimed that the book embodies a "modern conception of beauty" in that detail is sacrificed to the ensemble, returning to the purity of Italian primitive design. It is certainly true at least that the unit is the opening rather than the page, the illustrations being large rectangles in which the tale of Ruth and Boaz is depicted step by step, extending across verso and recto, and that for Schmied decoration is held to a minimum. The engaging 3.32 qualities of the book may be seen in the wedding of Ruth and Boaz, in which a predominantly sad story ends in happiness. In Le paradis musulman Schmied returned to the style of his pair of stories from The Arabian Nights, this time in an edition of 197 copies. It is a sumptuous book, the greater availability of which allows the amateur to gain some conception at first hand of the artist's achievements in his unfindable earlier volumes. As the year 1930 began Schmied had good reason to be confident about the future. In a survey for Byblis of the fine books of the previous 12 months, Pierre Guerquin offered this summary of his accomplishment: Everyone knows the preponderant role which F.-L. Schmied has played over the last ten years in the revival of several aspects of the modern livre d'art. His typographical researches, the finishing touches which he has brought to the technique and printing of wood engravings in color, the boldness of which he has given proof by introducing the elements of contemporary decorative art into illustration, have placed him from the outset and beyond question in the front rank of our artist-publishers.53 53. "Le beau livre en 1929," Byblis, 8 (1929), xxv-xxvi. The reception of the six books which Schmied completed during the year seemed to confirm Guerquin's tribute. All have already been mentioned except Kipling's Kim, which was published by the firm of Gonin in Lausanne, and Chateaubriand's Les aventures du dernier Abencérage, issued for the Bibliophiles de l'Amérique Latine. Yet the financial crisis of the following winter, which tested everyone connected with the livre d'art, showed Schmied to be particularly vulnerable. Even at the height of his prosperity in 1928 Roland-Marcel had written of "the controversies, the jealousies, the speculative fevers" that surrounded him and the envy and malice which pursued him (pp. 151, 154). This reservoir of ill will now found open expression. In defending Le paradis musul- man in February of 1931 his supporter Pierre Mornand conceded that "like all those who dare, who seek new patterns beyond the beaten path, [Schmied and Dr. Mardrus] are violently attacked."54 54. "Livres parus et livres à paraître," Le bibliophile, 1 (1931), 47. And when his enemy Jean Bruller essayed a comprehensive survey of the French livre d'art for Arts et métiers graphiques in November, he felt able to dismiss Schmied in a concluding aside: "Undeniably he is an excellent engraver. But as a creator and a publisher, I believe that his only talent has been to know how to get his carefully cultivated clientele to accept his motifs de catalogue as real art."55 55. "Le livre d'art en France: essai d'un classement rationnel," Arts et métiers graphiques, 26 (15 November 1931), 62. These doubts concerning Schmied's artistic standing came to a head at a time when his financial position was drastically overextended. He had a number of books under way at his atelier and elsewhere, books for which the demand had become uncertain at best. Moreover, he felt it his duty to protect the market for his earlier works after the crash, so Ward Ritchie relates, "buying bravely to keep up their value, but he could not keep on forever and finally had to give up. He lost almost everything he had" (p. 24). His yacht, the Peau-Brune, was sold. The atelier in the rue Halle was closed. And in 1935 his library, including his precious personal copies of his own books, was dispersed at auction at the Hôtel Drouot. While these sad events were occurring, the books begun by Schmied during his time of prosperity continued to appear. Indeed, eight further titles were added to his bibliography before he died. Beset with material worries, he was in no position to exercise the strict control over the production of his works which had hitherto assured their excellence. Hence these final volumes vary widely in merit. The most attractive by all odds is Peau-Brune de Saint-Nazaire à la Ciotat of 1931, his journal of a Mediterranean voyage aboard his yacht, illustrated with more than 100 engravings printed in color after his drawings. The most disappointing, given the labor and resources which went into it, is a four volume edition of the Odyssey, published between 1930 and 1934, all of the 140 sets of which were printed on vellum. This could have been a rewarding experiment, since Schmied's 100 drawings were engraved in black at the rue Halle and sent to Saudé for pochoir coloring, but Schmied was so dissatisfied with the typography and printing of Maurice Darantière that he wrote an article for L'Illustration of Christmas 1932 explaining how the work should have been designed.56 56. See Ritchie, pp. 37-38. Given this accumulation of setbacks, Schmied's occupation appeared to be gone, but at last friends procured an appointment for him at a desert outpost beyond Marrakech in Morocco. "Here he created a miniature palace for himself from a deserted fort," Ward Ritchie relates, "painting its walls with colorful murals, planting the desert and bringing order and beauty to the place" (p. 25). He alleviated his lonely life by continuing to draw, providing the illustrations, indeed, for two books engraved and printed by Théo Schmied. After his death of the plague during January of 1941, he was buried there in a tomb of his own design. Schmied's death in "a petty fortress," far from the scenes of his earlier triumphs, might stand merely as one more example of "the vanity of human wishes," were it not for the saving reflection that he left behind him one of the most brilliant bodies of work ever encompassed by a bookartist. This achievement has been obscured by the fact that he created so many books, 36 by Léopold Carteret's count (3: 193-196), published in such small editions. Few collectors and students have had the opportunity to study and compare his productions in a consecutive way, and consequently the filtering process of time, which usually operates automatically, has not proceeded very far in his case. Once attention is fixed on such books as Les climats, Daphné, Le cantique des cantiques, Deux contes, his two Arabian tales colored by Dunand, and La création among the books for which he himself made the designs, and Le livre de la jungle, Personnages de comédie, Salonique, and Les vies imaginaires among the books in which he engraved the designs of others, the magnitude of his accomplishment will become clear. That he represents the Art Deco book at its best, as well as its most typical, is self-evident. He was also the supreme "architect of the book" of the 1920s, surpassing rivals like Louis Jou and Jean-Gabriel Daragnès as far in the complexity of his aims as in the mastery of his execution. But even these qualifications pale beside his command of wood engravings printed in color, which he employed as freely and easily as other master craftsmen who worked in black and white. As Carteret told him, he was "the magician of color" (3: 192). 4. Jean-Émile Laboureur Jean-Émile Laboureur's achievement as a print-maker, and over the past few years the attention devoted to his place in the early development of cubism, have given him a standing in the larger world of art not matched by either Barbier or Schmied. We are concerned with him as a book artist, however, and here it is enough to assert that by common consent, he, Barbier, and Schmied continue to be regarded as the leading Art Deco illustrators. At the same time his work differs so greatly from theirs that he has rarely been seen as their rival. He dealt almost entirely in black and white rather than in color. He relied far more on vignettes than on plates. And his cool, austere designs stand in marked contrast to their warm, ornate creations. Rather than seeking to "load every rift with ore," he was frugal with his illustrations, realizing each with a disciplined selection of lines and dotting every series with a sparing hand throughout the text which it was to decorate. To many books, indeed, he contributed nothing but frontispieces, and only occasionally did his illustrations, despite their small size, exceed 20 in number. Moreover, far from aspiring to be an architecte du livre, a master of all the arts of the book, Laboureur was not even a bibliophile. "In an illustrated book," he told Marcel Valotaire, "only the designs interest me."57 57. Laboureur (Paris, 1929), p. 7. This was volume 4 in Henri Babou's series "Les artistes du livre." Not for him were the infinite pains taken by Barbier and Schmied to ensure that all aspects of their books would fully realize their intentions. For Laboureur that was the business of the publisher. Hence Jean Prinet, in the standard inventory of books illustrated by Laboureur,58 58. "Les illustrations de J.-Émile Laboureur," Le portique, 1 (January 1945), 7-25. was able to describe 132 titles, a much larger number than the production of Barbier and Schmied combined. In the survey of his career which follows it will be necessary to limit consideration to certain salient yet representative books from this long list. Laboureur was deservedly fortunate in his publishers, who admired him, allowed him to select texts which interested him for illustration, and did their best to ensure that the mise en page, typography, and paper of the resulting volumes would be worthy of his designs. From Camille Bloch and the Nouvelle Revue Française, who were his early patrons, to Au Sans Pareil and the bibliophile societies, who later performed a similar service, his publishers saw to it that most of the volumes to which he contributed were sufficiently attractive. The effect they sought was one of understated elegance: open, airy pages to which an engraving or an etching, usually in the form of a headpiece or a tailpiece, would add the finishing touch. Such a setting harmonized with the works chosen, which were invariably idiosyncratic, usually laconic, and often ironic. Despite these pains, since Laboureur usually limited himself to black and white, since his books were sparsely illustrated, since he favored short texts which could be printed in small formats, even his major works typically received only demi-luxe treatment by their publishers. The outstanding exceptions to this rule were two books issued by societies of bibliophiles—Jean Giraudoux's Suzanne et le Pacifique of 1927 for Les Cent Une in an edition of 125 copies, and Aristophanes' La paix of 1930 for Les Bibliophiles du Palais in an edition of 200 copies—and Oscar Wilde's Le portrait de Dorian Gray of 1928 published by Le Livre in an edition of 280 copies. In consequence his work became much better known at first hand among collectors in general than that of either Barbier or Schmied. This circumstance has protected Laboureur from the extremes of acceptance and rejection which the works especially of Schmied have experienced. Nowhere has this been more true, it may be noted, than in England and America, where from the 1920s on he has had many admirers. Laboureur was an Anglophile, who knew England and the English well, and a number of his illustrations appeared in books published in England or in books with English settings. In the former category his volumes for the Golden Cockerel Press should be particularly mentioned, together with his work for W. Heinemann, which was usually in the form of frontispieces to Marcel Boulestin's culinary volumes. In the latter were such titles as André Maurois' Les silences du Colonel Bramble of 1926 and Les discours du docteur O'Grady of 1929, both among his best books. As a preface to an account of Laboureur's career as a book artist, some remarks about the formation of his distinctive style will be useful. The most influential writers on the livre d'art in the 1920s, Clément-Janin, Raymond Hesse, and the author of the volume on the book in the Rapport général for the Art Deco exhibition of 1925, all emphasized the way in which the decorative spirit of the time led book artists towards déformation or distortion.59 59. See particularly Clément-Janin's chapter on "L'Illustration deformatrice," 1: 55104. Since literal realism no longer served their purpose, they felt at liberty to discard it. Laboureur was the prime example of this development, regarded as a leader by other illustrators. He thought that the exact depiction of nature no longer had any interest for the artist. Valotaire records his comments on the absurdity of reproductive engraving in an age which had mastered photomechanical process, and imagines him going on to remark about his original work: "This is how it pleases me to represent the world in which I live and the people who move restlessly around me. I wish to see them like that; I see them like that because it amuses me" (p. 43). Of crucial importance in the evolution of Laboureur's style was his brief adherence to cubism, which began in 1913. Though his prints of this period rank with those of La Fresnaye, Marcoussis, Picasso, and Villon, the masters with whom he exhibited, his interest in cubism was "decorative rather than analytical," and he used the new style from the first for subjects of an anecdotal nature.60 60. See Robert Allen's introduction to his catalogue Jean-Émile Laboureur: A Centenary Tribute (New York, 1977), p. 7. This personal emphasis became more pronounced in the burins of his album, Petites images de la guerre sur le front britannique of 1916, which Raoul Dufy thought superior to his earlier etchings.61 61. Jacqueline Loyer, Laboureur, oeuvre gravé et lithographié (Paris, 1962), p. 14. And when he turned to book illustration after the War, he in effect left cubism behind him. Burr Wallen, the scholar who has studied his cubist prints most closely, is able to claim for Laboureur's books after 1920 only that "his elegant plates . . . carry the stylishness of the Art Deco years to unrivalled heights of graphic refinement."62 62. Burr Wallen and Donna Stein, The Cubist Print (Santa Barbara, California, 1981), p. 49. Moreover, despite the geometric simplification of the images of Laboureur's cubist phase—the elongation of his figures, their ovoid heads, the reductions of his settings to their linear essentials—his work from the beginning had a classic cast based on his grasp of what the early masters of European engraving had to teach. "Whatever their anatomical distortion by the artist," Valotaire observes, "however schematic their presentation, [his people] still have a real existence; silhouette, attitude, gestures are always translated, transposed, in exact keeping" (p. 43). And as the years passed, the element of distortion in Laboureur's work progressively diminished, in the process enhancing his range and subtlety as an illustrator without impairing the distinctiveness of his style. Born to a solid middle-class family in Nantes during 1877, Laboureur received a humanistic education in that city before he enrolled at the age of 18 at the Sorbonne.63 63. The chief sources of biographical information about Laboureur are Louis Godefroy, L'Oeuvre gravé de Jean-Émile Laboureur (Paris, 1929) and the book of Jacqueline Loyer already cited. There is also useful material in Allen and in Valotaire. His studies in Paris were widely dispersed, including law as well as literature, and he was also much interested in the visual arts. Cézanne was the master whom he most revered, but his closest acquaintance was with Toulouse-Lautrec. Louis Godefroy relates that, after Laboureur met the painter in 1895, "he often saw him at work in the lithographic printing house which sometimes served as his studio," and that in time this association led him to take up painting himself, acquiring in the process something of his mentor's "subtle penetration into the comic aspect of men and things" (p. 20). Laboureur told Valotaire, indeed, that Lautrec's conversation "opened my eyes on many things; . . . he had the quickest of minds, spontaneous, altogether instinctive; his words had a turn, a sense as sharp as his design" (p. 13). Meanwhile, Laboureur was learning the technique of wood engraving from Auguste Lepère, to whom he had been introduced by Lotz-Brissonneau, the patron of the arts in Nantes who had also befriended Barbier. Though his first wood engraving and his first etching both date from 1896, it was not until after the War that his designs on metal began to outnumber his designs on wood. After performing his obligatory military service in 1898, Laboureur began his long years of travel. A student devoured by insatiable curiosity, he moved from country to country, at the same time applying himself in a desultory way to his craft as an etcher and an engraver. In 1898 and 1899 he was in Dresden, where he worked in the Cabinet des Estampes, pondering the prints of the early Italian, German, and French masters of engraving. From them, Godefroy holds, Laboureur took "the slightly unbending boldness of his precise figures, [his] often-used perspective of the stained glass window, and [his] anecdotal relish," without lapsing into false naïvete or anachronism (p. 21). Between 1903 and 1908 he passed much of his time in the United States and Canada, instead, as he put it, of "vegetating in Nantes or Paris."64 64. Quoted by Loyer, p. 13. There he was particularly drawn to Pittsburgh whose scenes of vast industrial activity he recorded in his etchings. During these years he toured the continent as a lecturer for the Alliance Française on subjects which touched both art and literature. After a protracted sojourn in London, where he developed a passion for Rowlandson, a trip to Greece in 1909 made him acquainted with the decorative art of ancient vases and frescoes, and his immersion in the Florentine world during the following spring led him to transfer the vision they offered, so Godefroy maintains, to the world around him. "The spectacle of modern life would henceforth suffice for Laboureur" (p. 25). He returned to Paris in 1910, where he settled down at last to a career as an artist. With the outbreak of the War, he was soon in uniform. Speaking fluent English, though with an American accent, he was attached as an interpreter, first to the Twelfth Division of the British Army for more than two years and then to the American Naval Base at Saint Nazaire. No doubt active participation in organized communal life was a revelation to Laboureur, but it should also be noted that his was a special sort of military experience. "Here we hardly speak of the War," he wrote, "—but of literature, cooking, travel, the arts . . . and we pay no attention to cannons or airplanes, at any rate unless they are very near at hand."65 65. Quoted by Loyer, p. 14. Falling in with Marcel Boulestin, a fellow army interpreter, he prepared with him in 1915 a plaquette called Dans les flandres britanniques, which contained, in Boulestin's words, "no concessions to public sentimentality, no horrors, no patriotism—just picturesque little scenes of life in British Flanders."66 66. Quoted by Loyer, p. 14. Stimulated by the success of these illustrations, Laboureur devoted some of his abundant leisure the following year to the nine designs of Petites images de la guerre sur le front britannique. For all its slightness this album was of special significance in Laboureur's career as a book-artist, displaying, as it did, what his friend Max Jacob had recognized as his particular sort of cubism, tempered by a distinctive humor and a full appreciation of Cézanne's contributions. It also saw the first employment of what became his characteristic technique on metal. Unable to carry about with him the equipment required for etching, he had recourse to the burin, using his graver to work directly on copper plates which he obtained from army stock. (The resulting prints are unlike the typical dry point, and I shall refer to them simply as burins.) Several plaquettes of wood engravings in a similar style ensued, among them Types de l'armée américaine en France of 1918, recording his impressions of the American Expeditionary Force. Laboureur's last months in uniform were spent installing the collections of the Musée de la Guerre. Once again a civilian, he had to consider what the future held for him. Though he was well known as an etcher and engraver, he discovered that a new career was opening out before him. The combination of artistic talent and broad literary culture which he had to offer was eminently marketable in the publishing world of the 1920s. For several years, nonetheless, he remained primarily a printmaker, the various books which he adorned being of relatively minor importance. In 1923 he founded Les Peintres-Graveurs Indépendantes and served as its first president. His profound mastery of both the history and technique of engraving ensured that he would be in demand as a lecturer and as a writer, and a forceful personality combined with his many accomplishments to make him a person of consequence in the Parisian art world. Moreover, the erstwhile wanderer had settled down to a comfortable domestic existence. After his marriage in 1919, he and his wife lived chiefly on the Breton coast near Nantes, latterly in a house which they built at Kerfahler in the Morbihan. Two sons were born to them. His 4.1 appearance during this time of great prosperity is suggested by an affectionate if teasing word-portrait which his friend Roger Allard drew of him in 1925: Physically, M. Laboureur is a corpulent man, clean-shaven, full of gravity and finesse, such as one is pleased to imagine the President de Brosses [the bibliophile landlord with whom Voltaire quarrelled at Ferney], in his vigorous maturity. Thus his figure offers a pleasant contrast to the personages whose slim and supple contours he draws; not through retaliation inspired by jealousy and spite, [however,] for M. Laboureur has nothing of the aspect of a martyr to obesity. What am I saying! That impudent word conveys very poorly the idea of an agreeable embonpoint, all aflower at its summit with smiles and optimistic words.67 67. "J.-É. Laboureur, un vignettiste de notre temps," Plaisir de bibliophile, 2 (April 1925), 67. We may turn now to Laboureur's career as a book artist. His various war-time albums have been mentioned. His first true book illustrated with original graphics was L'Appartement des jeunes filles by Roger Allard, who had written a letter-preface for Petites images de la guerre sur le front britannique.68 68. See the article by Allard just cited. Projected before the War, it finally appeared in 1919. To adorn his friend's poems about young women at play, enjoying tennis, swimming, and less innocent diversions, Laboureur pro- 4.2 vided six burins, still very much in the style of Petites images de la guerre. Even so, they were not always received as cubist inventions, some critics being reminded instead of the elongated bodies and small heads in Louis Binet's illustrations for the novels of Restif de la Bretonne. Though hardly more than a plaquette, the volume was well presented by its publisher, Camille Bloch, and bibliophiles found it attractive. Through his connection with the Nouvelle Revue Française, Allard persuaded Gaston Gallimard in 1920 to commission designs from Laboureur for Valery Larbaud's Beauté, mon beau souci, the story of a romance between a young Frenchman and a London typist. This was a much more substantial undertaking than L'Appartement des jeunes filles. Allard knew now to ensure that, despite its being only a demi-luxe edition of 412 copies, typography, layout, and paper were more than acceptable. Instead of the six isolated plates of L'Appartement des jeunes filles, drawn without regard for their placement in the text, Laboureur designed a frontispiece and 38 vignettes. His evocation of London was essentially what could be seen by a visitor quite outside the city's intimate life. The flavor of English existence is conveyed chiefly through street scenes—the top of an omnibus (p. 43), for example, or the Marble Arch (p. 69). Only occasionally is the focus narrowed even to such a subject as 4.3 the couple at tea in the Edgware Road (p. 72). It will be noted that the distortion of Laboureur's figures has become less extreme than in L'Appartement des jeunes filles. The many miniature illustrations dropped in the text—a bouquet of flowers (p. 36), a pair of letters (p. 66), or a 4.4 crocodile-skin valise (p. 139)—were already a trademark with the artist. Beauté, mon beau souci was a key book for Laboureur in that it established the pattern which he typically followed during his 20 years as a book artist. His aim was to establish an ambiance for his text through decorative compositions, not to detail once again in pictures what had already been written in words. So the effect of his designs comes more from their impact as a series than from the specific contribution of each individual illustration. In a phrase once used by The New Yorker, what counts is "all of the whole of the tout ensemble." When compared with the blaze of color that one finds in Barbier and Schmied, Laboureur's minimal blacks and grays may at first seem meager and drab. Yet the strategy works, for the reader has been brought to a properly receptive frame of mind by the decorative vision which Laboureur's spare and elegant line imposes. Despite its excellence, the small edition of Beauté, mon beau souci was not exhausted for two years, a circumstance which Allard invidiously ascribed to the vogue of "horrible coloriages printed in the style of luxurious catalogues" (p. 73). Meanwhile, Laboureur was demonstrating his mastery as a book-artist of other graphic techniques: of wood 4.5 engravings printed in color in Évariste Parny's Chansons madécasses 4.6 of 1920, of aquatint in Diderot's Supplément au voyage de Bougainville of 1921, and of lithographs in Jean Giraudoux's Promenade avec Gabrielle, which was finished in 1921 though it was not published until 1924. Even if in the future he often resorted to wood engraving, and occasionally to lithography, for his illustrations, he was henceforth regarded primarily as an engraver and an etcher. Passing by a variety of minor, though interesting, publications, we may take up the tale again in 1925. Laboureur's position as an illustrator was now established. His collaboration in a livre d'art guaranteed its acceptance by bibliophiles. He could pick and choose among commissions, sometimes taking the initiative himself with publishers, in fixing on texts which appealed to his sophisticated personal taste. For a time the major books to which he applied himself were off-beat stories of 20th century French life, each revived for publication with his designs after it had achieved a following among a discriminating public. These included Jacques de Lacretelle's Silbermann of 1925, Remy de Gourmont's Le songe d'une femme of the same year, and Colette's L'Envers du musichall of 1926. It is easy to see why Silbermann, originally published in 1922, recommended itself to Laboureur. This short novel, which turns on the hostility and persecution encountered by a sensitive Jewish schoolboy at his Parisian Lycée, had a special significance in the perfervid atmosphere of the 1920s. In his 16 burins, eight plates and eight headpieces, the artist as usual devoted much of his attention to the ambiance of the tale. Scenes at the Lycée, in and out of class, in the comfortable family apartments of Silbermann and of his comrade who tells the story, and in the country where the boys take their vacation bring an easy and cultivated way of life before the reader. But Laboureur also shows an unaccustomed interest in the characters and their crucial confrontations. Mme. Silbermann is the subject of a full-scale portrait (p. 42). There is a stirring 4.7 tableau of Silbermann pulling himself together after a fight at school (opposite p. 68), and Laboureur does not neglect the moment of truth in 4.8 which the narrator overhears his parents talking about his friend (opposite p. 136). The result is one of Laboureur's more forceful series of designs. Without subordinating his decorative scheme, he has become as well an illustrator of psychological penetration. Published by the Nouvelle Revue Française, and evidently patterned on Beauté, mon beau souci, which that firm had issued in 1920, this demi-luxe book (442 copies) is equally attractive in its presentation, and Laboureur's response to its theme gives his illustrations a weight and meaning which do not detract in the least from their grace and elegance. Among the books illustrated by Laboureur of which Camille Bloch was the publisher, Le songe d'une femme is the most successful. Paul Escoube described Remy de Gourmont's novel in letters as "a kind of album of attitudes towards love, from the most modest and chaste to the most daring,"69 69. Prospectus for Le songe d'une femme. and these attitudes are comprehensively suggested in the 4.9 artist's 27 burins. Indeed, the frontispiece is dominated by a woman's head in outline, beyond which are glimpsed her diverse imaginings. But one may surmise that Laboureur found an even stronger reason for reviving this book after 20 years in the opportunity it gave him to depict the French countryside, thus embarking on what for him was a largely unexplored range of subjects. Distinctive as his female figures are, it is 4.10 the scenes of forest (p. 65), country house, and seashore (p. 109) which most engage the reader's attention. Once more the miniature designs, 4.11 country still-lifes such as just-prepared pots of jam (p. 31), have their special charm. Bloch's realization of this small quarto, published in an edition of 455 copies, has its ingenious touches, from the facsimiles of the correspondents' signatures to the choice of an Italic type newly designed by Bernard Naudin as "suitable to the epistolary form of the work."70 70. Prospectus for Le songe d'une femme. It may be mentioned that Bloch's final book illustrated by Laboureur, Remy de Gourmont's Couleurs of 1928, though more elaborate is less successful. The colors added to its 36 etchings seem superfluous in the work of this master of black and white. If we pass by the Tableau des grands magasins for the moment, Laboureur's next work of importance was his friend Colette's L'Envers du music-hall. Once again he had chosen a novel subject for his graver. In this account of music-hall existence before the War, first published in 1913, Colette drew upon reminiscences of a difficult period in her life. For its 440 copies Laboureur composed 32 burins, vignettes except for five plates, which convey the harshness of second-rate performers' lives 4.12 as seen from "the wrong side." The frontispiece, showing the troupe in the rain as it sets out on its travels, sets the tone for all the designs which follow. In consonance with Colette's vision there is glamor neither in the vignettes, which depict the habitual round of the players and theri ani- 4.13 mals—on stage (p. 9), at the side-scenes, or in the dressing-rooms—nor in the plates, which present the chief figures of the anecdotes that she relates. The artist has made his illustrations as bleak as his author's text. After 1925 Laboureur's work as a book artist became so diverse and abundant that it would be tedious and confusing to review it in strictly chronological order. I shall comment instead on some of the principal groups into which his books fall: (1) those with English subjects, including those with English texts published in England; (2) those concerned primarily with the material background of the life of worldly leisure; (3) a representative selection from his less substantial works; and (4) the two culminating books of the period, Suzanne et le Pacifique and Les contrerimes. An examination of these volumes will make it clear why Raymond Hesse could write by 1928: "Laboureur occupies a place entirely apart in illustration and . . . presents a personality of the first significance" (p. 54). Such an examination will also reveal decisive changes both in his approach to illustration and in his technique. Without ceasing to be primarily a decorative artist, imposing his vision through the uniform style of his many small designs, he made increasing concessions to illustration as traditionally conceived. He no longer confined himself, as of set purpose, to the marginal aspects of his texts. On occasion he allowed himself to be direct rather than oblique, portraying leading characters and depicting dramatic encounters. Moreover the calculated distortions and rigidities of his style became less pronounced; indeed, the figures in his designs assume almost normal proportions, and the settings in which they appear are drawn with increasing freedom. With regard to technique, Valotaire discerned a "second manner" in Laboureur's development as a book artist beginning with Les silences du Colonel Bramble. Supporting his argument from Laboureur's essays on the art and history of engraving, the critic shows how he came to employ a variety of tools, such as the etcher's needle and the roulette, to enrich and make flexible his basic work with the graver. Laboureur achieved thereby a fuller, subtler technique, better adapted to realizing the more complex values which he wished to impart to his illustrations (pp. 39-40). An example of Laboureur's "second manner" is offered by his contribution to one of the most delightful of Art Deco books, the tricentenary edition of Perrault's Contes published in 1928. Each of 33 graphic artists contributed a plate, but it was left to Laboureur to provide the striking 4.14 medley from Perrault's tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, and the rest) which opens this édition dite des "33 graveurs." It will be remembered that Beauté, mon beau souci of 1920 had London as its setting. Laboureur returned to an English subject in two of his most engaging series of illustrations, those for André Maurois' Les silences du Colonel Bramble and its sequel Les discours du docteur O'Grady, in 1926 and 1929 respectively. The former, according to Valotaire, was regarded as "the book which without any doubt has been the artist's greatest triumph" (p. 33). A perfect match between author and artist ensured that Laboureur would eventually illustrate these volumes, which were originally published in 1918 and 1922. Maurois had served as a liaison officer with the British Army during the War, and he based his narratives on his memories of these years. Laboureur had gone through very similar experiences; indeed, he might have been the interpreter Aurelle who figures in Maurois' books. Moreover, Maurois and Laboureur saw the world from a like perspective. Both would have endorsed W. E. H. Lecky's affirmation, which stands as the epigraph to Les silences du Colonel Bramble, that there are few better models in life than the English gentleman. The humor and charm of Maurois' ensuing text derives in large part from the imperturbble acceptance by his little group of British officers of whatever may befall them. Since they are serving behind the lines in Flanders during the later years of a war of attrition, the trials that come their way are relatively minor. Maurois' subject for the most part is not combat but that equivalent of peace-time domestic life which men fashion for themselves under such conditions and above all the conversations on all subjects under the sun which are thereby encouraged. Laboureur found much to appeal to his whimsical turn of mind in such a subject: for example, the gramophone in the officer's mess which becomes the Colonel's pride and joy (p. 13), or his being called upon to 4.15 reassure a maiden lady who has complained of the "shocking spectacle" presented by his soldiers at their morning ablutions (p. 167). Yet the dreariness of such a war is not suppressed in Laboureur's graphic commentary, as his frontispiece bears witness; nor are its dangers, as in his rendering of Maurois' almost mathematical demonstration that a shell 4.16 had to destroy Private Scott because no man escapes his destiny (p. 75). It is significant, as well, that in Les discours du docteur O'Grady Laboureur selects for illustration an anecdote related by Bramble which suggests the ruthlessness which lay beneath his amiable manner. Private Biggs, a small cockney, has complained that he runs so slowly that he will never get a chance to kill. In the next attack his gigantic mates corner two Germans 4.17 in their trench until Biggs can finish them off (p. 112). Throughout the two volumes Laboureur characterizes his principal personages exclusively through their bodily confirmation and posture. Their faces count for nothing, yet their silhouettes identify them unmistakably, as in this 4.18 rendering of the Colonel and Aurelle setting out for Ypres (Bramble, p. 135). Both Les silences du Colonel Bramble and Les discours du docteur O'Grady have a frontispiece and 14 vignettes, burins in the first and burins completed by etching in the second. They were printed in editions of 440 and 430 copies respectively, but it must be admitted that, except for Laboureur's engravings, they would hardly qualify as livres d'art. Laboureur's designs for Oscar Wilde's Le portrait de Dorian Gray are among his best work, and once again they show him departing widely from his usual strategy for presenting a text. The sober elegance of the large headpieces executed by burin and roulette which introduce each of the 20 chapters of this ambitious livre d'art, published in 1928 in an edition of 280 copies, makes them highly decorative, but in their indirect and understated way they are also true illustrations. Until his final design Laboureur is content to play down the sensational elements of Wilde's novel. For example, the reader never sees the portrait which must bear the cumulative effect of Dorian Gray's misdeeds. In the headpiece to 4.19 the first chapter, while Lord Henry Wotton speaks to Basil Hallward as the painter adds his finishing touches (p. 1), the canvas is shown from behind. Later it is wrapped for removal to storage (p. 183), and still later our angle of vision is limited to Basil Hallward's reaction when Dorian draws back the curtain which conceals it (p. 239). Again, when the young actress Sybil Vane kills herself after her brutal rejection by Dorian, we are shown her corpse (p. 143), but the true horror of the episode has already been brought home by Laboureur's depiction of Dorian's sinister 4.20 figure as he returns home at dawn through Covent Garden Market after their confrontation (p. 125). Indeed, the stages of Dorian's degradation are rarely presented in a broad or obvious way. The experiments in behavior into which he is led by his absorption in Huysmans' À rebours are suggested merely by a glimpse of him reading in his study. Yet in the latter half of the book the mood of the artist's designs does become increasingly threatening: blacks and dark grays predominate in his engravings of London's gloomiest aspects. Then comes Wilde's melodramatic climax, which even Laboureur could not resist. We see at last what the portrait would have revealed, when Dorian, seeking to destroy the can- 4.21 vas with the knife which he used to kill Basil Hallward, thereby kills himself (p. 341). Laboureur's extensive English connections led to his providing designs for some 18 books with texts in English, nearly all of them printed in England. The most considerable of these were Jacques Cazotte's The Devil in Love of 1925, Thomas Carew's A Rapture of 1927, Sterne's A Sentimental Journey and The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy of 1928 and 1929-30 respectively (the last three for the Golden Cockerel Press), and George Farquhar's The Beaux' Strategem also of 1928. Of The Devil in Love 395 copies were printed for England and 365 for the United States. The latter issue has six etchings. In dealing with this short picaresque tale, first published as Le diable amoureux in 1772, Laboureur paid more attention than usual to period decor and costume, and though his plates are highly decorative, they are also tied to specific episodes in the text with the relevant passages printed below the images. Moreover, the moments Laboureur chose are crucial to the progress of the story, as in this Venetian tableau of the seeming assassination of 4.22 Biondetta, with whom the narrator is in love (p. 48). The result is a commentary on Cazotte's text as pertinent as it is lively. A Sentimental Journey may stand as representative of the works of classic English literature which Laboureur illustrated. As with his 15 plates for Tristram Shandy, his six for this work combine engraving and etching. Hardly more than sketches of passing moments in Sterne's chronicle, his designs leave unexploited such familiar passages as that on "The Dead Ass" in which an old traveller discourses mournfully on the loss of his patient companion. But in style and manner they harmonize with Sterne's carefully informal text, just as they suggest the book's 18th century background. An ex- 4.23 ample is Sterne's purchase of gloves from a fair shopkeeper in Paris (opposite p. 69). Also deserving of comment is William Cowper's The Diverting History of John Gilpin, published by Ronald Davis of Paris in 1931 in an edition of 57 copies. It is stated of the comic drawings of this little book that "the lithographs have been drawn by Lucien Serre et Cie." In the style of English caricatures of the later eighteenth century, and thus after their fashion contemporary with Cowper's poem, they may have been intended by Laboureur as a tribute to a long-time favorite, Thomas Rowlandson. They are altogether unlike his work on metal, though they have a certain kinship to the lithographs from his own hand in Jean Giraudoux's Promenade avec Gabrielle of 1921. As will be seen 4.24 from the opening shown, their animation, color, and abundance (one to a page) make an appeal quite different from that of Laboureur's usual designs. Finally, Laboureur's friendship for Marcel Boulestin led him to design frontispieces for a number of the latter's culinary and gastronomical works. They also collaborated in two books, Petits et grands verres, of which more presently, and The New Keepsake for the Year 1921. For the latter Boulestin selected the texts and Laboureur the plates. Among the artists he chose were Robert Bonfils, Galanis, Marcel Gromaire, Marie Laurencin, and Dunoyer de Segonzac—the French contemporaries whose work he found most congenial. His own contribution, characteristically, 4.25 was the portrait of a barmaid (p. 35), which may serve to represent his illustrations for Boulestin in general. Laboureur's frontispieces to Boulestin's books provide a natural transition to an idiosyncratic category among his books of the middle and later 1920s, those in which he took as his subject the material setting for the life of worldly leisure. Himself a bon vivant who delighted in food, wine, and the spectacle of society, he here concerned himself not so much with its people as with its background and accoutrements. In his hands these things, usually left to the often gross and always suspect attentions of advertisers, were imbued with a grace and elegance which make them a delight to behold. J. Valmy Baysse's Tableau des grands magasins of 1925 surveys the great Parisian department stores through informal essays and sketches. Published in the collection "Tableaux contemporains," which included another notable volume in Tristan Bernard's Tableau de la boxe with etchings by Dunoyer de Segonzac, it appeared in an edition of 315 copies with 12 burins by Laboureur: six plates, which are among his most ambitious illustrations, and six headpieces. As the author observes, the department store claimed all retail commerce as its province, and to attract the public to this novel initiative it drew upon the boldest experiments of contemporary decorative art (p. 25). Thus Laboureur's plates in their small way are as representative of the Art Deco style as was anything in 4.26 the great exhibition of the same year. An example is a scene before an elevator (opposite p. 55). Elsewhere he shows the store at its busiest and most animated, during sales, for example, or just before Christmas (op- 4.27 posite table of contents). "The hectic, charming, Parisian atmosphere" (p. 126) of the establishment is omnipresent in his engravings. Petits et grands verres: choix des meilleurs cocktails of 1927 was translated from the English of Nina Toye and A. H. Adair by Laboureur himself under the pseudonym of Ph. Le Huby. The unsigned preface, the work of Marcel Boulestin in the English version of 1925, has touches which can only have come from Laboureur. The resulting small quarto is one of the artist's most delightful books. Only the 260 copies of the limited edition included his 10 burins, plates which again exceed his usual scale. The preface opens with a nostalgic survey of the Parisian bars of the beginning of the century. Included are reminiscences of ToulouseLautrec, for whom "all bars were good, but he had his preferences" (p. 2). Lautrec was not above inventing cocktails, it is related, though he himself preferred a bottle of Scotch and a siphon. A section on the history of the cocktail follows, in which assurance is offered that they are now served as frequently at home as in public. There is a concluding admonition to the reader to try his own hand at devising recipes, thereby contributing "to the progress of a young art, which is full of promise" (p. 6). Laboureur's plates begin with bars at various social levels, including a design set in the 1890s and inscribed "hommage to Toulouse-Lautrec," 4.28 which shows the painter's occasional subject, "Chocolat dancing in a bar." He proceeds to groups of drinkers in other settings, beside a tennis court, in a boudoir, at a picnic, and—as a tribute to creole cuisine—on a plantation. That the book was a labor of love for Laboureur, in both its text and its illustrations, is evident throughout. How Laboureur could transform the backgrounds against which the leisure class led its life was shown again in 1927 through the 10 burins which illustrated Valery Larbaud's 200 chambres, 200 salles de bain, a volume issued in 366 copies. The glimpses offered of the appearance and routine of this luxurious Portuguese hotel, which was considered large at 4.29 the time—its exterior, the arrival of guests, its garden, its dining room, and so on—show it to be a palace of distinction and elegance. These designs lead one to speculate on what Laboureur might have made of Arnold Bennett's Imperial Palace of 1930. Before paying tribute to Laboureur's outstanding books of the later 1920s, Suzanne et le Pacifique and Les contrerimes, I should mention three other works of interest. Georges Camuset's Les sonnets du docteur, the poems of a nineteenth century practitioner resuscitated by a Dijon publisher in 1926, has four etchings by Laboureur. An hors d'oeuvre among the artist's books, it is yet worth mentioning for two reasons. It shows him working in the same field as did Daumier, one of the masters to whom he was most devoted, in Némésis médicale, and it contains a 4.30 plate which in its way foreshadows his own fate. This striking design depicts Camuset's great-uncle Bernard, "still vigorous, but very old," succumbing to a stroke at table after consuming an excellent but too copious dinner (p. 52). Gastronomic subjects were always attractive to Laboureur, but it is curious that he should have chosen one with such admonitory overtones. Les caves du Vatican, a sortie or entertainment by André Gide, was first published in 1914. For the reissue of 1929-30, printed in an edition of 372 copies by the Nouvelle Revue Française, Laboureur provided a frontispiece for each of the five spacious volumes, as well as a headpiece for each chapter, for a total of 44 etchings. An unusual feature was the printing in bister of the headpieces with added touches of bister in the frontispieces. The publication presents both artist and author in a lighthearted mood, rather as if Eric Gill had undertaken to illustrate Steven- 4.31 son's New Arabian Nights. The frontispiece of the final volume shows Lafcadio committing his famous acte gratuite, a perfectly motiveless murder. Laboureur's designs for the 1930 reissues of Maeterlinck's La vie des abeilles, La vie des fourmis, and La vie des termites, first published in the years 1901 and following, constituted something of a tour de force. In the rich illustrations for an edition of La vie des abeilles which had appeared in 1908, Carlos Schwabe did full justice to the country settings of that book but ignored the insects which are its main concern. Not so Laboureur, who had at his command the delicacy and precision to deal expertly with these tiny creatures. Only a few of the 32 burins of these volumes are plates, such as that showing a beekeeper and his hives which 4.32 serves as the frontispiece to La vie des abeilles. The rest are vignettes, appearing on the opening page of each section of the three volumes, hardly larger than the insects they depict. Most successful, perhaps, are the headpieces for La vie des termites, made oblong rather than square 4.33 to accommodate these white ants in their habitat. Here is Laboureur's sketch of the queen and her consort, about which Maeterlinck wrote: "this queen presents the most monstrous hypertrophy that one finds in the whole world of insects, and yet Nature is not miserly with monstrosities" (p. 89). Apart from Laboureur's designs these three volumes, published in editions of 750 copies each, make only modest claims for themselves. We come now to Jean Giraudoux's Suzanne et le Pacifique. A reissue of 1927, six years after its initial appearance, it was undertaken for the bibliophile society, Les Cent Une. Since Laboureur's 33 burins, all vignettes but unusually large, made it one of his two or three finest books, it is unfortunate that the limitation of the edition to 125 copies has prevented most amateurs from becoming acquainted with it at first hand. Giraudoux's fantasy on the tropical island theme is related by an 18-yearold girl. Living with her tutor near Toulouse, Suzanne learns that she has won a trip around the world in a competition held by an Australian newspaper. Laboureur's designs for the early chapters, which show her at 4.34 home and aboard an ocean liner on her way to Sydney (as on p. 62), establish the familiar world from which she is swept by a tempest. Then comes the heart of the book, her experiences on the island where she finds herself. For Giraudoux the interest of the situation lay in her responses, at once naïve and sophisticated. Laboureur found his opportunities in the hitherto unexplored scenes offered to him, vegetation, birds, animals, all under a different sun. Suzanne is cordially received by the 4.35 island's creatures (p. 101), for in its way it is a paradise. At one with 4.36 nature, her adventure becomes an idyll (p. 180). Indeed, her rescue, 4.37 when it occurs, is an anti-climax (p. 244). Godefroy has well observed how marvellously Laboureur contrived to associate "his brilliant linear art with Giraudoux's sparkling, mannered prose. These small prints, ethereal, transparent, and satin-like with tropical light, have the shimmering brightness of the text which they accompany" (p. 29). It is revealing to compare Laboureur's burins with the copper engravings which the always estimable Jean-Gabriel Daragnès made for his edition of Suzanne et le Pacifique the following year. Though dealing with a tropical paradise, a subject which would seem to call out for bright colors and a wide canvas, Laboureur's delicate art prevails. Even if judged by entirely conventional expectations concerning the livre d'art, Paul-Jean Toulet's Les contrerimes of 1930 has few rivals among Art Deco books. Issued in an edition of 301 copies, it is a large quarto to which paper, typography, and mise en page have all made their appropriate contributions. The artist's 62 vignettes, distributed evenly through its 145 pages, make it his fullest effort of illustration. The distortion that marked the figures of Beauté, mon beau souci a decade earlier has virtually disappeared, yet the subtler aspects of Laboureur's style continue to give his designs a unifying stamp. Indeed, they are as harmonious as they are varied, never departing from their note of urbane elegance. Among Toulet's hundred-odd poems—polished, witty, and worldly— Laboureur seized upon whatever points happened to catch his fancy. Often a passing image or allusion provided the hint for a small decora- 4.38 tion. When love is compared to smoke, for example, a small engraving shows cigarettes, a holder, an ashtray, and a matchbox, all in the Art Deco style (p. 87). At the other end of the scale, a reference to Arles or London, to Djibouti or Saigon, calls forth a more substantial rendering. These crisp and economical evocations are usually generalized, but sometimes they reflect special conditions imposed by the text, as when Toulet 4.39 describes an elephant on the streets of Paris (p. 33). Since love, always profane, is a prominent theme, Laboureur depicts many pretty ladies. 4.40 So a young girl awakens from a dream of lost virginity (p. 30), or an orgy is glimpsed during a moment of lassitude (p. 61). In sum, the world of Toulet's imagination is offered to the reader with consistent distinction, the poet's command of intricate verse forms being matched by the artist's mastery of his graver. Laboureur's career as a book artist had reached its peak between 1926 and 1930, when each year saw the appearance of several significant volumes with his designs. Yet the financial crisis of 1930—31 was not the disaster for him that it was for Schmied. It is true, however, that thereafter, apart from the drawings for two volumes of Maupassant's Oeuvres complètes in 1934 and 1936, which were reproduced by mechanical process, only a few major commissions came his way, and those for the most part were for editions of 200 copies or fewer, directed at the minuscule market of wealthy collectors whose devotion to livres d'art had survived the crash. Indeed, the most appealing of these, Perrault's Peau d'âne of 1935 with 31 etchings, limited to 75 copies, was issued by the artist himself. But Laboureur had another string to his bow. Once again he turned to print-making as his principal occupation, and some of his most ambitious works, including the 25 landscapes of the series devoted to a vast swamp near the Loire called La Grande Brière, date from this period. The serious illness which had overtaken Laboureur at the end of 1938 left him permanently paralyzed at Kerfahler after an attack during the following Easter vacation. Though he could no longer draw, a letter of 15 December 1941 to his friend and patron Jacques André in Paris, which is mounted in a copy of Le portrait de Dorian Gray owned by a New York collector, bears witness that he remained mentally alert and still concerned with the interests of a lifetime. Dictated to his wife, but bearing his faltering signature, it acknowledges the receipt of 2500 francs for "putting all the color desirable" in a set of his illustrations for Wilde's novel and expresses his eagerness to visit Paris in order to see the bindings which Paul Bonet had created for André's copies of books with his illustrations. Whether he was allowed to leave the zone interdite of which the War had made Kerfahler a part is uncertain. He died there in 1943. Though Laboureur was a supreme Art Deco book artist, and each of his principal books exemplifies the style in a striking way, I should emphasize in my conclusion that he also became an outstanding illustrator in the traditional sense. An intelligent man of wide sympathies, as much at home in literature as in life, he was expert at mastering and interpreting the texts which he himself chose. Despite the abundance of his production, he succeeded in avoiding repetition and monotony. Since he worked through selection rather than profusion, he never overwhelmed the reader with his designs. Once his cubist phase was over, his style acquired a suppleness which enabled him to achieve the varied effects demanded by his ever changing subjects, without losing any of the distinctiveness which marked it as his own. Moreover, his way of seeing the world was witty in itself. The human comedy is always amusing as presented through his eyes. Since he invariably employed original graphics over which he had complete control, his resourcefulness enabled him to present his personal vision with a precise elegance which made the smallness of scale to which he worked a major asset. In sum, his notable volumes, among them Beauté, mon beau souci, L'Envers du music-hall, Les silences du Colonel Bramble, Suzanne et le Pacifique, Le portrait de Dorian Gray, and Les contrerimes, are among the classics of the French illustrated book. 5. Pierre Legrain and Art Deco Bookbinding We come finally to the bindings of the 1920s, which have been far more influential than illustrations in attracting admirers of Art Deco to the books of the period. In Victor Arwas' recent survey, for example, they are the subject of a major chapter, whereas illustrated books in themselves receive only sporadic attention.71 71. Art Deco (London, 1980). Moreover, the interest of collectors of Art Deco bindings now extends beyond Legrain, Schmied, and Rose Adler, beyond Cretté, Creuzevault, and Bonfils, beyond a dozen other authentic workers in the style, to binders whose productions had dropped out of sight for decades and perhaps will do so again. Indeed, almost any elaborately decorated binding of the 1920s, no matter how inferior its quality, seems today to find its purchaser, a situation that will surely change as the original and accomplished work of the time becomes more generally known. It will be well to begin with a brief account of what Legrain and his followers were to disavow. That the 25 years between the publication of Marius Michel's L'Ornementation des reliures modernes in 1889 and the outbreak of the War were a high point of French fine binding is now generally conceded. The ranking masters were Henri Marius Michel, Émile Mercier, and Charles Meunier, but there were a dozen other binders like Canape, Carayon, Chambolle-Duru, Gruel, Kieffer, Maylander, and Noulhac, whose work was regarded as almost equally acceptable. The revolutionary principle announced in the preface to Marius Michel's treatise, that one should "make the exterior decoration of a book accord with the subject treated therein" (p. 2), was explored in all its nuances with remarkable results. As Marius Michel himself pointed out, this principle could be applied as appropriately to modest as to elaborate bindings, but in the eyes of posterity, the idea of opulence came to be associated as firmly with bindings as with all other aspects of Belle Epoque production. There is the story, indeed, of the traditionalist, distressed by the tendencies of the time, who remarked of a characteristic example: "You call that a binding? It is the foyer of the Opéra!" At any rate, when a reaction occurred after the War, it was in the name of simpler, more restrained decoration, though still one appropriate to the book being bound. What critics then found to deplore will become evident if we glance at four examples of Belle Epoque binding 5.1 at its most ambitious. Marius Michel's creation for Huysmans' À rebours of 1903 illustrated by Lepère is a particularly successful specimen of the floral ornament which he made synonymous with Art Nouveau binding. Its suitability to the text is achieved by a subtle harmony of color and design, not by anything assertively allusive. Far less restrained were the so-called reliures parlantes of the period, decorated with pictures in mosaic morocco of scenes from the text. Their sumptuousness 5.2 is shown in Meunier's doublure for Octave Uzanne's Physiologies des 5.3 quais de Paris of 1893. Even richer is the Arabian splendor of Maylander's binding for Toussaint's Le jardin des caresses of 1914, illustrated by Léon Carré. A double purpose is served by my final example. 5.4 Another reliure parlante by Meunier, this time on Erastène Ramiro's Faune parisienne of 1901, with illustrations by Louis Legrand, it makes use of incised leather panels after Legrand's etchings. Though executed in every respect as if it had been done at the time of the book's publication, it is dated 1924—thus underlining the persistence of conservative taste among post-War bibliophiles. During the course of the 1920s the dominance among bibliophiles of the binding tradition just described was called into question, shaken, and finally overcome by the example of one man, Pierre Legrain. But this was a gradual process, and the assertion in Pierre Legrain relieur, the standard catalogue of his work, that between 1919 and 1929 he was the "uncontested master" of the art of binding72 72. Pierre Legrain relieur (Paris, 1965), p. ix, apparently quoting Rose Adler, but she was writing of 1930. See below, note 96. In my account of Legrain's life I have depended chiefly on the essay by his stepson, Jacques Anthoine-Legrain, in this volume. is far from correct. The story of his brief but spectacular career in bookbinding is more complex as well as more interesting. The son of a well-to-do industrialist, born 20 October 1889, Legrain passed his early years in a Parisian suburb. By the age of 12 he had left school to apply himself to the study of design, which he pursued with increasing fervor. He was almost equally devoted to sports, notably tennis, cycling, and pelota (jai alai). Excessive exertion during a cycling tour brought on a nearly mortal attack, and he was henceforth afflicted with a cardiac condition which made him incapable of sustained physical effort. At the same period his father suffered drastic business reverses, and the elder Legrain's death shortly thereafter left Legrain and his mother without resources. Following a period of recuperation in the Auvergne, he returned to Paris to earn their living by his designs. Eventually his drawings brought him to the attention of the decorator Paul Iribe, whose friend and assistant he became. Between 1908 and 1914 he was Iribe's unacknowledged collaborator in all sorts of decorative work, sometimes originating designs, sometimes completing them from Iribe's sketches. After the War began, he saw such noncombatant duty as his physical condition permitted. He also married the young mother of Jacques Anthoine, later himself a well-known binder under the name Jacques Anthoine-Legrain, and she gave him a happy and comfortable home. This was Legrain's situation in 1916 when Jacques Doucet made him a momentous proposal.73 73. On Doucet see François Chapon, Mystère et splendeur de Jacques Doucet 1853-1929 (Paris, 1984). Adept at everything having to do with decoration, he yet had little public reputation of his own. And at a time when the War had suppressed both the materials and the market for the decorative arts, he was hard put to find employment. Doucet was celebrated as a fashion designer, a collector, and a patron of artists and writers. Having sold his great 18th century collection in 1912, he was in the process of forming another, a bibliothèque moderne, which would include not only the books but also the working manuscripts and the proofs of leading contemporary authors—a truly original conception anticipating by decades the institutional collecting policies of our own time. Through his commissions to artists and artisans he was also one of the principal inspirers of the Art Deco style. If Legrain had talent in need of employment, Doucet had a collection of books requiring to be bound, and in his atelier were the materials for such bindings. Marie Darmoy, Doucet's first librarian, imagines him addressing Legrain, "while the battle of Verdun was raging," in these terms: I have got rid of everything old. Now, I have modern furniture, modern paintings, modern books, but when I give one of these to a binder, he overwhelms me with horrible, intricate bindings, copies or pastiches of ancient bindings. I want modern bindings for modern books. Thus far I have found no one to make them for me. If you will apply yourself to the task, it will go very well.74 74. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xviii. When Legrain protested that he had no competence as a binder, Doucet replied: "You will draw the maquettes, and the binders who have worked for me up till now will execute them." So Legrain was installed in Doucet's dining room, comfortably warm even under wartime conditions, at the then acceptable wage of 300 francs a month. Between 1917 5.5 and 1919 he designed some 370 bindings which were executed principally by René Kieffer, but also by Canape, Noulhac, and Germaine Schroeder. Thus it happened that a great binder found his vocation and that the first step was taken towards revolutionizing the style of modern French binding. The books which resulted exist today, intact and fresh, at the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris. The originality of Legrain's work is evident at a glance. In their restrained elegance they offer a refreshing change from the still prevailing opulence of Belle Epoque binding. Legrain touched on the rationale of these early bindings in an interview of 1923. While explaining how the artist differs from the artisan, he remarked that "one must know how to take advantage of large surfaces, of elliptical hints which point to subtle thoughts, and which, under very simple appearances, allow very delicate ideas to be surmised." Above all one should not "over-embellish" but use the Jansenist cover as a base, rejecting "traditional lace patterns, ancestral fleurons, complicated mosaics, raised bands dividing the spine."75 75. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xlii. Considered intrinsically rather than historically, however, Legrain's earliest bindings can hardly be regarded as masterpieces. No doubt they employ the best morocco. No doubt such frills as gilt edges are disdained. No doubt their austere geometric patterns are harmonious and their infinitely varied use of typographic characters from a book's title to adorn its front cover is truly original. No doubt, as Jacques Chapon has recently shown (pp. 257-258), the bindings designed for each of Doucet's authors, Claudel, Gide, Verlaine, and the rest, form a distinct group with its prevailing colors, styles, and motifs. Yet to a degree these are negative virtues. If it is hardly a question of the emperor's new clothes, one nevertheless understands why the wits of the time affected to see in Doucet's ensemble of book furniture chiefly the "insistence on detail" characteristic of a grand couturier (p. 157). Legrain's great achievements as a binder lay ahead. After he completed his bindings for Doucet in 1919, he continued to work for him as a designer of furniture and other objects. Indeed, as Jacques Guignard is careful to emphasize: "until the end of his life binding remained only a secondary preoccupation with him, and he never forgot what he had been from the first: a decorator."76 76. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xxvii. Legrain had shown his bindings with success at the Société des Artistes Décorateurs in 1919, and he did not lack for other clients. As he continued to exhibit each year at the Société des Artistes Décorateurs, and beginning in 1922 at the Salon d'Automne, interest in his work grew apace. From the latter year onward articles about his bindings appeared with increasing frequency in periodicals devoted to art, decoration, and book collecting.77 77. See Pierre Legrain relieur, pp. 195-197. He could now pick and choose among clients, and sometimes even among books, and he no longer had to produce nearly 200 bindings a year. His services were sought by the more adventurous bibliophiles of the day, among them Baron Robert de Rothschild and Hubert de Montbrison. It was only after Legrain had left Doucet, incidentally, that his work began fully to reflect the spirit of the often quoted dictum which he pronounced in 1923: "Each binding is the frontispiece to each book; it synthesizes the work, it is the frame which should embellish and give value to it."78 78. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xlii. Two descriptions of bindings provided by Legrain himself offer examples of his practice. Of a binding on Maeterlinck's Serres 5.6 chaudes (No. 644) he wrote: "a few circles and two curved lines on a background of orange will suggest the creepers of rich tropical vegeta- 5.7 tion," and of a binding of 1922 on Roland Dorgelès' Les croix de bois (No. 246): "The wooden crosses . . . will be black on a silver background to create a striking ensemble in harmony with the speculations of the book."79 79. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xlii. The numbers given in parentheses are those of this standard catalogue. Further examples are provided by two maquettes in the New York Public Library, both rendered in 1921 by René Kieffer for Baron 5.8 Robert de Rothschild. The first is on René Boylesve's Nymphes dansant avec les satyrs of 1920 (No. 103). This design, which is carried out on bottle green calf, decorated in silver with inlays of black morocco, suggests a fountain with a single jet. (Legrain explains his correction of the lettering in a note: "Les naïades sont des satyrs.") The second was de- 5.9 signed for Oscar Wilde's Ballade de la géôle de Reading of 1918 with wood engravings by Daragnès (No. 1219), perhaps of all livres d'art the one most frequently selected for extra binding during the 1920s. Legrain alone decorated no fewer than 12 copies. Executed on black calf with the chains in silver, it may be preferred in its powerful simplicity to the more elaborate binding of 1929 for the same work which will be shown later in the lecture. Here I should note that I have worked with actual bindings wherever possible. Starting with my own collection, I have drawn particularly on the holdings of the New York Public Library, the Yale University Library, and the Stanford University Library. But in the interest of comprehensiveness I have supplemented these resources by reproductions from secondary works: from Pierre Legrain relieur of 1965, which includes the standard catalogue of his bindings; from the third volume of Devauchelle's La reliure en France de ses origines à nos jours of 195961; and from Rose Adler's Reliures, a portfolio of 1929 surveying contemporary binding. The volumes in the New York Public Library require a brief description. With one exception they were received from George Blumenthal in 1937. They were bound for Mrs. Florence Blumenthal, an American living in Paris, in the years following the award of the Prix Blumenthal to Legrain. Mrs. Blumenthal was an ardent patron of literature, the friend of Proust and Valéry, as well as a bibliophile. Five of her bindings are unrecorded in the standard catalogue, and others are listed but not described. They show her commissions developing from relatively simple designs on modest first editions to elaborate compositions on large-scale livres d'art, a typical progression, one imagines, among Legrain's clients of the later 1920s. The exception mentioned above is one of three albums, and by far the most important, in which Legrain near the end of his life collected the maquettes for his bindings.80 80. See the description in Martin Breslauer's catalogue no. 101 (London, 1970), item 324. This large folio contains 96 drawings in black and white and in color, many with instructions to the binders, though these are usually laconic, his rule obviously being that design was his province, its realization his binders'. The drawings cover his entire career from 1917 to 1929 and are mounted, with some divergences, in something approaching chronological order. There is no more significant volume for the study of his work. A new phase in Legrain's work had begun by 1923. Hitherto he had relied on Kieffer and others to make bindings from his maquettes at their own establishments, but now increasing custom led him to improvise an atelier with the interior decorators Briant and Robert. A year later he removed to his own premises, and though he shifted their location several times, he henceforth had his staff of workers to realize his conceptions. By this time the simplicity and purity which he had initially advocated were no longer dominant aspirations. If he still deplored literal representation, such as a rose window on Huysmans' La cathédrale or the outline of the Acropolis on Renan's Prière sur l'acropole, he freely admitted allusive designs, emphasizing once more that the binding was an "introductory frontispiece, . . . which by its color, manner, decorative spirit, and ordering after a fashion announces the text it contains."81 81. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xliv. From this liberated position he began to create bindings which approached those of the pre-War binders themselves in complexity, though they were composed of very different decorative elements. Looking through the plates to Pierre Legrain relieur, which reproduce more than 300 bindings in predominantly chronological arrangement, one sees how vastly Legrain extended his decorative scope during this period. It was then that he was able to take full advantage of the good luck which Paul Bonet later discerned in reviewing Legrain's career: "He had known how to look at cubism and abstract art,—no one yet in the little world of binding was aware of these things—he, who came with fresh eyes and without prejudices, understood the new road that had opened up, [and] he entered upon it."82 82. Carnets, 1924-1971 (Paris, 1981), entry for July 1929. The use of typographical lettering continued to be a mainstay, but there were many new departures. More and more of his designs are asymmetrical. Arrangements of repeated small squares or circles are common, as are parallel lines, whether continuous or broken into dots, now straight, now curved, now crossed. Inlays are the rule, and, as Guignard points out, Legrain felt free to employ incrustations of unaccustomed materials: metals, rare woods, or mother-of-pearl.83 83. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xxxi. Here is a pair of examples of this practice, drawn from his earliest bindings for Mrs. Blumenthal in 1925. Relatively simple designs for literary first editions, they rely chiefly on novel substances 5.10 for their effect: black calf with mother-of-pearl inlays for André Gide's La porte étroite of 1909 and two tones of brown calf surrounding an oval of stained and polished wood with a translucent facing for the same au- 5.11 thor's Isabelle of 1911. Since he was now binding illustrated books as well as literary texts, he sometimes drew inspiration from a volume's graphic contents. This was true, for example, of his many bindings for Schmied's notable books of 1924 and 1925. The directly representational bindings of earlier years are far less in evidence, though they still occur. An example is Octave 5.12 Mirbeau's Le journal d'une femme de chambre (No. 698), bound between 1922 and 1924, the pattern of seeming bars on which actually derives from the book's wrappers simulating a chambermaid's ledger. But enough has been said to suggest Legrain's wonderful fertility of invention. We come now to the period in which Legrain in fact became the "uncontested master" of French binding. During the early 1920s when his rising reputation and increasing clientele were beginning to make perceptible inroads on the position of traditional binders, their acknowledged leader remained Henri Marius Michel. This magnificent veteran had entrusted the active management of his atelier to Georges Cretté in the years following the latter's return to Paris in 1919, but he remained vigorous and alert to what was going on in his world. Upon hearing his young friend Georges Blaizot, son of the bookdealer Auguste Blaizot, express his pleasure in the bindings which Legrain had displayed at the Société des Artistes Décorateurs, he mockingly remarked: "So, young man, you admire that, decorative art created with a square, a compass, and a drawing pen."84 84. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xxiii. There is a slightly different version of the story in Devauchelle, 3: 151. Yet in other moods he was capable of a detached response to the changes going on around him. Speaking to the students of the École des Arts Décoratifs in 1922, when he was 76, he conceded: "I am no longer regarded as a revolutionary. Just as in politics a person always seems reactionary to someone, in decorative art, a person is always pompous and pretentious [pompier] to the following generation and more than pompous and pretentious [vieux pompier] to the very young. You will be the same in your turns, but since decorative art is a long chain in which each new generation comes to forge a new ring, it suffices that the one which you will bring should intelligently fill its place for you to leave an honorable trace there."85 85. Crauzat, 2: 32-33. By presenting Legrain's challenge to traditional binding to public view, the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs of 1925 sealed his reputation. Even Clément-Janin, by no means a friendly observer, conceded in L'Art vivant that "Legrain, who is enjoying a recent access of fame, well symbolizes our epoch through his bindings"86 86. "Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs: le livre et ses éléments," L'Art vivant, 15 August 1925, p. 30. and illustrated his article with reproductions of six of Legrain's creations. Indeed, they were illustrated everywhere in reviews of the Exhibition as ranking Art Deco objects.87 87. See, for example, L'Amour d'art, August 1925, p. 289; Art et décoration, May 1925, p. 176. The opposition between old and new came to be summed up by the work of Marius Michel on the one hand and the work of Legrain on the other. To feel the impact of this confrontation, we cannot do better than consider two copies of the edition of Diderot's Le neveu de Rameau which was published in 1924 with illustrations by Bernard Naudin. The two generations of the Blaizot family commissioned bindings for this book, 5.13 the father from Marius Michel and the son from Legrain. The first, which is reproduced from the third volume of Devauchelle's La reliure en France (after page 90), is decorated with one of the master's richest patterns of floral ornamentation. It is an uncompromising example of 5.14 le style 1900, a superb anachronism. The second, which serves as the frontispiece to the same volume, shows Legrain, no longer hampered by theoretical restrictions, applying the full resources of the Art Deco style to bookbinding. Certainly it is among the earliest in the long series of Legrain's masterpieces. No doubt Legrain's career would have developed in much the same way if there had been no Exposition des Arts Décoratifs in 1925, though surely not as rapidly, but his triumph there did unmistakably confirm his arrival. This success was not a matter of chance. As Crauzat points out, the Jury which selected bindings for display, under the vice-presidency of René Kieffer, chose to interpret literally general rule four of the Exhibition which limited admission to "works of a novel inspiration and a real originality." Hence Marius Michel, faithful to the floral ornament of Art Nouveau, was excluded altogether, as were a number of other well known binders in traditional modes. The binders shown, in a somewhat irregular and scattered way, included true innovators like Legrain, Schmied, and Bonfils; a bevy of relieurs-femmes like Rose Adler, Germaine Schroeder, and Jeanne Langrand; and some long-established artisans who had admitted elements of modernity into their work like Canape, Gruel, Noulhac, and Kieffer himself. Legrain's mark was everywhere; it was he who had provided, Crauzat notes, "a marvellous impetus towards domains previously unknown and unexplored" (2: 177). Far from being gratified by this evidence of his influence, Legrain issued a circular-letter entitled Copying is Stealing (Copier, c'est voler), in which he complained that for several years he had been "the victim of manifest theft" by a generation of young binders. He pointed particularly to the School of the Union Centrale des Arts Décoratifs, where such systematic plagiarism was part of the program, as demonstrated by its display at the Exhibition. The replies which he received bore out his accusations. A Jury member recalled the "false Legrains" which had been paraded past him and his fellows. But in general Legrain's friends and admirers urged him to take the matter quietly, to reflect that this was the way in which styles imposed themselves. Indeed, René Lalique, who had been through the same ordeal, told him that it was "the consecration of success."88 88. See Pierre Legrain relieur, pp. xlv-xlvi. Marius Michel died on 9 May 1925, not long after the opening of the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs. In November of that year the continuing loyalty of bibliophiles to him was affirmed when the third section of the great library of René Deschamps-Scrive was sold at auction, its principal offerings being modern illustrated books in Marius Michel's mosaic bindings. The sale contained a single binding by Legrain, on Jules Renard's Histoires naturelles of 1899 with lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec. The catalogue's comment was laconic: "Curious binding in the modern style" (lot 275). The critical and financial success of the sale showed that most bibliophiles still placed their faith in the man whom Henri Beraldi called "the most considerable artist who had come along in binding since the Renaissance."89 89. La reliure du XIXe siècle (4 vols.; Paris, 1895-97), 4: 65. A similar reception was accorded the memorial exhibition of his bindings held in 1927. But though Marius Michel's successor, Georges Cretté moved away from his style only slowly, and other binders working in traditional modes retained their clients, Legrain by the later 1920s had carried the day. When he died in 1929, Crauzat, the ranking authority, wrote simply: "P. Legrain is `contemporary binding' " (2: 301). In our own time, of course, Marius Michel and Legrain are no longer seen as competitors, but in the former's long philosophic perspective as masters in a succession which runs: Marius Michel, Pierre Legrain, Paul Bonet, and perhaps Pierre-Lucien Martin. The years between 1925 and Legrain's death in 1929 saw the appearance of most of his best work. His understanding of the technique of binding, about which doubts had remained earlier, was complete. His workmen stood ready to execute whatever maquettes he gave them, even if at first they declared his inventions to be impossible of realization. Though he continued to be in great demand as a decorator, he came more and more to favor binding, even giving some thought to becoming an architecte du livre like Schmied, interesting himself in all aspects of the creation of livres d'art. Under these circumstances he had obviously left the rule, the square, and the compass far behind him. Indeed, Crauzat mentions that one of the motives for the increasing elaboration of his bindings was to discourage plagiarism. "His designs, very simple at the beginning, have been intentionally complicated, in order to render them as inimitable as possible, and thereby to dampen the ardor of his rivals" (2: 29). Perhaps the work of Legrain's period of full maturity can best be explored from the actual bindings available to me, either in my own collection or in the New York Public Library, by considering six volumes the decoration of which is based in various ways on one of his favorite patterns: parallel lines. Their arrangement varies from the simple to the complex, they make use as well of other design elements, their abstractions sometimes yield symbolic interpretations, but they all belong to the same family of compositions. When one realizes that Legrain had at his disposal many other such families, the range of his achievement will at least be glimpsed. First, three bindings in which the parallel lines are straight. That on 5.15 Valéry's Monsieur Teste of 1927, one of 20 copies on special paper for subscribers presented by the author to Mrs. Blumenthal, has a criss-cross pattern of gold, silver, and black lines, irregularly spaced and asymmetrically arranged, both on its covers and its doublures of dark green morocco. A modest conception for this period, it is a model of elegance, appropriate to a small but treasured volume. His more casual composition 5.16 for the Comtesse de Noailles' Les forces éternelles of 1920, one of three identical bindings in calf executed for Mrs. Blumenthal in 1927 (No. 746), was presumably as close as Legrain now cared to come to the sort of general library bindings he had earlier executed for favored clients. It shows how Legrain's patterns of parallel lines could be varied by reorientation and the introduction of non-linear elements. Much more 5.17 elaborate, a major undertaking indeed, is Wilde's Deux contes of 1926. Seemingly another abstract pattern, this complex creation is in fact based on Schmied's highly original decorative scheme for the book. The rectangles composed of dots combine the narrow vertical bands illustrating the first of the two stories, and the narrow horizontal bands illustrating the second, the whole design then being rotated on its axis some 20 or 25 degrees. Now, three bindings in which the parallel lines are curved. The sim- 5.18 plest of these covers René Boylesve's Souvenirs d'un jardin détruit of 1924 (No. 105), an unpretentious volume with wood engravings by Maximilien Vox, bound for Mrs. Blumenthal in 1926. Two blocks of parallel lines in gold on a background of gray morocco sufficed for such a book. Very different was the commission which Legrain received from the wellknown bibliophile Dr. Lucien-Graux for a first edition of Baudelaire's 5.19 Les paradis artificiels of 1861 inscribed to Edouard Thierry (No. 58), an exemplaire truffé to which three autograph letters of Baudelaire had been added. The reversed curves of Legrain's parallel lines are only a starting point for a design of restrained splendor evoking the opium and hashish dreams of Baudelaire's text. This binding attracted admiring notice from the time of its first exhibition in 1927. Equally ambitious was his creation of the following year for Mrs. Blumenthal's inscribed 5.20 copy of Valéry's La jeune Parque of 1925 (No. 1055), a much larger volume. Here Legrain used his reversed curves to suggest the serpent of 5.21 Valéry's text, also shown in a title page vignette. A second way of sampling the bindings of Legrain's later years is offered by the concluding maquettes in the New York Public Library album. These are all large and splendid designs, but I must rest content 5.22 with four. That for Gérard d'Houville's Le diadème de flore bound in 1929 (No. 463) was among those selected by Rose Adler for inclusion in her portfolio of 1929 surveying contemporary binding. On a background of white morocco, a handful of rings and concentric circles, bands and triangles, have been thrown in such a way as to suggest through abstract forms the profusion of nature. This is what Marius Michel's floral ornament had become by the end of the 1920s. French binders ever since have been following Legrain's lead in this experiment with color on white. 5.23 Perhaps the latest of Legrain's 12 designs for Wilde's Ballade de la géôle de Reading of 1918 (No. 1215) shows him reinforcing the idea of confinement, so simply presented eight years before, by a heavily barred window and a massive grill set in a gray wall. The unusual number of verbal instructions on the maquette were necessitated by the abundance 5.24 of mosaic work involved. Then there are Legrain's designs for the dou- 5.25 blures of the album itself, two of his most intricate geometric compo- 5.26 sitions, which far exceed in magnificence his composition for the covers of the volume. Since he elsewhere almost never decorated doublures, their presence attests to the importance he attributed to this collection of his maquettes. Finally, some discussion is required of the controversial topic of Legrain's bindings for early livres de peintre, all designs dating from the later 1920s. As has been mentioned, after the 1925 exhibition Legrain was established as the chosen binder of bibliophiles with modern tastes. Not only did they give him contemporary books to bind, both first editions and livres d'art, but they also sought out surviving copies in sheets of the pre-War livres de peintre which they were just beginning to collect. So it happened that these books bound by Legrain, or by binders like Cretté who came gradually to work in an idiom related to his, exist in some abundance. It is usually assumed that this is an altogether happy conjunction resulting in modern books in modern bindings. Yet questions arise. When a binder addresses himself to an unillustrated book, it may well suffice to declare with Rose Adler that he is "at the service of the text."90 90. Reliures présenté par Rose Adler (Paris, [1929]). But when the book is illustrated, the same principle suggests that he should show a comparable awareness of the illustrations. Now, as Jacques Guignard has remarked, Legrain was "impervious to the manner of certain contemporary painters; his strict, classical style seems to take no account of that of the peintre-graveur."91 91. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xxxiii. This observation is particularly true of the livres de peintre which he bound most frequently: the 11 copies of Verlaine's Parallèlement of 1900 illustrated by Pierre Bonnard, the five copies of Longus' Daphnis et Chloé of 1902 illustrated by the same artist, and the three copies of Jules Renard's Histoires naturelles of 1899 illustrated by Toulouse-Lautrec. The carefully unfinished lithographs of these volumes, so shadowy in Bonnard's case that uncomprehending contemporary critics dismissed them as "uncertain" and "indecisive," remain obstinately uncorrelated with the precise compositions which Legrain designed for the bindings of the books in which they appear. Of the most successful it may be said that the relationship is neutral, much as with a Jansenist binding. 5.27 Witness this well-known creation for Parallèlement (No. 1153). In the 5.28 least successful, such as this copy of Daphnis et Chloé (No. 583), Legrain's aggressive geometry clashes radically with Bonnard's cloudy drawings. Insofar as harmony between binding and illustrations is concerned, if not in other ways, Legrain's even more numerous bindings for another group of 20th century illustrated books are far more satisfactory. I have in mind the books of the masters of Art Deco illustration, of Barbier, of Laboureur, and in particular of Schmied. The favor enjoyed by Schmied among collectors of livres d'art has been described in an earlier lecture. With good reason the collectors, particularly of his notable books of the mid-1920s, found a natural affinity between them and the novel style which Legrain had introduced into binding. So it came about that Legrain devoted some of his most lavish designs to 12 copies of Daphné, for example, to nine of Le cantique des cantiques, to seven of Wilde's Deux contes, and to five of the Comtesse de Noailles' Les climats. Legrain paid these books the compliment of close study, and in his bindings he sometimes offered a synthesis of Schmied's decorative conceptions. His binding for Schmied's edition of Wilde's Deux contes has already been shown. Equally characteristic are his creations for the two 5.29 copies of Le cantique des cantiques (Nos. 112 and 113) which Rose Adler 5.30 selected for her portfolio of contemporary bindings. Writing about this substantial part of Legrain's oeuvre in 1961, when Schmied's reputation was at its nadir, Georges Blaizot had the delicate task of explaining how the master could have brought himself to bind so many more of Schmied's volumes than those of any other artist. Here is his ingenious apology: "Compared with the bindings designed by Schmied [himself] for the same works, the bindings of this family show us that Pierre Legrain, while remaining faithful to the laws of decoration imposed on the book, knew how to play a flute solo at the threshold of the volume, within which would swell forth sounds of choirs, now swooning, now roaring, and of organs."92 92. Devauchelle, 3: 163. You will see some of Schmied's bindings later in the lecture. During these years of intense activity as a designer of bindings, Legrain was no less busy as a decorator. Jacques Doucet and more recent clients like Mme. Tachard and Pierre Meyer relied upon him for the adornment of their apartments, and he had many other commissions carried out, like his bindings, in his atelier on the Place de Val-de-Grâce. Meanwhile, his health continued to deteriorate. With a view to concentrating his efforts on binding, he rented and remodeled a charming and commodious villa near the residence of the artist H. Laurens. On the morning of 17 July 1929, when he was about to move there, he died, a few months before his fortieth birthday. Left behind in his bindery "were more than a year of work in the course of production" as well as many projects still to be executed.93 93. Devauchelle, 3: 158. Something should be said about the bindings completed after Legrain's death under the supervision of his stepson, Jacques AnthoineLegrain, of which 75 are listed in the standard catalogue.94 94. See Pierre Legrain relieur, pp. 173-186. Undertaken, as they were, at the height of his powers, they are for the most part ambitious indeed, but their execution was not always at the level of those which he himself lived to see completed. An example is afforded by 5.31 Georges Rouault's Paysages légendaires of 1929 bound for Mrs. Blumenthal. This is one of six copies in which two of the lithographs which Rouault drew to illustrate his own poems are colored by the artist. Legrain's conception seems to allude to the final words of the text: Le lune se leve sur un monde égaré qui crêve d'appétits sordides et inavoués, illustrated by a bleak city-scape surmounted by a moon. Legrain's more hopeful perspective shows the moon against the firmament rather than the earth. The result is a striking Art Deco design, blemished by the almost total illegibility of the book's title stamped in blind on the lower half of the moon. Considering Legrain's mastery of the use of typographic characters in his compositions, one wonders what he would have thought of the way in which his conception had been rendered. Not open to objection on the score of obscurity, certainly, is his composition for 5.32 Mrs. Blumenthal's copy of Valéry's Poésies of 1929. A large folio, the book demanded a bold design, yet there is some want of subtlety in its execution. We may turn next to Rose Adler, for whom Legrain was the "uncontested master" of modern binding.95 95. Bibliothèque Nationale, Catalogue de l'exposition: la reliure originale (Paris, 1947), p. 100. Her reputation has never stood higher than it does today. Indeed her bindings are more eagerly sought after than those by Legrain himself, if only because they appear so rarely on the market. Whereas almost 1300 bindings are recorded for his 12 years of activity, her nearly four decades seem to have yielded a small fraction of that total. Born in 1890, Rose Adler was a student from 1917 to 1925 at the École d'Art Décoratif, where she had the active encouragement of Andrée Langrand, its Director. Her work of this period is exampled in a rare 5.33 early binding at the New York Public Library on F. C. Longchamp's Les vices capitaux of 1922, which is also signed by A. Cuzin as doreur. The irregular geometric pattern in which she has arranged her panels of snakeskin and of black and green calf demonstrates how completely she had already broken with traditional conceptions of binding design. Rose Adler encountered Jacques Doucet in 1923 at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Décorateurs where her bindings were shown. As impressed by her talent as he was smitten by her beauty and sympathy, he showed her the bindings Legrain had done for him and commissioned further work from her hand. Over the next six years, as his friend and advisor, she bound many of his finest books and manuscripts. The patronage of other collectors followed, and she became an important figure in the world of decorative art generally.96 96. See Chapon, pp. 339-342. Having seen Legrain's achievement, Rose Adler knew exactly what she herself wanted to do. To introduce the selection from her bindings shown at the first exhibition of the Société de la Reliure Originale at Paris in 1947 she told how Legrain in his work for Doucet, "seeking to reorient binding to adapt it to contemporary literature," tried to make it a "discrete synthesis" of what "emanated from the text." Thus came into being "a stripped-down style, in which only the essential remained. Legrain understood the value of silence, for in expression the danger is to substitute oneself for the author, to write a sixth act."97 97. Bibliothèque Nationale, Catalogue de l'exposition, p. 100. As we have seen, Legrain soon put behind him this aesthetic of allusive selectivity, but Rose Adler remained faithful to it all her life. In her 1929 portfolio surveying contemporary binding she included seven examples of her own work. Though elsewhere in this volume she does full justice to the rich effects achieved by Legrain and others, for her part she was content to make little count for much, as may be seen 5.34 in her creations for Villiers de L'Isle-Adam's Trois contes cruels and Mérimée's Carmen (plate 37). Only in her composition for Colette's L'En- 5.35 vers du music-hall of 1926 (plate 49) did she depart from her accustomed restraint. Yet the six exuberantly kicking limbs of this design seem subdued in comparison with the binding by Legrain for the same book which 5.36 she reproduces (plate 42) with its suggestion of overlapping beams from a score of spotlights. Two bindings by Rose Adler which go beyond my chronological limits demand to be presented because they can be shown from the books themselves rather than from reproductions. So spare is her usual work 5.37 that her design of 1931 for Tristan Bernard's Tableau de la boxe in the New York Public Library may in comparison almost be called massive. As is so often the case with her, lettering provides the main element of the decor, and the dominant colors, here brown and blue, form an unexpected combination. There seems to be no obvious allusion in the design, unless the inset panel is taken to be either a tableau or a boxing ring. In her later career Rose Adler carried her procedures to further reaches of refinement. Consider, for example, her binding of 1948 on Toulet's 5.38 Les contrerimes of 1930 with etchings by Laboureur, a design inspired, one surmises, by the shape given the type-page by the writer's verseforms, rather than by either text or illustrations. Of the many other workers who at this time created what Rose Adler called the "binding of sensibility and sentiment—[the] reliure-femme,"98 98. Introduction to Reliures présenté par Rose Adler. I shall mention only three, her most prominent predecessors, Germaine Schroeder and Jeanne Langrand, and her most prolific rival, Mme. Marot-Rodde. The manner in which they adapted Legrain's simpler patterns is exampled by Germaine Schroeder's design for Giraudoux's 5.39 Juliette au pays des hommes of 1926 with colored engravings by Chas Laborde. In consonance with Legrain's compositions two or three years earlier, many of which she had executed herself, she provides a checkerboard pattern of tan morocco across which is festooned the book's title in green. Legrain's more elaborate style is paralleled in a binding for 5.40 Schmied's edition of Vigny's Daphné by Andrée and Jeanne Langrand, the geometric conception of which reflects Schmied's own decorations, just as do most of Legrain's bindings for this book. Mme. Marot-Rodde's 5.41 creation for Gustave Geffroy's L'Apprentie of 1924 with etchings and dry points by Auguste Brouet is characteristic of her work: a binding of brilliant execution the decoration of which is straightforward to the point of assertiveness. It is hard to reconcile its design with Crauzat's assertion that "at no point does Legrain's influence make itself felt in her bindings" (2: 138).99 99. Whether justly or not, Crauzat contended that in general the women binders were the worst offenders in copying Legrain. "Never has been seen such a consumption of circles," he wrote in 1932 (2: 29), "of parallel and crossed lines, of barbed wire, of pieces of broken glass, of snail-like coils, of archipelagoes of fantastic lettering, of fragmented and illegible titles, of the skins of snakes and other reptiles, all to produce nothing but the ornate, the contorted, and the obscure." As a designer of Art Deco bindings François-Louis Schmied has for some years been ranked with Legrain himself, at least if one is to judge by the prices realized in European and American auction sales. They were also regarded as equals in the later 1920s, when collectors besieged Schmied with commissions to bind copies of his own works. In the intervening decades, however, his bindings, like his books, fell into deepening disfavor. Writing in 1961 the even-handed Devauchelle largely ignored him in his comprehensive history of French binding, calling him, indeed, by the wrong first name.100 100. The only significant mention occurs in a passage quoted from Georges Blaizot (3: 162-163). Devauchelle calls Schmied Fernand-Louis, an error in which he has been followed by other writers. See, for example, Cent ans de reliures d'art, 1880-1980 (Toulouse, 1981). There is a pressing need today for a monograph on Schmied's bindings, which might take as its point of departure the 50 odd examples listed by Crauzat with lacquer panels by Jean Dunand (2: 104-108). A Swiss, like Schmied himself, and a collaborator with him in annual exhibitions at the Galérie Georges Petit, Dunand had learned the art of lacquering from the Japanese craftsman Sugawara before the War. Having mastered this demanding process, calling for the application of many layers of lacquer to a metal or wood base over a prolonged period of time and under controlled atmospheric conditions, he was without a rival in its use during the 1920s. Beginning in 1925 panels designed by Schmied and rendered in lacquer by Dunand were incorporated in bindings by Georges Cretté and others, while later such bindings came to be executed by Schmied's own staff. Initially these panels had metal as their base and occupied the entire cover, but the technical problems to which this operation gave rise led to the employment of smaller panels on ebonite which were mounted in the covers, an arrangement which allowed Schmied to make Dunand's renderings of his drawings parts of larger binding patterns. Schmied bound only works of his own creation, choosing above all the books of his great years—more than 20 copies of Le cantique des cantiques, for example, but also Daphné, Les climats, Les ballades françaises, his Arabian tales, and Deux contes. The subjects of his designs came from the decorations of the books themselves: doves, gazelles, gardens, and particularly the figures of Solomon and his maiden for Le cantique des cantiques; landscapes and seascapes for Les climats and Les ballades françaises, abstract patterns for Daphné, and nightingales for Deux contes. They were rendered by Dunand with a variety and richness of color, not to mention a freshness and a sparkle, that even mosaic morocco could rarely match. At their best, indeed, they are among the most spectacular of all Art Deco bindings. The Frank Altschul copy of La création at Yale offers an example of 5.42 the larger panels by Dunand mentioned above. Indeed, Schmied's ma- 5.43 quette, mounted in the volume, is virtually an Art Deco painting. As will be seen, this composition, which supplements the decorations in Book I devoted to "Creation through the Word," was reproduced with resplendent exactness by Dunand. The task of the binder, Cretté, was simply to make the lacquer panel into the book's front cover. Schmied's alternative procedure is shown in another volume from the Altschul collection, Le cantique des cantiques, which was executed by Schmied's 5.44 own workers. The panels which Dunand made from two much smaller 5.45 maquettes, one of King Solomon and one of a stylized garden, were 5.46 mounted in the front and rear covers. This time he radically altered 5.47 Schmied's color scheme for the garden, and Schmied himself had the opportunity of devising a handsome abstract setting for his portrait of King Solomon. Schmied also designed bindings, again for his own books, in which he did not collaborate with Dunand. In a sense, these gave him a freer hand, since he had the whole cover at his disposal, not simply the frame surrounding the lacquer panel. Signed simply "F.L.S.," they were executed at his own atelier in the later 1920s. Here is an example on another 5.48 copy of La création. At first glance the central panel of galuchat may seem to have no purpose beyond the contrast it offers to Schmied's abstract frame. Then one realizes that the line of large white bubbles is intended as nothing less than a symbol of germination, the emergence of life itself from inanimate matter. Our attention is next claimed by the beginnings of two binders who were to go on to long and distinguished careers, Georges Cretté and Henri Creuzevault. In contrast to the more celebrated Pierre Legrain and Paul Bonet, they not only designed bindings, they executed them, and latterly there has been some disposition among their admirers to claim superiority for them on this score over mere maquettistes.101 101. See Marcel Garrigou, Georges Cretté (Toulouse, 1984), chapter 2. For Cretté, indeed, the distinction was crucial. In a rare confession of faith he wrote in 1947: "The only allowable fantasy [for a binder] is what the métier can realize; thus, for me, the role of the technician is as important as that of the artist and I can't conceive a binding without taking an active part in its execution."102 102. Bibliothèque Nationale, Catalogue de l'exposition, p. 166. However, we are concerned with manifestations of the Art Deco style, where Legrain's contribution is hors concours, and this debate need not concern us. Cretté was born near Paris in 1893. A brilliant student of decorative design and of binding at the École Estienne, he entered the atelier of Marius Michel in 1911, where he became the master's "pupil, his preferred disciple, almost his adopted son."103 103. Crauzat, 2: 42. After a long and difficult War, much of which he spent in German captivity, he returned to the atelier in 1919. By this time old and sick, Marius Michel made Cretté first its effective director and in 1925 its proprietor. The signatures of both are sometimes to be found on the firm's bindings before this date; afterwards for at least five years the formula was "G. Cretté successeur de Marius Michel," a signature that continued to be used for certain kinds of bindings well into the 1940s. While Marius Michel was alive, the firm's avowed policies of decoration did not change, though a receptivity to new ideas became apparent. When Cretté took over, he issued a circular which read in part: "Formed by that great artist Marius Michel, I hope on the one hand to continue the beautiful realizations of my predecessor and on the other hand to adapt to the classical and elegant methods of execution, which he conserved so well, the conceptions of modern decorative art."104 104. Quoted by Garrigou, p. 42. Many of the bindings which Cretté created were of a transitional nature, half-way houses in which floral ornament is selectively employed. That decorating 5.49 the large paper edition of Proust's A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleur of 1920, one of 50 copies, is a model of delicate restraint (No. 460).105 105. Where numbers are given, the bindings appear in Garrigou's catalogue. In his more modern conceptions, far from copying Legrain, Cretté gradually evolved his own style, which at this period often involved "the play of lines," both in gold and in blind. An example is offered by Émile Ver- 5.50 haeren's Les campagnes hallucinées, of 1927, the midnight black of which is in harmony with the wood engravings and lithographs by Frank Brangwyn serving as its illustrations. When required by the book in hand, however, Cretté did not disdain Art Deco patterns. This was true in particular of the many books of Schmied for which he himself designed bindings, as well as of those on which Schmied commissioned 5.51 him to mount lacquer panels by Dunand. A related creation is his binding for Marceline Desbordes-Valmore's XII élégies of 1925 with lithographs by Charles Guérin, on which is mounted a large floral enamel by Jean Goulden, inspired, it may be surmised, by Guérin's compositions 5.52 rather than by house tradition. His binding for A. Suarès' Le livre d'émeraude of 1927 with etchings by Auguste Brouet (No. 531) combines a cream morocco inlay with the play of lines and dots on blue-green morocco, in an emblematic design appropriate to this tale of the Brittany coast.106 106. Cretté's binding for Pierre Loti's Pecheur d'islande of 1934 (no. 323) is identical. Like Cretté, but at a much younger age, Henri Creuzevault had the task of reorienting an established bindery, which served a veteran clientele, towards an accommodation with Legrain's innovations. Born in 1905, the older son of Louis-Lazare Creuzevault, Henri Creuzevault began his training as a finisher at the age of 12. He joined his father's atelier in 1920, and after a few years he was signing the firm's bindings as doreur.107 107. Jacqueline Du Pasquier, Henri Creuzevault: naissance d'une reliure (Bordeaux, 1984), pp. 15, 19, 22. He won his first prize in 1928 from the Société d'Encouragement des Arts et des Industries. By the following year Crauzat could write of him: "His wise principles, combined with the passion of a youthful temperament which is stimulated by the taste of his time and the claims of a necessary renewal, his perfect technique at the service of a designer gifted with a highly developed decorative sense, could not fail to yield excellent results" (2: 54-55). The bold and robust conceptions of this young master, related to Legrain's yet bearing his individual mark, soon found their place among the best work of the decade. Creuzevault's adaptation of Legrain's relatively simple early style for 5.53 Gus Bofa's Synthèses littéraires et extra littéraires of 1923 is character- 5.54 istically forceful. For Paul Valéry's Discours of 1928 on being received into the French Academy he created a combination of geometry and typographic lettering which recalls Legrain without servile imitation. There is even a hemisphere of mother-of-pearl in the "o" of discours. 5.55 For Francis Carco's Quelques-unes of 1931 with etchings by Louis Legrand his conception hardly differs from the criss-cross mosaic binding by Legrain already shown for Wilde's Deux contes, yet its more massive components and darker color scheme result in a quite different effect. Creuzevault also devoted himself to the books of Schmied and Maurice Denis, for which he produced stylized representational designs. His con- 5.56 ception for Carnets de voyage en Italie of 1925, which concentrates the landscapes of Denis' book into a single image, provides a reminder that he was a painter as well as a binder. Notable as Creuzevault's later work became, his early Art Deco productions remain a distinctive and important phase of his career. There are a dozen other binders who would demand treatment if time were available. There is the elegant Robert Bonfils whose stylized use of representational elements in his designs, often of the human face 5.57 or figure in profile, renders his work identifiable at a glance. This is his binding for a special number of the Revue musicale of 1921 with an article by Paul Valéry on the ballet from the Gunst collection at Stanford. There is the indefatigable René Kieffer, who for 55 years played "the sedulous ape" to a succession of styles, always with impeccable technique. Representative of his Art Deco phase is a binding also at Stan- 5.58 ford executed in 1927 on Blaise Cendrars' La fin du monde of 1919 with illustrations after Fernand Léger. But I had better conclude by explaining why I have not discussed Paul Bonet. Though he was born in 1889, the same year as Legrain, and though he had begun to design bindings by the end of 1924, Bonet's domination of French binding was achieved in the years following 1930. Indeed, he came to general notice among bibliophiles only at the auction sale of the library of his first client, R. Marty, in that year.108 108. Très beaux livres . . . composant la bibliothèque de M. R. Marty (Paris, 1930). Moreover, if Bonet was impelled towards his astonishing career by Legrain's example, as he freely admitted in his Carnets, "to be himself" he determined from the first to "follow another path,"109 109. Entry for July 1929. and he would certainly not have regarded himself as an Art Deco designer. Consequently, two examples of Bonet's early work must suffice for our purposes. They represent the half-bindings which he favored for his own library, and they are more appealing, to my mind, than Legrain's creations for Doucet, particularly on volumes designed to be viewed together as a series. Bonet is severe on his bindings of this period in his Carnets, but he would perhaps have allowed the comment "an amusing 5.59 binding" for this copy of Henri Béraud's Le martyre de l'obèse of 1925, if half-bindings had been recorded therein. The semi-circles of his composition correspond exactly to the figure of Béraud's rotund protagonist 5.60 as depicted in the illustrations by Gus Bofa. The second example is still another binding for Colette's L'Envers du music-hall. For the most part Bonet did indeed avoid the Art Deco style. Two revealing comments from the Carnets may be cited. There is a plate in this book which shows his display at the Salon d'Automne of 1927. Of these volumes, bound chiefly for Marty, Bonet on the whole approved. Only concerning that on Duhamel's Deux hommes (Carnets, No. 33), an Art Deco creation, did he admit deprecatingly that "it was in the manner of the times!" In 1930 he similarly dismissed a copy of Dr. Mardrus's Histoire charmante de l'adolescente Sucre d'Amour with the words: "a binding in the style of Schmied, alas!" (Carnets, No. 78). One's final estimate of Art Deco binding depends on one's estimate of Legrain, though, as I have tried to show, there was much notable work from other hands during the 1920s. Perhaps Robert Bonfils has offered the soundest appraisal, surveying his friend's career 35 years after Legrain's death. He found the supreme distinction of this "artist of Cartesian intelligence, enthusiastic temperament, and an aesthetic full of charm" to reside in his ability to create works in which "innovation was matched by equilibrium" during an epoch when "anarchy and liberty were confounded."110 110. Pierre Legrain relieur, p. xxxviii. Legrain's bindings do indeed provide the criterion by which Art Deco bindings in general can be judged, a touchstone never more useful than at present when so much garish and ill-considered work is uncritically accepted.

      <field name="fulltext">"ARMADILLOS OF INVENTION": A CENSUS OF MECHANICAL COLLATORS by Steven Escar Smith** I am grateful to Larry Mitchell, James Harner, Mauri Ives, Douglas Brooks, David Vander Meulen, William Proctor Williams, and others for their encouragement, guidance, and advice throughout this project. I was fortunate to have the support of a Big XII Faculty Fellowship from Texas A&amp;M University for early and critical research at the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas. I am grateful to Bill Crowe, Alexandra Mason, Richard Clements, and the rest of the staff of the Spencer Library for their highly professional and always courteous assistance during the term of my Fellowship. My research on the Hinman, and to a much lesser extent the other devices as well, has depended heavily on correspondence and other records relating to the sale, purchase, and manufacture of collators. For the most part I found these items in the administrative files of libraries and other institutions but many private individuals have also been generous in this regard. Chief among them is William P. Barlow, owner of the first Folger Hinman (A2 below). Very early on in my research he provided me with copies of letters from Arthur M. Johnson, manufacturer of the Hinman Collator, that were written to him when he acquired his machine. It was this act of generosity that inspired me to look elsewhere for like material, and though I am grateful to all those who provided access to such records I am especially indebted to Mr. Barlow. Many others have also given invaluable assistance, as the footnotes and the list of works cited amply attest. Responsibility for any mistakes, however, rests solely with me. And finally, I owe a special debt to Robert Michel, who supplied invaluable information on the last few Hinmans to be manufactured as well as his memories of and insights into the building of these machines back to the 1950s. Mr. Michel passed away in late 2002. This article is dedicated to his memory. SINCE THE LATE 1940s literary scholars have developed and used optical devices, known popularly as mechanical collators, to aid in the comparison of printed documents from the same edition.1 1. The use of the term "machine collation," and hence "mechanical collator," is a bit of a misnomer as the principles behind this activity and the devices that carry it out are more optical than mechanical in nature. The Hinman is the most machine-like of the four main devices treated here as it requires an independent power source and has both electronic and mechanical components. The others require no electricity and have no mechanically driven moving parts. Nevertheless, "machine collation" is the most popular term, and herein I use it interchangeably with "optical collation." The first and most famous of these devices was invented by and named for the Shakespeare scholar Charlton Joseph Kadio Hinman. Its fame and widespread use inspired the invention of other collators over the years, the most successful being the Lindstrand Comparator, the McLeod Portable Collator, and the Hailey's Comet.2 2. For a more detailed account of the invention and manufacturing of the Hinman, see my article " `The Eternal Verities Verified': Charlton Hinman and the Roots of Mechanical Collation," Studies in Bibliography 53 (2000): 129-161. Charlton Hinman built his machine as an aid in his landmark study of the Shakespeare First Folio (Hinman, Printing and First). Though the scholarly climate in which he labored has changed considerably, the Hinman Collator and its successors are still enabling important work. Noteworthy among the more recent projects is David Vander Meulen's use of the Hinman in collating copies and examining running titles to resolve the old question of which of the two 1728 issues of Pope's Dunciad came first ("Printing"). He also machine-collated copies for his facsimile edition of the 1728 Dunciad, and even more recently he used the Hinman, the Lindstrand, and the Comet for a study of press variants in bibliographical classics by Fredson Bowers and R. B. McKerrow ("Revision"). Another ambitious project is currently being carried out by R. Carter Hailey, who has examined around sixty copies of the three 1550 editions of Piers Plowman on the Comet (Metzger [2]). Randall McLeod has conducted extensive studies of the Holinshed Chronicle, the 1591 edition of John Harrington's translation of Orlando Furioso, and other texts on his device ("From Tranceformations"). Conor Fahy has also used McLeod's invention for his study of Orlando Furioso (1989). The energy and resourcefulness behind these projects suggest that the practice of machine-aided optical collation is far from its end. Indeed, as long as literary scholars continue to rely on the close examination and comparison of printed materials, there will always be a place for the Hinman or one of its offshoots, if not their computerized equivalent, though practical electronic alternatives have only recently begun to emerge.3 3. For an example of a recent and fruitful computer application, see Mari Agata, "Stop-press Variants in the Gutenberg Bible: The First Report of the Collation." Another example of the use of digital technology is described by Blaise Agüera y Arcas in "Temporary Matrices and Elemental Punches in Gutenberg's DK Type." In contrast to Agata, who is using digital technology for the same purpose as Hinman (i.e. the identification of stop press variants as a means of understanding the printing process), Agüera y Arcas uses digital technology to analyze and discover differences in letterforms as a means of illuminating the typefounding process. (Full publication details for these items appear in the list of Works Cited, below.) Whether for quick checks of points between a few copies or for larger projects, the "armadillos of invention," to quote McLeod, are still effective and in most cases the only viable tools (Zalewski 14). And as Peter Shillingsburg has observed: "The optical machines available to editors before the advent of computers remain necessary and useful in order to compare multiple copies of the same typesetting" (135). This census seeks to document the history of these machines and is divided into six parts—the location lists of Hinmans, Lindstrands, McLeods, and Comets; a list of "One-off Spin-offs" (experimental devices that, for the most part, never developed beyond the prototype stage); and a cumulative index. I should caution that not all of the surviving machines are available to researchers. Anyone interested in using a particular collator is encouraged to make inquiries well in advance of traveling to one. In regard especially to the Hinman, I should also mention that, as with any other aging population, some of these devices have fared better through the years than others. The youngest Hinman Collator is now over twenty years old and the oldest over half a century. As would be expected, the newer models tend to be in better condition than the older ones. The section on the Hinman is by far the most detailed. I have not consciously followed Falconer Madan's degressive principle of bibliography in constructing this census, though the Hinman is the most important and influential collator. As I have stated elsewhere, it has assumed an almost iconic status within bibliographical circles (Smith 2000). Because of this status and the fact that it is a large and fairly impressive piece of equipment, it has been easier to find people who remember it and to uncover records relating to its acquisition. The Lindstrand Comparator has been more difficult to follow. It is smaller, visually less impressive, and never made the splash that the Hinman did. On the other hand, it did generate a wave or two of its own and therefore attracted a certain amount of attention. And, despite being about four feet shorter in height and several hundred pounds lighter than its more famous forerunner, the comparator is not easily portable and therefore did not change hands or homes that often. The McLeod and the Comet are other matters altogether, however. Their affordability and portability make them moving targets. They also have not attracted anywhere near the publicity of their predecessors. For their locations I have relied almost exclusively on information provided by their respective inventors, Randall McLeod and R. Carter Hailey. I am grateful to them for this assistance. As these machines are still available for sale there will doubtless be additional locations in the future. The sections on the McLeod and the Comet are probably best regarded as general indications of how many machines have been manufactured to date and what kind of geographical distribution they have enjoyed rather than as a road map of current locations or a thorough historical tracing of their wanderings. I have been unable to find and confirm some dates, prices, and other details. I hope that the publication of this list will flush out some of the more elusive facts. Corrections and additions are welcome. A. HINMAN COLLATORS The arrangement of this section is chronological by date of acquisition as near as can be established for each machine. I have been able to date many of them very precisely while others less so. Obviously the more imprecise the date, the more susceptible a particular machine's place in the chronology is to revision if more information comes to light, though I do not believe such information will result in more than the rearrangement of a few machines here and there. In addition to surviving collators, the chronology also includes machines that have been lost. Anyone who has ever laid eyes on a Hinman, which stands nearly six feet tall and weighs over 400 pounds, knows that one cannot easily misplace such an object [plate 1]. Yet anyone who has ever worked in an organization of any size should also understand that such things happen—inventory is moved, records are purged and/or lost, staff changes, and soon no one remembers what happened to that hulking hunk of metal that used to sit in the corner. Over the years, a few Hinmans have also been officially de-accessioned, junked, gotten-rid-of, etc. Charlton Hinman was involved in the business of making and selling mechanical collators for only a few years. After he built the machine for his use at the Folger, he sub-contracted the manufacturing to Arthur M. Johnson, a retired Navy engineer who had been an unofficial advisor earlier in the project. Sometime in 1955 or 1956, Hinman completely turned over the business to Johnson. Coincidentally, both Hinman and Johnson died in 1977. In the last five years of his life, Johnson built collators in partnership with a former employee, Robert Michel of MICO Engineering, Bladensburg, Maryland. Michel had worked for Johnson since the 1950s. Mr. Michel stayed in business a few years after Johnson's death, selling five machines on his own, the last one to Penn State in 1979. He retired and closed his business in the mid-1980s. The sources for this section of the census are many and varied. They include letters, invoices, newspaper notices, newsletter announcements, bibliographical and textual studies, previous location lists, and the memories of individuals who used or were around particular machines. Perhaps the most important of these sources were the previous lists of Hinman locations. During the years when the Hinman Collator was being manufactured and widely used, three location lists were published in bibliographical journals, the final one in 1975, four years before the last machine was sold (Johnson, "Hinman Collators in Current Use"; "Hinman Collators: Present Locations"; "Locations of Hinman Collators"). Another list survives in typescript, and in 1979, after building what proved to be the last Hinman, Robert Michel compiled still another as part of an advertising flyer (Johnson, "Hinman Collators," 19 July 1970; Michel, Hinman Collator). Taken together, these documents provide a nearly complete record of the original purchasers. They do not, however, include dates of acquisition, sales prices, and other details, and they also contain a few errors that are corrected here. Some of the machines have also changed locations since the appearance of these lists. No complete or even reasonably comprehenseive archive of records relating to the buying and selling of collators resides in one location. Instead, papers and letters by and relating to Charlton Hinman and Arthur M. Johnson are located in the files of libraries, individuals, and the organizations with whom they dealt. These have also been important sources. Johnson especially was a prolific and chatty letter writer, and usually in the course of his correspondence with one customer he would mention others who had recently bought or ordered machines. Often, I was also able to obtain invoices, purchase orders, and other administrative documents. These were useful for dating machines and establishing details such as sales price. I am extremely grateful to those individuals who have made letters and other materials available to me. In my search I also examined the published results of every research PLATE 1.

These research projects included most of the volumes published under the direction of the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA), many of those associated with the Center for Scholarly Editions and its successor the Committee on Scholarly Editions (CSE), and shorter projects published in bibliographical journals. A good deal of the history of the collator survives only as oral tradition. So, as an extra additional measure, I also sought out individuals who own, have used, work or worked at institutions that possess (or previously possessed) Hinmans or who were in some way otherwise associated with the machine. These individuals patiently answered my queries, and a few also sought me out to provide information that I would have otherwise missed. I have not been able to inspect every machine personally. Traveling throughout the United States, Canada, England, Germany, and elsewhere to visit each one would be ideal but has not proven practical. I have, however, confirmed the presence (or absence) of machines and gathered details about them by corresponding with individuals at their various locations. I sent out a standard letter by e-mail or U.S. mail to institutions and individuals that I had reason to believe (because of a mention in a previous list or in the archival material, a reference in a published research project, a tip by someone who knew of the machine, or from another source) possessed a Hinman. This letter contained questions about the age, provenance, and certain physical features of the collator. I also asked about projects in which the collator in question may have been used. Answers to this letter frequently provoked more particular questions. I am grateful to all those who patiently answered my many queries, some of whom also graciously supplied me with photographs of their collators. Over the years press releases and newspaper articles would sometimes claim that this or that machine was the fifth, thirty-first, fortieth, or some other number. This information undoubtedly originated from Johnson, for he sometimes made such statements in letters to customers. These numbers, however, do not necessarily coincide with the entry numbers in this list. This disparity stems mainly from the fact that I count machines that Johnson did not. For instance, the prototype, built more or less by Hinman, is A1 in this list whereas Johnson probably never thought of it as the first machine. It was neither designed nor built by him, and it was only the prototype after all. My interests are historical; Johnson's were commercial. When asked how many collators he had built, he would have had no reason to include an experimental model that was never put into operation. Johnson's numbers are also inconsistent, or at least they appear so. When Johnson went into partnership with Robert Michel in 1972 he began putting a four-digit serial number on the front of each machine. These numbers begin with "10" followed by two numbers that indicate the particular machine's place in the manufacturing line, "45," "46," "47," etc. While these numbers are accurate indicators of sequence ("1046" came after "1045" and so on), they seem less reliable as exact statements of quantity. For example, the collator at the American Antiquarian Society, purchased in the summer of 1972, was the first to carry a serial number—"1045." The next machine, the University of Houston collator, is numbered "1046," and so on until the Wolfenbüttel collator, "1054." Without more information, however, I cannot say for sure whether the AAS machine was, as was assumed at the time of its purchase and is suggested by its serial number, the "45th edition" (McCorison, Letter). My suspicion is that it was not, as the numbers that other institutions reported as well as many statements made by Johnson do not square with it, or even with one another. The New Brunswick collator, acquired in September of 1971, was announced as the "36th" Hinman ("A First at a Canadian University"). The Florida machine, which showed up over a year earlier in June of 1970, was described as "one of only 40" ("University Libraries Get Hinman Collator"). If the AAS machine was really the 45th edition, then why are there at least seven machines between it and Florida's, supposedly the latest? Given these discrepancies, it seems wiser to admit uncertainty and to caution against being too literal about the serial numbers as well as about the numbers that turn up in newspapers and elsewhere. The machines sold by Michel after Johnson's death did not carry numbers. I have been unable to account for two machines that should have been produced within the sequence—machines that should carry the numbers "1048" and "1050." I believe that these machines were sold to pharmaceutical companies, as the timing of their production coincides with the period when these companies were acquiring Hinmans. In 1971 Bristol-Myers purchased a machine to proofread prescription labels. Seven additional machines were sold to other pharmaceutical companies, though the Bristol-Myers collator (A36) is the only one I have been able to date or to trace to a current location. Despite the fact that I have not been able to precisely date the other machines, I have chosen to list them after the Bristol-Myers collator, alphabetically by location, each with its own entry number. They were probably all built fairly close together, and so listing them this way seems the best way to document and facilitate access to them within the list. I have also been unable to locate up to three other machines that may have been produced. I have it from two sources that the Treasury Department used a collator. It is well known that the CIA owned a Hinman. If the Treasury Department had one, they could have borrowed or inherited it from the CIA. On the other hand, they could have owned an entirely separate machine. I do not have enough information to say if either, or neither, of these scenarios is true, or which is more likely. So for now rather than give the Treasury Department a separate listing, I discuss the sources and everything else I know about it in the entry for the CIA machine (A11). As for the other two mystery collators, Johnson stated in his first location list, published in 1963, that two "modified machines" were in "industrial use." I have no other references to these but suspect they may be the table model and a twin. I discuss this possibility in A6. Each entry is also annotated with information such as sales price, some of the projects the particular machine has been used for, why it was purchased in the first place, previous locations for those few machines that have had multiple owners or have been used at different institutions, current disposition, and other matters of interest. However, I have not been able to establish all of these details in every case. Furthermore, the annotations make no pretense toward completeness in regard to projects associated with particular machines. Most institutions have not kept records of how their collator has been used, and many projects that did utilize the machine do not announce that fact in their published prefaces and introductions. It should be remembered, though, that for many collators their most frequent usage was not for long-term editorial projects but for quick checks to confirm points between copies. This kind of traffic is very difficult to quantify, save to say that it has been substantial. My purpose for including details about projects is not to provide a complete catalog but merely to give a sense of how particular machines have been employed and what kind of lives they have led. Moreover, some collators have done double (and in a few cases their only) duty as demonstration pieces, mostly in introductory research classes for graduate students in English but in other venues as well. Since the early 1990s, Rare Book School at the University of Virginia, for example, has regularly conducted a lunchtime collator demonstration as part of its summer workshop in descriptive bibliography. Arthur Johnson gave a public lecture on the device as part of his standard delivery package. Some institutions, especially in the early days, used their machines for publicity purposes (see my aforementioned article on the invention of the Hinman for examples). Generations of English professors, librarians, curators, and others, most of who never went on to machine-collate a book or even a single page, have been introduced to the field of bibliographical and textual studies via the Hinman. This is another kind of usage that though impossible to quantify has been substantial. So how many Hinmans were produced? Given the scattered and incomplete nature of the records, I cannot say with absolute certainty. I can, however, offer an estimate that I believe is accurate within a machine or two. By my count, which as will be remembered includes machines that Johnson probably never counted or counted inconsistently, there were around fiftyeight. This estimate includes the fifty-seven machines given separate entries here, plus an additional table model. It also assumes that serial numbers 1048 and 1050 are among the seven undated pharmaceutical machines. If the Treasury Department did own a machine, and if it was not the same machine as the CIA collator, then the number would rise to fifty-nine. For anyone engaged in editorial or bibliographical work, however, the number of surviving machines is probably far more important than how many were ultimately manufactured. The census locates forty-one survivors, all but two of which appear to be in reasonably good condition. The two inoperable machines (Iowa, A14, and Colorado, A56) no longer possess their optics. As for the few lost collators—though in most cases I suspect these are gone for good, I cannot rule out the possibility of one or two being rediscovered, perhaps as the result of the publication of this list. A1. Folger Shakespeare Library Built sometime in 1946 or 1947, this is the prototype that Hinman demonstrated to the Modern Language Association and the Bibliographical Society of America in 1947. Its primary components were a "pair of ordinary microfilm projectors (borrowed from the Navy), some pieces of wooden apple box (abstracted from a trash pile), some heavy cardboard (begged from the Folger bindery), and parts of a rusty Erector set (more or less hi-jacked from the small son of a close personal friend)" (Hinman, "Mechanized Collation: A Preliminary Report" 102). The editor of PBSA was careful to put the word "machine" in quotation marks when referring to this device, perhaps underscoring its provisional state and still imprecise performance. This device was probably cannibalized and scrapped in the process of building the next machine. A2. Folger Shakespeare Library Built by Charlton Hinman with assistance primarily from the Institute for Co-operative Research at Johns Hopkins University (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow; Rich). It was at the Folger as early as July 1949. Hinman declared it more or less "perfected" in late 1951 (Altick 188; Hinman, "Mark III" 150). This machine was traded back to Arthur Johnson in 1973 when the Folger purchased a new collator. Currently owned by William P. Barlow, the machine was repaired and slightly renovated before Johnson sold it to him in October of 1973 (Johnson, Letter to William P. Barlow). A3. James Ford Bell, Minneapolis, Minnesota Purchased around 1953 for the private library of James Ford Bell, founder of General Mills and namesake of the James Ford Bell Special Collections at Minnesota (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). Part of Bell's library consisted of a collection of books on the Jesuit Relations of New France. There was some thought of using the machine to examine these books but the project never developed (Parker). Johnson's 1963 PBSA list incorrectly locates this machine at the University of Minnesota. He may have assumed that this machine was given to Minnesota in 1953 when Bell donated his library to the University. The machine was never at Minnesota and its current location is unknown. A4. Harvard University Purchased by the Houghton Library in 1954 (Hinman, "Mechanized Collation at the Houghton Library" 132; and Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957). It was first used by W. H. Bond for a study of the illustrations in the 1865 and 1866 editions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Bond, "Publication"). Jacob Blanck and William Jackson also tried the machine but never used it for any project (Bond, Letter to the author). The collator was transferred to Harvard's Collections of Historical Scientific Instruments in early 1986 (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments). A5. Lessing J. Rosenwald, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania Purchased by Lessing J. Rosenwald around 1954 or 1955 (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 23 Feb. 1957), loaned for some time to the University of Pennsylvania, and located at the Library of Congress by the early 1980s. William Proctor Williams remembers repairing it at the Library around 1982 or 1983 (E-mail to the author). In 1969 it was "on loan at the University of Pennsylvania" (Johnson, "Hinman Collators: Present Locations"), and according to the last list Johnson published it was still there in 1975. It was not at the Library of Congress in the mid-1970s. When Frederick R. Goff, who at the time was Honorary Consultant in Early Printed Books at the Library, undertook his study of the Declaration of Independence in the summer of 1975, he had copies of the Declaration that were loaned to him deposited at the Folger for examination on its machine (Goff 7). It seems likely that the machine came to the Library with Rosenwald's book collection in 1979, but according to records and the memories of those associated with the transfer this was not the case (Fine; Rare Book and Special Collections Division, Library of Congress). Again, however, the collator was there in 1983 when Williams repaired it. Its current location is unknown. A6. Arthur M. Johnson, Silver Spring, Maryland Built by Johnson in 1955, probably early in the year, to work with small, unbound items such as checks, small photographs, stamps, etc. Johnson called it the table model and built it in an effort to find applications other than the field of bibliography and textual studies. It measured 20 inches high, 23 inches long, and seven inches wide. It had a single eyepiece instead of a binocular set of optics. The blinking mechanism was provided by a button that the operator pushed up and down with his finger, rather than by the knee switch on the large machines (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 26 Dec. 1957). Johnson demonstrated it to a group of Wall Street bankers, and he also loaned it for a short time to the Aeronautical and Information Center, United States Air Force, St. Louis, Missouri (Johnson, Letter to Ross J. Foster). Neither group purchased the machine. It was on loan for a brief period to the Spencer Research Library, University of Kansas, while they awaited delivery of their full-size Hinman (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 27 Jan. 1958). The current location of this machine is unknown. In the 1963 location list, Johnson stated the two "modified machines" were in "industrial use." I have found no other reference to these machines, which is strange given Johnson's eagerness to expand his market and his penchant for chatting up the fact when he did. The only modified machine that I know of prior to 1963 is the table model, and the last mention I have of it occurs in 1958, in a letter to Joseph Rubinstein at the University of Kansas (11 Aug. 1958). That correspondence leaves the clear impression that of those to whom he had shown the machine, no one was interested. Nevertheless, if there were modified machines in industrial use prior to 1963, the table model and perhaps a twin seem the most likely candidates. A7. British Museum Purchased sometime in late 1955. In announcing the acquisition, the British Museum Quarterly stated that this was the "fifth such instrument to be produced and the first to come into operation outside America" ("Collating Machine," British Museum Quarterly). The announcement in the Times Literary Supplement repeats this claim and also adds that its purchase was made possible with funds from the bequest of the late Dr. Arthur Watson ("Mechanized Collation"). The machine passed to the British Library in 1973 and was disposed of around 1985 (Williams, "Smith"). In the mid1970s, the Library developed a hybrid machine that combined features of the Hinman Collator and the Lindstrand Comparator (E6). A8. University of Virginia Purchased in January or February of 1956 for $1500. The Charlottesville Daily Progress and the Richmond Times-Dispatch both covered the arrival of the Hinman, and a special demonstration was offered for members of the Bibliographical Society (Vander Meulen, Bibliographical Society 23-25). John Cook Wyllie was the driving force behind the acquisition of the machine. He had shown an interest in Hinman's experiements as early as 1946 (Wyllie) and played an important role in encouraging its use. Matthew J. Bruccoli credited Wyllie with suggesting his collation projects on F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis ("A Collation This Side of Paradise" 263; "Textual Variants" 264). The collator has also been used by David Vander Meulen for work on Pope, by David Gants on the Workes of Ben Jonson, and for many of the numerous editorial projects undertaken by Fredson Bowers. The machine is currently located in the Department of Special Collections, Alderman Library. A9. University of Kansas Purchased and delivered in July 1958 for about $5000 (Johnson, letters to Joseph Rubinstein, 11 Aug. 1958 and 23 Apr. 1957). Johnson later visited the University to demonstrate the machine (Johnson, Letter to Joseph Rubinstein, 22 Sept. 1958). Charlton Hinman himself used it to collate photocopies of Shakespeare quartos. It has also been used for work on William Dean Howells. Almost annually for the last forty years the staff of the Spencer Library have given demonstrations on it using their variant Jonson folios. In the 1960s a graduate student used it for a complete collation of the Jonson folios (Mason). This was the first machine to feature a gray rather than a black exterior and cabinets beneath the bookstands (Johnson, letters to Joseph Rubinstein, 10 Mar. and 9 June 1958). It is currently located in the Spencer Research Library. A10. University of Illnois Purchased in November 1959 for around $5000 at the recommendation of Bruce Harkness and G. Blakemore Evans, both of the English faculty, and Robert B. Downs, Dean of Library Administration. Johnson delivered this machine himself ("Hinman Collating Machine Installed in Rare Book Library"). It is currently located in the Rare Books and Special Collections Library of the University Library. A11. Central Intelligence Agency Probably purchased in 1959 or 1960. It was almost certainly in place before 1963. In the PBSA list that Johnson published that year, he describes a collator as being owned by an "agency of the Federal Government." Despite numerous attempts, I have been unable to extract any information, or even a response, from the CIA. Perhaps such matters are classified. There is a possibility that this machine was inherited or that an additional one was purchased by another U.S. government agency. John F. Andrews, in his obituary of Hinman in the Shakespeare Quarterly, stated that among the "non-bibliographical uses to which the Hinman Collator has been applied . . . is the detection of counterfeit currency by the United States Treasury Department" (Andrews 275-276). Hinman's daughter, Barbara Hinman, has told me that at the time of her father's death "the Treasury people were still using the collator or some variation in their day-to-day efforts to spot bogus bills" (Barbara Hinman). Neither source remembers where this information came from, and despite numerous queries I have been unable to confirm their reports with the Treasury Department. Johnson never mentioned the Treasury Department in any of the letters or his lists. Nevertheless, given independent reports from two witnesses, I am reluctant to dismiss the possibility that the Treasury Department either bought a machine of its own or borrowed the one from the CIA. There is an interesting story regarding the delivery of this machine. Apparently the CIA instructed Johnson to deliver it to an inconspicuous loading dock where an anonymous individual paid him in cash. He was also instructed to detach and leave the U-haul trailer on which the machine was still loaded. U-haul never asked Johnson to return the trailer or settle the bill (Michel, Telephone interview, 28 Sept. 2000). According to Johnson's relatives, a few years later he heard from the CIA again. As Johnson told the story, they were inquiring about the purchase of a new machine because the first one had been stored in a location so secret that even the CIA could not find it. Perhaps they had lent it to the Treasury Department and forgotten (Arthur Juniewicz). A12. Ohio State University Purchased in August of 1961 for $5000 and delivered by Johnson (Charvat). The funding was provided by the Council on Research, Department of English, and the University Libraries. The machine was purchased for use on the Ohio State Centenary Edition of Nathaniel Hawthorne (Hecht 1). It is currently located in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Department of the Ohio State University Libraries. A.13 Yale University Delivered by Johnson in June 1962, this machine was purchased with funding from the Old Dominion Foundation (Brooks). Library officials had intended to purchase the machine after the opening of the Beinecke Library in 1963. However, in early 1962, Herman Liebert, Curator of Rare Books, advised James Babb, University Librarian, to go ahead with the purchase as several people were already anxious to use it (Liebert). One faculty member was making weekly trips to Harvard for the Houghton machine (Ottemiller). The Yale collator was disposed of sometime in the late 1890s during renovations of the room where it resided. A14. University of Iowa Purchased in 1963 prior to October for work on the Berkeley Twain edition (Johnson, Letter to William B. Todd, 18 Oct. 1963). Warner Barnes found upwards of five thousand variants in the so-called "Royal Edition" of Twain's works on this collator, a number far in excess of anything ever uncovered in any other editorial project (Barnes, Personal interview; Todd, 203). Sidney Berger, who was a graduate student at Iowa and later on the faculty of the English Department at the University of California, Davis, worked as a research assistant on many editorial projects, among them Smollett, Twain, and Shaw, and he used this machine as well as the one at Davis (A46) on them (Berger). At some point the optics on this machine went missing, and it is now effectively inoperable. A15. University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Purchased sometime prior to October of 1964 (Johnson, Letter to Dorothy M. Lawrence). It has been used by Robert K. Turner for research on Fletcher and Beaumont and is currently located in the Shakespeare Research Collection, Golda Meir Library. Johnson may have delivered this machine. He visited later to make minor adjustments (Turner, Telephone interview, 13 June 2000). A.16. University of Texas, Austin Purchased in mid-January, 1965, and originally installed by Johnson in the Miriam Lutcher Stark Library (Brewer). It is currently located in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center. The price, including delivery, was $6205. William B. Todd played a leading role in its acquisition (Johnson, letters to William B. Todd, 13 Sept. 1962 and 18 Oct. 1963). Warner Barnes used it for his bibliography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It was also used for various projects by Todd and more recently by Joseph J. Moldenhauer on the Riverside edition of Thoreau. The 1969 census lists a second machine as being on order, but the University of Texas at Austin never acquired a second one (Barnes, Letter to the author). Johnson probably confused this location with the University of Texas at Arlington, for which he was building a machine at the time of the 1969 census. A17. Southern Illinois University Probably purchased in 1965 for the Southern Illinois Dewey edition. In 1964, Jo Ann Boydston, textual editor for the Dewey project, began working with Fredson Bowers, who probably first told her about the Hinman. On learning of it, she "pushed the administration very hard to purchase one" (Boydston). The collator has been used extensively, and perhaps exclusively, for the Dewey edition. It is currently located in the Special Collections Department of the Morris Library. A18. Northwestern University Purchased by Northwestern in the summer of 1965 for the Newberry/Northwestern edition of Melville (Hayford, Letter to G. Thomas Tanselle; Newberry Library, E-mail to the author). Originally located in the Deering Library, it was moved to the Newberry as early as May, 1966, but may have been moved back to Northwestern temporarily (Hayford, Letter to Jens Nyholm). The collator was again at the Newberry by the spring of 1969 (Johnson, Letter to Virginia Heiseman). At the Newberry, the machine was placed in a glass-fronted room near the main entrance and was thus one of the first things visitors saw on entering the Library. The spectacle of the machine in operation was frequently made all the more interesting by one of the editorial assistants who used it—a nun in full habit (Farren; Krummel). A19. Miami University, Oxford, Ohio Purchased in January of 1966 for $5,997.86. David Vander Meulen of Charlottesville, Virginia, acquired it from Miami in early 1993 (Special Collections, Miami University Library). A20. Kent State University Probably purchased in February 1966 (Krause) for the Kent State edition of Charles Brockden Brown and later used on the Cambridge Joseph Conrad and the Ohio University edition of Robert Browning (Reid). This machine is currently located in the Institute for Bibliography and Editing at Kent State. A21. University of California, Los Angeles Purchased by the Clark Library in June of 1966 and used primarily for the Dryden edition (Guffey, "Hinman Collator Acquired by the Clark Library"). It was the first machine on the West Coast and was personally delivered by Johnson (Johnson, Letter to Paul M. Miles). In justifying its purchase, Robert Vosper, University Librarian, stated that in addition to work on Dryden the collator would also be used to train "graduate students in bibliography" (Vosper). It is still located in the Clark Library. A22. Indiana University Purchased in the summer or early fall of 1966. The English Department announced its availability in November ("Howells Edition Center"). Originally located in the Lilly Library and later moved to the English Department, the machine was purchased for the William Dean Howells edition (Nordloh). It is currently located in its original home, the Lilly Library. A23. University of Wisconsin, Madison Purchased around December 1966 for about $6000 by the Graduate School for the University of Wisconsin edition of Washington Irving (Pochmann). Also used by Standish Henning for work on Thomas Middleton's A Mad World, My Masters and for several other projects carried out under Henning's direction (Special Collections, Memorial Library, University of Wisconsin, Madison). It is currently housed in the Department of Special Collections, Memorial Library. A24. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Purchased around 1966 or 1967 at the behest of Dennis Donovan, assistant chairman of English, with National Defense Education Act funds (Rust). It was moved from the English Department to the Rare Book Collection of the Wilson Library in 1986 (Rare Books, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina). The collator also spent some time in the Microform Reading Room of the Library before reaching its current destination (Boone). It was utilized primarily on the University of Wisconsin edition of Washington Irving. A25. University of South Carolina Purchased in 1966 or 1967 for work on the South Carolina William Gilmore Simms project. It was originally located in the McKissick Library, then moved to the English Department, and finally to the Thomas Cooper Library. The machine was also used on various projects directed by Matthew J. Bruccoli (Special Collections, Thomas Cooper Library). It was sold to McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, in September 1981 for $2100 for work on the McMaster University edition of Bertrand Russell. It was never used for this project, however, as the editors found it "was simply not applicable to their work" (Research Collections, Mills Memorial Library). David Gants acquired the machine in 1992 or 1993 while he was a graduate student at the University of Virginia. He later took it with him when he joined the faculty of the English Department at the University of Georgia. The collator is now at the University of New Brunswick, where Gants holds a joint appointment with the Department of English and the Etext Centre. He has used it extensively for his study of Ben Jonson's Workes and other projects (Gants, E-mail to the author, 9 Feb. 1999). The University of South Carolina purchased another machine in 1973 (see entry A50). A26. Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Münster, Germany Purchased under the direction of Dieter Kranz and installed in 1967 by Johnson. In the 1970s a team of scholars from Hamburg editing Klopstock's dramas also made use of it (Kranz). The machine has also been used for demonstration purposes for classes in analytical bibliography. It is currently located in the Forschungsinstitut für Buchwissenschaft und Bibliographie. A27. University of Edinburgh Purchased in 1967 or 1968. It seems to have been little used and now resides "gathering dust and unloved outside the Strong Room in the Main Library basement" (Special Collections, Edinburgh University Library). A28. Oxford University Purchased sometime in late 1969 or early 1970. The 1969 PBSA census lists this machine as being "on order." It is listed without qualification on the July 1970 typescript Folger list. According to the Bodleian Library Record it was purchased with a grant from the Higher Studies Fund ("The Hinman Collator"). The collator is currently located in the Johnson Reading Room, Department of Western Manuscripts, Bodleian Library. A29. Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas Purchased in late 1968 or early 1969 (Johnson, Letter to Charlton Hinman, 19 Feb. 1970). Kenneth W. Staggs used it on the James Fenimore Cooper edition (Baird). The current location of this machine is unknown. A30. Northern Illinois University Purchased in 1969. It is currently located in the Department of Special Collections, University Library. A31. Syracuse University Purchased in late 1969 (Johnson, Letter to Charlton Hinman, 19 Feb. 1970). Cornell purchased it from Syracuse in the mid-1970s for around $5000 (Eddy). Currently located in the Division of Rare Books and Manuscript Collections, Kroch Library, Cornell University. A32. University of Florida Purchased in June of 1970 with funds provided by the Vice President for Academic Affairs ("University Libraries Get Hinman Collator"). The machine was delivered by Johnson and probably cost around $6000 or $7000 (New). It was acquired for Melvyn New's work on the Florida edition of Tristram Shandy and used extensively for this project. The collator is currently located in the Rare Books and Special Collections Department, Smathers Library East. A33. University of Texas, Arlington Purchased in August or September of 1970. The first listing of this machine is on the 1970 unpublished list, where Johnson notes it will be delivered "in 30 days." The 1969 PBSA census lists a machine for Brown University as being "on order." In setting up for a definitive edition of the novels of Harold Frederic, Stanton Garner, who was on the Brown faculty at the time, apparently ordered a collator. Before the order was filled, he moved to the University of Texas, Arlington, where the project and eventually the collator followed him (Shroeder). In 1982, the Frederic project moved to the University of Nebraska, and with it went the machine. Since that time the machine has also been used for the Nebraska Willa Cather edition. It is currently located in the offices of the Willa Cather edition, 215 Andrews Hall, University of Nebraska, Lincoln (Mignon). A34. New York Public Library Purchased in August or September of 1970 with support from the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation (Ames; "Hinman Collator," Bulletin of the New York Public Library). The machine was disposed of sometime in 1996. Apparently the optics had gone missing before then (Rare Books Division, New York Public Library). A35. Texas Tech University Evidence for dating this machine is contradictory. An inventory tag on the machine reads "Texas Tech College," which would indicate that it showed up before September 1969 as that is the date the school's name was changed to Texas Tech University. However, neither the 1969 PBSA list nor the July, 1970, unpublished list mentions this machine. It is possible that the old nametags were used for a time after the name change. It was there at the time of David Leon Higdon's arrival in August, 1971. Higdon used the collator extensively for the Joseph Conrad edition, especially for work on Almayer's Folly and Under Western Eyes (Higdon). Donald Rude also used it for work on Conrad and asked graduate students to use it for projects in his introductory bibliography course (Rude). The collator is currently located in the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. A36. Bristol-Myers Laboratories, Syracuse, New York Purchased sometme before September of 1971 ("A First at Canadian University"). Bristol-Myers learned of the machine when Syracuse University purchased one (A31) in late 1969 or early 1970. Bristol-Myers used the machine to proofread labels. The company had had a scare when the hyphen was inadvertently dropped from a prescription label, so that the instructions directed patients to take "12" rather than "1-2" tablets. The machine was also used on packing inserts and carton instructions. It was not fitted with book cradles since the various texts compared on it were unbound or easily flattened. Ted Bertella used this machine almost every day from 1973 until his retirement in 1992 (Joann Bertella). He believes that the Bristol-Myers collator was probably the first sold for this application, as he remembers giving demonstrations to several other pharmaceutical firms and none of them ever indicated seeing one before. After Mr. Bertella's retirement the machine was not used so he offered to find a new home for it. The company agreed, and in 1993 Bertella placed it at Scheuler Communications (now Liberty Business Development), a printing company in Syracuse, where it is used to run final quality checks on printed documents (Ted Bertella). In the 1975 list, Johnson stated that he had placed collators at "seven pharmaceutical firms," though he did not name the firms. As mentioned in the introduction, the machines carrying serial numbers 1048 and 1050 have not been located. It seems likely that these were pharmaceutical collators as the serial numbers coincide with the time when these companies were buying Hinmans. The collators bearing these numbers should have been produced by 1975. Robert Michel listed eight pharmaceutical machines in his 1979 flyer. Again, the Bristol-Myers machine is the only one I have been able to track down. The others are listed alphabetically by location with individual entry numbers below. My search has been complicated by the fact that each of the companies in question has been bought, sold, merged, expanded, contracted, or relocated at least once since 1979. A37. Abbott Labs, Illinois A38. Mile Laboratories, Indiana A39. Elonco Corporation, Minnesota A40. Hoffman-LaRoche, New Jersey A41. Ortho Pharmaceuticals, New Jersey A42. Burroughs and Wellcome, North Carolina A43. William H. Rohrer, Inc., Pennsylvania A44. University of New Brunswick Purchased in late September of 1971 ("A First at a Canadian University") at the urging of Reavley Gair, who used it for work on Marston's Antonio's Revenge. The machine proved something of a disappointment to Gair, however. He had expected it to work equally well with microfilm and photocopy reproductions. While photocopies worked fine, the microfilm reproductions never registered well enough to be useful. The machine was personally delivered by Johnson and his wife, who were accommodated in a local hotel, taken out to dinner by Gair and a small committee, and generally "given a holiday in eastern Canada" (Gair). Gair trained graduate students on the machine, and on a few occasions scholars from other universities used the collator. Gair also had hopes of using it on a more substantial project in seventeenth-century editing, but the funding never materialized. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police used the machine and found it "very helpful in detecting forged banknotes" (Gair). In March of 1994, the machine was given to the National Library of Canada in Ottawa, where it is currently housed in the Rare Book Division ("Hinman Collator," Bulletin of the National Library of Canada; University Archives, University of New Brunswick). Ironically, another Hinman has made its way to New Brunswick. David Gants, who owns one of the two South Carolina machines (A25), is on the faculty of the Department of English and the Etext Centre at the University of New Brunswick. A45. Cambridge University Purchased in late 1971 or very early 1972, as the first recorded use of the machine was on January 26, 1972 ("Hinman Collator Log"). It has been used for many projects over the years, including work on the Brontës, eighteenth-century periodicals, Shakespeare quartos, and Orlando Furioso. It is currently housed in the Rare Books Department of the University Library. A46. University of California, Davis Purchased at the recommendation of Sid Berger through the English Department in 1972 and delivered by Johnson. Berger, who was on the English faculty, got to work on it immediately and "didn't stop for years" (Berger). As a graduate student he had also used the machine at Iowa (A14). For a time in the 1980s, the machine was on loan to the University of California, Santa Cruz, for work on Thomas Carlyle (Baumgarten). It is currently housed in the Special Collections Department of the University Library. A47. American Antiquarian Society Purchased in the late summer of 1972. Serial number 1045. The machine was delivered by Johnson and his wife and probably cost around $7,500 (McCorison, "Re: Hinman"). It has been used recently for work on the Colonial Williamsburg Imprints Project (Charbeneau). The editors of the Cooper edition also used the machine extensively (McCorison, "Re: Hinman"). A48. University of Houston Purchased at the behest of Irving Rothman, a faculty member in the English Department, probably very early in 1973 (Rothman). Serial number 1046. Funding was partially provided by the Biology Department, where there was some thought of using it to compare before and after shots of sediment and plants, but these plans never materialized. Rothman used the collator on several of his eighteenth-century projects as well as for demonstration purposes in the graduate bibliography course. In 1972, Kevin Mac Donnell used the machine for a study of Sinclair Lewis' The Jungle. Mac Donnell collated some 40 copies of the Doubleday, Page edition. The results of his research have never been published, however. Mac Donnell also used it for an unpublished study of the 1967 Doubleday revised edition of John Barth's Sot Weed Factor (Mac Donnell). The machine is housed in the Department of Special Collections, M. D. Anderson Library, University of Houston. A49. Folger Shakespeare Library Purchased with funds from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in the spring of 1973 as a replacement for the machine Hinman built and used. Serial number 1047. The editors of the Variorum Edition of Shakespeare have used it to collate quarto texts of Shakespeare plays (Folger Shakespeare Library). Frederick R. Goff used this machine for his study of the Declaration of Independence (Goff 7). More recent users include David Gants and Peter Blayney (Folger Shakespeare Library). A50. University of South Carolina Purchased in the summer of 1973 (Johnson, Letter to Don Kunitz). Serial number 1049. This is the second machine owned by the University (see A25). According to the 1975 list, it was located in the editorial office of the journal Proof (Johnson, "Locations"). In addition to publishing the journal, the Proof offices served as a "facility for teaching, research, and public service in bibliographical and textual studies" (English at South Carolina, 19741975 [11-12]). The Proof offices also hosted the graduate course in bibliography. The machine is currently located in the Department of Special Collections, Thomas Cooper Library. A51. Baylor University Purchased in April of 1974 for work on the Ohio University edition of Robert Browning ("Hinman Collator," The Armstrong Browning Library Newsletter). Serial number 1051. The price of the machine, including delivery, was $7565 (Johnson, Letter to Jack Herring, 23 Nov. 1973). Johnson and his wife personally delivered this collator, and Johnson also gave a brief lecture on the "history of the machine, how it came into being" and "what makes it do what it does" (Johnson, Letter to Jack Herring, 20 Mar. 1974). Jack Herring, who was then Director of the Armstrong Browning Library, was a member of the Browning variorum editorial board. Warner Barnes also used it on his bibliography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. This machine is currently in storage. A52. Stirling University Purchased in October or November of 1974. Serial number 1052. Johnson did not personally deliver this machine, though he sent extensive instructions for unpacking and assembling along with it (Johnson, Letter to P. G. Peacock, 21 Oct. 1974). The Library was new at the time, and its basement hosted a center for bibliographical study, equipped with a printing and papermaking lab (Stirling University Library). The collator was purchased as part of the equipment for this center and is currently located in the University Library. A53. Texas A&amp;M University Purchased in 1975 by the English Department and shortly thereafter transferred to the Department of Special Collections, Sterling C. Evans Library (King). Serial number 1053. It is currently located in the Cushing Memorial Library and Archives. A54. Herzog August Bibliothek. Wolfenbüttel, Germany Purchased in July of 1977. Serial number 1054. The cost, including shipping, was $8265 (Invoice Number 6570). Martin Boghardt was the force behind its acquisition (Herzog August Bibliothek). Boghardt and others used the machine extensively for work on the Klopstock dramas as well as on editorial projects such as the work of Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Luther, Giordano Bruno, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (Needham; Boghardt). This machine has been kept one of the busiest in the history of mechanical collation and is still located at the Herzog August Bibliothek. A55. University of Kentucky Purchased in late August or early September of 1978 for work on Cooper's Lionel Lincoln by Donald A. and Lucy B. Ringe (Alexander Juniewicz; Special Collections, University of Kentucky). No serial number. It is currently located in the Department of Special Collections and Archives, Margaret I. King Library, University of Kentucky. A56. University of Colorado, Boulder Purchased in September 1978 for $10,107 (Purchase Order). No serial number. The machine was purchased with funds provided by Milt Lipetz, then Vice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs, for work on a project by Michael Preston involving traditional British folk plays in chapbooks and broadsides. The optics disapeared before Preston could begin his study, however (Preston; Special Collections, University of Colorado Library). The machine is currently located in the Special Collections Department of the main library. A57. Penn State University Purchased in March 1979 by the Institute for Arts and Humanistic Study at Penn State for around $7500. No serial number. It has been used for work on W. B. Yeats and the eighteenth-century author Edward Young (Special Collections, Penn State University). R. Carter Hailey, who now teaches at the College of William and Mary, acquired the machine from Penn State in July of 1999. B. LINDSTRAND COMPARATORS 1971 Gordon Lindstrand, an assistant professor of English at the University of South Carolina, announced the first viable alternative to the Hinman Collator (Lindstrand, "Mechanized Textual Collation") [plate 2]. He had developed his device in the 1960s while a graduate student at the University of Illinois, where his dissertation concerned textual matters in Conrad's Nostromo. His invention, dubbed the Lindstrand Comparator (and also known as the Mark I), was offered in two models—the Comparator Criterion and the Comparator Library Custom. The Comparator Criterion, designed to accommodate copies or original images with text pages no larger than 8½ inches tall and 7 inches wide, was the basic model. The Comparator Library Custom was designed for larger documents, depending on the needs of the purchaser. Though he seems to have built a prototype of the Custom, I do not know that he actually sold one. A third model, which apparently never left the drawing board, was called the Comparator Portable, designed, as the name indicates, to travel more easily than the other two versions. Lindstrand also proposed a device for cross-edition collation—the Mark II— though, like the portable version, it does not appear to have ever gotten beyond the planning stages. The Lindstrand Comparator utilizes stereoscopic principles to detect typographical and other printed variations in nearly identical printed documents, usually those descending from the same edition. Stereoscopes have been utilized for everything from parlor entertainment to astronomical work since at least the early part of the nineteenth century ("Stereoscope"). Rather than relying on lights and shutters to present alternate images as with the Hinman, the Lindstrand was built to take advantage of the central nervous system's capacity to "fuse" images of two identical or nearly identical objects together when said objects are presented in a manner conducive to such fusion. Gordon Lindstrand's device was simply an "environmental apparatus" designed to facilitate this process (Lindstrand, The Lindstrand Comparator [1]). The researcher views two texts set up in separate cradles and positioned beneath a set of binocular optics. The optics, a set of mirrors, and a prism help overlay the texts in a kind of virtual superimposition. When this effect is achieved, small discrepancies between the texts seem to stand above the similarities in 3D. Big differences (for example, several reset lines) appear as areas of "total confusion" (Lindstrand, "Mechanized" 209). In contrast to its predecessor, however, the Lindstrand requires two good eyes on the part of the viewer. The Hinman is the only collator that can be used by individuals lacking good vision in one eye. Lindstrand got the idea for the comparator from a mapmaker in Champagne, Illinois (Roberta Lindstrand). He noted in a promotional pamphlet that stereoscopic view "has in the past been particularly appropriate for mapmaking from aerial photographic surveys" (The Lindstrand Comparator). He also remarked in his 1971 Studies in Bibliography article that similar devices had been used in the military, though "for an entirely different purpose" from the one he was proposing (209).4 4. Stereoscopes have indeed been used in the interpretation of aerial photographs, which, when taken from directly overhead, present a very unnatural view—because the objects pictured appear flat they are difficult for a viewer to recognize. Military photoanalysts and mapmakers use the stereoscope to view two photographs, slightly offset from one another, taken consecutively along the line of flight or simultaneously from different cameras in the same plane. This creates a 3-D effect that gives the images contour and thus makes them easier to interpret (Stanley 265-270). As I have mentioned elsewhere, Charlton Hinman apparently experimented with a stereoscope just after WWII, and there is also evidence that before the war other bibliographers had attempted to use the stereoscope or a similar device for textual collation (Smith 134-135). Lindstrand does not appear to have known about any bibliographical applications or experiments other than his own, however. In 1976, the Comparator Criterion cost $940. The two lamps, which again were optional features, cost an extra $48.00, and a dust cover could be purchased for $24.00 (Lindstrand, Comparator Research Associates [1]). The price of the Library Custom model varied upward according to the requested specifications, though again I do not know if he ever sold one of these larger models. At this time, the Hinman Collator was selling for around $8000. Lindstrand built his machine under the company name Comparator Research Associates, and over the course of about six years sold around thirty-eight devices to people and organizations (universities, libraries, research centers, etc.) throughout the United States and in Canada, England, South Africa, and Australia. Lindstrand published one location list in a bibliographical journal and issued updates with his promotional material ("Lindstrand Comparators: A Summary Report;" The Lindstrand Comparator).5 5. Announcements and descriptions of the machine were also published in PMLA 89 (1974): 1338, and BiN: Bibliography Newsletter 2.6 (June 1974): 2. These have been the primary sources in compiling the list below, though I have also interviewed people who knew Lindstrand and/or used his machine. Additionally, I have recovered a few documents and letters that have also provided useful information. These interviews and documents have led me to two machines (or, rather, one machine and a "ghost"—more about the latter in a moment) that were not included in the list and updates. I have confirmed at least the original location (or lack thereof—again, more in a moment) of every Comparator recorded by Lindstrand. Information on his invention, however, has been generally harder to track down and verify than for the Hinman. The arrival of a Lindstrand did not attract the same level of attention. The comparator was much less visually striking and much more easily disassembled, stowed away, and forgotten or lost than its predecessor. Moreover, its inventor did not leave nearly the paper trail that Arthur Johnson did. There is a longstanding rumor that Gordon Lindstrand reneged on the delivery of several machines after accepting payment for them. In some versions of the story he is said to have absconded with the funds and lived the rest of his life on the run, more or less. In another version he did jail time. The truth is less sensational. He was considering going out of business as early as 1975 (Lindstrand, Letter to William L. Mitchell). In 1976 or 1977, he appears to have stopped making comparators and failed to follow through on the delivery of at least three. These were machines promised to Trinity College, Cambridge; the University of Leeds; and Trinity College, Dublin. Records referring to the non-delivery of these machines are located in the archives of the latter. They indicate that he accepted at least partial if not complete payments on these orders.6 6. Unfortunately I have not been able to examine these records, though their contents have been summarized for me. They date from 1975 to 1982 and range from internal discussion before ordering to Lindstrand's acknowledgement of money to correspondence with Leeds and Cambridge, who also ordered but never received machines. I am grateful to Charles Benson, Keeper of Early Printed Books, for providing me this information. By library policy the file will remain closed until 2012, thirty years from the date of the creation of the last item in the file. A fourth may have also been promised but never delivered to the University of Calgary. He listed a Calgary machine in an update he distributed with other promotional material in 1976 or 1977, just as he was shutting the business down. I have been unable to locate anyone who remembers this device—hence the "ghost" I mentioned earlier. Cambridge and Dublin were also listed for the first and only time in the same update (Leeds never appears in any of his lists.) His failure to deliver devices to Cambridge, Dublin, Leeds, and possibly Calgary coincides with his going out of business. At the time he was suffering severely from the effects of alcoholism. Two years earlier, in 1975, he had lost his bid for tenure and his first marriage had ended in divorce (Roberta Lindstrand). Despite these difficulties, however, he was never in jail, and neither was he ever hard to find. Except for a short stay in a treatment facility in Charleston, South Carolina, and another brief relocation to Ohio, he continued to live in Columbia, the town from which he had always marketed and sold the comparator, until his passing in March of 2000 (Obituary). He was eventually able to control his drinking problem, though its effects left him legally blind. At his death he was working on a memoir about his battle with alcoholism. Were there more machines, either built and sold or sold and never delivered? I do not think so, though all I can say with certainty is that I have not found evidence of others. Despite my doubts as to its existence, I have chosen to give the Calgary machine a separate entry below, as I have for the devices I know Lindstrand did not deliver. Except for Leeds, these were all claimed by Lindstrand in print and so listing them with an appropriate note not only makes them easier to index but also facilitates correcting the record. The machines in this section are listed alphabetically by the last known location. As mentioned above, the machines that were never delivered are listed where they were supposed to have gone. A chronological arrangement is not possible because of the lack of records. Furthermore, since the Lindstrand was sold over a much shorter time period than the Hinman (five or six years as opposed to nearly thirty), sorting out the dates would not only be more difficult but probably less valuable. When the original location is known and differs from the current, that fact is noted in parentheses along with other potentially useful information. ARIZONA B1. Arizona State University, University Library, Department of Special Collections FLORIDA B2. Florida State University, English Department ILLINOIS B3. Northern Illinois University, English Department B4. Southern Illinois University Purchased for work on the Dewey edition and originally located in the John Dewey Studies Center. According to Jo Ann Boydston, editor of the Dewey edition, it was passed on to the Morris Library fairly soon after its arrival because the editors of the edition found the Hinman much easier and more efficient to use. It is currently located in the Special Collections Department of the Morris Library. INDIANA B5. Ball State University, English Department Surplused around 1960. KANSAS B6.

Random Cloud, Random Clod, Randalino, Sir Greg Walters, etc.) began devloping the device now known as the McLeod Portable Collator (Belanger) or the "McPortable Collator" (McLeod, E-mail to the author, 5 Feb. 2002) [plate 3]. Like the Lindstrand, this collator is based on stereoscopy. However, McLeod "has eliminated one of the symmetrical optical trains typical of stereo instruments: thus one eye looks directly at the farther book, and the other looks through two mirrors at the closer. Because the books are displayed in different depths, one can slide the more remote one part-way behind the front one on a two-tiered reading stand, so that just the two pages being compared appear adjacent directly in front of the viewer and, because of the reduction of size of the front image, as it passes through the mirror train, they appear at the same angular height and width, and they are readily accessible there for comparison and manipulation" (E-mail to the author, 5 Feb. 2002). Variants between the two books can display themselves "by one or more of four effects: 1) variantly spaced parts of otherwise identical settings of type appear in relative depth (that is, in 3D); 2) different settings in the same place (for example, `dog' in one copy and `cat' in the other) shimmer or alternate; 3) an image in one copy matched by blankness in the other appears `hollow' or insubstantial relative to the solid image formed by the combined stimulae of the invariant parts of the two copies; and 4) non-register of part of the superimposed image" (McLeod, The McLeod Portable Collator 2, and E-mail to the author, 9 Mar. 2002). As with the Lindstrand, the McLeod requires two good eyes on the part of the viewer. The McLeod, unlike either of its predecessors, has the virtue of portability. In fact, it is the first collator really capable of being easily transported —when disassembled, the device weighs about thirty pounds and can fit in a carry-on bag. Randall McLeod has used it "in over a score of major university and research libraries in Great Britain, Canada and the United States" (The McLeod Portable Collator 5). His first customer was a Philosophy professor at McGill University (Zalewski 15), about whom he relates an interesting anecdote: "I showed him how the collator worked, and offered to set up his own copy of Hume (which he was editing) with the University of Toronto's Fisher Library copy, but he was adamant that he do it himself, and proceeded to set up for a comparison of the titles pages. He struggled to get the adjustments right, but finally gave up and asked me to do it for him. Well, I realized right away that I couldn't get it adjusted right either: it was impossible to get everything aligned, since the two copies were different states of the same setting. So, in his first go he had hit the jackpot!" (E-mail to the author, 5 Feb. 2002). Though adjustable, the collator has no parts that move in the performance of collation. It requires no lights or electricity and generates no noise. The price is around $2500 US, not including shipping. I am grateful to McLeod for generously contributing to the foregoing description and providing the location information given below. LOUISIANA C1. Baton Rouge, private scholar NEW YORK C2.

Carter Hailey has built the simplest and most portable collator yet, the Hailey's Comet (Vander Meulen, "Revision" 223) [plate 4]. His device is available with bookstands in two sizes—14″ × 10″ for $750, 19″ × 10″ for $825, and both for $975. He has replaced the frame of the McLeod with two freestanding arms to hold the mirrors. The Comet weighs about fifteen pounds and packs easily in a small gym bag. Like McLeod, Hailey has eliminated one of the symmetrical optical trains—one eye looks directly at the farther book while the other looks through two mirrors at the nearer book. The absence of the frame accounts for the reduction in weight. As with the Lindstrand and the McLeod, the Comet requires two good eyes on the part of the viewer. Another bibliographer, David Gants, has given new meaning to the phrase "machine-aided collation" via the Comet. He has developed a method of collating an actual copy of a book on the Comet with a computer-generated image of another copy of the same book. Gants positions the physical book in relation to a digitized version of another copy on a laptop screen so that their images, after adjusting the freestanding mirrors, appear to superimpose in the eyes of the viewer. Since the dignitized image serves as his control copy, Gants does not need to carry a potentially valuable and bulky book with him when he travels to a distant library. The ever-increasing number of books available in this format greatly expands the number of texts now available for collation. A single CD can hold hundreds of volumes—a virtual portable library ready to collate at the press of a button. Since the size of the digitized image on the laptop screen is adjustable, the problem of controlling the standards under which the original book was scanned is not as acute as it has been for scholars who have attempted to collate from microfilm-based images in the past.7 7. George Guffey first addressed this problem in 1968. He also suggested a set of standards for the reproduction of texts on microfilm (Guffey, "Standardization"). Gants further reports that since "the laptop display can move along all three axes," it is very easy "to adjust yaw-pitch-roll image alignment as well as relative size" (E-mail to the author). This method also has the advantage of dispensing with the bookstands. The computer cannot fit in a stand, obviously. The book is carefully propped open against a soft, felt-covered support of the kind typically found in special collections libraries. Not having to strap a book into a stand or cradle also tends to calm the nerves of wary rare book custodians. Hailey built the device for his study of the three editions of Piers Plowman printed by Robert Crowley in 1550. He has used the Comet to collate over sixty copies at libraries in the United States and Great Britain (Metzger). I am grateful to him for generously providing the location information given below.

ONE-OFF SPIN-OFFS Gordon Lindstrand, Randall McLeod, and R. Carter Hailey are not the only individuals to have followed Hinman's lead. Over the years other scholars and bibliographers have tried to improve upon, replace, or supplement his invention. This section documents these efforts, which largely resulted in one-offs—that is, experimental devices that were never developed beyond the prototype and for the most part were never used on projects beyond those associated with their own inventors. I have not listed efforts to use the computer for collation purposes. Such attempts began very early (in 1962 Vinton Dearing introduced a program that ran on the IBM 7090) and continue to the present (as mentioned in note 3). Various applications (Peter Shillingsburg's CASE program, for example) have achieved some currency, but no effective system has yet been produced to compare efficiently a large number of original images (as the Hinman does) instead of comparing texts that must first be converted to digital text files. Readers who wish to know more about computer-assisted collation should consult Shillingsburg's Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age (3rd ed., 1996). The arrangement of this section is chronological by date of manufacture or development as near as can be determined. E1. The Poor Man's Mark IV In 1966, Vinton Dearing introduced the first second-generation mechanical collator (Dearing, "Poor Man's"). The "Poor Man's Mark IV" [plate 5] was created as a less expensive alternative to the Hinman. From 1953 to 1957, the price of a Hinman rose from $1500 to $5000. The very last machines sold for $8000 to $10,000. These were not inconsequential sums of money for scholars working in the humanities. Most Hinmans were bought with grants from public and private sources. If a researcher did not have access to such funds, chances were unlikely he or she could afford one. Dearing estimated his machine cost $100 in materials. There were no labor costs because he envisioned it as a do-it-yourself project, his intent being not to go into business but to show other researchers how to build a machine. This was not a new idea. Early in his work Charlton Hinman considered making mechanical drawings available for non-commercial projects. Any bibliographer or editor with access to a "standard machine shop," so the idea went, could build his or her own device ("Variant Readings" 281). The Hinman, however, was simply too complicated to construct for all but the most mechanically adept bibliographers, witness the professionally produced set of specifications required to build one. And even if one were able, the collator would still have been a significant investment. In 1953, Hinman estimated the cost of materials at $1000 (281). Dearing's inspiration was Hinman's prototype (A1), which was a much simpler and less expensive device to construct than its later incarnation (Dearing, Methods 20). Like the Hinman prototype, the Mark IV was designed to work with microfilm reproductions rather than the original documents. Dearing positioned two microfilm projectors side by side inside a box. The images were projected through an occulting disc onto a mirror in the far end of the box. The mirror then reflected the images back onto a ground glass screen above the projectors. The projectors, microfilm, mirror, and screen, along with the light and noise, were all contained within the box. This set up gave the Mark IV an advantage or two over Hinman's prototype. First, it could be used in a lighted rather than a darkened room. Second, any noise generated by the projectors or the motor turning the disc was somewhat insulated from the outside by the walls of the box. The disadvantage was that one had to rely on microfilm reproductions, and so one also had to deal with all the problems inherent in working from copies, not to mention the cost and trouble of making the microfilm. Dearing and a few of his fellow editors at the University of California used his device for work on their edition of Dryden, but it did not catch on elsewhere. Dearing also proposed another means of collation, one that was completely non-mechanical. This technique, dubbed the "poor, poor man's collator," was really just a variation on the old Wimblelon method with help from a photocopy machine. In the old-fashioned, unassisted manner, one opens two copies of the same book and proceeds to read from each. Using the "poor, poor" method, one first photocopies the pages in question and then, in Dearing's words, rolls a "Xerox copy of the pages . . . over the fingers so as to bring line after line to the top edge of the visible surface and just under the corresponding line in another copy (if one eye is closed, both lines will appear to be equidistant and so will be easier to read simultaneously, which is the whole purpose of the method)." Dearing earlier proposed a wooden frame with a system of rotating, "closely set rods" to accomplish the same thing but with practice evidently found his fingers and thumbs more portable and less cumbersome (Methods 15). E2. Another Poor Man's Collating Machine Richard Levin proposed a photocopy-assisted method in 1966. His idea was simply to photocopy the pages in question and overlay them on a light table or, in the absence of a table, merely hold them up to the light. As he admitted, this procedure was so simple he could hardly have been the first to think of it. And, he further suggested, it was easier on "one's purse, eyesight, and patience" than the Hinman (Levin 25-26). Levin did mention one drawback, however. If one page has a character placed where the other has a blank space, or if on one page there is a character that completely covers a character on the other (like for example a comma over a period), these variations will not show up. To avoid this problem, he recommended going through the process a second time, only with the pages in the reverse position. E3. The Poor Man's Mark VII In 1967, Gerald A. Smith, a former graduate student of Hinman's, proposed the next mechanical device—the "Poor Man's Mark VII," another machine in the poverty-stricken tradition (Smith 1967) [plate 6]. He utilized two Dagmar Super microfilm readers placed on their backs so that the mirrors faced one another. A screen was erected where the images were superimposed. Each reader contained its own shutter, operated either by a motor or a hand crank to create the alternate flashing effect. An advantage of this adaptation was that it required a minimum of assembly from non-readymade components. One merely turned the microfilm readers on their backs and erected a screen. The only materials that had to be fashioned from scratch were the alternating shutters. Another advantage of this device was that the viewers, because they were designed to zoom in and out, could in theory be adjusted to compensate for images photographed at different magnifications. In practice Smith indicated this was somewhat difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the feature was a novel proposal for a common collation problem. The disadvantage with Smith's collator was that it worked only with copies. Smith also indicated that exact register was often difficult, even with the help of the zoom feature. At the time of his description, the machine was still in development. 54. A Portable, Cheaper Collator In 1968, Johan Gerritsen announced a technique that utilized one portable tabletop projector, one negative microfilm of the book to be collated, and one original copy of the book. Gerritsen arranged the projector so as to cast the negative microfilm image on to the actual book itself. When the white or negative image was brought into exact superimposition with the black print of the page, variants were revealed by white spots where there was an impression of type in the filmed copy, dark spots in the opposite instance, or a combination of the two. As Gerritsen wrote, "If one can beg, borrow, or steal one physical copy, the method enables one to collect microfiches from all over the world and do one's collating at home. If one cannot, once one is the proud possessor of a single film, one can travel to the copies" (Gerritsen 29-30). Gerritsen stated that he had never tried this method with photographs in place of the original but imagined it would have worked well enough to have at least identified which formes needed closer examination. E5. The Televised Collator In 1972, John Horden described an application using two small industrial television cameras synchronized to feed to a single television monitor (Horden). The cameras broadcast images of two books from the same edition, and an automatic changeover switch alternated the images on the screen. At high speed any differences between the two texts appeared as a blur. Slowed down, the operator could more closely examine any discrepancies. The potential advantages of this system were significant. First, the actual collation process could be recorded on tape, allowing the act of collation itself to be preserved and stored for review at a later date, thereby avoiding the trouble and wear of consulting the original texts. The recorded collation could also be sent for examination to researchers at other locations. Second, the cameras could each conceivably be set up at separate libraries, alleviating the need and avoiding the risk of bringing the books together from distant locations. Horden also claimed this method was cheaper than other techniques (by which he presumably meant the Hinman, for at this time all the other methods, though ineffective except for the Lindstrand, were far cheaper than their more famous predecessor) as well as easier to operate and less tiring to use. Like most of the other methods and machines, the television collator was never used for projects other than those associated with its own development. Robin Alston, who worked with Horden at the time, states that the collator was "never more than an idea," though he was convinced "that it could be made to work" (Alston). E6. The British Library's Homemade Hybrid This machine was built sometime in the mid to late 1970s. Library staff members first tried to buy a Lindstrand Comparator and when that effort proved unsuccessful (Lindstrand had either gone out of business or proven himself unreliable) decided to build a machine of their own which combined features of the Lindstrand and the Hinman. They gathered specifications for the Lindstrand-like features from known users of the Comparator. They presumably based the Hinman features on their own machine (A7). William Proctor Williams was one of the individuals asked for advice on the Lindstrand (E-mail). He collated extensively with this hybrid machine in 1983 and found it a satisfactory, if uncomfortable, device. Its optics were on par with the Lindstrand. The blinking effect of the Hinman was created by a central rotating plate that alternately obstructed the right and left image. The collator moved with the rest of the British Library from Bloomsbury to Euston Road in 1998, and shortly thereafter technicians disabled the power cords because they felt the machine's electrical system was unsafe. Since that time Williams has tried to repair it twice. As of 2002, it was located in the Humanities 2 (Rare Books) reading room behind the Enquiries Desk. The stereoscopic effect of the Lindstrand can still be achieved, but without electrical power the blinking effect of the Hinman is not possible (Williams, E-mail and "Smith"). E7. The Houston Editing Desk and the Editing Frame In 1978, Irving Rothman introduced a device that occupied a middle ground between the replacement or alternative collators and the old-fashioned methods of collation by "eye-and-hand" (Rothman 130). Rothman felt that despite the successes of the Hinman and a few of its descendants, collation by sight was still by far the most common method of comparing texts. The chief impediment to mechanical collation, according to Rothman, was simply that there were very few places where one could find multiple copies of any text from the same edition. Most editors were therefore forced to work primarily from copies, and Rothman felt that when copies were involved sight collation was more effective. He built two devices designed to work in concert that accommodated and facilitated the old-fashioned method rather than replaced it. He named these devices the Houston Editing Desk (HED) and the Editing Frame (EDFRAME) [plate 7]. The HED was a portable, multi-layered Plexiglas box that allowed the bibliographer to organize more effectively the work of textual collation and editing. The HED was fitted with various compartments for the storage of copies as well as paper, pens, rulers, erasers, and other paraphernalia. The EDFRAME was a frame constructed to the precise dimensions of the type page in question, including head and direction lines. The text under investigation was placed on the top of the HED and then the EDFRAME over the text. A transparent rule was fitted to the width of the frame to assist in line-by-line referral. If an editor was performing collation within the same edition, two frames of the same dimension, each with its own independent rule, were used. If one was performing collation across editions, the frames could be manufactured to different sizes, say the left frame for a large folio page and the right for a smaller one, or even for different formats. Rothman also suggested various means by which the desk and frame could be customized to meet the needs of a particular project. Rothman's devices grew out of his research as a textual editor on The Stoke Newington Daniel Defoe Edition, currently being published by the AMS Press, Inc. Though he patented these two devices for commercial production, he never sold them or built any beyond the ones used in his own research. E8. Rotating Vertical Collation Aids, or Twirler Developed by William Proctor Williams around 1998, this device [plate 8] was built specifically for "vertical" or cross-edition collation. Williams has kindly provided the following information on the origin and operation of his device: While working on the New Variorum Shakespeare edition of Titus Andronicus I have devised a collating tool that, although it does not do away with the old Wimbledon method of collation, does improve its efficiency. Tit Q1 (1594, the copy-text) exists in only one copy. Of Q2 (1600) there are only two copies; Q3 (1611) exists in 17 copies. These were all collated (Q3 regularly using optical collation) several years ago. However, now I was faced with the daunting task of the vertical collation of all those editions from F1 (1623) on. I had seen illuminations and woodcuts of various sorts of book wheels and dimly wondered how they would work. Slowly this drifted around in my mind until one day in a DIY shop (I believe it was Home Depot, but any such shop can supply these things) I saw those pre-cut round wooden items sold as small table tops . . . and the light dawned. I first built one and then a second one (one for each side of the centrally located computer). Now when collating by the Wimbledon method using two Twirlers . . . I have 8 copies in front of me, plus the copy-text on paper and the historical collation on the computer screen, instead of just one or two other texts. I use the larger size of rectangular post-its as line holders. Although the collation takes slightly longer per line this way, when I am finished I have done 8 texts not just one. I have also found in practice that the accuracy of all the collations is improved because of the ability to spin back and forth between copies on the Twirlers and, since all previously completed copies are kept on shelves to the side of the work table, it has also been the case that some errors and omissions from previous collations are also corrected in this manner. (Williams, Letter) So essentially what Williams has constructed are two revolving bookstands, each capable of holding multiple texts. With his computer between the stands, he can look across several editions of the same text, checking and recording differences between them, spinning each twirler as he moves from edition to edition. INDEX OF PAST, PRESENT, AND "GHOST" OWNERS OR LOCATIONS The index identifies all former and current owners of the four collators. In two cases (C1 and C5) I have been unable to obtain permission from the owners to list them in the census. In these two cases the city where the machine is located has been indexed instead. The index also includes "ghosts" —machines that have been mistakenly attributed or that were ordered but never delivered.

      <field name="fulltext">R. B. McKERROW'S PRE-1914 EDITIONS by Marcel De Smedt** I would like to thank my colleague Prof. Dr. V. Doyen (K. U. Leuven) for reading over the final version of this paper. IN 1997 Studies in Bibliography published an article of mine on "W. Bang Kaup, W. W. Greg, R. B. McKerrow and the Edition of English Dramatic Works (1902-1914)".1 1. Studies in Bibliography 50 (1997): 213-223. For readers of Studies in Bibliography, names like W. W. Greg and R. B. McKerrow are familiar. Probably this is not the case with the German Orientalist Willy Bang Kaup (1869-1934), who was to become an outstanding scholar on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English dramatic works. Indeed, Bang, who studied in the Louvain Oriental school, was one of the first professors of the newly (1893) inaugurated curriculum in Germanic philology (i.e. English, Dutch, and German studies) at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium). He lectured on English language and literature until 1914, when, being a German, he had to return to Germany, not to come back after the war. There was an intensive correspondence between Greg and McKerrow on the one hand and Bang on the other. Letters of both British bibliographers to Bang are extant in the Louvain University Library. They throw light on the genesis and the editorial principles of some editions in Bang's series Materialien zur Kunde des älteren Englischen Dramas (set up in 1902), in which a number of older dramatic texts were published, some of them edited by the two British scholars. In my article of 1997, I had the opportunity to publish a couple of these letters relating to the founding of Greg's Malone Society. I would now like to have a closer look at McKerrow's editions in Bang's series, as well as his famous Nashe edition. His letters in the Louvain University Library will be taken into account whenever necessary or desirable.2 2. All quotations are from the correspondence in the Louvain University Library (P56). I hope the result will be a better insight into the importance of McKerrow's editorial principles underlying his pre-1914 editions. I Let us first have a look at the editions McKerrow made for Bang's Materialien series. McKerrow was recommended to Bang by W. W. Greg in a letter of February 9, 1903.3 3. Cf. De Smedt, p. 214. Ten days later Bang wrote to McKerrow, for on February 25, McKerrow answers: "I am greatly obliged for your letter of the 19th inst. and kind offer to include me among the collaborators in your series of `Materialen' [sic],—an offer which I accept with many thanks" (cf. Appendix). A few months later, on May 8, 1903, McKerrow shows his possible interest in editing Barnabe Barnes' The Devil's Charter. He asks Bang whether he knows of any reprint of this work: "I can trace no reprint in England, and it seems to me to be of some interest from its connection with the Faust-story". A letter of June 11 tells us McKerrow is making a transcript of The Devil's Charter, and at the same time we are told that the play is "of some length running to 93 pages in the 410. (38 lines to the page, probably about 3,400 lines altogether, excluding stage directions &amp; c.)". A fortnight later the transcription is finished, but McKerrow wants to read it through before sending it to Bang, "as all the copies seem made up of sheets in different degrees of correctness" (June 27, 1903). In October, McKerrow is proofreading and returns proofs of sheets E and F with a couple of remarks, including on the carelessness of the printer as to the distinction between the letters e and c. About 25% of the e's look like c's: "The printer probably cleaned them with a nail when they got choked with ink and so destroyed the bar" (October 21, 1903). In 1904 Barnabe Barnes' The Devil's Charter appeared as number 6 in the series.4 4. Barnabe Barnes, The Devil's Charter. Edited from the quarto of 1607 by R. B. McKerrow. Materialien . . ., 6. Louvain, 1904. In his introduction, McKerrow refers to the four copies (of the only early edition—1607) he made use of. As I have mentioned elsewhere, in this introduction he lays down one of the basic rules of analytical bibliography, pointing out that the forme, not the sheet, is the unit of printing (Introduction, p. XV-XVI). As a consequence, McKerrow gives a table of "most corrected", "intermediate" and "least correct" sheets, divided in outer and inner formes. For the text proper, he follows copy A, except for two sheets.5 5. Cf. De Smedt, p. 216. As to the method of his "reprint" (as McKerrow calls it; it is in fact a new edition), "like other works in this series it is intended to represent as accurately as possible in every respect the original" (p. XVIII). And indeed, the 1607 text is followed page for page, with the original signatures and catchwords, and with its misprints, which are corrected in the explanatory notes (e.g. pp. 111, 113, 117). There are some modifications to the strict following of the copy, as in the case of the distinction between e and c. When an e was obviously required, the editor puts a c "only if it seemed fairly certain that the wrong letter really had been used . . .". Further, though several founts of commas are used in the original text, the editor does not distinguish between them. It was also impossible to distinguish turned n's and turned u's; and "no notice has been taken of the varying spaces between words". As to stage directions and signatures, they "are placed so far as possible in the position in which they stand in the quarto, but the different proportions of the letters in the old and modern founts prevent absolute accuracy in this respect". Emendations proposed have been placed with the explanatory notes, "as being more likely to be required by the reader" (pp. XVIII-XIX). Misprints are also mentioned in the "Notes". "Textual notes" give the variants between the different copies, with "the signature of each page . . . before the number of the line" (p. [97]). McKerrow's next edition in Bang's series dates from 1905, and is in fact a product of the collaboration between Bang and McKerrow. Indeed, The Enterlude of Youth has both editors on the title page.6 6. The Enterlude of Youth nebst Fragmenten des Playe of Lucres und von Nature. Herausgegeben von W. Bang und R. B. McKerrow. Materialien . . ., 12. Louvain, 1905. The edition is partly in German, partly in English. From McKerrow's letters to Bang we get some data as to genesis and plan of this work. On December 15, 1903, McKerrow expresses his gladness at helping with the edition of Enterlude: "it will only mean very little work at any rate, as the whole thing is so short". At the same time, in this letter he gives a survey of the four copies known to him: two copies of an edition printed by Waley (W), one printed by Copland (C), and a (printed) fragment in the library of Lambeth Palace (L).7 7. In a letter of February 11, 1904, McKerrow informs Bang that Mr. Macbeth has at last received permission to photograph the fragment. Both editions, as well as the fragment, are undated. However, "as they all have wood-cuts it may with luck be possible to date them pretty accurately". And indeed, in the introduction to the edition, McKerrow gives indications on the date of the fragment on the basis of the woodcuts: this, the oldest text, "was printed not earlier than 1528" (pp. XV-XVIII). As to the relationship of the three texts, McKerrow comes to the conclusion that C and W are not connected directly to L, but that there must be at least one intermediate edition. As none of the three texts is superior to the others or of such a kind that it can be taken automatically as a basis for an edition (p. XXI), the three of them are reproduced "page for page and line for line with the originals" (p. XV). Apparently this was on Bang's suggestion, since McKerrow writes on February 27, 1905: "I have returned the Copland proofs. I had not realised that we were going to have both texts in [full canceled] full but it is just as well, I think—at any rate it absolves one to some extent of the responsibility of deciding which should be rejected". On May 4, 1905, McKerrow sends Bang, along with remarks on the relationship of the three texts, a number of textual and other notes. As to the textual notes, McKerrow expresses his doubts about how and where they have to be put, as Bang already commented upon some in his explanatory notes (the "Erläuterungen"). Perhaps some notes have to be given in both places? Or: "One might of course given [sic] only variants in the text notes and leave misprints for the others, as I did in D[evil's] Ch[arter] but in that case I do not quite see how one would deal with misprints in C, which should, I think, be mentioned somewhere"; otherwise it would not be clear that they are not errors in the new edition. For safety's sake, the "misprints occurring in C alone" are given in a separate list in the edition proper (pp. [70]-[71]). As to the explanatory notes, "I really know very little about the early plays so have not been able to add anything of value", McKerrow writes in the same letter. Still he gives a remark on Humility's words in lines 153-156 of the play. According to him, the character Humility is in all likelihood not on stage at that moment. McKerrow suggests that we have here "a trace of an older version in which the character took a more prominent part, and that this single speech was left by inadvertence". Bang does not take over the suggestion, and simply states at line 153: "Die Bühnenweisung Humilitye (für Charitie) ist jedenfalls nur Druckfehler [The stagedirection Humilitye (for Charitie) is in any case a misprint]" (p. 82). In the "Textual notes" in the edition proper, McKerrow gives "Notes on Waley's edition (W), with such variant readings as are not merely meaningless misprints from Copland's edition (C) and from the Lambeth Palace fragment (L)". He also mentions that words divided into two parts, nowadays printed as one (for instance, for sake), are included in the notes (p. [65]). There must have been some remark in this respect by Bang, since McKerrow writes on August 4, 1905, that he did not mean to say that "for sake" is a misprint, he simply meant to show that such cases "were not—as some might otherwise suppose—errors in our reprint". A few days later (August 8), he informs Bang that he "added a note at the head". The note probably consists of the last sentences of the introductory statement, in which McKerrow expresses his fear that if forms like "for sake" would not be marked, readers might think them to be errors in the present edition; at the same time he states "that such division of words was extremely common at a somewhat earlier period" (p. [65]). In conclusion, it is important to note that Bang and McKerrow publish the three texts in full (with some restriction for the fragment, of course), and that they do not give an eclectic text (although in this case it would have been perfectly justified, as there are no authorised versions). In a letter of May 31, 1906, McKerrow informs Bang that seventeen plays, "the property of a gentleman in Ireland" have turned up, and will soon (on June 30) be sold at Sotheby's. More specifically McKerrow mentions the plays Wealth and Health, Impatient Poverty and John the Evangelist. A month later, on July 3, McKerrow writes that the British Museum has been able to buy all it wanted, including the three plays mentioned, and he informs Bang that it is possible that Greg will publish the plays. At the same time he refers to the new society Greg intends to set up (The Malone Society). Greg's edition "will however, I understand, be a mere reprint without introduction or notes, so will leave the way open for a more elaborate edition if you care to do one".8 8. In fact Greg edited The Interlude of John the Evangelist and The Interlude of Wealth and Health in the Malone Society Reprints (cf. De Smedt, p. 218). McKerrow is prepared to transcribe the plays for Bang, if he wishes so. On July 24, McKerrow writes that the new society will "interfere as little as possible with lines of work which you have taken up, so that the two series may not clash"; the edition of Impatient Poverty will be left to Bang. The Malone Society was founded on July 30. The next day McKerrow confirms that he will transcribe Impatient Poverty for Bang "next week", but in a letter of August 5, he has to report that the copy has been sent to the binder. There are apparently no letters from McKerrow to Bang left from the period between August 5, 1906, and March 9, 1907. Surprisingly, at the end of March McKerrow himself is working on the edition of Impatient Poverty! From March 29 until April 8, 1907, Bang almost daily sends remarks and notes to McKerrow concerning the edition of Impatient Poverty: six of Bang's postcards from this rather short period are present in the archive because McKerrow returned them to Bang.9 9. Cf.: "I return the post-cards in case you would like to add anything from them" (McKerrow in a letter dated April 2, 1911). In a number of remarks Bang wants to prove that some word forms in the play are clearly "Northern". In his card stamped on April 8, he puts it firmly: "I have not the least doubt that Imp. Pov. was written in the North". McKerrow has a more differentiated approach. In his introduction he speaks about "a northern element in the piece", but that does not mean that we can "with safety assign it to any particular locality". According to him it is quite possible that the play was originally Scottish and afterwards revised by a Southerner, or Northern English written down by a Londoner (p. XVI). Moreover, in the notes McKerrow sometimes explicitly points to southern word forms (e.g. p. 51: "414, 415 be] i.e. been. The form appears to be distinctively southern"; p. 64: "1033 redemeth] The -eth termination of plural of the present tense is of course one of the chief marks of Southern English"). On the whole, McKerrow was very cautious to draw conclusions from the spelling or word forms as to the identity of an author or the location of a work.10 10. Cf. McKerrow in one of his lectures from 1928: "It would at any rate, after 1590— perhaps after 1580—be quite unsafe to take the spelling of any ordinary printed book as representing that of its author, or to deduce from the spellings of any anonymous printed work anything as to the identity of its author, or even as to his age, education, or the part of the country from which he came" (McKerrow, "The Relationship of English Printed Books to Authors' Manuscripts during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (The 1928 Sandars Lectures)", ed. Carlo M. Bajetta, Studies in Bibliography 53 [2000]: 1-65 [p. 39]). In this edition of Impatient Poverty, there is no distinction between textual and explanatory notes; they have been put together (as there is only one copy left of this play, there was no question of giving variants). As to the text itself, it is again a page-for-page reprint, and the editor has "endeavoured to reproduce the original text as exactly as possible, including all misprints. The more important of these, but not minor errors of punctuation, will be found corrected in the notes" (p. XIV). Along with the notes, there is an index. The edition of this text of 1560 was finally published in 1911 as number 33 in the Materialien series.11 11. A Newe Interlude of Impacyente Pouerte. From the quarto of 1560 edited by R. B. McKerrow. Materialien . . ., 33. Louvain, 1911. On April 2 of that year, McKerrow sends the introduction and the notes to Bang, "at last" as he says. "You will see that I have used most of the notes &amp; suggestions which you sent me; but in a few cases I couldn't get satisfactory evidence that the form in question was specially northern". On April 3 he adds a note to his letter, stating that he sends the index as well. As an expression of thanks, McKerrow records his indebtedness to Bang in the introduction to the edition (p. XV). As far as the three plays hitherto discussed conform to the principles of the Materialien series, McKerrow wants to give a text representing the original as accurately as possible, whether there is only one copy left or more. In the latter case, either the different copies are printed, or the text of the chosen base copy is edited carefully and replaced by "corrected" formes when there have been press corrections. II Let us now turn to McKerrow's great edition of the works of Thomas Nashe, published 1904-1910 in five volumes, thus in the same period that he worked on his editions for Bang's series.12 12. The Works of Thomas Nashe. Edited from the original texts by Ronald B. McKerrow, 5 vols. London, 1904-1910. In the first of his letters in the Louvain University archive (dating from February 25, 1903), McKerrow refers to his effort on the edition of Nashe, "which is a somewhat lengthy piece of work". In the following letters there is more than once a complaint about the slow progress of the work. May 8, 1903: "It [i.e. "my edition of Nashe"] is not getting on quite so fast as I could wish but I hope that the first two volumes (of four) will appear in the early autumn". January 18, 1904: "No, unfortunately Nashe is by no means finished yet, it is proving a much longer job than I expected. Vol I is out, &amp; half vol II passed for press, that's all". And more than a year later there were problems with the printers: "Unfortunately Nashe 3 is not yet finished. It was half done in November but since that the printers ceased to work at it (for reasons that can be guessed) [and canceled] or at least only went on very slowly, a sheet a month or so, with great delay in getting the revises" (April 13, 1905). The printers have gone on now, but there arises a new difficulty about an indecent poem in the last sheet of the volume. I will turn to it in a moment. R. B. McKerrow is generally known for having invented the term "copytext", although according to W. W. Greg in his famous article of 1950, "he was merely giving a name to a conception already familiar".13 13. W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text", Studies in Bibliography 3 (1950-1951): 19-36 (p. 19). In his memorial tribute to McKerrow, Greg states: "He also saw that the rock-bed of editing was the choice of the text to be taken as the basis of a reprint. For this he invented the term `copy-text', which has passed into critical use" (W. W. Greg, "Ronald Brunlees McKerrow, 1872-1940", Proceedings of the British Academy 26 [1940]: 488-515 [p. 504]). As a rule, when copy-text theory is spoken of, the names of Greg and McKerrow are always bracketed together, but that does not mean that there are no differences of opinion between these scholars. Thus, in connection with McKerrow's edition of Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller, published in the second volume of Nashe's works, Greg rather disapprovingly cites McKerrow's words: "if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, or some of them at least, are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint". As a consequence, McKerrow followed the second edition, "Newly corrected and augmented". In this respect Greg speaks about the principle of "maintaining the integrity of the copy-text" and about "the old fallacy of the `best text' " and claims that as a consequence for McKerrow an editor has to accept all substantive readings and all accidentals of the copy-text, also in the case where the copy-text is based on a version revised by the author.14 14. Greg, pp. 23-24; McKerrow, 2:197 (our quotation follows McKerrow's text). To do full justice to McKerrow, it is not superfluous to examine once more the principles underlying his Nashe edition. The same prudence and reflection on which text to edit and particularly how to edit it that McKerrow displays in his editions we have discussed so far will also become visible here. Right at the beginning of his work, in the general note on the treatment of the text, he introduces the term copy-text, which he defines as "the text used in each particular case as the basis of mine", and which he follows "exactly except as regards evident misprints": these are corrected, "the reading of the original being given at the foot of the page". Misprints in word division on the other hand are corrected without a note (1:xi). As to punctuation, McKerrow has chosen a compromise, namely "to keep the old punctuation wherever it is neither misleading nor actually disturbing to a reader, but to alter it without scruple where it is so". He humbly admits that his system is inconsistent (1:xiii). It is obvious that McKerrow does not follow the copy-text slavishly; judgment has to play a role, even in the case of the accidentals (e.g. punctuation). The first volume (1904) of his Nashe edition includes the text of A Countercuffe giuen to Martin Iunior: by the venturous, hardie, and renowned Pasquill of England, Caualiero of 1589 (1:51-64). Two old editions of the text are known, though scarcely differentiated from one another. McKerrow believes they are set in duplicate. One edition has the printer's device on the title page and the other not; McKerrow concludes that "the one with the printer's mark is in a sense the original, the other a duplicate". The editor therefore follows the former (from the copy in the British Museum), though in this case the choice between the two is of minor importance (1:52-55). The same holds for The Returne of the renowned Caualiero Pasquill of England (1:65-103). There is one old edition (1589), of which several copies are left. McKerrow examined seven of them. On the basis of the variants, he distinguishes three groups. The variations in the different copies are, according to him, due "to certain pages being for some reason or other set up twice". The editor follows the a-copy (British Museum), "representing the text of the majority of the copies" he has seen (1:66-68). In other words, in the case where there is only one old edition left (or two editions, set in duplicate) with several copies, there is no big problem as to the choice of the copy-text. The editor examines whether there are differences, and he uses them to define and motivate the choice of the copy he bases his edition on. More complicated, and more interesting too, is the situation where there are several editions from different years. This is the case with Pierce Penilesse his Supplication to the Diuell (1:137-245). There are three editions of 1592 (A, B, C), one of 1593, and one of 1595. On the basis of some arguments, McKerrow is able to settle the order of A, B, and C (through examples like: frantick in A; fran-tick (divided at the end of a line) in B, and fran-tick in C and 1593) (1:142). In his chapter on the choice of the copy-text, McKerrow makes it plausible that C was the last edition corrected by the author, though Nashe probably did not see the texts of B and C in proof: "I imagine that in both cases the printer was supplied with a corrected copy of the preceding edition to work from". At the same time he thinks that the texts of 1593 and 1595 were not corrected by the author. So, "C was the last text corrected by the author. At the same time C is often inferior to A, being much less carefully printed". McKerrow was then faced with two alternatives: either to print from A, adopting the corrections of C, or to print from C, with corrections from A (1:147). On page 143 McKerrow had already stated his "general principle of making the last edition which seems to have been corrected by the author the foundation of the text", and so as a consequence he decides in favour of the C-text (from the British Museum) as copy-text, "correcting where necessary from A". Moreover, he frankly testifies he has used "somewhat more freedom in restoring to the text from earlier editions words which seem to have been merely accidentally omitted in C, than would have been justifiable if we had had reason to think that the author himself had read the proofs" (1:147-148). The least we can say is that this statement proves McKerrow's cautiousness and his differentiated approach towards the copy-text. The second volume of McKerrow's edition of Nashe (also 1904) includes three works, beginning with Christs Teares over Ierusalem (2:1-186). Christs Teares exists in an edition of 1593, one of 1594, and one of 1613. The 1594 edition is from the same setting-up of type as 1593, but there are differences in the preliminary matter. The original Epistle to the Reader was canceled and a new one substituted, for example. McKerrow follows the edition of 1593 (copy in the British Museum). The preliminary matter of 1594 is based on the copy in the Bodleian Library, and is placed at the end of the work (1:1-5). It seems somewhat strange that McKerrow opts for the first edition here, as it is clear that the new preliminary matter of 1594 ("To the reader") is certainly from Nashe's hand. Another work published in the second volume is the already mentioned The Unfortunate Traveller (2:187-328), of which there are two editions of 1594, A and B, the latter one "Newly corrected and augmented". McKerrow gives some arguments to prove that the second edition was the work of two printers (whom he calls X and Y), each of them responsible for a number of sheets (2:189-191). It would lead us too far astray to go into the different arguments for this thesis (e.g. difference in the workmanship, variation in the number of lines, etc.). As to the relation between the editions, there are arguments to say that B was printed from a copy of A (e.g., the last two sheets of B correspond page for page with the last two of A). The question is then whether and to what extent "the differences between the two editions can be set down to deliberate correction on the part of the author" (2:194). McKerrow argues "that a large number of the changes are certainly intentional alterations which can only have been made with the object of improving the style" (2:194). But there are other changes, "due to an entirely different cause". Indeed, on page K4r "we find a number of changes all tending to shorten the text" to such an extent that in one instance it becomes almost unintelligible (2:195). This must have to do with the division of the copy between the two printers. Sheet L being already set by printer X, printer Y, seeing that he still had two and a half pages of copy to get into two pages of sheet K, "he himself, perhaps with the consent of the author, made the alterations in question" (2:195). In other words, McKerrow gives us here a marvelous example of so-called "textual bibliography", of how printing techniques can influence the wording of the text. There are some other changes for which the editor can see no reason, and he concludes that the second edition is evidently corrected, though not always improved: "Whether the changes were the work of Nashe himself it is, I think, not possible to say. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it seems natural to suppose that they were" (2:196). And then follows the famous paragraph, also quoted by Greg, in which McKerrow states that the editor has to take as copy-text the text in which there are (some) corrections by the author, in this case the second edition. But to do justice to McKerrow, it must be remarked that he does not stick to his copy-text in all cases, and Greg is somewhat misleadingly referring to the fallacy of the `best text' and the duty always to follow the copy-text in the matter of accidentals. Indeed, McKerrow clearly states that his edition is "from the copy of edition B in the Bodleian Library, with collations from the copy of A at the British Museum. As stated below, I am very doubtful whether all the differences between the two editions are due to the author, and in a considerable number of cases have felt bound to recur to the readings of the first edition" (1:189). Could it be any clearer? The last text edited in the second volume of Nashe's works in The Tragedie of Dido Queene of Carthage, "Written by Christopher Marlowe, and Thomas Nash. Gent." as is printed on the title page (2:328-397). In a couple of letters to Bang, McKerrow goes into the question of the relationship between Marlowe and Nashe, and more specifically into the inclusion of Dido in his edition of Nashe's works. In a letter dated June 11, 1903, an answer to a letter in which Bang expressed his doubts about Marlowe's authorship of the prologue of his Faustus, McKerrow likewise doubts the possible authorship of Nashe; he wonders "whether there is enough evidence". Indeed, "there is not enough left of Nashe's verse to enable us to judge by the evidence of style, and what there is is so extraordinarily various". In this context he makes a reference to Dido: "It is difficult to believe that any of Dido can have been written by a person capable of such very poor verse as most of Summers Last Will and Testament", a statement suggesting McKerrow's conviction about Nashe's authorship of Dido. Nevertheless, a fortnight later, in a letter to Bang of June 27, McKerrow is in doubt whether or not he will include Dido in his edition. He refers to A. H. Bullen (the publisher of McKerrow's Nashe edition) who "is about to issue a new edition of his `Marlowe' which will of course contain the play. He was therefore of the opinion that it would be as well for me to omit it". But McKerrow prefers to include it "so as to have the edition as complete as possible". Moreover, it is "very largely a question of [whether canceled] how the space will work out".15 15. In his edition, McKerrow refers to a note by Malone quoting the words of "Bishop Tanner" about The Tragedie of Dido by Christopher Marlowe: "Hanc perfecit &amp; edidit Tho. Nash Lond. 1594. 4to" (2:336). Further on, McKerrow expresses his hope not to interfere with an edition of Dido that Bang is "about to publish" as that one will "follow the original page for page", which his edition cannot, and "will probably be more elaborately annotated". As far as I know, Bang did not publish an edition of Dido. There is only one early edition left of this work, dating from 1594. In it, the play is divided into five acts and there are no divisions of scenes. Yet, most of the modern editors have divided the play into scenes, and McKerrow will act the same way, "though, for the purpose of numbering" he treats the acts as undivided (2:333-335). It may appear strange that the editor deviates from his copy-text as to the division into scenes, as it is likewise remarkable that his edition is "from the copy in the Bodleian Library, with collations from Dyce, Cunningham, Mr. Bullen, and Grosart" (2:331), i.e. collations from modern editions. The third volume of the Nashe edition begins with three pieces of which there are in each case two or three copies in the British Museum. Of Have with You to Saffron-Walden (3:1-139), the British Museum owns two copies of the 1596 edition, with occasional differences of reading between them, "evidently owing to correction at press". McKerrow edits following one of these copies, and in the case of differences, "the reading which appears to be correct is given in the text, that of the other copy being recorded in a foot-note" (3:2). Of Nashes Lenten Stuffe (3:141-226) two copies of the 1599 edition are held by the British Museum, also with a few variations. McKerrow's edition is again based on one of them, with some variants of the other copy (3:142). The third text in this third volume, Summers Last Will and Testament (3:227-295), exists in three copies at the British Museum. Again, as we would expect, McKerrow follows one copy, and the other copies "have also been occasionally consulted" (3:228). It is striking that for the three texts mentioned, as was already the case with Dido, McKerrow gives readings from modern, mainly nineteenth-century editions as well (e.g. from The Complete Works of Thomas Nashe edited by A. B. Grosart in 1883-85).16 16. Cf. For Have with You: "Grosart's variations from the quarto have been recorded only when it seemed that they might be intentional" (3:2). For Nashes Lenten Stuffe: "Grosart's readings have been recorded whenever they seem not to be mere errors of transcription or misprints" (3:143). And for Summers Last Will: "I have attempted to give all Grosart's readings and also all those of Mr. Hazlitt with the exception of a few which seemed to be certainly misprints" (3:229). This procedure is in keeping with McKerrow's statement in the general note introducing his edition: "Unless the contrary is stated in the introductory note, variant readings of modern reprints, such as those of Collier and Grosart, are only given when the divergence from the quartos seems to be intentional, i.e. when the editors appear to have intended an emendation" (1:xiv). Also in the third volume are some "shorter pieces". As to the "Preface to R. Greene's `Menaphon' " (3:300-325), it is interesting to see why McKerrow takes the 1610 edition as the basis of his own, even though there is an edition from Nashe's lifetime, i.e. of 1589. In the 1610 text, McKerrow notices changes and insertions which according to him must "be considered as deliberate corrections, and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be attributed to the author of the work". Another argument in favour of the 1610 version is that there are already two modern reprints of the edition of 1589 (3:309-310). At the end of the volume are some "doubtful works" of which "The choice of Valentines" (3:397-416) is one. No early editions of this poem are extant, there are only three manuscripts left (B, D and P). McKerrow bases his edition on manuscript P, "apparently written not long before the end of the seventeenth century". He inserts a few readings from B and gives the collation of B and D in footnotes (3:399-400). He prefers this method to the construction of an eclectic text (3:402). According to a letter McKerrow wrote to Bang on April 13, 1905, it was by no means sure that this poem would appear in the volume. Indeed, after the delay in the printing of the sheets of the volume, caused by the inertia of the printers, "a new difficulty has just arisen" about "an indecent poem in the last sheet of the vol. which they don't quite like to print &amp; which will have to go before the delegates of the press for their approval"—a matter which, according to McKerrow, "will probably cause further delay"; he himself would not be "particularly sorry to be obliged to omit it". Anyway, the "indecent" poem is included in the edition. The theme of the poem can at best be understood by quoting the title of manuscript B: "Nash his Dildo" (3:403)! The fourth volume of The Works of Thomas Nashe consists of the explanatory notes, while the fifth volume gives the introduction and the index. In conclusion, it is clear that McKerrow's pre-1914 editions testify of his extreme cautiousness in the choice of the copy-text on which he bases his editions. According to the principles underlying the editions in Bang's Materialien series, he follows the base text page for page. Variants between copies are rendered in the textual notes. Misprints are corrected in the explanatory notes. In his Nashe edition, misprints are corrected in the text, the reading of the original is given in footnote. In the cases where other old editions of the work exist, McKerrow allows corrections from those editions into the copy-text, though always with the necessary justification. McKerrow's editorial labours in these years also produced another important fruit. On July 6, 1914, he sent to Bang a booklet, "a little sermon on the importance of bibliography to editors of Eliz. lit" (cf. Appendix). McKerrow was extremely well prepared to compose these Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students . . ., in which he could lean on evidence and examples gathered while working on his editions.17 17. R. B. McKerrow, Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors of English Works of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. London, 1914, 102 pp. (Reprinted from the Transactions of the Bibliographical Society, vol. 12.) The booklet in turn was the predecessor of his famous manual An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (Oxford, 1927) that for decades to come has acted as the bible of analytical and textual bibliography. The fact that the edition of 1927 (reprinted with "a few corrections and small additions" in 1928) remains in print testifies to its quality.18 18. David L. Vander Meulen surveys the various printings of this book in "Revision in Bibliographical Classics: `McKerrow' and `Bowers' ", Studies in Bibliography 52 (1999): 215-245. Although knowledge of the history of printing as well as bibliographical study have evolved since McKerrow's day, this additional product of the early years of the twentieth century is a further reminder of his continuing impact on scholarship of the twenty-first. APPENDIX: Letters 1. Letter from R. B. McKerrow to W. Bang, February 25, 1903 22, Friars Stile Road Richmond, Surrey25 Feb. '03. Dear Sir, I am greatly obliged for your letter of the 19th inst. and kind offer to include me among the collaborators in your series of `Materialen' [sic],—an offer which I accept with many thanks. May I ask whether you have any suggestions to make as to texts that want `doing'? you would, I suppose, naturally prefer those that are at present inaccessible in cheap or separate editions. At the moment I am unable to propose anything, or rather, though I have in my mind two or three things that I should be glad to do and that seem to be wanted, they all want some looking into first. I will consider them and write again in a few days. I am indeed rather busy just now being engaged on an edition of T. Nash [sic], which is a somewhat lengthy piece of work. I should therefore prefer if possible to arrange what piece or pieces you would like me to do soon, so that I can get them done when an opportunity offers. You seem to have plenty of material arranged for already, so would not, I suppose, wish to receive anything from me for some little time. Yours very truly, R. B. McKerrow. Professor W. Bang, Louvain. 2. Letter from R. B. McKerrow to W. Bang, July 6, 1914 4, Phoenix Lodge Mansions, Brook Green, Hammersmith, W.6 July 1914 Dear Professor Bang, I am sending you a little sermon on the importance of bibliography to editors of Eliz. lit (reprinted from the Bibliographical Soc.'s Transactions), which may perhaps interest you. Strictly speaking I ought not to send it out yet [next parenthetical phrase interlined] (though it was printed months ago) as the vol. from which it is "reprinted" has not been issued yet, but I do so because if I delay any longer you will be on your holiday. If you have time to look at it, I should be very much obliged if you could give me the names of any people—say 6 or 8—whom you think it might interest. I have a number of free copies to give away, &amp; am anxious to send them where they might be useful. I am sending one to De Vocht, and shall later send copies to all those of your "Materialists" who have edited texts. You may, however, know some students of this side of the subject whose names I have not come across. If the book seems likely to be of any use I hope later to do something more elaborate on the same subject. Yours ever R. B. McKerrow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LONDON BOOK TRADE 1614-1618 by David L. Gants** A preliminary version of this paper was presented before a Newberry Library Fellows' Seminar on 19 February 2001, and at a seminar on the Stationers' Company at the Annual Meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America on 12 April 2001. The suggestions of the participants at both events have been invaluable, as was the crucial support of my 2000-2001 Mellon Fellowship at the Newberry Library. I would also like to thank Peter W. M. Blayney for his insightful comments on an earlier version of this essay. AS STUDENTS OF THE BOOK have borrowed tools of the historian in their attempts to gain insights into the world of early printing and publishing, they have also faced the limits inherent in such instruments.1 1. For a concise survey of recent developments in bibliographical resources and methods with respect to historical approaches, see Hugh Amory, "Pseudoxia Bibliographica, or When Is a Book Not a Book? When It's a Record," The Scholar &amp; The Database, CERL Papers 11, ed. Lotte Hellinga (London: Consortium of European Research Libraries, 1999), 1-14. In particular, the methods of quantitative history, often called cliometrics, offer many analytical advantages, derived in part from the broad perspective that large population samples afford and in part from the numerous descriptive and inferential tools available. For the unwary these tools are also accompanied by the potential traps of unreliable data, anachronistic modeling, and statistical misapplication. Nonetheless, a number of admirable studies in the area of the early modern English book trade have demonstrated what can be gained through a thoughtful application of quantitative approaches.2 2. See especially: D. F. McKenzie, The Cambridge University Press, 1696-1712 (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1966); Peter W. M. Blayney, The Texts of King Lear and their Origins (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982); Akihiro Yamada, Thomas Creede: Printer to Shakespeare and his Contemporaries (Tokyo: Meisei Univ. Press, 1994); Alain Veylit, "A Statistical Survey and Evaluation of the Eighteenth-Century Short-Title Catalog" (Diss. Univ. of California Riverside, 1994); Mark Bland, "The London Book-Trade in 1600," A Companion to Shakespeare, ed. David Scott Kastan (Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1999), 450-463; and Don-John Dugas, "The London Book Trade in 1709," PBSA 95 (2001), 32-58, 157-172. The following essay attempts to navigate the shoals of cliometrics and offer a contextual frame within which we might begin asking questions about the relationships among stationers in mid-Jacobean London. Focusing on the book trade from 1614 through 1618, a period when the city enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, it will analyze the interplay of production capacity and bookseller preference with the genre and format of the books published. It will, insofar as possible, try to tease out from title pages and secondary documents an outline of business relations among printers, publishers, wholesalers, and retailers active during a specific moment in the trade. From a larger perspective, this study also serves as a test case for the Early English Booktrade Database project, an enterprise whose central goal is the creation of a bibliographical augmentation to the English Short-Title Catalogue.3 3. The Early English Booktrade Database seeks to improve certain features of the ESTC while adding significant new data. The first stage of the project will create edition-sheet totals and collation formulæ for each record, standardize the spelling of imprint information, design and implement a subject classification scheme, and correct the confusion caused by the sometimes arbitrary practice adopted by the first STC editors in 1926 of assigning unique item numbers to variants, states, and issues. The second, longer-term goal of the project is to compile data about typography, composition, paper, paratext, page design, and the lives of the people involved in the trade. A fuller discussion of the project can be found at {http://purl.oclc.org/EEBD}. The lessons learned while collecting and interrogating this small sampling of data will subsequently be applied to the entire STC period.4 4. For a discussion of some of the issues surrounding the collection and organization of the evidence underlying this study, see the "Project Methods" section of the Early English Booktrade Database Web site. Two matters need to be addressed briefly before I discuss the results of my analysis. First, I have employed the edition sheet as the base unit for measuring printing-house output. Bibliographers have employed this term for different concepts, but I take it to mean the number of sheets in an exemplar volume used as a measure of the relative amount of work required to produce the complete run of that volume. For example, a 32-page quarto that collates A-D4 contains four edition sheets, while a 32-page octavo that collates A-B8 contains two edition sheets. Although both volumes have the same number of pages, the quarto contains twice as many sheets and would require roughly twice as much work to machine as the octavo. The second issue revolves around the generic classifications I have used to evaluate printing and publishing activity. The utility of ongoing research increases when pursued with an awareness of its predecessors in the field, and so I have broken down the books published during the target period into categories used in recent studies. A more detailed discussion of these issues can be found at the Early English Booktrade Database Web site. 1. Book Production in Mid-Jacobean London5 5. The information upon which this study relies comes from the STC, the ESTC, ProQuest's Early English Books Online ({http://eebo.chadwyck.com}), the UMI Early English Books microfilm series, numerous public and private On-line Public Access Catalogues (OPACs), and a physical examination of roughly half the items in question. In some cases I was forced to estimate the edition-sheet total of a particular title based upon data derived from similar editions of the same work (for example when dealing with the Ames collection of title pages in the British Library), and in one case I was not able to acquire or estimate edition sheet totals because it was unavailable: Bartholomew Robertson, Sapienta Secundum Pietatem (London: John Beale, 1618; STC 21098.2). The base quantitative unit in this study is the edition; in those cases where the editors of the STC have split a single edition into multiple entries to reflect the presence of variants, issues, or impressions, I have only counted the single edition entry in my totals. The STC defines an edition as "An item having a majority of sheets (usually all) from reset type," while a variant has a "major change in title, imprint or colophon," an issue has had the "addition, deletion, and/or substitution of leaves or sheets constituting up to half of a book's original sheets," and an impression "indicates standing type which has been reimposed" and additional sheets printed from it (1.xli). In those cases where the STC editors were able to identify the quantity of reset material in an issue, or when I was able to generate such figures from my physical inspection, I have included those numbers in my data. During the five-year period 1614-1618, London stationers produced an average of 7616 edition sheets and 356 distinct editions each year,6 6. Compare this with Mark Bland's estimate of 5400 edition sheets and 262 editions in 1600 London (457-458). and the size of a typical book was slightly less than twenty-two edition sheets (see table 1). A little over half of that output was religious material, with 15% Table 1. London printing, 1614-1618 Year Edition sheets Editionsa a. These figures differ significantly from those generated by Maureen Bell and John Barnard, "Provisional Count of STC Titles 1475-1648," Publishing History 31 (1992), 48-66. The scope of their study forced Bell and Barnard to count all STC items, while as noted above, I was able to eliminate variants, issues, and impressions from my totals and focus my analysis on composition and production numbers. Edition sheets/Edition 1614 7932 326 24.3 1615 8156 412 19.8 1616 7095 379 18.7 1617 7240 320 22.6 1618 7653 341 22.4 Average 7616 356 21.4 works of literature, 12% informational texts, 11% law and politics, 7% history, and the remaining 2% ephemera and official documents (see table 2). Of the religious materials, about two-thirds of the output consisted of devotional or instructional volumes, learned commentary, controversial tracts, and other such works, with 20% devoted to biblical texts, 14% to sermons, and 4% to copies of the Book of Common Prayer (see table 3). It is useful to recall at this point that these figures describe only the output of London printers and do not reflect the larger bookselling market for which they labored. For example, manuscripts still played an important role in the production and circulation of certain types of works. Furthermore, London presses produced mainly English-language volumes, while stationers imported large numbers of Greek and Latin works from the continent that they then retailed through bookstalls and to a broad clientele of aristocrats and intellectuals.7 7. See Julian Roberts, "The Latin Trade," The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Vol. 4, 1557-1695, ed. John Barnard and D. F. McKenzie, with the assistance of Maureen Bell (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002), 141-173. Mark Bland estimates that "80 per cent of the books that survive from the libraries of Ben Jonson and John Donne . . . were printed on the Continent" (450), and Sir Edward Stanhope's book bequest to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1608 contained nearly 93% continental imprints.8 8. Alain A. Wijffels, "Sir Edward Stanhope's Bequest of Books to Trinity College, Cambridge, 1608," Private Libraries in Renaissance England, ed. R. J. Fehrnbach (Binghamton: Medieval &amp; Renaissance Texts &amp; Studies, 1992), 1.41-78. Each of these collections reflects its owner's interests; less scholarly personal libraries contain more native printing, as is illustrated by an inventory of Sir Roger Townsend's books around 1625 in which 60% of the titles are English-language works printed in Britain.9 9. R. J. Fehrenbach, "An Inventory of Books in the Possession of Sir Roger Townshend, ca. 1625," Private Libraries in Renaissance England, ed. R. J. Fehrnbach (Binghamton: Medieval &amp; Renaissance Texts &amp; Studies, 1992), 1.79-136. While the overall book trade increased, internal Company restrictions and periodic Star Chamber decrees meant the number of master printers active in London during the first forty years of the seventeenth century hovered around twenty, and with a few exceptions those licensed printers were limited to only one or two presses. Many London printers owned more than two presses but used them for proofing and other purposes, interpreting the decrees to mean one or two production presses. Compare this situation with that of Christophe Plantin of Antwerp, who in the early 1570s had up to sixteen active presses and employed in the neighborhood of fifty workers,10 10. Philip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972), 164-165. an order issued by the Provost of Paris in 1618 decreeing that each master printer have at least two working presses,11 11. Henri-Jean Martin, Print, Power, and People in 17th-Century France, trans. David Gerard (Metuchen and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993), 39-40. or with a 1644 Parisian inventory indicating that one printing house had seven presses, five had five presses, eight had four, eleven had three, thirty-five had two, and sixteen had one press.12 12. Martin, 246. The reasons for this apparent imbalance are various—the lack of a significant domestic supply of paper (the English wore mainly wool and thus lacked a ready source of the linen rags from which paper was made), the minuscule continental market for English-language books, the inability to achieve economies of scale that continental printers enjoyed, the dominance of French printing during the sixteenth century, and the obvious fact that Paris was nearly twice as large as London and the population of France three times as large as England—but the important point to bear in mind is that the London printing trade was a relatively small industry serving a subset of a larger market. Although the domestic printing trade may have remained small relative to the continental industry, it is clear that the overall circulation and sales of books printed in England had been growing for some time. Veylit has compiled figures for British publishing from 1475-1800, based upon individual titles listed in the ESTC database. These indicate that the average number of titles annually printed in the forty-year period between the death of Elizabeth and the beginning of the English Civil War roughly doubled, from about 250 per year to 500.13 13. See {http://cbsr26.ucr.edu/ESTCStatistics.html}. This expansion is part of a longer trend of steady growth in common-press books that began when Caxton set up his office in Westminster in 1475. Marjorie Plant has observed that "The prosperity of any branch of economic activity is directly affected by the prevalence of war, and this is surely nowhere more true than in the case of the book industry."14 14. Marjorie Plant, The English Book Trade (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1939), 32. Certainly the accession of Henry VII at the end of 100 years of civil strife and the one and one-half centuries of relative domestic peace that followed played a major role in the growth of the English market for books. Other larger factors contributed as well: rising literacy, national population recovery from the fourteenth-century plagues and accompanying economic development (albeit usually slow and halting), the growing hegemony of London within England, and a host of smaller influences all made for not just an expanding market for books but also a diverse one.15 15. Whether the trade's growth indicates an associated prosperity is less clear, and the progressive model presented here is only a simple overview. For a discussion of the issues concerning the economics of the London book trade see John Barnard's Introduction to The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Vol. 4, especially pp. 14-21. As far as the five-year period of this study is concerned, a number of localized factors combined to make it an especially interesting one. Politically it marked the center of James I's rule and the last years of an era of relative calm that had begun with the Edict of Nantes in 1598 and peace with Spain in 1604; by 1619 Ralegh had been executed, James's popularity at home had evaporated, and turmoil in Bohemia had sparked the Thirty Years War. England was experiencing sustained economic prosperity, marked by stable prices, a series of good harvests, and a welcome lack of plague visitations.16 16. Of course, one's experience of prosperity varied with station. The relentless flood of immigration into London also caused a growing disparity between wages and prices. Figures cited by C. G. A. Clay indicate that the relative purchasing power of a craftsman's wages in the building trade between 1500 and 1720 reached its lowest point in the 1610s (Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700 [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1984], 216-218). In 1616 the Stationers' Company renewed and enlarged its exclusive right to print primers, Psalters, and almanacs, titles that formed the core of the profitable English Stock. In the same year, an apparent optimistic moment, the Company also struck a deal with Bonham Norton and formed the Latin Stock, which was primarily concerned with importing books from the continent. Two years later, in 1618, the Stationers formed the Irish Stock in a bid to control the book trade in Ireland. Overall the middle years of James's reign were marked by relative peace and prosperity, a business climate that would have encouraged printers and publishers to produce at a fairly high level. The increasingly complex and active market is reflected in the varied subjects of the works published, bought, and consumed in England. Different genres of works brought with them assumptions about textual presentation, and nowhere is this clearer than in the choice of format.17 17. Gaskell has a very useful discussion of formats in his New Introduction, pp. 78-117. Full-sheet broadsides were usually reserved for official proclamations or ballads, while the smallest formats (16°-64°) were almost exclusively the domain of religious publication. Overall, the bulk of the works from this period were printed either in folio (36%) or quarto (41%) format, with 15% in octavo, 6% duodecimo, and the remaining 2% in a collection of little-used formats (see table 2). Informational and literary publishing most closely mirrors the distribution of formats seen in the overall trade, with slightly more quartos than folios, and a significant percentage of octavo printing. Other genres show much more striking preferences. Books of history, as well as works of law and politics, are overwhelmingly printed in folio, a format perceived as carrying a certain amount of weight and prestige, while religious works dominate small-format publication. Ephemera were overwhelmingly published in the more portable quarto and octavo formats, with official documents either printed as full-sheet broadside proclamations or quarto pamphlets. It is in the printing of religious materials that the greatest diversity of formats is employed. Almost half of the religious works are imposed in a quarto format, with a significant number of folio, octavo, and duodecimo titles and a smattering of small-format printing. Two sub-categories of religious publishing are worth touching on as well. Two-thirds of all sermons are published in quarto format, although sermon compilations tend to appear in octavo and duodecimo. The greatest range of format choices, however, is in the printing of Bibles; there appears to have been a market for Bibles, single-testament books and psalm translations in nearly every format (see table 3). Similar studies against which we might compare these data are hard to come by and often detail the activities of a single house rather than the industry as a whole. For example, Jan Materné's survey of the Officina Plantiniana's practices during the Counter-Reformation shows that this Antwerp enterprise favored smaller formats than did the London trade. The most common format as measured by titles printed was octavo, followed by duodecimo, quarto, 24mo, 32mo, and finally folio.18 18. "The Officina Plantiana and the Dynamics of the Counter-Reformation, 1590-1650," Produzione e Commercio della Carta e del Libro Secc. XIII-XVIII (Prato: Le Monnier, 1992), 485. Counting titles, McKenzie examined a trio of five-year periods in the sixteenth-century London trade and revealed that religious works made up about half the total output and that the most popular format was octavo (accounting for between fifty and seventy percent of the total output in the late 1540s).19 19. "The Economics of Print, 1550-1750: Scales of Production and Conditions of Constraint," Produzione e Commercio della Carta e del Libro Secc. XIII-XVIII (Prato: Le Monnier, 1992), 417-418. Yamada's study of Creede's establishment 1593-1617 analyzed his output by genre and size but not format, while Blayney's examination of Okes's house contains an appen- Table 2.

Biographical information in this and the next section is derived primarily from Vol. 3 of the STC and from R. B. McKerrow's A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers in England, Scotland and Ireland 1557-1640 (London: Bibliographical Society, 1910). Because of regulations requiring the inclusion in imprints of the printer's name, we can identify most of the establishments responsible for producing extant works from mid-Jacobean London. Twenty-nine individuals or organizations appear in title pages during this period as having in some way been responsible for physically printing books (some of these businesses worked cooperatively and their data have been combined; see footnotes for individual printers in table 4). The most striking observation coming from the figures below is the wide discrepancy in the levels of business activity; the top six offices were responsible for over half of the total output and the bottom six responsible for only 8% (see table 4). These figures indicate that the most productive printing houses operating in London achieved a sustained high volume one of two ways: by acquiring a privilege to print protected materials, as is the case of the King's Printer, Adam Islip, and to a lesser degree John Legat (who through established connections with Cambridge had cornered a valuable share of a steady market); or by cultivating a network of active publishers who could be relied upon to provide work sufficient to keep an office busy, as with the printers William Stansby, Edward Griffin, Thomas Snodham, Felix Kingston, and Humphrey Lownes. McKerrow, in his examination of Edward Allde's career, distinguished between two types of printers, "according as they themselves published and sold the bulk of the work they printed—the so-called printerpublisher, or printed mainly or entirely for others—the so-called trade printers."21 21. "Allde," p. 121. He did not differentiate between those who mainly printed privileged material and those who primarily commissioned new titles, but his central distinction is still a useful one, especially if one compares output levels with the place a printer falls on the printer-publisher/trade printer continuum. Indeed, the data suggest a strong correlation between the ability of a printer to solicit commissions from other publishers and the production totals posted by that printer.22 22. The two variables are linked of course, and there is no way to infer causality from these data alone. An ambitious printer with a small house would be limited by the amount of available equipment; likewise, a lazy printer with a large house would only produce as much work as the owner required, no matter how many presses or cases of type. Excluding the King's Printer, Islip, and Legat from the population, the five most productive houses (which are responsible for half the output of this group) printed only 6% of their production for themselves, while the remaining dozen identified houses printed over one- Table 4.

The King's Printing House of this period descends directly from Christopher Barker (1577-1587) and his deputies (George Bishop and Ralph Newberry, 1587-1599) to Barker's son Robert (1600-1634). However, sometime in 1616 Bonham Norton and John Bill assumed control of the press, precipitating a contracted battle over the position (for an account of the disputes see Henry R. Plomer, "The King's Printing House under the Stuarts," Library 2nd ser. 2 [1901], 353-375).

These totals include material identified with Griffin as well as the establishment known as the Eliot's Court Press. Note that the name Eliot's Court Press never appeared in an imprint, which makes attribution of responsibility highly speculative. The STC used the label as a holding category for items produced by one of the partners but without a name in the imprint, and it occasionally includes some that do have a partner's name in the imprint.

Roughly 5% of the printing output during this period has no printer listed on the title page, and over half of this work falls into generic categories that indicate it was controlled by the Stationers' Company, i.e. religion (psalm books and collections of biblical texts) and ephemera (almanacs and prognostications). The law and politics category is likely inflated by four 67-sheet quarto editions of a single work published in 1618, John Selden's controversial History of Tithes (STC 22172 ff.). This book was originally produced in Stansby's house, but sometime during Christmas 1617 the Bishop of London raided the establishment, confiscated the paper and type being used to print it, and shut down the business for a time. The text had circulated in manuscript prior to publication, and some in the government felt certain passages attempted "to proue that Tithes are not due by the Law of God . . . that the Laitie may detaine them . . . that Lay hands may still enjoy Appropriations" and that the work was "against the maintenance of the Clergie" (a3v). When the work appeared the next year (with a long preface refuting the objections raised by others and some modifications to the text itself), the only identifying features on the title page were its author and the publication date. The printer even went so far as to explicitly distance himself from the text with a short "Printer to the Reader" coda: "As I found the Copie partly Printed partly Writen, so is this done off; sauing only where those faults, and perhaps some other (which your courtesie, Reader, may amend) are committed. Neither thought I it fit to alter any thing without the Autors presence, whence euen the syllables of those passages in which mention was as if it were yet but in part only printed (as my Copie was) are also retained" (2f4v). Stansby's unfortunate experience, along with the fear that further trouble might attend this book, apparently prompted the printer of these volumes to stay as far away as possible from this debate. Selden described the raid on Stansby's house in a letter to Nicholas Fabri de Peiresc dated 6 February 1618. Bland includes a translation of the letter in his unpublished dissertation Jonson, Stansby and English Typography 1579-1623, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1995), 1.49. There is also reason to believe that at least one of the four editions was printed after 1618, although confirmation of this supposition awaits further investigation. 1374 na 7.5 2% 10% 33% 29% 19% 3% 2% 2% — Alsop/Creedef f.

If we isolate the output and selfpublication data (see figure 1), an inverse relationship between the two emerges—as a printing house increases its publishing activities it tends to decrease its overall emphasis on production work. FIGURE 1. London printing, 1614-1618: Printing house output vs. % self-published. A recent monograph on printing house activities during this period can shed further light on some of the data listed in table 4. Yamada's 1994 study of Thomas Creede's establishment contains output and subject distribution analyses for the house's history up to Creede's death in 1617 (including the materials produced in partnership with Bernard Alsop in 1616). My examination of this business's output from 1614 through 1618 indicates that Creede and then Alsop relied more heavily on projects from outside publishers than on self-financed books; they printed roughly two sheets for themselves for every three sheets they printed for other stationers. However, Yamada's analysis allows us to view this house's practices from a long-term perspective. From 1593 through 1602, Creede "printed twice as many books for himself as for others. In other words, he was a printer-bookseller" (McKerrow's printer-publisher). For the next ten-year period of 1603-1612, nearly the opposite was true. According to Yamada's figures, "the average ratio in this period of the books for himself to those for others was about 3 to 5. This reversed tendency remained unchanged until the end of his business. He became a trade-printer."23 23. Creede, p. 41. Despite the shift in publishing strategy, the overall productivity of the business didn't seem to have suffered; while the amount of self-publishing dropped steadily from an average of 292 sheets per year in 1596-98 to an annual average of 74 during the three years immediately preceding the arrival of Alsop, production rates declined much less, from 367 sheets per annum to a little over 250 (see figure 2).24 24. Creede, pp. 38-39. I have added my figures from 1614-18 to Yamada's data for this graph. FIGURE 2. Yearly output for Creede and Alsop/Creede. Before examining the much more diverse publishing segment of the London book trade, I'd like to discuss briefly the printing side of the book trade, beginning with one of the most important printers of his time. Born in Exeter, William Stansby's twenty-six-year career as a master printer (1610-1636) spans the core Jacobean-Caroline period, a time during which his output was both prolific and catholic. When Stansby apprenticed with John Windet in 1589, most of the office's composition was done in pica type. Over the years the printing house expanded its capacity by acquiring additional typographical material (in 1589 and again in 1609 the establishment purchased large amounts of english type, and around 1590 they acquired some of John Wolfe's type and ornaments), so that by the time Stansby took over in 1610 he had quite a substantial amount of type at his disposal.25 25. Bland includes a detailed analysis of the Windet-Stansby house to 1616 in his unpublished dissertation. For example, in the summer of 1616 he paused in the printing of the final quires of Ben Jonson's Workes (STC 14751), leaving 18.5 formes of type standing idle while he attended to other matters.26 26. 18.5 formes from Jonson's Workes is between 350 and 400 pounds of type. When setting a text (especially drama with its heavy consumption of capitals for speech prefixes) a compositor will start to run short after using about 10% of the available types. The implication here is that Stansby had at least 2000 pounds of one font of english type with a second font in use on another project. In 1683 Moxon recommended that a printing house have between 800-1000 pounds of commonly used fonts like english and pica (p. 25). For evidence of the standing formes, see Johan Gerritsen, "Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio: A Preliminary Account," English Studies 40 (1959), 52-65. Allowing that amount of type to sit unused would have seriously compromised many printing houses, but it had little impact on Stansby's activities. This large collection of equipment gave him the capacity to develop a business capable of concurrently printing both large and small projects and the flexibility to tackle a wide range of books. He also displayed an enormous amount of ambition. When Windet owned the house his output averaged between 200 and 300 edition sheets per year. Stansby doubled that amount within a year of succeeding to the mastership and within five years nearly tripled it. Clearly the production rates of this printing office were the result of industrial capacity married to individual drive. Stansby was responsible for roughly 9% of the total London output during the period in question. That he could sustain production at this level without the benefit of exclusive patents meant that, among other things, he needed to develop relationships with the booksellers who served as publishers at this time. The title pages of the slightly more than one hundred books he printed from 1614 through 1618 bear the names of over thirty different booksellers, and only 3% of his output was printed without the evident involvement of another stationer. By contrast, Islip's title pages reveal only six names (other than the Company of Stationers who managed the law patent) on his handful of non-law publications, and only three of his title pages lack publisher information. The Star Chamber decrees of 1586 and 1615 that restricted the number of presses owned by individual printing houses in London to either one or two (save the King's Printer, who was not subject to these limits) were usually taken to apply only to the number of operating presses. Nonetheless these decrees along with periodic Company raids and crackdowns placed a tangible limit on the production capacity of each office. For an ambitious businessman like Stansby (in the 1615 decree he was allowed two presses), the only way to achieve his high levels of output was by making maximum use of his equipment. A brief look at how he managed his typographical resources under these circumstances, then, might provide useful insights. At the end of Windet's mastership, when the house was averaging less than 300 edition sheets per annum and the generic mix tended toward smallformat books of a religious nature, composition was roughly half black letter and half roman, and "Pica was twice as commonly used as english . . . [with] a significant use of long-primer, brevier and non pareil."27 27. Bland, "William Stansby and the Production of The Workes of Benjamin Jonson, 1615-1616," Library 6th ser. 20 (1998), 5-6. When Stansby hit his stride in 1614-1618 and was averaging 700 sheets per annum, less than 10% of the composition was black letter, with over 50% of the work done in english and only 42% in pica. He also tended toward publishing largeformat books, with 62% of his output imposed as folio, 28% quarto, 7% octavo and only 3% duodecimo. Stansby seems to have made full use of his ample stocks of english type for his extensive folio publication, supplementing it with pica only in two instances—in 1614 when he was printing the 244-sheet Purchas his Pilgrimage (STC 20506) and Walter Ralegh's 394-sheet History of the World (STC 20637), and again in 1617 when he printed an enlarged Purchas (294 sheets, STC 20507) along with the second edition of the History (STC 20638).28 28. Stansby's resources were further strained in the second instance because he was just completing the 257-sheet Workes of Ben Jonson and another edition of Richard Hooker's 129-sheet Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie, both in english type. In both cases he chose to set Purchas in pica (he set Ralegh's History in english), the only two times he employed that body for folio printing. When setting quarto, though, the balance shifts to the other extreme: 80% of his quarto output is in pica roman or black letter, with only 20% set in english. What little small-format printing Stansby did was a smattering of brevier and long and great primer. The rapid increase in production seems to have forced a number of changes from the earlier practices of Windet's mastership, including a focus on secular rather than religious publishing, "a shift to larger sizes of type and increased emphasis on composition over presswork."29 29. Bland, "Stansby," 5. Unlike that of most of his contemporaries, nearly all of Stansby's work was the result of commissions from other stationers (discussed further below), and he seems to have cultivated strong commercial relationships with publishers who fed a growing market for works of literature and history. Edward Griffin's career, while much shorter, resembles Stansby's in a number of important ways.30 30. Stationer records include two Edward Griffins. One was from Flintshire in Northeastern Wales, apprenticed to Henry Conneway in 1589, freed in 1596, and likely dead by 1606. The narrative that follows describes the second, younger, Edward Griffin. Like Stansby he was not from London but rather born in Denbigh, in northern Wales. After being freed in 1611 Griffin worked as a journeyman in the establishment of his former master Arnold Hatfield and succeeded to the business upon the latter's death the next year. The printing house Griffin acquired is often referred to as the Eliot's Court Press, a syndicate formed in 1584 from the printing materials of Henry Bynneman and located in the Old Bailey. Hatfield was the last of the four founding partners, and by the time he died Melchisidec Bradwood, who had joined the partners in 1602, seems to have withdrawn completely to Eton. To help with the firm, around 1613 Griffin may have contracted George Purslowe to provide supplementary production, although the STC offers "It is not clear whether [Purslowe] ever actually worked in the Old Bailey, or whether he may have borrowed a few ornaments from the Eliot's Court Press, or only contracted with the partners to share in printing some of their publications" (3.139). Upon assuming the Eliot's Court Press, Griffin seems to have hit the ground running. He started off quite busy, averaging between 600 and 800 sheets a year during the first four years of his mastership, and he maintained that level of production until his death in 1621. He also seems to have been a fairly law-abiding colleague, was admitted to livery in 1616, and received a one-half yeoman's share in the English Stock in 1618 and a full share the next year. With the established printing business apparently came a long list of client publishers; Griffin dealt with thirty-five different booksellers during the year 1614-1618, especially Nathaniel Butter (1499 sheets), Ralph Mab (500 sheets), William Bladen (226 sheets), and William Aspley (225 sheets). He printed many more titles of smaller size and format, with an output totaling nearly 170 separate works of which three-quarters were quarto format or smaller. Most of the publishers he dealt with had a preference for divinity, and during this period they commissioned him to print nearly 2700 edition sheets of religious titles, especially commentaries, works of instruction, and collections of sermons. Both Stansby and Griffin relied upon outside financing from prosperous stationers: Stansby maintained relations with booksellers who favored secular works, and Griffin exploited his connections with publishers specializing in religious texts. Large establishments such as the King's Printer, Islip, Stansby, and Griffin managed to attract the lion's share of the large-format and prestige printing, yet there was still enough business in the London market to support midsized outfits such as the one run by Thomas Snodham. Like Stansby and Griffin, after Snodham was freed in 1602 he remained with, and ultimately took over the business of, his former master Thomas East. He apparently had no valuable patents, although he occasionally printed music as an assignee of William Barley. During the last part of his career he served on a committee of stock-keepers who oversaw the management of the English Stock. In 1619 he also was asked by the Stationers' Company "to goe into Ireland to take the account" of the Irish Stock. As recompense the Company ordered that he "shall haue worke for 2 presses vntill his returne &amp; that the Company shall pay to his wife eu'ye saterday 4[pounds] if the worke amount to so much."31 31. Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1602 to 1640, ed. William A. Jackson (London: Bibliographical Society, 1957), 110. Snodham's output reflects the sorts of projects a mid-sized office could expect to attract. A little more than half of his production consisted of the religious material that was so popular at this time (about a quarter of this was sermon publication). His work came from a number of different sources, with the names of over thirty stationers appearing on the title pages of the books he printed during this period and approximately 10% of his output produced without an outside publisher. He may have worked for so many publishers because the commissions they gave him were so small. Over the five-year period of this study Snodham printed more than 130 separate titles with an average of a little less than seventeen edition sheets per title, 25% smaller than the average for the trade. As one might expect from such a collection of smaller works, a majority (57%) of his work was in quarto, with roughly 18% in folio, 18% octavo, and 7% duodecimo. He also managed to keep a fairly consistent rate of work in his house, with a solid schedule of smaller quarto and octavo jobs punctuated on occasion with large folio contracts.32 32. Three books in 1615 and three in 1616 comprised virtually all of Snodham's folio work. The remaining printers from this period reflect in one way or another the characteristics displayed by the largest establishments. Felix Kingston and Humphrey Lownes, both in the middle of successful careers, relied upon other booksellers for their financing and produced a slate of titles resembling that of Griffin (Kingston succeeded to the business of his father the printer John Kingston, a former apprentice of Richard Grafton; Lownes also collaborated frequently with his brother Matthew and married the daughter of the wealthy bookseller Thomas Man). Among the mid-sized houses that published for themselves as well as printed for others, the typical annual output consisted of much smaller volumes than that of printers who worked primarily for others. Younger stationers such as John Beale, Nicholas Okes, and George Purslowe printed small format works of divinity and literature for numerous booksellers: Beale's title pages include thirty-three different publishers, Okes's forty-three, and Purslowe's twenty-nine. These printers also received various Company subsidies to help them, with Beale commissioned to print Thomas Ashe's 486-sheet common law reference Le Primier Volume del Promptuarie (STC 840.5) and both Okes and Purslowe receiving sums from the Company Loan Book.33 33.

Craig Ferguson, The Loan Book of the Stationers' Company With a List of Transactions 1592-1692, Occasional Papers of the Bibliographical Society Number 4 (London: Bibliographical Society, 1989), 27, 28. The older printers dominate the bottom of table 4, indicating that either they had reached the point where their own more profitable publishing and bookselling ventures replaced printing, were nearing the end of their careers and withdrawing from the trade, or were flirting with failure (William White, for example, received £4 in 1611 from the Company Poor Book34 34. W. Craig Ferguson, "The Stationers' Company Poor Book, 1608-1700," Library 5th ser. 31 (1976), 50. ). 3. London Publishing McKenzie has observed that "There is still no satisfactory model of the economics of the London trade which usefully structures the dense and complex relationship between writers, printers, booksellers and readers during the hand-press period."35 35. "Printing and Publishing 1557-1700: Constraints on the London Book Trades," The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, Vol. 4, 553. As I have shown, by blending title-page and Stationers' Register data with evidence derived from a physical examination of surviving books, we can begin to sketch patterns of large-scale printinghouse activities. However, little financial documentation has survived the ravages of time and fire, and thus mapping the terrain of publishing activity in mid-Jacobean London is much more difficult. A title page might provide an imperfect glimpse at the business deals behind the book, but at best we can only use the collected data in broad strokes. During the five-year period in question, nearly 200 different names or organizations appear on title pages, over half of whom, according to title-page evidence, averaged less than 10 edition sheets per year. At the other end of the scale, the four establishments who controlled protected printing published 44% of the output during the same period. Table 5 details the twenty-two stationers who published or controlled the publication of at least 80 sheets a year, with the data broken down by total output, percent of output that is reprinted material, and subject classification. As was the case with most commerce in early modern England, monopolies played a large role in determining who printed what texts, and the four most productive entities dealt primarily with protected printing. Henry VIII awarded patents for printing on royal privilege, while Edward gave limitedperiod patents for individual titles. Elizabeth, however, greatly expanded the concept of patents by awarding lifetime rights to print whole classes of books. It was during her reign that individuals began acquiring sole rights to biblical publication, prayer books, law books, Latin and Greek printing, almanacs, and the like. Poorer stationers infringed on the growing number of restricted texts, resulting in a stream of small squabbles within the Company. At the request of the Stationers' Company, the Star Chamber in 1586 reorganized the jumbled patent situation and most of the discord died away. In 1603 the materials that became known as the English Stock were awarded to the Company in perpetuity, including primers, Psalters, psalms, almanacs, and prognostications. This collection of protected works earned a significant income, and when the Stationers bought Abergavenny House in 1611 for their new hall they did so "from the stocke of the [par]tners in the Privilege."36 36. Jackson, 50. A few years later in 1616 the English Stock was expanded and the Latin Stock formed; the latter was mainly concerned with the importation of Latin works from the continent and did very little domestic publishing.

There is significant overlap between the Stationers' Company and Adam Islip concerning the printing of law books. Over 2500 sheets of law publishing were controlled by the Stationers but printed by Islip.

Arnold Hunt, Giles Mandelbrote and Alison Shell (Winchester: St. Paul's Bibliographies, 1997), 27-54. By the middle of James I's reign, protected printing fell into four groups: the English Stock, the Latin Stock, the King's Printer material (see below), and the Ballad partners.38 38. A Company order in 1612 gave control of ballad printing to Edward Allde, Ralph Blower, George Eld, Simon Stafford (replaced in 1614 by George Purslowe), and William White. In 1620 the order was rescinded and the printing of ballads expanded a bit, but in 1624 the Company gave the exclusive rights to ballads to the partners Henry Gosson, John Grismand, Thomas Pavier, Cuthburt Wright, Edward Wright, and John Wright. See Jackson, xiii-xiv. The English Stock is the most important of these classes of texts, for it served the dual purpose of providing a steady return to those who could afford to invest in the stock (shares ranged from £50-200) while at the same time generating a pool of funds to assist poor stationers (a printer obtained the right to produce one edition by paying sixpence in the pound for the poor). Overall, the effect of these patents was to channel certain classes of books to a select group of stationers, the impact of which will become evident in the examination of individual printing houses that follows. The most important and potentially profitable printing establishment in Jacobean London was the King's Printer. For the first 100 years of printing in England, royal publishing was essentially on a contractual or commission basis, with the title "King's Printer" or "Queen's Printer" applied only to a particular work or set of works and their production undertaken by private printing houses. However, when Christopher Barker was awarded the post in 1577 it became recognized as a distinct office in which publication rights lay not with an individual house or title but with the office itself. Barker also purchased Bacon House in 1579 and established it as a separate printing office, a move that "led ultimately to the concept of a royal printing house under joint ownership."39 39. STC, 3.97. When Barker retired ten years later his deputies George Bishop and Ralph Newberry ran the institution. In 1593 Barker's eldest son Robert became a third deputy, eventually acquiring the position and its patents outright in 1600. Despite the broad variety of patents under its control, the office of the King's Printer experienced frequent financial difficulties. For a number of years Bonham Norton had dealings with Robert Barker, and at some point Norton and John Bill apparently became partners with Barker in the King's Printing Office, perhaps as part of an investment arrangement to pay for the so-called `Authorized Version' of the Bible in 1611. Early in the partnership things went smoothly, so smoothly in fact that Barker's eldest son Christopher and Norton's eldest daughter Sarah were married in 1615. However, Norton's aggressive and often unscrupulous activities soon resulted in Barker filing a suit in Chancery in 1618 to recover the office, an action that marked the beginning of a series of legal squabbles that would ultimately result in Norton's imprisonment in 1630 and subsequent retirement to Shropshire. Given the tangled business dealings of Barker, Bill, and Norton during this period, I am treating their individual and corporate efforts under the general heading of the King's Printer. The bulk of the patents acquired over the years and controlled by the King's Printer consisted of a monopoly on the printing of large- and smallformat Bibles, some prayer-books, and certain classes of official documents, of which the printing of Bibles consumed a majority of the office's time and resources. The large folio Royal Bible (containing the text of what is commonly called the King James Bible of 1611) could be a massive undertaking, for it was printed lectern size to be read in churches. The 1616 Royal Bible ran in 273 edition sheets (STC 2244), while one printed the next year required 366 (STC 2247),40 40. Each one of these volumes required in the neighborhood of 4.5 million ens of pica type. Using McKenzie's estimation that one worker could set around 72,000 ens per week ("Printers of the Mind: Some Notes on Bibliographical Theories and Printing-House Practices," Studies in Bibliography 22 [1969], 8) it would take one compositor over 62 weeks to set the type required for a Royal Bible. or a total of 639 edition sheets for two Bibles (by comparison, the total five-year output of Purfoot's house was 637 sheets). The slightly smaller Geneva Bibles, usually printed in quarto format for personal use, were nonetheless large undertakings in themselves, with the two editions of the work published in 1615 accounting for 138 edition sheets apiece (STC 2241, 2242). Barker rarely ventured beyond Bibles, proclamations, and prayers: on one occasion in 1614 he printed a sermon by Lancelot Andrewes, Bishop of Ely (STC 622); around the same time he printed a couple of broadsides (without his name on the title page), one outlining table manners (STC 23634.7), the other extolling the virtues of rosemary (STC 24844.7); in 1616 he printed some anti-Catholic tracts with John Bill (STC 6996, 6998). Other than these minor diversions, however, Barker seems to have focused solely on printing materials whose patents he controlled. When Bill and Norton began to take a more active role in the office, their first task seems to have been printing a large retrospective collection of the proclamations of Elizabeth (STC 7758.3, 7886 sqq.). Once this project was underway they commenced printing the same materials that took all of Barker's attention. They also, under the auspices of the Officina Nortoniana and the royal patent for printing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, printed a number of non-biblical controversial works and religious commentaries. Overall, the King's Printer accounted for 6069 edition sheets, or roughly 17% of all London printing from 1614-1618, with slightly over one-half of that total devoted to Bibles and the Book of Common Prayer, while almost three-quarters of the office's production consisted of reprints. The scope of this particular paper does not go beyond output and genre, but it is part of a larger study that includes a detailed examination of the year 1616 and from which we can catch a glimpse of how the business managed its workflow. During this year the printing house issued 740 edition sheets of biblical text: two 2° Bibles, one 4° Bible, an 8° New Testament, a 24° New Testament, and a 24° collection of five Old Testament books. The office used three different type bodies (nonpareil, brevier, pica) and two different faces (roman and black letter), giving it extraordinary flexibility when juggling the setting, proofing, and printing of the texts. For example, the two large folios (a Geneva and a Royal Bible) were both set in a pica body, although one employed a roman face while the other was black letter. In practical terms this meant that the books could be set simultaneously since they used separate typecases. The proofing and printing could also take place simultaneously, with a sheet of black letter text being proofed while the roman text was being machined and vice versa. Likewise the 8° and 24° New Testaments could be printed concurrently, for the former volume was set in brevier while the latter was set in nonpareil. Efficiency may have been of particular importance in 1616, for in addition to biblical texts, Barker and Bill teamed up to print King James's A Collection of His Majesties Workes (STC 14344), a 154-sheet folio that must have tied up the press's font of english body type for a stretch of time. For all works produced by the King's Printer in 1616, roughly two-thirds of the composition was in pica, one-third in brevier and english, with a small amount of nonpareil and great primer. While the King's Printer held the patent on large- and small-format Bibles, prayer books and the like, Adam Islip had upon Thomas Wight's death in 1605 bought the rights to print law books belonging to the English Stock. As a result, for much of his career he was engaged in producing multiple editions of a relatively small collection of titles. For example, between 1605 and 1629 (when the law patent expired and the rights passed to the assignees of John More), he published over thirty-two editions of the highly profitable law reports of Sir Edward Coke (averaging from forty to eighty edition sheets each, STC 5493-5526.5) as well as Coke's massive 1614 Booke of Entries (368 edition sheets, STC 5488), and large law compilations such as the 1618 folio A Collection of Sundrie Statutes (382 edition sheets, STC 9328). The exact value of the volumes printed by Islip is unknown—the order awarding him the right only noted he be charged "such reasonable rate &amp; alowance as shalbe judged to be sufficient . . . from tyme to tyme"41 41. Jackson, 16. — but evidence exists to indicate that the Company held these patents in high regard. For example, when the Stationers purchased the rights to Ashe's Le Primier Volume del Promptuarie they contracted to pay James Pagett of the Middle Temple £50 a year for six years.42 42. Jackson, 82. This work was not part of the 1605 lawbook purchase and was actually printed by John Beale. See note d to table 4, above. The Company also contributed financing to the production of these titles, especially during the first years after Islip's assumption of the printing rights. Between 10 November 1606 and 12 October 1607, Islip was awarded sums by the Company to help pay for the publication of an octavo edition of Christopher St. German's The Dialogue in English, Betweene a Doctor of Diuinities, and a Student in the Lawes of England (23 sheets, STC 21578), a folio edition of Coke's law digest La Size Part des Reports (46 sheets, STC 5509), an octavo edition of William Lambard's Eirenarcha: or the Office of the Iustices of the Peace (44 sheets, STC 15171), and what is likely a lost edition of one or both parts of William Fulbecke's A Parallel or Conference of the Civil Law, the Canon Law, and the Common Law of England (approximately twenty-three sheets for Part 1 and thirty-one sheets for Part 2, STC 11415 and 11415a).43 43. Jackson, 22, 24, 27, 28. The records concerning the last two titles include the size of the edition and the price allowed for paper, from which we can estimate that Islip was paid roughly £29 for the Lambard volume44 44. 5s./ream for 1200-1/2 copies. and perhaps £13 or £14 for Fulbecke's Parallel.45 45. 10s./heap for 800-1/2 copies. Ten years later Islip received nearly £300 for the Collection of Sundrie Statutes mentioned above,46 46. 5s. 8d./ream for 1250 copies. Jackson, 94. while in 1622 he and John Haviland were awarded an undetermined sum for printing Richard Montagu's Analecta Ecclesiasticarum Exercitationum (106 sheets, STC 18029). Of course, the individual books themselves had value, and care was taken to prevent those who had the right to produce them from printing a few extra copies for private sale. In 1627 the Stationers' Court issued an edict calling for strict accounting of the paper supplied for each work so that the Company could check for surreptitious extra copies by comparing the amount of material consumed with the number of books printed. Islip himself testified in 1622 that he paid each workman 4d a title "in liewe of a Copie due to them by the Custome of the Companie,"47 47. Jackson, 148. and was compensated for his expense. Islip was also a member of the ill-fated Irish Stock when it was created in 1618. During the 1614-1618 period, Islip printed a little over 3750 edition sheets, or roughly 10% of the total London production. Of these works, twothirds were legal volumes, 15% were education-related (mainly a couple of French vocational works and John Rider's Latin-English dictionary, STC 21034), 10% history (a translation of Pierre d'Avity's The Estates, Empires &amp; Principallities of the World, STC 988), 8% religion (an annotated New Testament), and a smattering of literary publishing. Indeed, with the exception of the five large volumes parenthetically mentioned, almost everything Islip printed during this period derived from the lawbook patent and the English Stock. When compared with the London trade in general, Islip printed half of all material classified under Law and Politics, with the only significant work of law not printed by Islip being Ashe's Le Primier Volume (printed by John Beale). The overwhelming emphasis on large lawbooks is reflected in the size and format of Islip's output as well. While the average size of a work printed in London during this time was a little more than twenty-one sheets (see above), over the same period Islip averaged eighty-five sheets per title. He also printed mainly folio volumes, with 71% of his output printed in that format, 19% quarto, 9% octavo, and the remaining 1% contained in a pair of small duodecimos. After the lawbook patent expired, Islip remained an active and important member of the Stationers' Company, serving as warden and master. He died in the fall of 1638. Beyond the London trade a smaller market for specialized books existed at the two universities. A charter in 1534 gave Cambridge University the right to erect a press for its own use, although it wasn't until 1583 that Thomas Thomas set up a house and began printing books for the local market. The London Stationers attempted to crush what they viewed as an infringement on their prerogative, and although a Star Chamber decree in 1586 recognized the right of the university to maintain one press, disagreements continued well into the seventeenth century. John Legat was wellconnected within the Company, apprenticing with Christopher Barker and moving to Cambridge, first as the assistant and then in 1588 the successor to Thomas, who was also his father-in-law. Legat ran the Cambridge office for twenty-two years before moving his enterprise to London around 1610, where he operated until his death in 1620. Both Thomas and Legat were independent businessmen who ran a house licensed by the university but not owned by it. Thus when Legat moved to the larger London market he took all his equipment and materials with him, leaving his successor in rather bad straits.48 48. David McKitterick, A History of Cambridge University Press, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992). See especially 1.109-135. With the exception of Nicholas Okes, Legat is the only master printer listed of the period not to be liveried. The Stationers had been a livery Company since 1560, and this gave them certain rights in city and parliamentary governance. Individual stationers called to livery could vote in Company and city elections as well as stand for office, and it also made one eligible to purchase shares in the English Stock. A stationer who was called to livery and refused could be fined,49 49. The standard fine for refusal was 40 shillings, while the fee for election was £20. although there is no record of Legat being either called or fined. As one might expect from a stationer associated with the Cambridge University (even after the move to London he continued to call himself "Printer to the University" and to use the Cambridge device),50 50. McKerrow, Dictionary, 173. a significant amount of Legat's output was aimed at the academic and intellectual market; roughly 32% of his output was informational, with the bulk of that total resulting from a single reprint of the 233-sheet folio Praxis Medicinae Universalis in 1617 (STC 25865). The remainder of his production was religious (58%), supplemented by a smattering of literature (6%) and history (4%). Almost all of Legat's religious output consisted of large-format volumes of commentary or instruction by divines like William Perkins, with 58% imposed in folio and 29% in quarto. Consequently the average size of his titles is twice that of the trade in general—over forty-one edition sheets per work. He died in 1620 and his son, also named John, took over the business. Ranking publishers by total output clearly displays the primacy of protected printing. If we view publishing activity according to specific types of works being produced, however, certain other patterns begin to emerge. In some areas a handful of concerns dominated the trade, for example in Law and Politics where the Stationers' Company (3071 sheets) and Islip (2550 sheets) were responsible for the bulk of the output. Likewise the King's Printing House controlled the printing of Official Documents while the Stationers, with the Almanac patent, determined who printed most extant Ephemera. In other areas the work is much more dispersed. Legat and Islip published a significant amount of works of Information, but eleven others published at least 100 edition sheets from 1614-1618 (see table 6). Even Table 6. London information publishing by output, 1614-1618 Publisher Edition sheets John Legat 683 Thomas Adams 619 Adam Islip 572 Stationers 329 William &amp; Isaac Jaggard 329 Roger Jackson 268 Thomas &amp; Jonas Man 144 John Tapp 136 John Browne 133 Nicholas Okes 124 Richard Field 123 John Marriot 117 Matthew Lownes 114 more diverse is literary publishing, where 17 stationers published at least 100 edition sheets during the period of this study (see table 7). History is dominated by Walter Burre, whose two editions of Walter Ralegh's History of the World in 1614 and 1617 (STC 20637 and 20638, 394 sheets each) place Table 7.

Fewer than forty stationers in all can be identified as working with this subject area. Finally, the more complex area of religious publication is a mixture of dominance and diversity. The King's Printing House controlled the printing of most Bibles and all Books of Common Prayer (although Islip and Adams did publish some New Testaments), while the Stationers determined Psalm printing; these works constituted about one-quarter of the total religious publishing during this time. A slightly larger group marketed devotional works, where five concerns issued half the output—John Budge (170), Nicholas Bourne (155), Sam &amp; Joyce Macham (139), the Stationers' Company (115), and the joint venture of Ralph Mab, George Edwards and Jacob Bloome (114). Likewise, three-quarters of the controversial works were published by the King's Printing House (740), Officina Nortoniana (656), Matthew Lownes (283), William Barrett (196), Nathaniel Butter (124), and Henry Fetherstone (122). Eleven different establishments contributed to the publication of religious instruction (see table 8), while even more worked with commentary (see table 9). Sermon publishing is a little more difficult to outline. While two groups of stationers stand out from the rest—Ralph Mab, George Edwards and Table 8.

The top five sermon publishers controlled approximately one-third of the output, the next fourteen controlled another third, and the remaining 75+ the final third. Compare this with Commentary (36 publishers), Controversial (35 publishers), Devotional (59 publishers), and Instructional (73 publishers). 4. Conclusions The snapshot of mid-Jacobean printing and publishing revealed above is just that—a single frame extracted from the larger movie that is early modern London. Within the five-year period of this study certain general observations emerge: the most productive printing houses maintained their high levels of activity either through the acquisition of protected titles or by aggressively pursuing work as trade printers; religious works constituted the single most important area of publishing, and a large number of stationers were involved in producing the non-protected segment of the field, especially sermons and books of religious devotion and instruction; literary and informational titles were also an important segment of non-protected printing, with perhaps two-thirds of the stationers we can identify as publishers involved with this trade; other areas, such as history and works of religious commentary and controversy attracted relatively few stationers interested in publishing; different subjects bring with them certain expectations regarding format, especially volumes of history, law, and works of religious commentary and controversy. The snapshot also prompts many questions. How does the Stansby house compare with other large printing offices from different periods? How did the King's Printing House change over time? What do the shifts in the kind and number of books being published tell us about the dynamics of early modern English culture? How do various stationers from different times negotiate the business continuum between trade-printing and self-publishing? How does the role of the printer within the trade change over the decades? In what ways do influential booksellers like Thomas Adams, Henry Fetherstone, and Thomas Man resemble or differ from earlier booksellers such as William Bonham, Richard Grafton, John Rastell, and Richard Tottell? Such questions require further context; thus the next step in exploring the London book trade through quantitative analysis should involve expanding the chronological as well as evidentiary scope of the data collection. In practical terms this means adding typographical data (composition totals as well as face and body choices), design characteristics (headline structure, the presence of ruled compartments and marginal notes) and paratextual evidence (dedications, epistles, errata). As well some of the editorial features of the STC (inherited by the ESTC) need to be addressed, the most important being the decision by the original editors to blur the distinction between edition, state, issue, and variant. Some method of representing shared printing and publishing is needed, perhaps a standard authority table51 51. A possible authority file is already underway at the University of Birmingham. The British Book Trade Index, directed by Maureen Bell, seeks to compile in database form "brief biographical and trade details of all those who worked in the English and Welsh book trades before 1852" ({http://www.bbti.bham.ac.uk}). The Library of Congress also maintains a set of authority files ({http://authorities.loc.gov}). through which we can cross-reference printer, publisher, and a numeric estimate of their proportional responsibility for each item. Finally this evidence must be compiled for the entire STC period. One hundred years and more have passed since the British Museum published its General Catalogue of Printed Books, and in that time a number of union and short-title catalogues, biographical dictionaries, and documentary transcription surrounding early printing and publishing have emerged. More recently projects such as the ESTC and EEBO as well as institutional OPACs have begun creating digital resources available across computer networks. I hope the preceding essay has demonstrated how these diverse materials can be synthesized in ways that reveal new insights into book history while avoiding most of the obvious phantoms, chimeras, and mirages of statistical misapplication and misinterpretation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHO EDITED FIELDING'S JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE TO LISBON (1755)? THE CASE FOR ARTHUR MURPHY AND A NEW FIELDING ESSAY by Martin C. Battestin IN a masterly essay on the authority of the two versions of the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon that were published posthumously in 1755, the late Hugh Amory came close to solving the most perplexing textual problem in Fielding studies—as close, that is, as bibliographical analysis and circumstantial evidence allow.1 1. See Hugh Amory, "The Authority of the Two Versions of Fielding's Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon," in The Culture of the Book: Essays from Two Hemispheres in Honour of Wallace Kirsop, ed. David Garrioch, Harold Love, Brian McMullin, Ian Morrison, and Meredith Sherlock (Melbourne: Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand, 1999), 182-200. Two distinct editions were printed by William Strahan in January 1755: the "Francis" version (so-called after the name of the innkeeper whom Fielding satirizes), which, though printed first, was published later; and the "Humphrys" version (the name under which Mrs. Francis's identity is hidden in the second edition), which, though printed later, was published first. The two versions were first noticed by Austin Dobson in 1883;2 2. Austin Dobson, Fielding (London and New York: Macmillan, 1883), p. 168 n. a generation later, further analysis was undertaken by a trio of Fielding scholars—F. S. Dickson, J. P. de Castro, and Wilbur Cross, Fielding's biographer—who were joined by the eminent bibliographer A. W. Pollard.3 3. Frederick S. Dickson, "The Early Editions of Fielding's `Voyage to Lisbon,' " The Library, 3rd ser., 8 (1917), pp. 24-35; J. Paul de Castro, "Henry Fielding's Last Voyage," ibid., pp. 145-159; A. W. Pollard, "The Two 1755 Editions of Fielding's `Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon,' " ibid., pp. 160-162; and Wilbur L. Cross, The History of Henry Fielding (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1918), 3 vols., iii. 83-92. In his biography Cross accounted for the two versions by attributing the "Humphrys" to the unfortunate, if well intentioned, meddling of Fielding's blind half-brother. John Fielding, he supposed, having become aware of certain potentially offensive passages in the first edition, attempted to purge them from the second while adding revisions of his own, and so Mrs. Francis became Mrs. Humphrys. Until the dawn of the new century, Cross's theory prevailed among Fielding scholars, myself included—though the thought that the work had been edited by a blind man remained troublesome. Even now, however—though Amory refuted the notion of editorial meddling in "Humphrys" by arguing, cogently, that both versions descend directly from Fielding's heavily revised autograph manuscript—he preferred to regard John as editor of the work, not so much meddling as deciding which of his brother's words, phrases, passages—Fielding's first thoughts or his second ones—would be preserved. Referring to a statement in the Dedication, Amory illustrates by a metaphor from cinema the process that resulted in the two texts: Neither "Francis" nor "Humphrys" . . . is what "came from the hands of the author", entirely. Rather, . . . they represent two editorial views of the composition of a perplexed autograph manuscript—two clippings of the unedited "rushes" of the same film, so to speak—by Andrew Millar, who owned the copyright, and by John Fielding, as the chief representative of Fielding's "friends". (p. 183) Perhaps Amory was right in seeing John behind the texts as we have them; there can be no certainty in the matter. But there are reasons—some of them quite compelling, I believe—why we might prefer another candidate: namely, Arthur Murphy. The case for Murphy rests principally on the question of who wrote the "Dedication to the Public" that is prefixed to both the "Francis" and the "Humphrys" versions. It reads as follows: YOUR candour is desired on the perusal of the following sheets, as they are the product of a genius that has long been your delight and entertainment. It must be acknowledged that a lamp almost burnt out does not give so steady and uniform a light, as when it blazes in full vigour; but yet it is well known that, by its wavering, as if struggling against its own dissolution, it sometimes darts a ray as bright as ever. In like manner, a strong and lively genius will, in its last struggles, sometimes mount aloft, and throw forth the most striking marks of its original lustre. Wherever these are to be found, do you, the genuine patrons of extraordinary capacities, be as liberal in your applauses of him who is now no more, as you were of him whilst he was yet amongst you. And, on the other hand, if in this little work there should appear any traces of a weaken'd and decay'd life, let your own imaginations place before your eyes a true picture, in that of a hand trembling in almost its latest hour, of a body emaciated with pains, yet struggling for your entertainment; and let this affecting picture open each tender heart, and call forth a melting tear, to blot out whatever failings may be found in a work begun in pain, and finished almost at the same period with life. It was thought proper, by the friends of the deceased, that this little piece should come into your hands as it came from the hands of the author; it being judged that you would be better pleased to have an opportunity of observing the faintest traces of a genius you have long admired, than have it patch'd by a different hand; by which means the marks of its true author might have been effac'd. That the success of this last written, tho' first published volume, of the author's posthumous pieces, may be attended with some convenience to those innocents he hath left behind, will, no doubt be a motive to encourage its circulation through the kingdom, which will engage every future genius to exert itself for your pleasure. The principles and spirit which breathe in every line of the small fragment begun in answer to Lord Bolingbroke will unquestionably be a sufficient apology for its publication, altho' vital strength was wanting to finish a work so happily begun and so well designed. In 1916 de Castro, who noticed a "similarity of rythym [sic] and diction" between the prose of the Dedication and that of Murphy's "Essay on the Life and Genius" of Fielding prefixed to his edition of the Works (1762), first proposed Murphy's authorship in a letter to Dickson, who found merit in the "sage suggestion," as did Cross,4 4. See Dickson, p. 29, and Cross, iii. 88. and indeed every editor of the Journal since then.5 5. In his letter to Dickson, dated 14 October 1916, de Castro from his chambers at the Temple, wrote: I am very glad to hear that you will undertake an account of the Chronology of the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon for N. &amp; Q. I am sure it will be most useful, and may perhaps lead to a discussion. I am of opinion that the Dedication was written by Arthur Murphy. Read the Dedication through and then turn to his "Life &amp; Genius of Henry Fielding" and I think you will be struck by a similarity of rythym [sic] and diction, and also that the `hath' occurs in both though sparingly. If that be so one can understand better why Millar should have turned to him when requiring an editor for the "Complete" Works. The Dedication has always seemed to me an excellent piece of English and in a style not unfamiliar to me, but it is only recently that I fancied I had run its author to earth. (Frederick S. Dickson Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscripts Library, Yale University) But there is more than the similarity of rhythm and diction to link the Dedication to Murphy's essay. In his remarks on Fielding's state of health and its damaging effects on the literary quality of the Journal, and in his praise of Fielding's defense of religion in the "Fragment" of an answer to Bolingbroke appended to the Journal, there are striking correspondences of thought and metaphor. Consider, for example, the following parallels: (1) The dedicator begins by appealing to the reader's "candour" (in the sense of fairness, kindliness [OED 3-4]) to overlook the defects of the work. Murphy, moving from his account of the Journal to reflect on Fielding's character flaws and physical infirmities, similarly appeals to "the candid reader", and "every candid mind."6 6. Fielding's Works, ed. Arthur Murphy, 4 vols. (1762) 4°, i. 46-47. References are to this edition. (2) The dedicator reminds the reader of the obligation he owes to Fielding: "a genius that has long been your delight and entertainment." Murphy, after referring to the generosity of John Fielding and Ralph Allen in providing for Fielding's children, similarly reminds the reader that their father was "the writer, whose works have afforded such exquisite entertainment" (p. 46). (3) Especially striking, however, is the metaphor the dedicator develops in the opening paragraph. He describes the "genius" of the author, "struggling" against the debilitating effects of a fatal illness, in terms of "a lamp almost burnt out" giving off a "light . . . wavering" instead of "blaz[ing]" as before, yet, even so, at times "dart[ing] a ray as bright as ever." In the "Essay," Murphy employs this same metaphor as he evokes an image of Fielding struggling against illness, trying to make the Journal a work worthy of the "genius" he once had: "Even in this distressful condition, his imagination still continued making its strongest efforts to display itself; and the last gleams of his wit and humour faintly sparkled in the account he left behind him of his voyage" (p. 46). (4) In his second paragraph, the dedicator stresses the ruined state of Fielding's health at the time he wrote the work, wherein the reader will find "traces of a weaken'd and decay'd life," and can imagine "a true picture, in that of a hand trembling in almost its latest hour, of a body emaciated with pains, yet struggling for your entertainment." The Journal, he concludes, is "a work begun in pain, and finished almost at the same period with life." Murphy presents the same picture: "our author's whole frame of body was so entirely shattered by continual inroads of complicated disorders, and the incessant fatigue of business in his office [as magistrate]" that he was ordered to leave England for his health. "In this his last sketch," Murphy concludes, ` "he puts us in mind of a person, under sentence of death, jesting on the scaffold; for his strength was now quite exhausted; and in about two months after his arrival at Lisbon, he yielded his last breath" (pp. 45-46). brother, Sir John Fielding" (pp. 48-49). (5) In his final paragraph the dedicator commends "the principles and spirit," as well as the design, of the "Fragment of a Comment on Bolingbroke's Essays," Fielding's unfinished answer to the attack on religion in the philosopher's posthumous Works (1754). So, too, in the penultimate paragraph of his "Essay" Murphy commends Fielding's principles: "The interests of virtue and religion he never betrayed; the former is amiably enforced in his works; and, for the defence of the latter, he had projected a laborious answer to the posthumous philosophy of Bolingbroke; and the preparation he had made for it of long extracts and arguments from the fathers and the most eminent writers of controversy, is still extant in the hands of his brother, Sir John Fielding" (pp. 48-49). If Murphy wrote the Dedication, as these parallel passages suggest he did, he would also be the most likely person for Millar to have employed as editor of the Journal. As such, as de Castro saw, their collaboration in this project would lead to the agreement between them, announced in May 1759, that resulted in the production of Fielding's Works (1762).7 7. In the London Chronicle (17-19, 24 May 1759) Millar published proposals for a fivevolume subscription edition of Fielding's Works "with Annotations upon such Passages as require Illustration; and an Essay on the Life and Genius of the Author. By Arthur Murphy, of Lincoln's Inn, Esq." There, in his "Essay," Murphy describes their relationship, referring to Millar as "the Proprietor" of the work and to himself as "the Editor," assuring readers that it was only "after communicating with the ablest and best of the Author's friends" that he had proceeded in the selection of materials. As his acknowledgments make clear, the most helpful of those friends, besides of course Millar himself, was John Fielding. In the present case of the Journal, the evidence of the Dedication points to a similar collaboration between these three: John, who possessed his brother's manuscript and who transferred it to Millar in partial payment of the enormous debt Fielding owed him (£1,892),8 8. See Hugh Amory, "Andrew Millar and the First Recension of Fielding's Works (1762)," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society 8 (1981), p. 63; and M. C. with R. R. Battestin, Henry Fielding: A Life (London and New York: Routledge 1989), pp. 581 and 683 n. 364. and Murphy, a professional writer and friend of Fielding, whom Millar employed to edit the heavily revised manuscript. Amory, it should be said, could not accept the possibility that Murphy had anything to do with the Journal. Referring to the generally held view that Murphy may have been the author of the Dedication, he offered the following objections: The identification of the dedicator rests chiefly (I believe solely) on an allusion to the Dedication in Murphy's "Essay", prefixed to Fielding's 1762 Works (vol. 1, p. 46, 4to). Murphy had no personal acquaintance with Fielding or his family, pace Cross (History, vol. 3, p. 85; but see The Correspondence of Henry and Sarah Fielding, ed. Martin C. Battestin and Clive T. Probyn, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1993, p. 172). He seems a priori an unlikely candidate to dedicate our author's dying legacy—John or Sarah Fielding, James Harris, George Lyttelton, Ralph Allen, or David Garrick are equally if not more eligible—and the allusion in itself proves little enough. (p. 199 n. 7) But the reasons Amory offers for doubting Murphy's involvement in the edition clearly misrepresent the facts of the matter. As we have seen, the case for Murphy's authorship of the Dedication rests on internal evidence far more persuasive than what a mere "allusion" to it in the "Essay" could possibly amount to. What is more, the assertion that Murphy was not personally known to Fielding is mistaken, whatever his sister may have thought.9 9. Amory refers to Sarah Fielding's letter to James Harris of 4 March 1762, in which, shocked at learning that Millar had engaged Murphy rather than Harris to write the introductory "Essay" to Fielding's Works, she declared that Murphy "knew little or nothing of my Brother" and that he "had his strange Information from Bow-Street"—i.e. from John Fielding. But it was Sarah, not Murphy, who knew little of Fielding's affairs during the last years of his life. After his marriage to Mary Daniel in November 1747 she left his household and soon became one of the coterie of clever women who circled round Richardson. By June 1754 she was residing at Bath, too ill to attend Fielding as he prepared to leave for Lisbon; from that time on she remained at Bath (or Bathwick or Walcot), far from the literary life of London. Indeed she was so ill informed in this regard that she was unaware of Murphy's appointment as editor of the Works until a month before publication, even though Millar had announced the fact nearly three years earlier in the London Chronicle (17-19 May 1759). Forty years later, HF's son, the Revd. Allen Fielding, echoed his aunt's words when, replying to an inquiry of the Dorset antiquarian Thomas Rackett, he assured him that "Murphy himself knew nothing of my father" (Correspondence, p. 190). But Allen himself, who was two months old when his father embarked for Lisbon, could have known nothing of the matter. Though Bertrand Goldgar has discredited the view that Murphy began his literary career by assisting Fielding with The Covent-Garden Journal,10 10. The Covent-Garden Journal and A Plan of the Universal Register-Office, ed. Bertrand A. Goldgar (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1988), p. xxxi and n. 2. Fielding's friendship with Murphy—and with Murphy's friend Christopher Smart—had certainly formed by the autumn of 1752, when they all three took sides with Garrick and the troupe at Drury Lane in a literary and theatrical "war" provoked by the fulminations of Dr. John Hill, who in the London Daily Advertiser supported the inane entertainments of John Rich at Covent Garden.11 11. See Battestins, Life, pp. 561-564. During this period Fielding had no more vocal admirer in London than Murphy. As Fielding was writing the last numbers of The Covent-Garden Journal, Murphy took over authorship of The Craftsman on 28 October 1752, giving it the subtitle Gray's-Inn Journal and, taking Fielding's paper as his model, transformed The Craftsman from a partisan political organ into a forum for the witty discussion of literature and manners. Beginning with the numbers for 11 and 18 November 1752, when he paid Fielding the compliment of appropriating for his own journal Fielding's feature of the "Court of Censorial Enquiry," and in a leader chose Fielding to represent "those whose Writings are likely to live," Murphy, throughout the two-year run of The Gray's-Inn Journal, would extol his idol, "the immortal author of Jonathan Wild, Joseph Andrews, and Tom Jones" (9 December).12 12. References to issues of The Craftsman; or, Gray's-Inn Journal from 21 October to 30 December 1752, which Murphy wrote under the pseudonym "Joseph D'Anvers, Esq;" are to the unique run of the paper for the period 7 October 1749-30 December 1752 in the John Dawson Collection, Archives Department, Rose Lipman Library, Hackney Public Library. Unless otherwise noted, references to the Gray's-Inn Journal, written by Murphy as "Charles Ranger, Esq;" from January 1753 to the final issue, No. 104 of 12 October 1754 [for No. 52 of 21 September 1754 of the original folio], will be to the facsimile of the 1756 reprint, 2 vols., ed. Donald D. Eddy (New York and London: Garland Publishing, 1979). Compliments to Fielding also occur in the number for 3 February 175[3] ("Fielding will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance" [i. 107]); 3 March 1753 ("the Stile of Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones" [i. 131]); 10 March 1753 ("Mr. Justice Fielding" [i. 142]); 7 July 1753 ("the inimitable Mr. Fielding . . . a Man of exquisite Humour" [i. 243]); 27 April 1754 ("soothed . . . by reading Fielding's Joseph Andrews" [ii. 179]); 8 June 1754 (Fielding will be elected to Parnassus [ii. 215-216]); 17 August 1754 (Preface to Joseph Andrews on "Ridicule" [ii. 278]); 24 August 1754 ("Burlesque" illustrated by Parson Adams and a note to Tom Thumb [ii. 284-285]). Indeed, in a letter dated 21 December but published later with Smart's satire The Hilliad (February 1753), Murphy paid Fielding one of the handsomest tributes he ever received: Through all Mr. Fielding's inimitable comic Romances, we perceive no such thing as personal malice, no private character dragged into light; but every stroke is copied from the volume which nature has unfolded to him; every scene of life is by him represented in its natural colours, and every species of folly or humour is ridiculed with the most exquisite touches. A genius like this is perhaps more useful to mankind, than any class of writers; he serves to dispel all gloom from our minds, to work off our ill-humours by the gay sensations excited by a well directed pleasantry, and in a vein of mirth he leads his readers into the knowledge of human nature; the most useful and pleasing science we can apply to.13 13. In C. Smart, The Hilliad: an Epic Poem (1753), p. viii. Concluding his Introduction to the Wesleyan Edition of The CoventGarden Journal, Goldgar remarks on Murphy's admiration for Fielding as a journalist as well as novelist. In The Gray's-Inn Journal (30 December 1752) —after puffing Fielding's plan (abortive as it proved) to publish a translation of Lucian14 14. In a dream vision Murphy meets the author: "I told Lucian, that the excellent Mr. Fielding has promised us a Translation of his Performances into the English Tongue, which gave the old Grecian great Pleasure, as he did not doubt but the Author of Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones would give the whole [t]he true Spirit of Humour." —Murphy freely acknowledged his debt to Fielding's periodical while regretting Fielding's decision, announced in the final number, not "to hold any further Correspondence with the gayer Muses."15 15. Covent-Garden Journal, p. 380. Goldgar, who quotes the passage in full, observes: "These comments not only give us a glimpse of Murphy's earliest views of Fielding; they also have the air already of a biographer, of reflections by an admirer on a writer whose major accomplishments are over."16 16. Goldgar, p. liv. He notes in Murphy's words "the tone of a final tribute," of regret at witnessing the twilight of Fielding's genius. Later this would also be the tone, though darker, that one hears in the Dedication to the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon and in Murphy's "Essay." Considering the correspondences between the manner in which the dedicator and Murphy treat the circumstances in which Fielding wrote the Journal and the effect they had on his performance, and considering the esteem in which Murphy held Fielding as friend and author, Amory's last objection—that Murphy "seems a priori an unlikely candidate to dedicate our author's dying legacy"—seems frivolous. His own favored candidates for Millar's choice of an editor of the heavily revised manuscript Fielding left behind are patently unsuitable. John, a blind man, would have been lost among a textual thicket of false starts, cancellations, and second thoughts scrawled between the lines and in the margins. There is no reason to suppose Sarah, at Bath, knew anything of Millar's plans for the work; or to think that Harris at Salisbury, or Lyttelton at Hagley Park, or Ralph Allen at Prior Park—or Garrick, in the midst of the theatrical season at Drury Lane— would have offered themselves to undertake such a difficult job of editing even if Millar or John had presumed to propose it. Murphy, on the other hand, was at the beginning of a long and prolific career as a professional writer; and, burdened with a debt of £300, he needed money. On 21 September 1754, with the fifty-second number,17 17. In the 1756 reprint, this final issue of the paper became No. 104 and is dated 12 October 1754. Fielding died in Lisbon on 8 October, but his death was not known in London until announced in the Public Advertiser on 28 October; indeed, since that paper on 16 October had reported that Fielding was "surprisingly recovered," the news would have been unexpected. (See Battestins, Life, p. 605.) he brought The Gray's-Inn Journal to a close. Little more than a fortnight later, Fielding died in Lisbon. Murphy engaged himself to act for a season at Covent Garden; but though he met with success, even as late as the following April it had not been enough to satisfy his creditors.18 18. See Howard Hunter Dunbar, The Dramatic Career of Arthur Murphy (New York: Modern Language Association of America; London: Oxford University Press, 1946), pp. 8-11. The question of who edited the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon, that last sad testament of Fielding's life, cannot be answered with certainty. But, clearly, de Castro's hunch was right: there is a case to be made for Arthur Murphy. Murphy, who was twenty years Fielding's junior, had taken him as his model in his début as an author. In a sense he was Fielding's protégé; and there is reason to believe that in the early days of the Gray's-Inn Journal—when Fielding had the time and his health allowed—he returned the favor of the public adulation Murphy bestowed on him by assisting him as a contributor. In the leader that concluded the run of the journal, Murphy modestly apologized to his readers for the inadequacies he felt as "so young a Writer" and graciously expressed his thanks to certain unnamed contributors—one of whom is the subject of the following paragraph: A Paper upon what may be called Imitation in Writing, and an Essay towards fixing the Standard of modern Criticism, together with some occasional Strokes of Humour in the true Intelligence,19 19. A regular feature of Murphy's journal was a section called "True Intelligence," which consisted of brief "Articles of News," chiefly from the coffee-houses and theaters, and often submitted by contributors. were the Contributions of another ingenious Gentleman, whose Friendship, I am convinced, would have inclined him to do something towards raising the Estimation of this Paper much higher, had not Avocations of more Consequence to himself and the Public, demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way.20 20. Quoted from the original issue. The text is the same in the 1756 reprint (ii. 336) except for the addition of "the" before "fixing" in the first sentence. On the face of it, the "ingenious Gentleman" whom Murphy acknowledges as having contributed two essays and "some occasional Strokes of Humour" in the department of his journal called "True Intelligence," could be Fielding—or any other witty author. The pool of possible candidates narrows, however, when Murphy represents him as a particularly gifted writer, one whose contributions were capable of "raising the Estimation of this Paper much higher." And the pool narrows farther still when we are told that he is Murphy's good friend, one who would have wished to do more to help the paper succeed had not matters "of more Consequence" not only to "himself," but also to "the Public, demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way." On all counts, Fielding fits this profile perfectly. Indeed, Murphy's last sentence repeats Fielding's own explanation, in the final number of The Covent-Garden Journal (25 November 1752), as to why he chose to follow his friends' advice and "lay down" his paper: "that I might employ my Pen much more to the Honour of myself, and to the Good of the Public" (p. 380). At the time he wrote these words, Fielding had been serving the public for four years as principal magistrate of the metropolis, and was engaged in drafting an ambitious treatise designed to alleviate a serious social problem: his Proposal for Making an Effectual Provision for the Poor would be published on 29 January 1753. That Fielding was in fact the "ingenious Gentleman" who contributed the two leaders to which Murphy refers, should be evident from the articles themselves: the one—No. 16 (3 February 1752 [for 1753]—a "Paper" entitled in the list of Contents, "On Imitation in Writing"; the other—No. 27 (21 April 1753)—an "Essay" entitled "On the Standards of modern Criticism." I. On Imitation in Writing This "Paper," as Murphy calls it, was not written by Fielding, but by Murphy in the guise of Charles Ranger, Esq, author of The Gray's-Inn Journal. The credit for it, however, goes to the "ingenious Gentleman" because not only the topic in general, but, for much of the paper, the specific treatment of the topic and the phrasing was his—that is, was Fielding's, as will be seen. Murphy, who throughout the journal reminds readers that he is a mere tyro in the writing profession, opens the paper with a conversation between Ranger and Mr. Candid, an older, wiser man who warns that the fame the young journalist enjoys as a new writer will, with familiarity, turn to indifference. This advice leads Ranger "to throw together a few Reflections upon what may be term'd Novelty in Writing" (i. 106). These reflections, however, are not so much Murphy's as they are, essentially, Fielding's: they are borrowed without open acknowledgment—though, by his allusions to Fielding, Murphy winks at his friend and source—from the introductory essay to Book XII of Tom Jones: "Shewing what is to be deemed Plagiarism in a modern Author, and what is to be considered lawful Prize." The debt is most obvious in the paragraphs at the beginning and end of Murphy's remarks on the topic of literary imitation, where Fielding is first complimented as the model for aspiring comic novelists, and later (implicitly) invoked as Ranger's "humourous Acquaintance," with whom plagiarism is a favorite subject. The relevant passages are these: I think then that judicious Imitation either of antient or modern Standards ought not to be stigmatised as Larceny in an Author. He is certainly at Liberty to draw from any excellent Model, whom he chuses to copy; and that without incurring the ignominious Appellations of a Plagiary or Transcriber. Universal Custom will justify the Practice. All the imitative Arts may be more particularly termed so, as the several Masters have frequently work'd after a Plan, that was first sketched out by some eminent Example. The same Design, diversified indeed with newer Decorations, as Genius or Invention prompted, may be traced in the different Performances of subsequent Artists; sometimes extended by the Addition of Circumstances, which naturally grew out of the Work; or contracted, by pruning the luxuriant Branches, and retrenching what appeared superfluous and unnecessary. This general and distant Imitation, it will be readily owned, is allowable and just; is what cannot perhaps be easily avoided, where the Subject is treated with Propriety, and according to the Rules of Art. Thus Virgil followed Homer; thus Addison will always be regarded as the Pattern either of grave, or of humourous Speculation; and Fielding will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance. (i. 106-107) * * * * * An humourous Acquaintance, who often talks to me on this head, lays it down as an indisputable Principle, that Composition is only the Art of Stealing wisely: And indeed, as Matters are usually managed by our worthy Fraternity of Authors, if we strike out the last Word, his definition is perfectly unexceptionable. I make then no Scruple to declare, that I look on all the Wit, and all the Humour in antient or modern Languages, as good and lawful Prize; and that I shall freely convert them to my own Use, and the Public Emolument. . . . (i. 109)21 21. With Murphy's last sentence in the quotation, cf. Fielding: "nor shall I ever scruple to take to my self any Passage which I shall find in an ancient Author to my Purpose, without setting down the Name of the Author from whence it was taken. Nay, I absolutely claim a Property in all such Sentiments the Moment they are transcribed into my Writings, and I expect all Readers henceforwards to regard them as purely and entirely my own"; that is, to use the phrase Murphy found in the heading to Fielding's chapter, such passages are to be regarded as "lawful Prize" (Tom Jones, ed. M. C. Battestin and F. Bowers [Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1975], p. 621). II. On the Standards of Modern Criticism Fielding was only the source of Murphy's reflections on "Imitation"; but the essay "On the Standards of modern Criticism" is wholly his, and it is one of the best of his humorous pieces of this kind. Opening with a favorite observation—that "Character" is determined by a ruling passion that "gives a casting Weight to the Genius" of a person—he regrets that there has been no objective means of measuring the force and efficacy of the particular passion necessary to produce the man of "Wit" or of "Humour," or, indeed, to produce Nature's masterpiece, "the modern Critic." Fielding had long made the latter the target of ridicule, most recently, for example, in the introductory essays to Tom Jones (Book X: "Containing Instructions very necessary to be perused by modern Critics"; and Book XI: "A Crust for the Critics") and in The Covent-Garden Journal, Nos. 3 (11 January 1752) and 46 (9 June 1752). Here, it appears to have been a particular modern critic whose taste and judgment required the correction of being laughed at. Samuel Foote, actor and mimic at the Covent-Garden Theatre, and a man Fielding despised (Life, pp. 435-39), had belittled the gifts of David Garrick, the greatest actor of the age—and, as the author of the essay calls him, "my little Friend of Drury Lane": Foote was publicly arguing that Garrick at 5′6″ was physically too short to be convincing in the role of a hero (see below, note 14). Affecting to agree with Foote's premise, the solution Fielding proposes to the problem of subjectivity when judging the pretensions of authors and critics is reminiscent of the "physico-logical" schemes of Swift: having "shewn to a Demonstration" that the qualifications of writers are entirely dependent on "the Height and Stature of the Body"—a Wit is 5′6″, a Humorist is 5′8″, a practical Joker 5′10″, a Critic 6′—it follows that a yardstick in future must be "the only infallible Criterion." As I believe the evidence attests,22 22. In addition to the evidence for Fielding's authorship presented in this essay, I report the conclusion of Michael and Jill Farringdon, who have conducted a computerassisted analysis: "Attribution analysis using the cusum technique—and taking for comparison material from Fielding's Joseph Andrews and Nicholas Amhurst's The Craftsman No. 396—shows the whole essay is indistinguishable from Fielding's material and clearly separates from Armhurst's material." On the cusum technique, see Jill M. Farringdon, Analysing for Authorship: A Guide to the Cusum Technique (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1996). de Castro's "suggestion" of nearly ninety years ago was as "sage" as Dickson judged it to be. Arthur Murphy was not only Fielding's good friend but, as Fielding's contributions to the Gray's-Inn Journal make clear, his protégé as well; he is the most likely author of the Dedication to The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon. And if he was author of the Dedication, Murphy, a professional writer and experienced editor of manuscripts, would certainly be the most likely person to have been employed by Millar to see through to publication the "perplexed autograph manuscript" that Amory has described. And, to repeat de Castro's words, "If that be so one can understand why Millar should have turned to him when requiring an editor for the `Complete' Works" of 1762. The complete text of the essay follows below, the copy text being the only extant source: The Gray's-Inn Journal, No. 27 (21 April 1753), in the 1756 reprint, i. 174-179.

Rushton Fairclough, Loeb Library, 1916). THERE are few Terms which are applied with greater Impropriety, than those characteristical Appellations, which Men usually bestow on their Acquaintance, or on others, in whose Company and Conversation they may at any Time have been casually engaged. Every Character, indeed, is formed by the Prevalence of some particular Passion,2 2. "the Prevalence of some particular Passion": Cf. JA (I. xviii) "the latter Passion was far more prevalent" (p. 88). —R which influences the Temper, and gives a casting Weight to the Genius of the Person in whom it subsists.3 *3. "Every Character . . . subsists": The theory that character is determined by a dominant passion is fundamental to HF's view of human nature. Cf. KCM, where he comments: "that immense Variety of Characters . . . could hardly exist, unless the Distinction had some original Foundation in Nature itself," and then declares that "among all these, there subsists . . . so manifest and extreme a Difference of Inclination or Character, that almost obliges us to acknowledge some unacquired, original Distinction, in the Nature or Soul of one Man, from that of another" (Misc i. 153-154). Also CGJ No. 55 (18 July 1752), where he explains the "Notion of Humour" (i.e. a ruling passion) as "nothing more than a violent Bent or Disposition of the Mind to some particular Point" (p. 300). But no Rules that I know of, have been yet laid down,4 *4. "no Rules . . . yet laid down": C-H cites 49 instances in HF's fiction of "Rules" in the sense of a set of principles or regulations governing conduct, an art or science, etc. With the phrasing here, cf. EC, where HF will "lay down some general Rules" on the subject of "Good Breeding" (Misc i. 128); also TJ (V. i) "we have laid it down as a Rule"; "to lay down dogmatical Rules in any Art or Science" and "the Rules . . . laid down by those great Judges" (pp. 209, 210, 211); Am (IV. iii) "to lay down any fixed and certain Rules" (p. 161); JVL "lay down only one general rule" (p. 6); "my own rule laid down in my preface" (p. 15). nor is there any certain Standard which should fix the Degree of Elevation, to which the ruling Passion must necessarily rise, before it can have Strength sufficient to determine the Character. The Reader must, however, be informed, that I am not speaking of those moral Qualifications, or Endowments of the Heart, which speculative Writers have taken so much idle Pains5 *5. "idle Pains": C-H cites 34 instances of "idle" in HF's fiction, 8 of which are in the present sense of "without purpose, meaningless": e.g. JWN (I. ii) "idle Opinions" (Misc ii. 10); JW (III. ii) "as vain and idle, as to bid the . . . River to cease to run" (Misc iii. 95); TJ (IV. i) "idle Romances" (p. 150); (XII. v) "idle Trumpery" (p. 639); (XII. vi) "idle Shows" (p. 641); (XV. iii) ("idle Stories") (p. 790). to adorn and recommend; and which Men of Sense, or Men of the World, have unanimously agreed in rejecting, as unworthy of their serious Notice. The Qualities I mean are pure Virtues of the Head or Face; Properties, which enable the Possessor to assume a solemn Aspect6 *6. "assume a solemn Aspect": C-H cites 27 instances in HF's fiction of "Aspect" referring to the appearance of a person or situation: in the present context cf., especially, TJ (VIII. vi), where Partridge the barber/surgeon explains to Jones: " `You can't imagine, Sir, of how much Consequence a grave Aspect is to a Grave Character. A Barber may make you laugh, but a Surgeon ought to make you cry' " (p. 423). Also (I. xii), where Captain Blifil affects "great Gravity of Aspect" (p. 69). at Incidents, which set the rest of the Table on a Roar;7 7. "set the Table on a Roar": C-H cites 34 instances in HF's fiction of the verb "roar," including TJ (VII. iv), Squire Western's "extraordinary Degree of roaring Mirth" (p. 339). or to interrupt what is truly serious and grave, by impertinent Questions of Levity and Mirth; or lastly, to condemn and cavil,8 8. "to . . . cavil": C-H cites 4 instances of "cavil" in HF's fiction, 2 as a noun and 2 as a verb, e.g. TJ (I. i) "Nor do I fear that my sensible Reader . . . will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named but one Article" (p. 32); (V. i) "I have been surprized that Horace should cavil at this Art in Homer" (p. 214). when all the World sees the highest Reasons for Applause and Admiration. The Effects which these Causes produce in Life, however various and complicated in their Appearance, may be reduced to the three general Sources of Wit, Humour, and Criticism, and as the Pretenders to these several Qualities are infinite in Number,9 *9. "infinite in Number": These two words were among HF's favorites. C-H cites 77 instances in HF's fiction of "infinite/infinitely" and 130 of "number/numberless" denoting quantity (not a numeral). Used together, cf. JWN (I. viii) "infinite Numbers of Spirits" (Misc ii. 36). I have determined on a certain Standard, in order to regulate and adjust their Claims. The Method I propose is, to decide their different Pretensions by the Height and Stature of the Body. And lest this should be considered as a wild chimerical Design,10 *10. "chimerical Design": The adjective "chimerical" was a particular favorite of HF's: cf. Ch (26 Jan. 1739/40) "chimerical System" (p. 142); (3 May 1740) "a chimerical Good," "so chimerical a Reward," "chimerical Expectations" (pp. 298-299); TP (26 Nov. 1745) "chimerical" concerns (p. 139); (24 Dec. 1745) "chimerical" apprehensions (p. 163); (6-13 May 1746) "such chimerical Good" (p. 288); DGA "chimerical Enterprizes" and "Grievances" (pp. 49, 57, 59). In addition to these examples and the 4 citations in C-H of "chimerical" and "Chimera" in HF's fiction, a further 9, at least, occur in his works from The Modern Husband (1732) to the posthumous Fragment of a Comment on Bolingbroke. I must beg Leave to assure my Reader, that the Theory I am forming is built upon the latest Discoveries, and most uncontroverted Principles of true Philosophy. It is possible however, that Persons of an over-refining Curiosity,11 *11. "an over-refining Curiosity": Beginning with the opening line of his earliest extant publication—The Masquerade (1728): "Some call Curiosity an evil"—HF was fascinated by the fact of human inquisitiveness; C-H cites 112 instances of "Curiosity" in the fiction alone. may be able to raise some Objections to what I am going to advance, but as every Thing is liable to be called in Question by those who are disposed to cavil, they will give me but little Pain upon that Head.12 12. "upon that Head": A favorite locution of HF's: e.g. JA (III. ii) "the utmost Perfection on that Head" (p. 199); TJ (IV. xiv) "be silent on that Head" (p. 206); Am (I. vii) "susceptible of Flattery on that Head" (p. 49); (V. ix) "my Assurances on that Head" (p. 228); (VII. viii) "to comfort me on that Head" (p. 298). The plainest Truths have been disputed, and the most extravagant Opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their Advocates and Admirers. Now, I would have such People recollect what are the general Apprehensions arising in the Mind, on the Sight of an uncommon Stature; and how favourable, withal, even the Notions of the Vulgar13 *13. "the Notions of the Vulgar": C-H cites 85 instances in HF's fiction of "vulgar" or "vulgarly." With the idea expressed by the present phrase, cf. JA (Preface) "in vulgar Opinion" (p. 5); (III. iii) "that vulgar Opinion" (p. 214); JW (I. v) "the vulgar erroneous Estimation of Things" (p. 23); TJ (XVII. i) "Mythology . . . more firmly believed by the Vulgar" (p. 876); XVIII. iii) "the vulgar Observation" (p. 933); A (II.i) "the vulgar Opinion of the Fatality of Marriage" (p. 67); (VII. x) "no greater vulgar Error" (p. 306). are to an unusual Height of Person. Is it not commonly supposed, that Men of this superior Eminence possess as superior Parts, and extraordinary Degrees of Merit. From this Principle, my little Friend of Drury-Lane is universally censured, as falling short of a true Hero, by near half a Foot;14 *14. "my little Friend . . . half a Foot": In A Treatise on the Passions (1747), Samuel Foote complained that HF's close friend David Garrick, rival to Spranger Barry at CoventGarden, was too small in stature to be effective in heroic roles: "And as the Eye is the Scence [sic] first gratified, or disgusted, it may not be improper to enquire what kind of Prepossession arises in the Mind, from the Appearance of Mr. G's Figure, and here I am afraid frail Nature has been a little unkind, and tho' I must own I have very distinct Ideas of big and great, yet such is the Folly of the Million, that they expect a more than ordinary Appearance from a Man, who is to perform extraordinary Actions; it it is in vain, to tell them, that Charles of Sweden, was but five-feet five, or Alexander the Great, a very little Man" (p. 14). In TJ (XVI. v) HF (who was himself tall, "rising above six feet," as Murphy remembered in his Essay) rebuts this criticism by having Partridge, with Jones watching Hamlet at Drury Lane, twice refer to Garrick in the title role as a "little Man" (p. 854); yet, however unimpressive his stature, Garrick's acting when confronting the ghost has most effectively terrified him. whilst his more aspiring Antagonist is allowed to have all the necessary Dimensions, required both by ancient and modern Precedents, to constitute the heroic Character. It is an Axiom in Philosophy,15 15. "an Axiom of Philosophy": cf. JWN (I. xix) "an Axiom of indubitable Truth" (Misc ii. 84). which few, I hope, will be so hardy as to deny,16 16. "few . . . will be so hardy as to deny": Cf. JWN (I. v) "will any of you be so insensible or ungrateful, as to deny" (Misc ii. 27); Am (XI. i) "Why will you be so barbarous to deny" (p. 454). —R that the Soul is all and all in every Part. From hence it is obvious, that the Body which is a Covering only for the Ætherial Particle that is lodged within it, must necessarily receive its Dimensions from the Vigour of the Spirit, which actuates the exterior Frame. The greater Portion of Fire this Spirit is endued with, its elastic Qualities will be proportionably stronger; and the Dimensions of the Body will be protruded to a Size, exactly of the same Dimensions with the Soul which informs it. On this simple Hypothesis, which I imagine cannot be easily disproved, I proceed to settle the respective Qualifications of the different Pretenders, who have been mentioned above. In the first Place, those who, with gentle William in the Play,17 17. "gentle William in the Play": Referring to Fribble the fop, a part played by Garrick (see above, n. 14) in his popular farce, Miss in Her Teens (1747), which was staged at Drury Lane for the first time this season on 28 April 1753, a week after this essay was published. In Act II, scene I, Fribble reads a poem entitled, "William Fribble, Esq; to Miss Biddy Bellair," in which he assures her "No brutal passion fires my breast, . . . But one of harmless, gentle kind, / Whose joys are centred—in the mind." When asked her opinion of the verses, Biddy replies: "I swear they are very pretty—but I don't quite understand 'em" (Eighteenth Century Drama: Afterpieces, ed. Richard W. Bevis [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1970], p. 96). boast themselves not on Account of their Wisdom, but as they have a pretty Wit, do not exceed the lowest Degree of our appointed Standard. It is not in Nature, that such Persons can rise in their Stature, above the Height of five Feet and six Inches.18 *18. Garrick, the author's "little Friend of Drury-Lane" (above, n. 14), who acted the part of "gentle William" the fop in Miss in Her Teens (above, n. 17), is said to have been 5′6″. For Wit, which is merely an Exercise of the Tongue, doth19 *19. "doth": This is the sole occurrence in the essay of HF's characteristic preference for the archaic forms doth and hath; subsequently, does occurs twice and has five times. Since Murphy throughout the journal prefers does and has, it is tempting to suppose that the compositor began setting the type by following the reading of the manuscript before, in the seven subsequent instances, imposing the house style on HF's archaisms—such was in fact the case with a contribution HF made to Common Sense in 1738, where the manuscript hath was systematically changed to has (see M. C. with R. R. Battestin, "A Fielding Discovery, with Some Remarks on the Canon," Studies in Bibliography 33 [1980], p. 135). On the uncertain usefulness of hath and doth as a stylistic test of HF's writing, see W. B. Coley, TP, Appendix VI. not require the same Bulk and Dimensions, which are essential to Qualifications of a superior Order. It is evidently a much less Exertion of the interior Faculties, than what are productive of that Talent which we call Humour. Hence we must advance a little in our Standard; and can admit no one to be a Man of real Humour, who does not come up to the full Height of five Feet and eight Inches; and this small Progression is the more allowable, as a considerable Part of Humour is frequently expressed by such Feats of Body, as require some little Degree of Size and Strength.20 *20. "require some little Degree of Size and Strength": Cf. TJ (IX. i) "require some little Degree of Learning and Knowledge" (p. 489); JVL "acquired some little degree of strength" (p. 17). Also TJ (III. vi) "no little Degree of Inveteracy" (p. 138); (XI. iii) "she had . . . some little Degree of natural Courage" (p. 579); Am (IV. ix) "to introduce some little Degree of Love or Friendship" (p. 192). —R Giving a Friend a violent and unexpected Slap on the Back, or the dexterous Leaping over Chairs and Tables, have been often regarded as so many undoubted Signs of genuine Humour;21 *21. "a considerable Part . . . Signs of genuine Humour": Cf. KCM, where HF, on the causes of laughter, quotes Pope's Dunciad: "Gentle Dulness ever loves a Joke. / i.e. one of her own Jokes. These are sometimes performed by the Foot; as by leaping over Heads, or Chairs, or Tables, Kicks in the B—ch, &amp;c. sometimes by the Hand; as by Slaps in the Face, pulling off Wigs, and infinite other Dexterities" (Misc i. 161). And in EC, recalling the sort of buffoonery practised on Parson Adams by the followers of the "roasting" squire (JA III. vii), he writes of "that Kind of Raillery . . . which is concerned in tossing Men out of their Chairs, tumbling them into Water, or any of those handicraft Jokes" (Misc i. 150). and are generally agreed to denote a most facetious Vein of Pleasantry,22 22. "a most facetious Vein of Pleasantry"; Cf. Dr. Harrison in Am (IX. v), who possessed "a Vein of Cheerfulness, Good-humour and Pleasantry" (p. 377); C-H records 12 instances in HF's fiction of "facetious" as various parts of speech: e.g. TJ (VIII. viii) "a most facetious Grin" (p. 432). in the Authors of such exquisite Jokes.23 23. "exquisite Jokes": Cf. above note 21. In KCM introducing the line from the Dunciad about Dulness loving a "Joke," HF admires Pope's "exquisite Pleasantry." It will sometimes further happen, that these two Qualities may be blended in the same Person; as I doubt not but many of my Readers can recollect several of their Acquaintance, who are your only Men of Wit and Humour. Now, this Conjunction manifestly implies a much superior Energy of Soul;24 *24. "Energy of Soul": Dr. Ribble reminds me that " `Energy' is a distinctive, semitechnical term in Fielding's moral psychology, based on Aristotle's notion of energeia" and refers to his article, "Aristotle and the `Prudence' Theme of Tom Jones," EighteenthCentury Studies 15 (1981), p. 38, which includes these references: FL "all the energies of love" (p. 51); TJ (XIII. i) "those strong Energies of a good Mind" (p. 687); Am (III. v) "the . . . Energies of that Passion" (p. 115); (VIII. x) "an Energy, a Habit, as Aristotle calls it" (p. 351); CGJ (14 March 1752) "the Energies of Benevolence" (p. 142 and n. 1); "that Compassion which is the constant Energy of these good Hearts" (p. 143); (11 April 1752) "In the Energy itself of Virtue (says Aristotle) there is great Pleasure" (p. 185). —R and consequently, a still higher Advancement in our Scale of characteristic Excellencies. These Candidates for Fame will accordingly rise two Inches above those who are mentioned last; and none are to pass under the Denomination for the future, but whose Height is five Feet ten. For these Qualities, when thus united, will frequently exert themselves in Strokes25 *25. "Strokes": A favorite locution of HF's. C-H records the following 6 instances in the fiction: Sh (To Miss Fanny) "you have . . . brightened many strokes in this work" (p. 301); JA (I. ix) "some Strokes which every one will not truly comprehend" (p. 42); (III. x) "there are . . . manly Strokes . . . in your last Tragedy" (p. 261); TJ (I. iii) "There were some Strokes in this Speech" (p. 41); (IX. i) "the nicest Strokes of a Shakespear" (p. 493); Am (III. xi) "Thus she ran on, and after many bitter Strokes upon her Sister" (p. 142). Also JVL "we acknowledge the strokes of nature" (p. 8). of Gallantry and Mirth, which are so much the more honourable as they are dangerous to the Person or the Purse of the ingenious Artist, who has the Courage or Curiosity to attempt the Experiment. The demolishing Windows, knocking down of Watchmen, bilking26 26. "bilking": Cf. TJ (XIV. iv) " `I don't intend to bilk my Lodgings' " (p. 753). —R of Waiters at Places of Entertainment, with other Instances of the like Kind, are very laudable and convincing Proofs of these compound Qualities, residing together in the same Habitation.27 *27. "compound Qualities . . . in the same Habitation": In the fourth paragraph of the essay, "the Body" is defined as "a Covering only for the Ætherial Particle [i.e. the "Soul" or "Spirit"] that is lodged within it." The "compound Quality" that defines the Man of Wit and Humour gives him "a much superior Energy of Soul," and that soul resides in a body 5′ 10″ tall, its "Habitation." In JWN, HF had the spirits of the dead use the same conceit: the narrator speaks of his life on earth as "my Habitation in the Body"; his companion, who died of a violent fever, speaks of his body as "the inflamed Habitation I am lately departed from" (Misc ii. 8, 10). HF often refers to the dwelling places of his characters as their "Habitations": C-H records 20 instances in the fiction alone (including the two quoted). The last Quality, which greatly overtops the rest, and is indeed the Crown and Perfection of all, is the wonderful28 *28. "wonderful": For this sarcastic use of the word, see TJ (XIV. i) "by the wonderful Force of Genius only" (p. 739). Also JA (II. vii) "a wonderful Capacity" (p. 130); (III. i) "the wonderful Extent of human Genius" (p. 187); JW (I. i) "those wonderful Productions of Nature called Great Men" (p. 7); (II. xi) "The Great and wonderful Behaviour of our Hero" (p. 80); TJ (VI. i) "certain Philosophers, among many other wonderful Discoveries" (p. 268); Am (VIII. vi) "by his own Account, he was the Author of most of the wonderful Productions of the Age" (p. 332). —R and most ingenious Faculty of modern Criticism. And as this is, in the most exalted Manner, the Gift of Nature, whoever has the Happiness to be born a true Critic, is at least six Feet complete. A Critic is the Master-piece and noblest Work of Nature;29 29. "the Master-piece and noblest Work of Nature": Cf. JW (I. x) "Individuals . . . who do not seem intended by Nature as her greatest Master-piece" (Misc iii. 35). Also Misc i "A perfect Work! the Iliad of Nature!"

TJ (IV. ix) "yet did he bear about him some thing of what the Antients called the Irascible" (p. 186). —R some distinguishing Tokens,31 *31. "some distinguishing Tokens": HF often used "Token" as a synonym for "sign"; C-H lists 13 instances in the fiction: e.g. TJ (III. v) "deficient in outward Tokens of Respect" (p. 133); (III. vi) "gave Tokens of that Gallantry of Temper" (p. 139); (XIII. x) "showed . . . the utmost Tokens of Surprize" (p. 727); (XVII. ii) "gave Tokens of Submission" (p. 879); Am (I. vii) "I gave him too undeniable Tokens [of infatuation]" (p. 51); (II. vi) "gave the strongest Tokens of Amazement" (p. 85). —R which will enable a Spectator, at the first View, to acknowledge and revere his Merits. Hence she has bestowed on him a more than ordinary Portion of the Daring and Tremendous;32 *32. "the Daring and Tremendous": In his literary criticism HF liked to propose terms for generic types by placing the definite article before an adjective, thus making it into a substantive: e.g. "the Ridiculous," and "the Monstrous" (JA Preface); "the Marvellous" (TJ VIII. i). Here the terms characterizing the "modern Critic," who "glares horribly terrific," freezing "the young Author's Blood," suggest Pope's characterization of John Dennis (1657-1734) in the Essay on Criticism (1711): "Appius reddens at each Word you speak, / And stares, Tremendous! with a threatning Eye, / Like some fierce Tyrant in Old Tapestry!" (TE, ll. 585-587). From the Preface and notes to The Tragedy of Tragedies (1731), where Dennis is ridiculed as hidebound and priggish, to CGJ (9 June 1752), where he is referred to as being "of acutely austere Memory" (p. 258), Dennis might well be thought to represent for HF the very type of the "modern Critic." and these would appear to very little Effect in a Person of less Dimensions, than those which we have here assigned him. The Wit may be pert and sanguine;33 *33. "pert and sanguine": HF was fond of both these words. C-H lists 10 occurrences of "pert/pertly/pertness" in the fiction—e.g. Sh "as pertly as I could," "pert again" (p. 311); "the pert Jade" (p. 339); JA (I. ix); "answered . . . very pertly"; (IV. i) "whom no Pertness could make her Mistress . . . part with" (p. 280); TJ (II. iii) "very pert and obstinate" (p. 85); (IV. xiii) "would be Pertness in a Woman" (p. 202); (XVII. iii) "Pertness, or what is called Repartee" (p. 882); Am (IV. vi) "answered pertly enough" (p. 178). Especially relevant in the present context is CGJ (19 May 1752), "A TREATISE on the Confident and Pert, A modern Improvement in Writing" (pp. 231-233, continued pp. 255-259). —For "sanguine" C-H also lists 10 instances in the fiction—e.g. in TJ "sanguine" modifies "Expectations" (p. 106); "Assurance" (p. 221); "Friend" (p. 440); "Temper" and "Disposition of Mind" (p. 708); in Am, "Temper" (pp. 163, 499); "Persons" (p. 289); "Hopes" (p. 368). Also JVL "sanguine hopes" (pp. 19, 45). —R the Man of Humour confident or overbearing; but it is the Critic alone, who glares horribly terrific. His every Look freezes the young Author's Blood;34 34. "freezes the young Author's Blood": Cf. TJ (XI. vi) "These Words almost froze up the Blood of Sophia" (p. 593). —R and at the Sound of his Voice, the rooted Seats have been known to be torn from the Ground, and hurled violently through the Air, in furious and wild Commotion.35 35. "the Sound of his Voice . . . furious and wild Commotion": Cf. Pope's complaint in the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot (1734/35), recalling Dennis's attacks on his early poetry: "Yet then did Dennis rave in furious fret" (TE, l. 153). Phænomena,36 36. "Phænomena": Cf. TJ (VII. xiii) "often attended with worse Phænomena" (p. 380); Am (I. i) "all the ordinary Phenomena" (p. 16); JVL "so extraordinary a phænomenon" (p. 50). —R like these, can only be produced by that iron Strength of Lungs,37 *37. "iron Strength of Lungs"; Cf. Am (XII. vi) "one of the sturdiest and forwardest of the Mob . . . who by a superior Strength of Body, and of Lungs, presided" (p. 519). and brazen Audacity of Figure, which Nature has so liberally imparted to the modern Critic. It will be necessary to obviate38 38. "obviate": C-H cites 5 occurrences of "obviate" in HF's fiction: JA (III. i) "to obviate some Constructions" (p. 188); TJ (III. iv) "to obviate some Misconstructions" (p. 128); (XI. i) "Criticism I here intend to obviate" (p. 569); (XII. i) "to obviate all such Imputations" (p. 620); Am (Dedication) "to obviate any Criticisms" (p. 3). Also JVL "to obviate some censures" (p. 11). an Objection arising from popular Prejudice, that the Science of Criticism39 39. "the Science of Criticism": Cf.

"have not . . . duly reflected on": Cf. TJ (IX. v) "hath duly reflected on these many Charms" (p. 510). —R the necessary Qualities to discharge the Province41 *41. "discharge the Province": HF often uses this geographical metaphor to refer to prescribed responsibilities, spheres of intellectual endeavor, or mental faculties. See JA (Preface) "within its proper Province" (p. 6); "The Ridiculous only . . . falls within my Province" (p. 7); (III. iv) "my Beer, which falls to my Province" (p. 227); TJ (II. i) "Founder of a new Province of Writing" (p. 77); (II. iv) "it is our Province to relate Facts" (p. 87); (IX. i) "the undisputed Province of Judgment" (p. 491); (XIV. i) "a Writer whose Province is Comedy" (p. 743); (XVI. vi) "within the Province of Cunning" (p. 859). —R they are desirous of allotting it. To execute that Task,42 42. "execute that Task": C-H cites 82 instances in HF's fiction alone of "execute," the great majority in this sense of "to carry out, accomplish." would require a moderate Portion of Sense, Taste and Judgment, under the Direction of Modesty and Candour; Talents so little practised by those who have taken up the Occupation of a a [sic] Critic, that they appear on all Occasions not to have the least Conception of them. Whoever will give himself Leave to consider, that the Character of a Critic, a Wit, and Man of Humour, in the present Estimation of the World, is supported43 43. "Character . . . is supported": Cf.

John Wilders [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967], p. 231); and Jonathan Swift in The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit (1704), in which Swift ironically explains things spiritual in terms of mechanistic bodily functions. The author of the present essay has proceeded in this same vein, insisting that literary and intellectual faculties are proportionable to bodily height and stature. in which the Understanding has no Manner of Share,45 45. "in which the Understanding has no Manner of Share": Cf. TJ (I. vi) "Nature . . . had given her a very uncommon Share of Understanding" (p. 48). —R he will easily agree with me, that the surest Method to discover those Characters, must be taken from that Part which is principally concerned; and as we can truly judge from outward Appearances alone, I have shewn to a Demonstration that the Stature of a Person is the only infallible Criterion, by which we can decide, on the Justness of his Pretensions; and that no one for the future can have any Right to either of those Characters, but whose Dimensions will exactly tally with the Measures of this Standard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOMAS DE QUINCEY AND THE EDINBURGH SATURDAY POST OF 1827 by David Groves THE Edinburgh Saturday Post was an eight-page weekly newspaper that ran from 12 May 1827 to 3 May 1828. After that it continued as the Edinburgh Evening Post. The Post would be of little importance today except that one of its weekly writers was Thomas De Quincey, the author of Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and of several memoirs of his literary friends including Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Charles Lamb. Although De Quincey never mentions the Edinburgh Post in his other essays, there is no doubt he contributed many anonymous articles to it, from about the middle of 1827. His work for the paper was disregarded until 1966, when Stuart Tave reprinted twenty-three pieces from the 1827 Post (and sixteen from the 1828 Post) that are clearly De Quincey's.1 1. Tave, New Essays by De Quincey: His Contributions to the Edinburgh Saturday Post and the Edinburgh Evening Post 1827-1828 (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1966). Hereafter cited as "Tave." The first thirty-five of those articles, together with fifty newly-attributed articles from the same Edinburgh Saturday Post, now constitute Volume Five (which I edited) in The Works of Thomas De Quincey (gen. ed. Grevel Lindop, 21 vols., London: Pickering and Chatto, 2000-2003; hereafter cited as Works). (The remaining four pieces in Dr. Tave's collection, from the same paper after it was renamed the Evening Post, are in Volume Six of the new Works.) The purpose of the present essay is to tell, for the first time in print, the detailed story of De Quincey's involvement with the 1827 Post, with a view to supporting the attributions in Volume Five. It is hoped that this new contextual information concerning De Quincey's unusual position (as both an Englishman and the only writer of recognized literary ability on the staff of a tiny Scottish newspaper) will lend strength to the eighty-five attributions in Volume Five, which are necessarily brief and necessarily rely mainly on the internal evidence of style and content. De Quincey was forty-one when he started writing for the Post. He desperately needed money to support his wife and children in the English lake district. His only previous newspaper-work had been as the editor of the Westmorland Gazette in 1818-19. After that job ended, De Quincey wrote articles for the London Magazine, 1821-24, and for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, beginning in 1826.2 2. His only previous known contribution to Blackwood's was a translation of Schiller's "The Sport of Fortune" (8 [1821]: 375-381). Despite the success of his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater in 1821, De Quincey was not yet well-known as an author in Edinburgh. When Thomas Carlyle met "De Quincy" there in November 1827, he was appalled at the poverty which kept the Englishman tied to the Post: It might soften a very hard heart to see him . . . so weak and poor; retiring home with his two children to a miserable lodging-house, and writing all day for the King of Donkies, the Proprietor of the Saturday Post.3 3. Letter to John Carlyle, 29 Nov. 1827, in The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle, ed. Charles R. Sanders et al., 29 vols. to date (Durham, North Carolina: Duke Univ. Press, 1970- ), 4:287-293 (291). No article in the Edinburgh Saturday Post ever carried the name of its author. Nor did the Saturday Post ever mention Thomas De Quincey by name, initials, or pseudonym "the Opium-Eater." As a result, critics until lately have underestimated his involvement. But in the last few years it has been shown that De Quincey was the paper's editor for two months in 1827, secondly that he furnished most of its leading-articles in that year,4 4. De Quincey's political leaders are discussed in my article, " `Climbing the Post': Thomas De Quincey as a Newspaper Editor, 1827-28," The Wordsworth Circle 29 (1998): 126-131. and thirdly that he was still submitting essays to the Post well beyond 1827.5 5. See the endnotes to "Letters of Junius," in Works, 5:388, for evidence that he submitted the concluding fourth part of his essay on "Junius" to the Post in 1831. De Quincey's other Edinburgh publisher, William Blackwood, confided privately in October 1827 that De Quincey "has been it seems for a few weeks the Editor" of the Post.6 6. Letter to David Robinson, 9 Oct. 1827, National Library of Scotland (hereafter NLS), MS 30310, no. 288. All manuscripts from the NLS are cited by kind permission of the Trustees of the NLS. Years later, another writer recalled working for "the Saturday Evening Post . . . during the administration of De Quincey."7 7. William Hay, letter to David Moir, 11 Dec. 1837, NLS MS Acc. 9856, no. 44. The reference is to a review of Confessions of an Unexecuted Femicide, 29 Sept. 1827 (see also note 38 below). It is also now believed that De Quincey had a contract that required him to supply articles to the paper on a weekly basis.8 8. For evidence of De Quincey's contract, see his legal claim in 1833 that he "Overpaid the late M[r]. Blackie . . . for a debt said to be due," to the sum of £23 (ptd. in Kenneth Forward, "De Quincey's Cessio Bonorum," PMLA 54 [1939]: 511-525 [519]). For "Mr. Blackie," the owner of the Post, see note 20 below. As it would be hard to overpay a sum borrowed, I think it more likely that these details refer to a contract to supply articles, which De Quincey bought his way out of, and then wished he had driven a better bargain. Writers for the Post were normally paid at the end of each year. When another contributor, Andrew Crichton (see note 109 below), quit in late 1829, he feared he might lose a whole year's salary: "So that I quit the concern after nearly twelve months . . . a loser by nearly £200 myself" (letter to David Moir, 14 Dec. 1829, NLS MS Acc. 9856, no. 40). One problem in investigating the Post is that many of its articles were revised by editors or typesetters, while other articles combined the efforts of more than one author. When one contributor reprinted some of his pieces as a separate booklet in 1828, he complained that their "substance" had first "appeared in the . . . Post . . . with some additions and alterations." "It is now," he added, "printed from the original MS. as it was first written."9 9. Senex (i.e., Alexander Peterkin), Reviews in the Case of the Rev. Dr. A. Thomson (Edinburgh: Wardlaw, 1828), p. 1. The previous identification of Andrew Crichton as the author of this pamphlet (see Tave, p. 10n.) was based on the belief that Crichton edited the Post from the start. Now that Peterkin is known to have been its first editor (see note 22 below), the pamphlet may be re-assigned. Peterkin sued Blackie in December 1828, claiming that he never paid him for his "Letter signed `Senex' " and other pieces reprinted from the Post in this pamphlet (Scottish Registry Office [hereafter SRO], WRH/Box 423 [n.p.]. All documents from the SRO are cited with permission.) On the level of punctuation, capitalization, and length of sentences, it seems that some or all of the authors expected the paper's compositors to revise their submissions.10 10. A later essay, "([Mr. Huskisson's `Resignation']" (Post, 31 May 1828), appears to be the only contribution by De Quincey to survive in manuscript. The manuscript (which is transcribed in Works, 6.302-307) shows that he willingly relied on the compositor to punctuate and capitalize what he wrote, and even to re-organize certain passages. Had these changes been instigated by the editor, they presumably would appear on the manuscript. Volume Five in the new Works includes two long essays that are almost certainly collaborations between De Quincey and someone else, and De Quincey is not responsible for the complete text.11 11. One is a review of religious pamphlets (22 Dec. 1827, pp. 262-263), and the other is a review of Robert Macnish's Anatomy of Drunkenness (1 Mar. 1828, p. 342). Divided authorship seems certain, because different paragraphs differ radically in style and opinion (see Works, 5:187-194 and 282-288). Unless cited to the contrary, all journalistic articles in the present essay were anonymous. On controversial topics, the Post often combined remarks by two or more of its writers in a single article.12 12. In 1829 "actions for Libel [were] threatened" against the Post for a number of religious articles written "jointly or severally" by "Mr. Crichton + Mr. Nelson" (David Kerr, letter to David Blackie, 15 Dec. 1829, NLS, MS Acc, 9856, no. 40). For "Nelson," see note 22 below. Few journalists have ever been quite so unsuited to their paper as Thomas De Quincey was to the Post. The Post was designed for well-to-do Scottish conservatives, with businessmen, lawyers, and Presbyterian ministers making up much of its audience. Its appearance was lavish, with each large page laid out in four spacious columns, beautifully printed in clear dark ink. The title appeared in a graceful rolling scroll across the top of the first page, with Scotland's coat-of-arms in the center. Beneath the title, the subtitle stood in small block capitals, announcing the paper as "A GENERAL NEWSPAPER, LITERARY JOURNAL, AND RECORD OF SCOTTISH AFFAIRS." As a sign of its upper-class nature, the first thirteen issues sold for nine pence, at a time when almost all newspapers sold for seven pence. The strongest commercial feature of the Post was its promise to bring "the latest London news" to Scotland on Saturday night. Previously, Edinburgh's Saturday papers were published early on Saturday morning, and their news from the south would be three days old by the time readers saw it. The Post, however, created a niche for itself through having a permanent correspondent based in London. Every Thursday afternoon the correspondent would write his "private letter," containing news from Parliament and the stock exchange as well as the latest overseas news. He would also gather various newspapers from England, Ireland, and sometimes from Paris, Berlin, and beyond. At seven o'clock on Thursday evening, this London correspondent would place his letter and the newspapers in a packet addressed to the Saturday Post in Edinburgh. The packet would then be handed to the mail-coach, just before it left London for the north. Barring a problem with the horses, an accident, or a storm, the parcel would arrive at Edinburgh's main post-office on Princes' Street a little before six p.m. on Saturday. Someone from the Post would collect the parcel and rush back to the paper's office on West Register Street, two blocks away. At this point, the Saturday Post was due to be printed in little more than an hour. All its articles had been set in type, excepting a column or so on the front page, for the latest London and overseas news, and a column or two beginning on the fourth page, which was reserved for the leading-article. These innovative arrangements were a matter of some pride: This Paper will be published every Saturday Evening after the arrival of the London Mail. It will contain not only the whole news of the week, . . . but the latest London news, of every description, with the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament, state of the Funds, &amp;c. continued and brought down by means of a Private Letter to the hour when the Mail-coach leaves Lombard Street [in London] on the previous Thursday night.13 13. Prospectus to the Edinburgh Saturday Post, 30 Mar. 1827, p. 1. The two-page Prospectus survives at the Orkney Archives (reference D2/5/10). Material from the Orkney Archives is cited by permission. Subscribers to the new paper would receive Thursday's news from the south on Saturday night; because no printing was done in Scotland on Sunday, readers of other papers would have to wait until late on Monday for similar information. The benefits for speculators, politicians, journalists, and even devotees of fashion would have been obvious. Advertisers, too, would have seen that readers of the Post were people with money to spend. The importance of this master-stroke of timing is confirmed in a letter from the owner of the Post, informing a local printer that another firm had been chosen to print the paper: "The other Proprietors with myself viewed the distance of yr. Establishment from the Post office [i.e., the public mail depot] as the Great objection."14 14. David Blackie, letter to George Boyd, 21 Apr. 1827, NLS MS Acc. 5000, no. 6. Boyd's firm of Oliver and Boyd operated in Tweeddale Court, just off the High Street; the greater distance would have meant a delay of only about seven minutes in publishing the Post. (For Blackie's role at the Post, see note 20 below.) Each copy of the Post was printed on a single, large sheet, subsequently folded into four leaves.15 15. This and the following details are derived from reading the Post in the light of the Prospectus. An editorial note of 1829 explained that half its pages, including its "literary columns," "goes to press early on Saturday morning" ("To Publishers," Post, 5 Dec., p. 324). Logic seems to require a similar arrangement in 1827. The inner forme, containing the second, third, sixth, and seventh pages, was normally printed on Saturday morning, and the ink would be dry by six o'clock. Meanwhile the compositor prepared the type for the reverse side (the outer forme), which would comprise the remaining four pages. Between six o'clock and seven on Saturday night, the letter from London (sometimes supplemented by extracts from the newspapers) would be set in type for the front page, while someone (in many cases De Quincey) would use the other news from London to dash off the leading article for the fourth page. As soon as these final pieces were set in type and proofread, the outer forme was ready to be printed. The sheets were then presumably hung up to dry, folded into pages, and finally cut along two sides. Assuming all went well, copies were on the way to subscribers by half-past-seven.16 16. It was "delivered in town every Saturday night between seven and eight o'clock" (advertisement, Edinburgh Evening Courant, 17 May 1827, [p. 1]). Early copies were "on sale at our Office . . . by half-past Seven" on Saturday night ("Notice," Post, 4 Aug. 1827, p. 104). I suspect that copies of the Post were cut before being sent out (rather than being cut by subscribers) because surviving unbound copies (at the National Library of Scotland and the Edinburgh Public Library) all seem to be cut in a uniform and regular fashion. The paper's other selling-point was its overwhelmingly Scottish sympathies. Six weeks before the first issue appeared, the Post declared that its "chief materials" and chief interests would "relate to the past and passing History of Scotland—its Ecclesiastical concerns—its Literary and Scientific Transactions—its Statistics and Improvements," so that it would prove "an interesting record to Scotsmen in all parts of the world." In the book-review section, too, great emphasis was to be placed on Scottish literature: The Edinburgh Saturday Post will be in part also a Literary Journal. Literature, indeed, has now become of so general interest in this country, that no newspaper would be thought complete . . . without having a part of its columns devoted to subjects of that kind. The Saturday Post will therefore contain regular notices of new Books; and chiefly of such as are published in Scotland.17 17. Prospectus, p. 2. Similarly, the first issue claimed that the paper's book-reviews would be a "chronicle in which to notice Scottish publications," with "a regular notice" of every book "which issues from the Scottish press, or is the production of a Scotsman." With "numberless . . . works of . . . genius" now "published in Scotland," the Scottish people could "boast of a literature peculiar to itself," the Post declared; "we have not merely a national literature, but a national book-trade, more extensive perhaps than exists in any other country of the same population."18 18. Untitled essay, Post, 12 May 1827, p. 3. The paper would not likely have stressed the Scottishness of its literary columns to such a degree if it had expected from the start to publish major reviews by the "English Opium-Eater." Almost everyone involved with the Post, except De Quincey, was a Scot.19 19. The only other known exception was its typesetter Christopher Torrop (1810-1871), a teenager of Swedish descent. A trusted employee by 1829, Torrop rose to be co-editor in 1831. His youth adds to the impression that the Post was a marginal newspaper without substantial economic resources. The paper was founded, and primarily owned until August 1830, by a young Scottish shipowner and lawyer named David Blackie or Blaikie. Although other investors were involved,20 20. The surnames Blackie and Blaikie were used interchangeably. David Blackie (c. 1795-1832) was a "printer, publisher, and ship-owner," and he and his cousin Robert were "partners in the firm of DAVID and ROBERT BLACKIE, writers and ship-owners" ("Monthly List of Sequestrations," Law Chronicle, 1 [1829], 303). ("Writers" refers to the Scottish legal position of "Writer to the Signet.") In a probe of the men's affairs in 1833, it was asked whether the Post "belonged to the Company [i.e., to both cousins], or to David Blackie as an individual"; investigation "soon settled" that the paper "belonged to," and was rightly "claimed by, Mr David Blackie as an individual" (Petition and Complaint, Royal Bank of Scotland and Others, Against Robert Wight [SRO, WRH SC 236/B/33/2, pp. 3-6, passim]). Another source calls David Blackie a "printer, publisher, and ship-owner," and Robert simply a "ship-owner" ("Monthly List of Sequestrations," Law Chronicle 1, 303). For more information, see "Blackie's Trustees," Scottish Jurist 5 (1833): 188-191. Blackie's sale of the Post is recorded in the Caledonian Mercury, 2 Sept. 1830, [p. 2]. Uncertainty surrounds another investor, Archibald Bell. In London in 1838, Fraser's Magazine described the Post as "started . . . by, if we are not mistaken, a Mr. Bell, a lithographic printer, and its first price was tenpence" [sic]; "The copyright, soon after," was "purchased by Mr. Blackie" ([William Anderson], "The Newspaper Press of Scotland: The Edinburgh Newspapers," 17:559-571 [567]). In fact, Bell's name first appears in the colophon for the eighteenth number, where the paper is said to be "Printed for the PROPRIETORS by JAMES CLARKE &amp; CO. . . . At No. 10, West Register Street, BY ARCHIBALD BELL" (8 Sept. 1827, p. 144). Earlier colophons are identical, except in lacking the reference to Bell. His name vanished from the Post after 3 May 1828. Bell (1755-1854) was an Edinburgh advocate and printer, and sheriff-depute for Ayrshire. Apparently he hoped to publish his own essays in the Post; when at last they appeared in print in 1835, he said they were "written several years ago . . . for periodical circulation in Edinburgh," "for the good of my fellow citizens"; the "causes which prevented that course, are wholly uninteresting to the Public" (The Cabinet: A Series of Moral and Literary Essays, 2 vols. [Edinburgh: Bell and Bradfute], 1:iii, 7). Bell seems to have had little impact on the Post; in any event, his prose is unlike De Quincey's, as it rings with phrases like "our Scottish superstitions," "our countryman Burns," and "our great poet" Burns (Cabinet, 1:46, 41). The article in Fraser's Magazine is not a reliable source for the Post. It gives the wrong selling-price, denies Blackie's involvement at the start, and misidentifies Crichton as the paper's editor, "so long as it remained in the possession of Mr. Blackie" (p. 568). (In fact, Crichton toiled for the Post only from March 1828 to December 1829; see note 109 below and my article "De Quincey, the West Indies, and the Edinburgh Evening Post," PBSA 86 [1992]: 41-56). Blackie was the paper's driving-force and apparently the only one of its investors who also had a role in management.21 21. Across the first page of the only surviving copy of the first number of the Post, Blackie scrawled, in ink, "12 May 1827 1st Copy of 1st number thrown off," followed by his signature, "D.B." All fifty-two numbers of the Saturday Post survive in a bound volume at the British Library. See also the letter cited in note 14 above for proof of Blackie's initial involvement. For the first four months, the paper was edited by a Scots ecclesiastical lawyer named Alexander Peterkin, assisted by the Reverend Thomas Nelson and the Reverend George Milligan.22 22. For information on Peterkin (1780-1846), see the DNB. For Nelson and Milligan, see my article in PBSA (cited in note 20 above). Most critics have followed the Fraser's article (cited in note 20) in regarding Crichton as the Post's initial editor (see Tave, p. 10, and R. M. W. Cowan, The Newspaper in Scotland [Glasgow: Maclehose, 1946], p. 35). But on 30 March 1827, writing on a copy of the Prospectus to the Post, Peterkin confided that "A new paper is about to be established in Edin for which I have been requested to take an Editorial charge" (letter to Captain Balfour, Orkney Archives, D2/5/10). In 1833, the Edinburgh Weekly Journal sent a "sketch of Mr Alexr. Peterkin's career" to the Kelso Mail newspaper, in which the relevant entry is: "1827 May—Editor of the Edinr Evening [sic] Post" (John Harthill, letter to George Jerdan, 15 Apr., Borders Regional Library, MS SC/R/38/2/9; cited by permission). (The confusion over the Post's title was endemic in the 1830s.) A writer in 1833 confirms that "Mr. Peterkin" was "entrusted with [the] management" of the Post, "at its commencement," "six years ago" ("Edinburgh and Glasgow Newspaper Press," Metropolitan Magazine 7:96-101 [98]). All three were Scots by birth, upbringing, and education, and all were devoted members of the Church of Scotland. In writing for the Post, Peterkin, Nelson, and Milligan were (in the words of the paper itself) "manfully set[ting] themselves in opposition to the foolish principles of liberalism in all its branches and modifications—regarding it as a spurious and monstrous offspring of Jacobinism and Popery."23 23. "Parliamentary Reform," Post, 2 Oct. 1830, p. 313. The "English Opium-Eater" would make a most unusual addition to this team of proud, pious Scots, when he joined it in the summer of 1827. The writings of Peterkin, Nelson, and Milligan deserve a glance, if only to show how unlike De Quincey's they are. Their interests lay chiefly in religion and national pride. Editor Peterkin's style may be seen at its most argumentative in his edition of Robert Burns: And if ever calumny of the most dastardly kind poisoned public opinion [Peterkin writes], it has been in the case of Burns. It is not enough to say, that he frequently indulged in convivial propensities, and therefore was an habitual débauchée, and every way abominable as a man; it is absolute imbecility, savouring of the tabernacle, to say, that because he satirised and painted hypocrisy truly, he was a blasphemer, and a profligate, as an author: and no man shall be permitted to assert . . . that Burns was a worthless wretch, if there be one untrammelled press in Scotland.24 24. Peterkin, "A Review of the Life of Robert Burns," prefixed to his revised edition of James Curry's Life and Works of Robert Burns, 3 vols. (Edinburgh: Macredie) 1:lxxvilxxviii. By an interesting coincidence, Peterkin's work on Burns happened to be read by De Quincey's friend Wordsworth, who dismissed Peterkin's literary pretensions in his Letter to a Friend of Robert Burns.25 25. Wordsworth replied that biographical details are "an incumbrance" to poetry; good poems "contain within themselves all that is necessary to their being comprehended" (London: Longman, 1816), pp. 18-19, 17. It is quite likely, therefore, that De Quincey knew of Peterkin through Wordsworth, long before he started writing for the Post. Two typical sentences from one of Peterkin's religious works will confirm that his prose is unlikely to be mistaken for De Quincey's: It rarely happens that there is any thing in the incidents of a Scottish clergyman's life to furnish materials for a posthumous Memoir that is likely to awaken interest in the public mind; for with some exceptions, the even tenor of his way, in the paths of clerical duty, and in the unobtrusive retirement of domestic society, presents but few of those vicissitudes and achievements which afford the most attractive materials of biography. Nor would the subject of the following notices perhaps have formed an exception from the common destiny of his brethren, if it had not been for the circumstances attendant on his separation from the communion of a body of Dissenters, after a connexion of many years, and his union to the Established Church of Scotland along with his flock,—and the melancholy fact of his sudden illness and death, within a few weeks after that reunion, while he was engaged in the public ministrations.26 26. "Biographical Memoir," in Peterkin's edition of Sermons by the Late Rev. John Johnston (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1834), p. 1. Directness of approach and long sentences with many subordinate clauses are obvious features of Peterkin's style. Two words which appear regularly in Peterkin, but almost never in De Quincey, are "cotemporary" and "betwixt;" Peterkin also uniformly used "Scottish" and "Scots" (but never "Scotch"). De Quincey, by contrast, always preferred "contemporary" and "between," and usually (though with some exceptions) preferred "Scotch" to "Scottish" or "Scots."27 27. To De Quincey, "cotemporary" seemed "vicious" ("Life of Richard Bentley," rpt. Works, 7:394). "[B]etwixt" occurs only once in De Quincey, where he cites the well-known epigram, "betwixt tweedledum and tweedledee" (rpt. Works, 5:69). "Scotch" appears many times in his known essays, and "Scottish" somewhat less. Peterkin's first main contributor was the Reverend Thomas Nelson or Neilson. Nelson's writings agree with De Quincey's in using "between" and "contemporary," but they differ in preferring "Scottish" to "Scotch." His work shows an earnest regard for respectability and convention, combined with little, if indeed any, interest in irony. The ending of his mammoth essay on "Religion" seems typical of the sobriety, directness, and authoritarianism of Nelson's prose: We beg once more to remind our readers, that the Scriptures contain both the history and the evidence of the true religion, as well as of the origin and the influence of that which is false. The idolatry which was introduced among the apostate children of men at Babel, is at this hour in full vigour throughout the greater part of Asia, and the remotest islands of the sea. Christianity, which is the consummation,—the grace and the truth of the religion of the patriarchs, and of the offspring of Israel, is happily the religion of our own highly favoured land, and of every country in which knowledge is cultivated, morality practised, and civilization attained. It is a religion admirably calculated to improve the understanding, as well as to purify the heart, and heighten the prospects.28 28. "Religion," Encyclopaedia Edinensis, 6 vols. (Edinburgh, 1827), 6.62-147 (147). The title-page of Nelson's Life of William Ritchie (Edinburgh: Waugh and Innes, 1830) identifies Nelson as the "author of a treatise on Religion . . . in the Encyclopaedia Edinensis." The other regular in the early months of the Post was the Reverend Milligan. Like Peterkin and Nelson, George Milligan used "betwixt," but he sided with De Quincey over "contemporary" and "Scotch." His known writings are direct and factual, with little patience for irony, amusement, or subtlety. The beginning of his Catechism of Greek Grammar seems typical in its ornate alliteration, Latin constructions, and laborious self-justification: Two Catechisms of Grammar,—the one of English and the other of Latin,—having been already published, the present Compilation was undertaken to complete the Series. The main object contemplated in drawing it up was to bring the leading principles of the language into as narrow a compass as is compatible with a due regard to perspicuity.29 29. (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1832), p. 5. As one editor remarked privately, Milligan's style "would not have been at all impaired by a little . . . simplicity."30 30. Robert Connel, letter to Oliver and Boyd, 15 Aug. 1830, NLS MS Acc. 5000, no. 195. "These strictures," Connel added, "I make with a thorough conviction of their being well founded." Milligan was "an ass," according to Blackwood's Magazine, because his writing—or "braying," as Blackwood's called it—combined "commonplace" thoughts with "insufferable arrogance."31 31. George Dunbar and E. H. Barker, "To the Editor of Blackwood's Magazine," Blackwood's, 31 (1832): 405-411. Milligan brought notoriety to the Post when his series on the "State of Greek Literature in Scotland" argued that "throughout the extent of the National Church" there were barely "a dozen clergymen who can read the New Testament" in Greek. "This state of things," Milligan warned in the Post, is peculiarly discreditable to a National Church. It was doubtless the intention of those who took an active part in establishing such endowments [for teaching Greek in Scotland], that they should not only promote the interests of true religion, but that they should also be the depositories of sound learning. The two ought, if possible, to be inseparably connected. They should ever go hand in hand. . . .32 32. "State of Greek Literature in Scotand", 5 Apr. 1828, p. 377. In 1832, George Dunbar described Milligan as "a licentiate of the Church" and "a writer of some notoriety in newspapers"; "A few years ago he published, in the . . . Post, a series of articles on the State of Greek Literature," in which he "thought fit to libel the . . . clergy of Scotland, by asserting that few . . . were capable of reading the Greek Testament" (letter, cited in note 31 above, p. 410). There seems little to differentiate the gargantuan sentences of Peterkin, Nelson, and Milligan. All three seemingly enjoyed wordiness for its own sake, but their complex syntax does not seem to reflect any corresponding complexity of thought. Ambiguity, depth of meaning, and conscious humour have little place. Perhaps De Quincey was recalling his co-workers at the Post when he later wrote humorously of the kind of writer who "regards a sentence in the light of a package." Into that "package," De Quincey says, such a writer crowd[s] as much as he possibly can. Having framed a sentence, . . . he next proceeds to pack it, . . . by enormous parenthetic involutions. All qualifications, limitations, exceptions, illustrations, are stuffed and violently rammed into the bowels of the principal proposition.33 33. "Elements of Rhetoric" (rpt. Works, 6:182). Elsewhere, De Quincey complains of the "endless and labyrinthine sentences" in the journalism in his time ("Style," rpt. Works, 12:21). The Post also had two occasional contributors in 1827. One was the retired soldier John Malcolm, who submitted a "roll" of manuscripts, from which his "much-valued friend" Peterkin selected a tale or poem about once a month.34 34. Editorial note, Post, 19 May, p. 15. Privately, Peterkin called Malcolm (1780-1835) "a particular friend of mine" (undated letter to the Earl of Minto, NLS MS 13344, f. 118). Malcolm's writings in the Post began with "Our Fathers—Where are They?" (19 May, p. 15), and "Sketches of Society: A Trip to Paris" (9 June, pp. 34-35). The first is signed "J.M.," and the second was reprinted by Malcolm in his Tales of Field and Flood (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1829), pp. 173-190. Malcolm was noted for blandness, and for what his admirers called "pure taste."35 35. "The late John Malcolm," Edinburgh Observer, rpt. Scotsman, 12 Sept. 1835, [p. 3]. "Mr. Malcolm was `the mildest mannered man' we ever had the pleasure to know" (obituary, Post, 12 Sept. 1835, p. 291). His known essays are emphatically Scottish, and always use "betwixt."36 36. For "betwixt," see Tales of Field and Flood, p. 29 and passim. Malcolm avoided both "contemporary" and "cotemporary." The second minor writer was the scholar William Hay, whose translations of classical poetry began in September 1827.37 37. Hay (c. 1790-1854) published four translations of classical poems in the 1827 Post: "Marathon," "Love," "The Thracian's Birth and Funeral," and "Leonora" (25 Aug., p. 123; 29 Sept., p. 167; 13 Oct., p. 183; and 20 Oct., p. 191). De Quincey, who knew him slightly, advised Hay to stop "throwing away his valuable time" by sending his "threadbare" essays to the Post.38 38. [De Quincey], "Plagiarism," Post, 3 Nov. 1827, p. 201 (rpt. Tave, pp. 181-183 [181]). Hay's only known review for the Post was an uninspired one (cited in note 7 above), arguing "That a phrenologist had a hand" in writing a certain novel (p. 167). Malcolm and Hay were the only contributors whose pieces were normally signed with their initials. Finally, each issue of the Post contained miscellaneous items like scientific paragraphs, gardening hints, local reports, legal essays, and dramatic notices. Most of these may be set aside from the present study, as it is unlikely they were written by De Quincey. The scientific reports were usually by William MacGillivray,39 39. See the review of MacGillivray's History of British Birds in North British Review 19 (1853): 1-44. "Engrossed" by minute researches in the digestive tracts of birds, MacGillivray was a strange, solitary man, with no literary pretensions (obituary, Edinburgh Journal of Natural History 54 [1853]: 189-206, passim). while the legal ones were by Peterkin and other lawyers.40 40. In his legal suit against Blackie (cited in note 9 above), Peterkin listed thirteen of his own articles in the Post. The list includes four legal articles, from "Civil Law" (17 Nov., p. 217) to "Law Changes" (15 Dec., p. 252) (SRO WRH CS239/Box 423 [n.p.]). For accounts of local sermons, speeches, trials, executions, and similar events, the paper normally sent one of its office-clerks to the scene.41 41. These tasks were "imposed" upon the paper's "compositors and clerks" ("The Reporter," Post, 4 Aug. 1827, p. 99). The weekly column on "The Drama," however, poses many problems. Some of these theatrical notices include occasional passages that seem like De Quincey's, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Part of the difficulty is that, on this one special subject, readers were invited to send in their own remarks. In the first issue, Peterkin drily explained that watching plays was a thing for which he and his initial contributors had "not much relish." "On this subject," he added, "contributions will at all times be acceptable, but should our volunteers be backward, our household troops will always be prepared for action."42 42. "The Theatre," 12 May, p. 6. During Peterkin's regime, theatrical criticism in the Post was moralistic in the extreme. Its first dramatic review, apparently written by Peterkin himself, amply demonstrates the prevailing tone of the paper: We went last night to see the exhibition, founded on the story of Frankenstein, which has found its way to our northern stage. It would have been a marvellous deviation from the ordinary moral laws of nature, if the daughter of Wm. Godwin and Mary Wolstoncroft, and the wife of Bysche Shelly, had written any sort of book . . . which was not characterised by something monstrous and extravagant— and, accordingly, her Frankenstein is the vehicle for imaginings the most outrageously monstrous and extravagant that ever were conceived by the human mind. The entire play, according to this critique, "is about the most disgusting we ever witnessed." "[A]ny one who purposes visiting our theatre, to see the monster," is advised "to look into the work from which it is dramatised [i.e., Mary Shelley's novel], before he go, or allow his family to behold the spectacle."43 43. "The Theatre," 2 June, p. 31. The critic seems to include Shakespeare and Byron among his objects of scorn: "Caliban [in The Tempest] is grace and loveliness—and [Byron's] Manfred is a tame and insipid caricature . . . when put in comparison with the monster of Mrs. Shelly. All the fancies of Shakespeare . . . are at least free from the audacious dream in which Mrs. Shelly . . . invests mortal man with the attributes which belong to the Creator. . . . " Peterkin's authorship is suggested by the editorial tone, and by the term "northern" (which appears strangely often in the Post; it was, I suspect, a sign of Peterkin, who spent many years in Orkney). With such contempt for drama, and for Mary Shelley's novel, it is not surprising that early issues of the Post pay little attention to theatre and literature. Many of its drama notices were likely written by "volunteers," none of whom can now be identified. Their comments were probably revised and polished by one of the paper's "household troops," including at times (I suspect) De Quincey.44 44. In one of the drama reviews, the following passage seems an obvious interjection by De Quincey: "Hazlitt, in one of his absurd and paradoxical speculations, has affirmed that the Hindoo jugglers are the first and most eminent of human beings, because their tricks and feats are both the most wonderful and the most perfect in themselves" ("The Public Amusements," 17 Nov. 1827, p. 223). This gratuitous mention of William Hazlitt (whom De Quincey knew from the London Magazine) echoes a review in the same issue of the Post, where De Quincey complains of Hazlitt's "eternal paradoxes" ("No. 55.—Edinburgh Review, No. 92," p. 222 [rpt. Works, 5.136]). Both allusions to Hazlitt are uncalledfor, and "paradoxical." But as it has no other clear signs of De Quincey, the drama review is relegated to Volume Twenty, where it appears in an Appendix with three other Post articles in which De Quincey's role seems similarly to be of uncertain extent. On 20 June 1827, Alexander Peterkin told a friend that the Post was "get[ting] on well enough considering that we are on the unpopular + antiministerial side."45 45. Letter to Captain Balfour, Orkney Archives, D2/5/10. The Post was "always Conservative in its politics," with an unflinching constitutional tone," rejoicing in "established institutions" of both church and state and quick to expose "the hollow pretensions" of its "Whig-Radical opponents."46 46. "The Newspaper Press of Scotland" (cited in note 20 above), pp. 567-568, passim. Yet although the Post was among the most reactionary journals in Britain, Peterkin himself privately sided with the reformers. In later years the paper vented a barrage of ridicule upon its first editor, whom it then referred to as "the man P—n,"47 47. "To Correspondents," Post, 15 Oct. 1831, p. 334, and 22 Oct. 1831, p. 340. or as "Peatreeking, Esquire, of Orkney."48 48. "The Evening Post and Earl Rat!", 29 Oct. 1831, p. 348. Peterkin was dubbed "Earl Rat" because the Post liked to pretend that the new Reform government in London had raised him to the peerage as a reward for years of hypocrisy in the newspaper press. His "title," conferred by the Post in 1831, was that of "Earl Rat Peatreeking, Esquire, of Orkney, &amp;c." (p. 348). In his counter-attack, Peterkin denounced "the vulgar patronising airs" of "the despicable Conductors" of his former paper, with their "scurrilities" and "infamous falsehood"; and he threatened a duel, should the Post persevere in its "impertinences" (advertisement, Edinburgh Weekly Journal, 26 Oct. 1831, p. 367). "Peatreeking" was, according to the Post in 1831, "a consummate slanderer and hypocrite," as well as an "infamous" and "malignant" "Rat."49 49. Advertisement, Edinburgh Weekly Journal, 2 Nov. 1831, p. 375. Moreover, in 1827 he was guilty of "political apostacy," the Post recalled, because he wrote in its columns in support of one political party while privately he supported the opposite party. "It was only from feelings of delicacy," the Post protested in 1831, "that we did not openly denounce" Peterkin "as a traitor in the camp—as a traitor to the duty which he had been hired to discharge."50 50. "The Evening Post and Earl Rat!" Peterkin's curt reply was not exactly as unambiguous as he tried to make it sound: "I have only to say, that I retract not one word of what I have written and published relative to your infamous trash in the Post. It is all a lie!" (advertisement, Edinburgh Weekly Journal, 2 Nov. 1831, p. 375). But in 1827 Peterkin concealed his sympathies to write in the Post in support of extreme Toryism, as that paper required. Although De Quincey's politics were a little closer to those of the Post, there is evidence that he, too, altered his political views when he wrote for Blackie's Post.51 51. Uneasiness over his political pieces is the likeliest explanation for De Quincey's silence about the Post in later years. As early as 1830, he began to back-peddle from the extremism of his Post years. "[T]he old arguments for excluding the Whigs" from power, he conceded, "strong and insurmountable as they were" in former years, "are departed" ("The Late Cabinet," Blackwood's 28 [1830]: 960-987 [965]). In his letter of June 20th, Peterkin mentioned that he was "preparing a defence of the Lords decision on the Corn bill agt. the Radicals." His resulting front-page article in the Post defended the House of Lords while dismissing "sentimental persons" who thought the Corn Laws were "robbing the poor of bread to eat."52 52. "Summary of News &amp; Politics," 23 June, p. 49. From this early stage, Peterkin's duplicity began to be a matter of comment in the local press. The Scotsman newspaper called his remarks "an amusing instance" of those who "think it a species of sacrilege" to doubt that the Duke of Wellington "is possessed of absolute wisdom"; the Scotsman then "assure[d] our readers most seriously" that Peterkin was, "out of his Post, as candid . . . a companion as can well be met with. But what may not the taking up of an unfortunate cause do?"53 53. Scotsman, 27 June 1827, p. 406. The next Saturday Peterkin defended his article against "our friends of the Scotsman." In a phrase that has implicatons for the study of De Quincey's contributions, he excused part of his article on the grounds that it was "not even transcribed by us, but cut out from another paper with a pair of scissors, according to use and wont in such cases."54 54. "Public Journals," 30 June 1827, p. 58. Most likely it was politics, not literature, that gave De Quincey his foothold with the Post. In the weeks between the Prospectus and the first number, the paper was embarrassed by a sudden change of government in London. In its Prospectus the Post defined itself as "sincerely attached to the present Government,"55 55. Prospectus (cited in note 13 above), p. 1. but unluckily, almost as soon as those words were in print, the Tory Cabinet of Lord Liverpool was replaced by a more liberal coalition led by George Canning. This meant that potential subscribers received an entirely wrong impression of the politics of the Post. The first number tried to put the record straight: "we had the remnant of Lord Liverpool's ministry in our contemplation, and little dreamt that in a few short days that remnant would be scattered."56 56. "Summary of News &amp; Politics," 12 May 1827, pp. 1-2. Perhaps this initial problem, combined with Peterkin's private radicalism, led the Post to look for someone better-acquainted with London politics, who could write leading-articles from a Tory viewpoint in the short time between six and seven o'clock every Saturday evening. De Quincey's previous newspaper work, and his knowledge of London, probably made him seem a good choice, despite his Englishness, his addiction, and certain literary interests that would prove anomalous in an Edinburgh newspaper. Many leading articles in the Saturday Post seem clearly De Quincey's, while others seem probably his, yet not demonstrably so.57 57. Tave's edition includes eight leading articles from the 1827 Post, starting with "[Mr. Canning's Death]" (18 Aug.). Volume Five of the new Works adds eight more leaders from the same period. De Quincey quite likely wrote most, or perhaps nearly all, of the weekly leaders in the Saturday Post from August 1827 onward. Considering the haste with which they had to be written (and the likelihood of their subjects being of limited interest to De Quincey), the difficulty in deciding whether some of the weekly leaders are his or not is understandable; it does not diminish the evidence that, in general, his interests, outlook, and style are extremely unlike those of the other writers at the Post. Luckily, De Quincey's book-reviews and other contributions on literary subjects did not have to be written so quickly. Their allusions and more ambitious effects of style make many of them about as unlike as possible from the mundane efforts of the other contributors. At first, the Post paid scant attention to literature of any kind, in spite of its proclamations to the contrary. The first three numbers held only five reviews, with the entire review section comprising less than two columns a week, on average. The two reviews in the first issue would never be mistaken for De Quincey's, for one uses "betwixt" while the other applauds the "earnestness" of "one of the best clergymen in the Church of Scotland." In the second number, one review uses the Scots word "cairn" and the other concerns a chemistry book by a local lecturer. The third Post featured only one review, which praises a Glasgow poet for his "high and holy purpose" of "giv[ing] us an eloquent . . . exposition of Calvinistic doctrine."58 58. Reviews, "No. 1. The Objects, Advantages, and Pleasures of Sciences," and "No. 2. Sermon on Cruelty to Animals, by the Rev. John Somerville," 12 May, p. 3; "No. 3. Memoirs of Zahir-ed-din Muhammed Baber," and "No. 4. Elements of Chemistry . . . by Edward Turner," 19 May, p. 15; and "No. 5.—The Course of Time, a Poem, by Robert Pollock," 26 May, p. 23. The other "literary" items in the early numbers were an untitled essay on Scots literature (cited in note 18 above), two Scots poems (p. 15), and a "List of Scottish Publications Betwixt . . . November 1826, and May, 1827" (p. 15). All fifty-two issues of the Edinburgh Saturday Post are paginated consecutively, from p. 1 to p. 416. These early reviews are by critics who, unlike De Quincey, shared the paper's dominant interests in Scottishness, piety, and science. All five early reviews have an unambitious quality, suitable to Peterkin's idea that "Our literary notices must . . . be brief." Readers of the Post, Peterkin explained, did not care for "lengthened analysis" of books, nor for "any thing like dissertation"; "It is sufficient for them to know that a book deserves perusal, or a place on the shelf; and the more simply this . . . is communicated the better."59 59. Review, "No. 6.—The Youth and Manhood of Cyril Thornton," 2 June, p. 31. The editorial tone seems to indicate Peterkin's hand. Fortunately for modern readers, the Post would soon loosen these self-imposed shackles, when De Quincey became one of its reviewers. Subscribers may have been surprised to find that the fourth issue devoted most of its space to an English book. Of the two reviews in this number, the first discusses "our national character," while using the Scots term "Provost" where an English writer would probably use "Mayor." But the second review, concerning the book Observations on Diet, is entirely English in perspective, and it helpfully uses the word "alderman" where a Scots writer would use the equivalent Scots term "baillie." (The position of "alderman" has never existed in Scotland; a helpful contrast may be observed between the Scots word "Provost" in the first review of this fourth issue and the English term "alderman" in the second review.) The critique of Observations on Diet seems to be the first article in the Post that can be safely ascribed to De Quincey. Its lightness and wit are in striking contrast with the piety or factuality of earlier reviews. "Eating," it begins, "is a very ancient custom, and from all we can observe, appears to be a universal one likewise." Among its many allusions (to, for example, Virgil, Cervantes, Molière, Bacon, James Thomson, and Cowper, none of whom had been cited before in the Post), there is one that I think places the attribution beyond reasonable doubt. The telling allusion is to an unnamed "amusing and witty writer," who "some time ago, in a London periodical, stood up as the advocate of the refinements of modern cookery."60 60. Reviews, "No. 6" (cited in note 59 above), and "No. 7.—Observations on Diet," 2 June, p. 31. The latter critique is reprinted, for the first time, in Works, 5:3-5. As well as being the first mention of any "London periodical" in a book-review in the Post, those words almost certainly refer to Charles Lamb's articles on food in the London Magazine of 1821-22.61 61. In his "Dissertation Upon Roast Pig," Lamb condemns the "obsolete custom" of "our ancestors," who "ate their meat raw," in contrast to modern fashion (London Magazine 6 [1822]: 245-248). In 1839, De Quincey praised Lamb's "Dissertation," with its whimsical "history" of cooking, as "the very best of all human stories" ("Dinner Real and Reputed," rpt. Works, 11:409-432 [412]). A modern reader might suspect that these hints of authorship, here and later in the Post, could have been concocted to benefit the paper by misleading readers into thinking that a given article was De Quincey's. But an understanding of the context of the Post will show how unlikely it is that the signs of De Quincey were other than genuine. In the first place, most subscribers in 1827 would not have known the identity of the southerner who wrote for their paper.62 62. His anonymity lasted until January 1830, when a London journal declared that he was "engaged regularly by the Post" ("Provincial, Scotch, and Irish Newspaper Press," Westminster Review, 12:69-103 [85]). In what appears to be its first mention of De Quincey, the Post replied, "It is true that `De Quincy is engaged regularly by the Post;' and we hope long to receive many able contributions from his pen" (review of Westminster Review, 16 Jan. 1830, p. 22). Secondly, any allusion which hinted at De Quincey's presence was almost always necessarily an English one. De Quincey had a few Scottish friends, it is true, but a reference to John Wilson, for example, would not have hinted his presence, in the way that allusion to his English friends like Charles Lamb or Wordsworth would. Thirdly, one suspects that the paper's respectable, devout, and proudly Scottish subscribers would not have been much amused to learn that many of its articles were by a certain "English Opium-Eater." What, then, was the purpose of the telling allusions like the one to Charles Lamb in the review of Observations on Diet? I suggest the answer lies with De Quincey's other publisher, William Blackwood. Blackwood, along with his chief advisor John Wilson, was reading the Post from an early date in 1827.63 63. For Blackwood's interest in the 1827 Post, see note 6 above. In the same year, Wilson told Blackwood, "If you . . . see Peterkin, tell him to put my Post into the Post on Saturday Night" (undated letter [watermark "1827"], NLS MS 4730, f. 117). The letter's references to the Foreign Quarterly Review imply a date of around August 1827. Unlike ordinary readers of the paper, Blackwood knew De Quincey, his situation, and some of his writings. He also met frequently with Wilson, who was probably De Quincey's closest friend in Edinburgh.64 64. De Quincey first met Wilson in 1808. They were close neighbours in Westmorland from 1814 to 1827. Many of the signs of De Quincey that probably went over the heads of ordinary readers would have been clear to Blackwood, especially with Wilson at hand. De Quincey, I suggest, wanted his more prestigious publisher, Blackwood, to know which articles in the Post were his, so that Blackwood would realize that De Quincey was supporting his interests, both literary and political.65 65. The Post was the only Edinburgh newspaper to share the extreme Toryism of Blackwood's Magazine. In 1834 Blackwood's commended "that able journal the Edinburgh Evening Post" for its political articles ([Archibald Alison], "Foreign Affairs," 36:507-523 [514]). The likeliest motive behind the telling allusions was to keep on the good side of William Blackwood, so as to enhance De Quincey's position with Blackwood's Magazine. The Blackwood's connection seems to me to be the only explanation for what otherwise seems a strange contradiction between the anonymity of De Quincey's work for the Post and his use of occasional telling allusions that would betray his presence to a few privatelyinformed readers. Most articles in the Post are clearly not De Quincey's. Some are manifestly by an ecclesiastic or a Scot, others are unlike him in style, vocabulary, or subject, and many are simply too short for attribution. But when those are set aside, many articles remain which appear to be the work of an Englishman, regularly employed by the paper, and more interested in literature than religion, science, or national pride. Several articles in this group refer in personal terms to De Quincey's friends in London or Westmorland. Many have a De Quinceyan style of wit and contain strong and concerted points of resemblance to works that are known to be his. Many also have explicit links to similar articles in the Post, which implies that they were written by the same person. Of course, it would be naive to think that a few Anglicisms, or a reference to one of De Quincey's friends, would amount to proof of authorship. But when an article in the Post has many links to his known writings, including one or two that point to him and to no one else, then I think his authorship is established beyond reasonable doubt, and to a degree equal to that by which other articles have long been attributed to him.66 66. The sentence is intended to refer to Stuart Tave's New Essays by De Quincey. Of the thirty-nine articles in that edition, ten (those beginning on pp. 60, 106, 129, 189, 197, 236, 247, 263, 346, and 388) are described there as "certainly" De Quincey's. Two others (on pp. 280 and 349) seem equally certain, on the basis of a manuscript in De Quincey's handwriting. A further two (see pp. 95 and 181) have been confirmed by external evidence (see my articles "De Quincey, William Hay, and the Edinburgh Saturday Post," American Notes and Queries 2 [1989], 135-136, and "De Quincey, David Robinson, and the Edinburgh Post," Notes and Queries n.s. 37 [1990]: 420). The rest of Dr. Tave's ascriptions have not been challenged in over three decades, and my research suggests they are unlikely to be challenged successfully in the future. After the piece on Observations on Diet, the reviews in the Post resumed their focus on Scottishness, science, and faith. A survey of the "Literary and Scientific Notices" over the next seven issues will show what the paper might have looked like if De Quincey had never joined it. The fifth issue had no reviews; its entire "Literary and Scientific" section was given over to an essay by John Malcolm and a report of a speech in Edinburgh by John James Audubon.67 67. "Sketches of Society" (cited in note 34 above), and "Natural History," 9 June, p. 35. Audubon was in Britain at this time to raise funds; he became a correspondent of the Post's MacGillivray. In the sixth number, all three reviews concerned religious books by Scots authors or editors.68 68. Reviews, "No. 8.—Constable's Miscellany," "No. 9—Religious Characteristics, by Thomas Aird," and "No. 10.—Specimens of Sacred and Serious Poetry, by John Johnson," 16 June, pp. 46-47. The seventh Post had no literary section at all. Issue number eight had three reviews, all Scottish; one was on Sir Walter Scott, the second was on a local scientist, and the third was on the Celtic Society. These were followed by extracts from an Edinburgh diary and assorted paragraphs on topics like "Theological Library."69 69. The reviews were: "No. 11.—The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte . . . by Sir Walter Scott," "No. 12.—Illustrations of Conchology . . . and A System of General Ornithology . . . by Captain Thomas Brown," and "No. 13.—Second Statement . . . of the Celtic Society," 30 June, pp. 62-63. In the ninth issue, one review praises the Scottish poems of William Tennant for their "national taste unmixed with anglified affectations," while the other review finds the work of Thomas Moore "too poetical for our cold northern taste." A poem, a second excerpt from an Edinburgh diary, seventeen miscellaneous paragraphs (on topics like "Liturgy of John Knox" and "Toothache"), and a list of recent Scottish publications bring this week's "Literary and Scientific Notices" to five columns.70 70. The reviews were: "No. 14.—Papistry Storm'd," and "No. 15.—The Epicurean," 7 July, p. 70. The next number had one review (of an encyclopaedia), followed by paragraphs on "Valuable Chemical Test," "Turnips," and the like, for a combined "Literary and Scientific Notices" of just two columns.71 71. The review was: "Encyclopaedia Britannica," 14 July, p. 75. For this issue only, the review pages were entitled "Scientific Notices," and the review itself was unnumbered. The eleventh number had two reviews, both of them extremely unlike De Quincey. The first, concerning London's Quarterly Review, happens to be the paper's first critique of an English journal. But this critic ignores every literary article in the Quarterly Review in favour of its sole religious article. As a result, all three columns of this very long piece are devoted to applauding the Quarterly's attack on the London Bible Society. The "hypocritical reptiles" who apparently "coiled themselves, and concealed their base purposes and practices from public execration" in the "glittering slough" of the London Bible Society, are berated at great length. Turning to the Edinburgh Bible Society, the Post critic pays a handsome "tribute" to its clergymen for their "characteristic energy" in exposing the "arrant quacks" of London. Readers would have inferred, from the designation of Scottish clergymen as "our countrymen," that the author of this piece was a Scot. The other review, on the same page, mundanely commends a book on the Highlands for its "patient research, and multifarious learning." With their Scottish interests and disregard of literary qualities, neither piece seems in any danger of being mistaken for De Quincey's. The same "Literary and Scientific" section for 21 July ends with a story by John Malcolm, an extract about Sir Walter Scott's biography of Napoleon, and the usual miscellaneous paragraphs, for a total of slightly over one page.72 72. The reviews were: "No. 16.—The Quarterly Review, No. 71," and "No. 17.—History of the Province of Moray, By . . . Dr. Shaw," p. 86. The extract on "Sir Walter Scott and Napoleon" was translated "from the French paper Constitutionel" (pp. 86-87). De Quincey's next three identifiable pieces were letters "To the Editor of the Edinburgh Saturday Post" in consecutive issues beginning 28 July. The letters (which were reprinted in Stuart Tave's edition) show some distinguishing features of De Quincey's work, as well as the problems he encountered. The first letter (in order of composition, but not of publication) tells of the Danish poet Klopstock, as seen through the eyes of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and others. Such a topic would have seemed totally unsuited for the Post. Peterkin set it aside for the present, but it eventually appeared in the paper, about three weeks after it was written. Although this piece is undoubtedly De Quincey's, it has one phrase that sounds suspiciously like an interpolation by the editor. The phrase is: "and hoping that I shall not offend any religious reader."73 73. "Klopstock, from the Danish," 11 Aug., p. 110 (rpt. Works, 5:20-27). The apparent interpolation appears in a passage translated from the Danish; but it has no basis in the original Danish (see Works, 5:24). Peterkin most likely encouraged De Quincey to try something more suitable. De Quincey's next letter, dated two days later, begins with a promise to "confin[e] myself" to subjects of "general attention." This second letter, concerning the latest issue of the Edinburgh Review, appeared in the Post on 28 July 1827, just one day after it was written. Its abrupt ending, which seems unlike De Quincey, was perhaps another of Peterkin's interpolations: Next week I shall trouble you with a paper at some length on this subject; for the present, I fear that I have already gone beyond the limits you prescribe to such communications.—Yours, very truly, Metacriticus.74 74. "No. 19.—Edinburgh Review, No. 91," 28 July, pp. 94-95 (rpt. Works, 5:6-10 [10]). The terribly pompous pseudonym similarly suggests Peterkin's hand in this final sentence and signature. Suspicions are strengthened by the following week's Post, where the review continues in the shape of an undated second letter. (All other letters in the 1827 Post are dated.) A lame introduction to the second letter seems likely to be another editorial intrusion: Sir,—According to my promise, I resume my letter on the last No. of the Edinburgh Review, for the purpose of commenting a little on its concluding article. . . .75 75. "Edinburgh Review: To the Editor of the Edinburgh Evening [sic] Post," pp. 102103 (rpt. Works, 5:12-19 [12]). The review of Observations on Diet and the three long letters were probably submitted on speculation, rather than being commissioned beforehand. When Peterkin received De Quincey's remarks on the Edinburgh Review, he decided to postpone a commissioned review of the same journal, which he received from another writer. As a result, the Post of 4 August must have seemed very odd, with the second half of De Quincey's remarks on the Edinburgh Review, as well as the original critique which had been bumped out of the previous week's paper, to make room for De Quincey's former remarks. In other words, three very long articles about the latest Edinburgh Review appeared in two consecutive issues of the Post.76 76. In fact, two other notices of the same Edinburgh Review appeared in the shape of front-page commentaries on 21 July (p. 81) and 4 Aug. (p. 97). These political discussions, which anticipate many points in De Quincey's two-part review, may have been either written in haste by De Quincey, or (more likely, in my opinion) written by Peterkin on the basis of hints from De Quincey. Extracts from the two preliminary pieces appear in Dr. Tave's notes (Tave, pp. 28-31). Peterkin apologized by saying that the original critique of the Edinburgh Review had been ready last week, but it was . . . superseded to give place to a communication from a very clever Correspondent, for whose strictures, however, the Editor of this Paper does not consider himself in any sense or degree responsible. Our readers must be aware, that in order to afford variety to a periodical publication, and to supply something to the taste of all the public, many papers . . . are inserted, of which it is quite impossible that the Conductors can be held to approve. So long as libellous, and indecent, and nonsensical matter is avoided, great latitude is, and ought to be allowed. . . .77 77. Editorial note (signed "ED."), 4 Aug., p. 102. It seems Peterkin had doubts about De Quincey from the start. From this point on, subscribers would have noticed a widening gap between the original Scottish contributors and the new English one. If the Post displayed qualms about its "clever Correspondent," so too did De Quincey have difficulty adjusting to the Post.78 78. Probably it was De Quincey who sent the Post a list of printer's errors in his first letter (rpt. Works, 5:414). Since the signature "Metacriticus" never re-appeared, he may have expressed a dislike of that pseudonym. Readers must have wondered why their paper now began to feature long witty reviews, citing English and European authors, after promising from the start to limit its reviews to short, straightforward notices of Scottish books. The Saturday Post was never commercially successful. Thomas Carlyle called it "the paltriest of all newspapers."79 79. Letter to Anna Montagu, 29 Nov. 1827 (Carlyle Letters 4:282). Other sources agree that the Post "could not be made to pay the expenses" in 1827: For a long while it was a losing concern. The unusually high price . . . was one great obstacle to its circulation. It soon reduced the price to sevenpence, but without any material increase in the sale.80 80. "Edinburgh and Glasgow Newspaper Press" (cited in note 22 above), p. 98. In its early months, the Post was a "dull" paper, and its editor Peterkin was little more than a "clumsy hypocrite and wretched driveller," according to a rival paper. Indeed, there seems to be some justification for that competitor's claim that Peterkin "cannot even . . . write down in plain English what he means to say." Small wonder that, under its first editor, "the Post [did] not calculate upon ever having occasion to print above 400 or 500" copies.81 81. Editorial note, Edinburgh, Leith, Glasgow, and North British Commercial and Literary Advertiser, 22 Sept. [p. 4]. These comments surely apply to Peterkin rather than to De Quincey; the Advertiser probably did not know that the Post now had a new editor. So "paltry" a paper would not have paid authors lavishly. Yet De Quincey's finances improved greatly during the time he worked for the Post. In a letter of 1829, he recalls coming to Edinburgh "in the summer of 1827" to "stave off . . . pecuniary embarrassments." He "continued . . . writing" in the city until June 1829, when his newfound prosperity allowed him to rejoin his family in Westmorland.82 82. Letter to Charles Knight, 23 July 1829, ptd. in Alice A. Clowes, Charles Knight: A Life (London, 1892), pp. 167-174, passim. De Quincey's only other known source of income during those two years was Blackwood's Magazine, but Blackwood's accepted only three of his articles during that time, and paid him only £34.83 83. He received £9 for "The Toilette of the Hebrew Lady" and £15 for "Rhetoric," both in 1828, and £10 for "The Duke of Wellington and Mr. Peel" in 1829 (Blackwood ledgers, NLS MS 30659). De Quincey's rising fortunes probably represented his payment for a good many articles in the Post, particularly in view of Carlyle's statement that the Englishman was "writing all day" for "the Saturday Post" in 1827. De Quincey was on his best behavior when he joined the Post. He did so well, at first, that he quickly took over Peterkin's position as editor. Peterkin's resignation appeared on 1 September: The Editor who has hitherto conducted this paper is prevented, by other avocations anl circumstances, from taking that charge on himself in future. The management of it is now in more able hands; and it will be conducted on the same principles as heretofore. He requests that those who have given their confidence and support to the Paper . . . will continue. . . . 84 84. Untitled notice (signed "P."), 8 Sept., p. 140. For the next notice signed "P.," see note 110 below. As far as the public was concerned, the new editor's identity remained a secret. At no time (so far as surviving evidence shows) did the Post ever declare that De Quincey had been its editor for a few months in 1827. A useful comparison may be made between two issues immediately before and after De Quincey became editor. Both numbers contain reviews of contrasting Scottish and English perspective. But in the Post of 1 September (the last of Peterkin's regime), the Scottish one is the first and longest. It also goes out of its way to mention "our [i.e., Edinburgh's] Military Academy" and "the contempt and ridicule with which Cockneys are regarded" in Edinburgh for their physiques. As Peterkin was an amateur athlete, this leading review was probably his.85 85. Review, "No. 27—Gymnastics . . . ," p. 134. For Peterkin's interest in this subject, see the DNB. Although De Quincey was not a "Cockney," he probably seemed the next thing to it to his colleagues at the Post. Moreover, De Quincey's smallness and unusual shape (with "almost no legs," as one unkind observer put it86 86. John G. Lockhart, letter to William Whitwell, 20 Oct. 1852, NLS MS 145, ff. 26-28. ) may have given the words in the Post an extra sting. The contempt for ill-shaped "Cockneys" may indicate some bitterness toward the Englishman who was taking Peterkin's job. In the same last issue under Peterkin, the middle review is about the Scottish Highlands, while the third and tiniest review concerns a book on London night-spots. This final piece (which is included in Volume Five of the Works) is certainly secular in its point-of-view. Probable signs of De Quincey include the indirectness and the urbane yet colloquial tone of the opening paragraph: We have seen many a better book than this—and a few worse. That it is not the very worst in the heap of resuscitated old rags which are so indefatigably poured forth in the present times is even some faint praise. Other signs include a sentence-fragment (a frequent device of De Quincey's), other colloquial phrases like "dip into," and the interest in "taverns, theatres, operas," and other "evening amusements" in "the vast metropolis" of London.87 87. Reviews, "No. 29. A Picture of Strathearn, By John Brown," and "No. 28. Every Night Book, or Life After Dark," 1 Sept., p. 134 (rpt. Works, 5:50). This brief and lighthearted review shows qualities that probably helped De Quincey to rise at the Post. Yet its off-hand mention of London as the "metropolis" (or capital city) sparked resentments that smouldered in the paper for some time. A Scots journalist, writing for a proudly Scottish paper, might call London the southern metropolis, British metropolis, or English metropolis, but would not likely call it simply "the" metropolis. Local custom is exemplified in the paper's Prospectus, where Edinburgh was called "the Metropolis of Scotland."88 88. Prospectus (cited in note 13 above), p. 1. From the date of this review onward, other contributors to the Post almost always used the term "metropolis" to denote the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, rather than London.89 89. "The Drama," 6 Oct., p. 175. The phrase re-appears in a dramatic notice of 19 April 1828 (p. 399). Another critic objected to an Edinburgh actress being "ranked among the `metropolitan powers' " of London ("The Drama," 3 Nov. 1827, p. 207). Other articles using "metropolis" or "metropolitan" to designate Edinburgh include "Leith Harbour" (3 Nov. 1827, p. 204), "Moscheles' Concert" (19 Jan. 1828, p. 293), "Moschele's Morning Concert" (2 Feb. 1828, p. 311), and "Scottish Academy" (9 Feb. 1828, p. 319). The next issue, dated September 8th, was the first one edited by De Quincey. Suddenly the "Literary and Scientific Notices" were without their usual scientific component. The reviews and other "literary" pieces now took up two full pages (as they would continue to do throughout De Quincey's regime), as compared with an average of less than one page previously. The liteerary columns for this week had two long reviews, the first of which was the new editor's critique of the September Blackwood's (which modern readers may recall from Dr. Tave's edition). Its beginning is indirect, amusing, and a fine example of the gallows humour De Quincey enjoyed: This is a good number. Yet, in one thing, we find a want—there is no politics. Conceive the disappointment of an old thorough-paced connoisseur in executions, after paying overnight a guinea for a front seat [by the gallows], and leaving his bed at six o'clock on a wintry morning, on finding all hushed and silent in the Old Bailey, and no sign of any `performance'. . . . The old gentleman . . . learns, with disgust, that a reprieve had reached Newgate . . .; and goes home muttering . . . about `mere swindling on the part of government.' Such feelings have we. . . .90 90. Review, "No. 30.—Blackwood's Magazine.—No. CXXX," p. 142 (rpt. Works, 5:55-60). "Old Bailey" and "Newgate" were a well-known London courthouse and prison, respectively. These remarks are an exercise in praising Blackwood's without appearing to do so. By the end of the first paragraph De Quincey concedes that the September Blackwood's is "excellent." With flattering allusions to his friend Wilson, as well as to Westmorland, to English authors Sir Thomas Browne and John Dryden, and to continental authors A. W. Schlegel and Germaine de Stael, this review probably seemed clearly De Quincey's to William Blackwood. On the other hand, both Blackwood and his associate John Wilson would know at a glance that the other long review for this week (with its wordy eulogy for an Edinburgh clergyman) was not by De Quincey: The distinguished talents, the upright character, and unaffected piety of the reverend Baronet had endeared him to his flock, while the rank which he held in society, combined with his unbending integrity, and the profound knowledge which he had of the laws and the constitution of the church, gave him an influence in our ecclesiastical Courts, which few comparatively have ever been able to exert. The third and fourth reviews in this issue seem too prosaic to be assigned to De Quincey (as well as too brief to be confidently assigned to any particular contributor).91 91. Reviews, "No. 31. The Resurrection of Believers . . ., By Andrew Thomson," "No. 32. Constable's Miscellany, No. XII," and "No. 33. Narrative of Don Juan Van Halens . . .," 8 Sept., p. 142. The rest of the literary section for 8 September consists of two long extracts, one about the Italian athlete Belzoni, whom De Quincey had seen, and the other about the poet James Thomson; both extracts might well have been chosen by the new editor, but proof it lacking. Then comes an essay by Malcolm on Scottish identity, followed by two letters to the editor, paragraphs on farming, and a poem.92 92. The extract entitled "Belzoni" is translated from the Annuaire Nécrologique (Post, pp. 142-143). There is evidence that some of the Post's extracts and translations from French journals were supplied by De Quincey. In one review, he implies he has been reading Le Globe "for the last three years" ("Foreign Quarterly Review," 15 Dec. 1827, p. 254 [rpt. Works, 5:169-175]). De Quincey's recollection of seeing Belzoni is in "Professor Wilson" (rpt. Works, 7:7). Without banishing Scottish or religious topics, De Quincey would continue to give priority to English and "literary" topics in the "Literary and Scientific" columns as long as he remained editor. De Quincey's review of the September Blackwood's was the first of four critiques of this magazine that he wrote for the Post.93 93. Stuart Tave's edition includes the reviews of the September, October, and December Blackwood's. The new edition accepts these attributions and adds the review for the November 1827 Blackwood's (Works, 5:121-122). Both journals would have been deeply embarrassed if it had become publicly known that these flattering reviews of Blackwood's were in fact written by someone who was himself a Blackwood's author. When we add that De Quincey also supplied far less flattering critiques of the Edinburgh Review (the main local rival to Blackwood's), I think it becomes clear that De Quincey, Blackwood's, and the Post all had much to gain by keeping his newspaper-work a secret as far as the general public was concerned. Neither the Post nor Blackwood's would likely tolerate articles that endangered De Quincey's anonymity, or implied that he contributed more often than he actually did. Allusions that strongly suggest De Quincey are therefore probably genuine, because the paper would only have harmed itself if reviews in the Post had been fabricated to look like De Quincey's. Subscribers may have been puzzled, on reading their Post of 15 September 1827, by De Quincey's essay on Robert Owen. Perhaps they wondered why a Welsh-born social philosopher who lived mainly in Scotland should be condemned for forgetting "our English ideas of civil liberty."94 94. "Owen of Lanark," pp. 148-149 (rpt. Works, 5:61-67). To William Blackwood, however, the English allusions (including some to Wordsworth) may have quietly conveyed De Quincey's authorship. Turning to the "Literary and Scientific" pages, readers would have found few signs of the new editor. The first two reviews are theological, and the third discusses a poet in sentimental terms that are unlike De Quincey. Only the fourth and final review, in this third issue under De Quincey, is included in Volume Five. It concerns a drama, King James I. of Scotland, by the Scottish playwright David Erskine. With its unmistakably English perspective (mentioning London theatres and London authors), its irreverent use of "thee" and "thy," and its high-spirited mockery of a respected local author, this piece is an early symptom of the deepening rift between De Quincey and his colleagues. Other signs of De Quincey (discussed in the relevant headnote in Volume Five) include the word "contemporaries" and the rare Shakespearean word "forgetive." Shakespeare "wrote because his soul was full," the critic says, and his brain quick, forgetive, and overflowing—and so it is with thee, Captain David Erskine of the York Rangers, Fellow of the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh, and . . . of the Scottish and Border Society. Happy man! . . . Far be it from us . . . to obtrude on thy silent satisfaction—enjoy to the full thy production—may no other person officiously attempt a participation of thy pleasure, but mayest thou be the sole reader of thy tragedy—and . . . the sole critic too.95 95. Reviews, "No. 34. A General View . . . of Public Education in France, by David Johnston," "No. 35.—The End of our Being . . ., By David Dickson," "No. 36.—The Life of Karl Theodor Korner . . ., By G. F. Richardson," and "No. 37. King James I. . . ., By Captain D. Erskine," pp. 150-151. "[F]orgetive" (meaning: creative) is a Shakespearean coinage (see The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth, in William Shakespeare, Complete Works, gen. eds. Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986], 4.2.96). In case the piece on Korner might be suspected of being De Quincey's (from his interest in German literature), one might note that it naively depicts that "enthusiastic" poet composing his final poem as he lay dying on the battle-field: "he sang his song of war on the tented field . . . amid the din of conflict." The next week's literary section has almost no sign of De Quincey. For some unknown reason, its first column is occupied by a letter about sea-levels on the continent. The letter consists of only one sentence, followed by a long extract from the Literary Chronicle. Such a lacklustre start looks suspiciously like a last-minute substitute for a promised review by a regular contributor— such as, perhaps, the editor himself. Two bland reviews ensue, one praising James Montgomery's "great deal of very beautiful poetry" for its "religious feelings," and the other praising a Glaswegian's Treatise on the Use of the Blow Pipe. Then comes a letter from Walter Scott (reprinted from the Edinburgh Weekly Journal), followed by an ominous letter to the editor of the Post, complaining of English phrases like "High Court of Chancery in England" and "the Bank of England."96 96. The reviews were: "No. 38.—The Pelican Island, and other Poems, By James Montgomery," and "No. 39.—A Practical Treatise . . ., By John Griffin"; the letters were: P.L., "Level of the Sea; To the Editor . . .," "Sir Walter Scott to General Gourgaud," and X.Y., "Consigned Money; To the Editor . . .," 22 Sept., pp. 158-159. The article containing those phrases, two weeks earlier in the Post, had been reprinted from an unnamed source, but it was quite likely selected by De Quincey; the eight words which introduce it (i.e., "We copy the following article from a contemporary") were therefore probably written by De Quincey, although proof is lacking.97 97. "Consigned Money," 8 Sept., p. 139. The editorial tone and "contemporary" suggest De Quincey, but so brief a passage would be difficult to attribute with confidence. The same "Literary and Scientific Notices" of 22 September contain a second letter of complaint, this time over De Quincey's piece on Robert Owen. "Permit me to express my surprise," the letter austerely remarks, "that a person so well versed in . . . political economy . . . should assert that Mr. Owen's `delusions' have been hitherto subjected to no examination."98 98. B., "Mr. Owen of Lanark; To the Editor . . .," p. 159 (rpt. in the notes to De Quincey's reply, Works, 5:345-346). Perhaps "B." was the owner of the Post, David Blackie. Owen's "delusions," the letter points out, had in fact been criticized by Thomas Malthus years before. A contrite reply from the editor concedes that "The reproof of our Correspondent is just." That apology is the only part of the literary section of 22 September which seems to be De Quincey's.99 99. Unsigned editorial note, pp. 158-159 (rpt. Works, 5:79). In the absence of proof, it may be speculated that he supplied a long review, which he expected would appear at the head of the literary columns but which offended Blackie, perhaps for reasons related to the letters of complaint. Perhaps then, at the last moment, the letter on rising sea-levels was inserted, in place of a leading review by De Quincey. The poor quality of this number, and the two complaints from readers, suggest that the new editor was not doing very well at this point. The sea, it seems, was indeed rising for Thomas De Quincey.100 100. Another possibility, that he failed to write a promised review, seems less likely in view of the seriousness of the complaints and the sombre tone of De Quincey's rejoinder (cited in note 99 above). "Upon B.'s information," De Quincey replies, with uncharacteristic humility, "we shall now make it a point of our duty . . ." (rpt. Works, 5:79). Next week, the editor made a better showing. The first review was his amusing essay on the October Blackwood's. Slightly short of a full page in length, it has many signs of authorship, beginning with allusions to Lamb, Wordsworth, and Coleridge. Of the two other reviews on 29 September, one was by William Hay, and the other was a brief notice of a biography of Dr. Jenner.101 101. Reviews, "No. 40.—Blackwood's Magazine, No. CXXXI" (rpt. Works, 5:88-97), "No. 41.—Confessions . . ." (cited in note 7 above), and "No. 42.—The Life of Edward Jenner . . .," pp. 166-167. Four miscellaneous paragraphs (on Egypt, mental illness, the Monmouth Rebellion, and the Scots painter David Wilkie) brought the "Literary and Scientific Notices" to nearly seven full columns. The political pages for 6 October contain De Quincey's article on "Waste Lands and Emigration" (familiar to readers of Tave's edition), but the literary section has few signs of De Quincey. Once again, there is no leading review. The "Literary and Scientific Notices" begin with an extract on the dramatist Ugo Foscolo, "from a London periodical." As De Quincey was interested in Italian literature and may have met Foscolo (who lived in London), the extract was possibly chosen by him. A tale by John Malcolm and a perfunctory review of the Naval and Military Magazine complete the literary section.102 102. "Ugo Foscolo," M., "Miseries of a Bachelor" (rpt. as "The Bachelor" in Malcolm, Tales of Field and Flood, pp. 239-247); and review, "No. 43.—Naval and Military Magazine, No. III," p. 174. The next issue had three reviews. The one on "Italian Opera in England" is perhaps De Quincey's, since opera was an interest of his, but there seems to be no clear evidence one way or the other. Unless a piece has specific signs of Dr Quincey, it is not included in Volume Five. The second review for 13 October was surely by one of the more pious Postmen, as it "earnestly recommend[s]" a book on missionaries "to the perusal and serious consideration of our readers."103 103. Reviews, "Musical Reminiscences of an Old Amateur," and "No. 45.—Review of the State of Missions . . .," 13 Oct., p. 182. For some unknown reason, the first review is unnumbered. Only the third review, concerning the book Tales of all Nations, has features pointing to De Quincey and no one else at the Post. This piece is reprinted for the first time in Volume Five. Its point-of-view is English and literary (with allusions to several English novelists), and its beginning is informal, indirect, and metaphorical: We do not like long stories either in books or in conversation, and consider it a very heavy tax on the time and the purse, and the temper of a gentle reader, to be obliged to wade through three or four volumes . . . while the author is taxed both in brains and penmanship, to spin out a very slender thread. . . . Aversion to "long stories" was one of De Quincey's crochets (and one which, judging from the longwindedness of other contributors, was not widely shared at the Post). The appeal to pleasure as a basis for judgment again suggests De Quincey, since most critics in the paper tended to judge by religious or patriotic criteria. A hint of self-mockery in the ending may have been Editor De Quincey's attempt to disarm certain criticisms of his recent articles on political economy: We like novels. They are a positive necessary of intellectual life; but whether primary or secondary, we leave to the economists to settle. Let us, by all means, have new novels—but let them be short. . . .104 104. Review, "No. 46.—Tales of all Nations," p. 182 (rpt. Works, 5:107). De Quincey confirms his aversion to "long stories" in many essays, including his "Professor Wilson" (Works, 17:37) and "[Cornillon's Dictionnaire and the Teaching of Languages]" (Works, 5:161). Next week's paper carried De Quincey's "Disciples of Mr. Malthus" (again familiar to readers of Tave) as its political leader. But its two reviews are too pedestrian, uncritical, or pious for De Quincey. The first lauds a minor Scots poet for his "very sweet poetry," while the second praises a minor novelist for her "Christian principles" and "examples of piety so useful"; "While she writes in an agreeable style, shewing a mind deeply imbued with the elegant literature of her native language, she, at the same time, discovers an intimate knowledge of the Holy Scriptures." (These praises for a now-forgotten novelist contrast with the vituperation heaped on Mary Shelley and Frankenstein, earlier in the Post.) The two reviews, and the usual assortment of extracts and correspondence, brought the "Literary and Scientific Notices" to six colums; other items, elsewhere in the same issue, brought its "literary" content to almost nine columns.105 105. The reviews were: "No. 46.—Fitful Fancies, By William Kennedy," and "No. 47.— Scenes of Life: or, the Influence of Religion, By Mrs. Barber," 20 Oct., p. 190. Other "literary" items include a letter from Walter Scott to Adam Ferguson (dated 2 Aug. 1827; rpt. from the Edinburgh Weekly Journal), pp. 190-191, an essay by De Quincey on London newspapers ("Disciples of Mr. Malthus," p. 188 [rpt. Works, 5:109-110]), and a poem (cited in note 37 above). The following Saturday, 27 October, saw the editor's long essay on London's Quarterly Review and Standard newspaper dominating the political pages of the Post. If he read this article, William Blackwood almost certainly would have spotted De Quincey's presence through its Ricardian economic doctrines, which are unusual for a Tory paper. As Blackwood, himself a conservative, told a friend a few weeks later, "one may as well attempt to overturn a mountain" as try to dissuade De Quincey from his "Ricardo notions."106 106. Copy of a letter to David Robinson, 3 Dec. 1827, NLS MS Acc. 5643/B7, f. 346. Turning to the "Literary and Scientific" pages, both reviews this week were unlike De Quincey: the one concerns the Scottish Jacobites, and the other naively praises a collection of "very pretty" poems.107 107. Reviews, "No. 48.—Constable's Miscellany—History of the Rebellion in 1745, by Robert Chambers," and "No. 49.—The Casquet of Literary Gems," 27 Oct., p. 198. After so many complaints and other signs of failure during his two months as editor, De Quincey may have been relieved to return to being a regular contributor.108 108. A further complaint, from a religious reader, is discussed in " `Climbing the Post' " (cited in note 4 above). Nothing speaks more eloquently of his failure than the fact that Alexander Peterkin came back to his old position. Yet De Quincey must have had some success, for he rose again to become the paper's co-editor the following summer.109 109. An informed source says that Crichton "commenced his connection with the newspaper press in 1828, by editing (at first in conjunction with De Quincy), the Edinburgh Evening Post" (obituary, in Edward Walford, Hardwicke's Annual Biography for 1856, p. 198). Volume Six of the Works confirms that De Quincey and Crichton became co-editors of the Evening Post in 1828 (pp. 193-195). Peterkin's return was heralded on 3 November 1827.110 110. An editorial note, signed "P.," addressed to "respected friends in Zetland," is the first sign of his return ("Whales," 3 Nov., p. 201). As an advocate for the whalers, Peterkin gained notoriety in 1822 by arguing that whaling should be allowed on Sunday: his bon mot, "that the whales would not wait till the Monday," was pondered in respectable circles for at least two decades (see "Current Objections," Presbyterian 1 [1843]: in.). As might be expected, the literary section for that issue begins with a "Scottish" review, followed by an "English" review, The first, a long patriotic eulogy of Sir Walter Scott, commends that novelist for "shed[ding] a glory on our country." "[O]ur wizard of the North," we are told, "conjures up a host of . . . pictures," "from the depths of his own splendid imagination," "of which every Scotsman is so justly proud." The other main review, concerning the November Blackwood's, has the wit, humour, and lightness of touch that distinguish De Quincey's work in the Post. With references to English, German, and Italian authors, this second review would (I suggest) have been easily recognized as De Quincey's by a grateful William Blackwood.111 111. Reviews, "No. 50.—Chronicles of the Canongate," and "No. 51.—Blackwood's Magazine, No. 132," p. 206 (rpt. Works, 5.121-122). For the rest of 1827 the Post continued with Peterkin at the helm. De Quincey was mainly, but not completely, confined to politics. In case readers were still upset by the Anglicized tone of some recent reviews, the three critiques for 10 November were all clearly Scottish. The first mentions King "James the Sixth" of Scotland, the second singles out two Scots writers (from a list of British writers) as "poets of our own country," and the third commends a Scottish farming-magazine for its "national point of view."112 112. Reviews, "No. 52.—Ancient Ballads and Songs, By Thomas Lyle," "Literary Annuals: No. 53.—The Souvenir, Forget-me-Not, Amulet, &amp;c.," and "No. 54.—The Scots Agricultural Magazine," p. 214. All three reviews are too effusive for De Quincey. The first flatters an "elegant" book of "very pretty" ballads; the second hails the "sweet" strains of John Malcolm and the "tender and elegant" ones of Elizabeth Hemans; and the third says, "No subject is of greater interest than . . . agriculture." In the next three issues, a prominent notice above the literary columns announced a return to "our original proposal, of constituting the `SATURDAY POST' a Regular Chronicle of National Literature." Priority would again be given to literature "connected with Scotland." From now on, the Post declared, "Every new work which issues from the Scottish Press" would be "regularly noticed."113 113. "Notice," 17 Nov., p. 222 (rpt. Post, pp. 230, 238). Under this arrangement Peterkin apparently did most of the reviewing, but De Quincey was sometimes assigned to reviews where his English sympathies would be less of a detriment. The Post of 17 November contained the first half of his critique of the newest Edinburgh Review, with important reflections on Burke and Kant. His remarks on the young Carlyle as a "man of genius"114 114. Reviews, "No. 55" (cited in note 44 above), and "Edinburgh Review, No. 92," 24 Nov., p. 230 (rpt. Works, 5:133-137). probably played a part in De Quincey's becoming "almost a friend" (as Carlyle put it) with Thomas and Jane Carlyle. A few days after those words appeared in the Post, De Quincey paid his first visit to the Carlyle home, where he "sate till midnight" talking about German literature, poverty, and "the King of Donkies" at the Post.115 115. Letter (cited in note 3 above). The letters of Thomas and Jane Carlyle contain no other references to Blackie; nor do they mention anyone else at the Post except De Quincey. In December the Post featured De Quincey's critiques of the latest Blackwood's Magazine and Foreign Quarterly Review (both accepted as De Quincey's since Dr. Tave's edition). Two other reviews from December seem vaguely like De Quincey, but conclusive evidence is lacking. Both are English and "literary" in their terms of reference, yet they lack any specific indication that would settle the issue. Although excluded from Volume Five, they are mentioned here in case future researchers uncover new evidence. The first, on Charlotte Bury's novel Flirtation, briefly discusses "fancy and imagination" and "the picturesque."116 116. Review, "No. 66.—Flirtation; A Novel," 1 Dec., p. 238. The other, about a book on gas-lighting, uses "between," describes London as "the metropolis," and speaks of the "Mayor of London" "in the days of Henry V."117 117. Review, "An Historical Sketch of the Origin, Progress, and Present State of Gaslighting. By W. Matthews," 22 Dec., p. 262. Reviews ceased to be numbered after 8 December. If these two very straightforward reviews were De Quincey's, they show him in uninspired moments, perhaps when he was rushing to meet a deadline.118 118. "I move slowly," De Quincey told Blackwood, "whenever I am uncommonly witty. Nevertheless, if you are more particular about quantity than quality, I am perfectly ready to oblige you by changing my style." If "dull reviews" were needed, De Quincey could "produce" them "as fast as you please" (undated letter, NLS MS 4006, f. 169). Near the end of December De Quincey almost certainly played a role in reviewing Allan Cunningham's romance Michael Scott. The first paragraph is far too saccharine (with flattery of "sweet and plaintive ballads"), and the second is too Scottish. But in the last sentence of the second paragraph, the tone lightens. This, and the ensuing final paragraph, seem likely additions by De Quincey. Evidence includes the stress on pleasure, conversational phrases like "to wade through," and personal allusions to Cunningham, whom De Quincey knew from his London Magazine days. Perhaps an original draft of this review was handed to De Quincey, on account of his knowledge of the London poet. De Quincey possibly then shortened the original remarks to make room for his own more critical conclusion: It is a dreary thing to wade through three volumes of witches, warlocks, and hobgoblins, even as described in the flowing language, and illuminated by the bright fancy and poetic fire of the most gentle, simple, and highly gifted Allan Cunningham. We have said that there are many ballads and pieces of poetry interspersed: these are in Allan's best stile, and one or two of them we think we have met with before. We could extract many individual passages from the prose, too, of great power and beauty; and one whole chapter, the 9th of vol. 2d, where James sees pass before him the great and the famous who have lived since his day to the present times, which is not without considerable interest. But want of room obliges us to waive these for the present.119 119. Review, "Michael Scott; A Romance . . .," 22 Dec., p. 262. The style and outlook here suggest De Quincey, especially in the sentence beginning "It is a dreary thing." But is his part limited to one sentence, or does it include all or much of the final paragraph too? Because of the uncertainty in fixing the limits of De Quincey's contribution, this piece, too, is excluded from Volume Five.120 120. Like other articles in the Post in which De Quincey most likely played a role, yet where the precise limits of his contribution appear impossible to ascertain with confidence, the review of Michael Scott is relegated to the Appendix in Volume Twenty of the Works (see note 44 above). Many questions still surround the Edinburgh Saturday Post, and De Quincey's changing role in it. On the one hand, his anomalous position renders some of his pieces fairly easy to identify. On the other hand, there is a small but undeniable grey area consisting of articles which may or may not be his, or in which he played a role that cannot be precisely defined at present. The uncertainties will probably remain, unless new information comes to light.</field>
