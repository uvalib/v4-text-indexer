      <field name="fulltext">THE GIFT of the Richard Henry Lee Papers to Mr. Jefferson's uncompleted University Library one hundred and twenty-two years ago was the first of the many gifts which in the second quarter of the twentieth century have resulted in making the University a center for historical studies. In that first session of the University, the Founder was occupied in assembling for the library a collection of books which, though not the largest in America, would he hoped be second to none in value. Under his exacting supervision, funds for the original library were doled out only for the choicest editions; and even before his appropriation was fully spent, he began issuing in the newspapers appeals for library gifts. Acknowledging donations of books from "public spirited citizens" of Boston and London, as well as of Virginia, he assured prospective donors, in a notice of April 28, 1825, that "their talent shall not be hidden in the earth". It is to such public spirited citizens that the University owes the rapid expansion of its historical collections during the two years covered by this report. Virginians, alumni, and other friends of the University have, during this two-year period, increased its manuscript collections to a total figure in excess of two million pieces. To donors, to depositors, to those who have lent their family papers for photographing, as well as to those who have preferred to sell their historical materials within the state of their origin, the University has no means to express adequately its gratitude— except to assure them that their talent shall not be buried. Space does not permit individual acknowledgment, but a list of these generous friends is appended at the end of this report. A second appendix and the section headed "Newspapers" acknowledge the indispensable assistance of individual editors and publishers in the state-wide program for the preservation of Virginia's newspapers (the most essential to the historian of all printed records). In a later report an effort will be made to sketch in some detail the history of the historical collections. The present one must be concerned primarily with recent developments. The disastrous fire of 1895, which destroyed four-fifths of our books, left intact the Lee Papers, the Jefferson Papers, and the University Archives. These today form the nucleus of the historical collections. James Madison's library, except for his pamphlet collection and a few volumes, was consumed in the flames, but his signature appears often in the earlier archives, along with those of Jefferson, Monroe, Joseph C. Cabell, and the other co-founders. The systematic and continuous assembling of a great research collection around the nucleus groups just mentioned was initiated on its present scale soon after the appointment of the present Librarian in 1927. Three years later a Virginia Collection was established in a separate wing of the library, and the first archivist began his work. The ambitious collecting program that followed did much to check the flow of Virginia historical materials to other states. By 1938 nearly a quarter of a million manuscripts had been assembled, and made available to researchers almost as rapidly as they were acquired. Following the erection of the Alderman Library in that year, the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts was organied to house and administer the principal historical materials, including the two collections of Virginiana which memorialize the late Elizabeth Cocke Coles and Alfred Henry Byrd. This, coinciding with the gift of the Tracy W. McGregor Library, with its distinguished holdings in southeastern American history, made possible a broadening of the scope of the historical collections. The rate of acquisition was also rapidly accelerated by the drawing power of a modern fireproof repository, and stimulated by the formation in 1940, with the active cooperation of the library, of the Albemarle County Historical Society. The collections described in the following pages were acquired between June 30, 1945, and June 30, 1947. The librarian's statistical report for the first of these dates showed a total figure for manuscripts of 1,591,984 pieces. That number has now increased to 2,109,700. The growth of the collections of broadsides, maps, newspapers, and prints and pictures has also been striking. Descriptions and statistics for these appear later in the report. The historical, literary, and bibliographical significance of many of these materials gives assurance that current growth has not been entirely quantitative. During the war years the library had the privilege of housing not only the Union Catalogue, but also an extensive deposit of manuscripts from the Library of Congress, placed here for safekeeping. Even at our present rate of growth, it will doubtless be some time before we can recover the proud sense of custodianship which we then enjoyed. War conditions and post-war readjustments have caused some delay in the printing of the Division's publications, as well as in the archival field work, which was considerably restricted until the war ended. In August 1945 the fourteenth annual report, for the year 1943-44, was issued. Normally the fifteenth and sixteenth reports would have been issued together the following year to bring the reports up to date. At the end of 1945, however, the library had the misfortune to lose the services of the Archivist, who resigned to accept another post. The fifteenth report, covering his final year, was therefore issued separately in 1946. A cumulative index to the fifteen reports covering his period of distinguished service has recently been issued. In future reports, pagination will be continuous for five-year periods, with an index in every fifth report. The other principal publications of the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts for the two-year period have been the two McGregor publications: Iron Works at Tuball, edited by Lester J. Cappon, and A Proclamation for Setling the Plantation of Virginia, edited by Thomas Cary Johnson, Jr. Two others are pending, one in press and another in process of editing. Two stimulating post-war developments which center in the Division are the McGregor Room Seminars in Contemporary Prose and Poetry and the University of Virginia Bibliographical Society. Upon the return to the staff of war-time absentees in December, 1945, the Division was partially reorganized to facilitate the administration of its expanded holdings. The photographic laboratory was placed under the supervision of the Acquisitions Librarian; responsibility for the map collections, as well as for the collections of prints and pictures, was assumed by the Curator of Rare Books; with the archives and manuscripts, the newspaper and broadside collections, and the major portion of the field work, assigned to the Curator of Manuscripts. A final word as to this report. It is prepared by various members of the staff, and its introduction is signed by the Curator of Manuscripts, who is responsible for its shortcomings. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr. July 1, 1947</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES MOST ENTRIES describe the manuscripts of a single acquisition, all the items in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. Dates in parentheses following names are birth and death dates. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725(1900)-1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791(1840-1860)1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. Abbreviations, MS for manuscript, ALS for autograph letter signed, etc., are those in common use. Numbers which appear at the end of each heading are accession numbers, included for their convenience to the library staff. As used in this report, "manuscripts" are the handwritten letters or other personal papers of individuals or families; "papers" are the manuscripts of a public officer, and are official or semi-official in character; "archives" are the official records of an institution; and "collections" are deliberately assembled groups, such as autograph collections. Non-manuscript material, other than books, acquired for the historical collections will be found under the following headings: Broadsides, Maps, Newspapers, and Prints and Pictures (in this report an unusual archive of original drawings is entered under the name of the artist, Frederick Otto Seibel). Under University of Virginia a statement regarding the University's archives is given. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>

Gifts, deposit, and the Coles Collection. No. 2225. The University's own collection of some 2,000 original manuscripts of Jefferson is supplemented by a very extensive collection of transcripts, including photographic copies of the great Jefferson collections at the Library of Congress and the Massachusetts Historical Society, as well as photostats and microfilm from many of the lesser repositories of Jefferson's papers, and from hundreds of private owners of individual manuscripts. The conspicious gap in our transcripts collections is the great body of material at the National Archives which is now being filmed for the use of Dr. Julian P. Boyd and his associates in the editing of Jefferson's writings. For students of Jefferson and his times the University's most useful tool is the Jefferson Checklist, a card file, chronologically arranged, listing more than 50,000 Jefferson papers in print and in manuscript. The Checklist was begun twelve years ago as a reference tool, and to make possible a more complete publication of Jefferson's writings, a project which was visualized as a cooperative one among the Jefferson libraries, supported by Congress, to mark the Jefferson Bicentennial in 1943. World War II intervened. The generous support of the New York Times has now revived the project, and the editorial work goes forward at Princeton University, where no Jefferson manuscripts exist, but where a collection of photostats even more extensive than our own is being assembled. Through the cooperation of the Editor and his associates, our Jefferson Checklist will be enlarged and made available also at the Library of Congress and at Princeton. Photostats recently received by this library come from the collections of the American Embassy in Paris, Mrs. Alfred R. Berkeley, Jr., Newton B. Drury, Wayne M. Hart, Robert G. Hopkins, the Henry E. Huntington Library, Mrs. Gamble Latrobe, Jr., the Library of Congress, Francis V. Lloyd, Arthur W. Machen, the Massachusetts Historical Society, Mills Miller, Thomas D. Murphy, Dr. Mary Parmenter, Mrs. Laird U. Park, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Charles Porter III, Garnett Ryland, and James B. Twyman. Among the new photostats are an extensive group of architectural drawings for Monticello, Poplar Forest, and the Virginia State Capitol; portraits and cartoons of Jefferson; views of Monticello; scenes in Jefferson's life; a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence and its signatures; Joseph Boze's miniature of Martha Jefferson in the American Embassay at Paris; a survey of Jefferson's lands in Albemarle County, Va.; metrical annotations by Jefferson on Horace's poems; a bill of sale, 1829, for the books from Jefferson's library purchased at the Poor Sale, in Baltimore, by L.

The map collections of the University in the immediate post-war years have taken several new directions. There has been a very large expansion not only in size but in interests. Formerly centered almost exclusively around historical studies, the expansion of the University's curriculum in both foreign affairs and in advanced geographical studies has demanded new map collection developments. The Library has become one of the chief depositories of the Army Map Service and received in the period from 1945-1947 from this agency 17,722 maps; from the U. S. Weather Bureau 14,935; from all sources 35,544, bringing the total holdings to 48,580 maps. The historical interests have not, however, been neglected, and two of the most significant historical additions of the period were maps, both to the McGregor Library. One of these, Christopher Colles' A Survey of the Roads of the United States of America, 1789, was the first American road map; it covers the east coast area between New York and Virginia in 83 sections, showing the post routes, taverns, etc., of the day. The copy is an exceptionally fine one, including the prospectus, and may be the most perfect one surviving. The other very exceptional item is the first edition of the famous Bishop Madison map of Virginia, a map so rare that Swem in 1914 had seen no copy and had the title only from the Harvard copy. Other Virginia maps acquired for the Coles Collection and the McGregor Library include: Virginia item et Floridae, Mercator and Hondius, [1638]; Virginia Partis Australis, Montanus, [1671]; Carte Particuliere de Virginie, de Fransche Neptunus, [1700]; Partie Meridionale de la Virginie, Covens and Mortier, [1729]; A Draught of Virginia from the Capes to York in York River and to Kuiquotan or Hamton in James River, Mark Tiddeman, [1755]; Carte de la Louisiane, Maryland, Virginie, Caroline, Georgie, avec un Partie de la Floride, Covens and Mortier, 1758; Carte Generale des Costes dé l'Amerique . . . Ruyter (after Covens and Mortier), 1760; Carte de la Baie de Chesapeake et de la Partie Navigable des Rivieres James, York, Patoumac . . . de la Sartine, 1778; Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, Improved to 1825, by H. S. Tanner, Philadelphia, 1825; Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, [by T. G. Bradford], Boston, 1835.

Coles and Stone collections; Byrd, McGregor, and general libraries. Virginia's cooperative program for the preservation of currently published Virginia newspapers, maintained jointly by newspaper publishers and libraries in the commonwealth, has been supported by the University Library during the past two years through the preservation and cataloguing of sixty-five dailies and weeklies. Many of these, as in the case of the titles for which the Virginia State Library and other libraries are responsible, come to the library as gift subscriptions from the publishers. Last year, following an adverse ruling by a postal inspector, a number of these free subscriptions were cancelled. The ruling was subsequently reversed by the Postmaster General, and most of the free subscriptions have since been renewed. A list of newspapers regularly received by this library as the publishers' contribution to this project is appended at the end of this report. A slightly smaller number of out-of-state and foreign newspapers come to the library by subscription. Old and rare issues of Virginia newspapers are acquired occasionally for the Coles Collection and the McGregor Library. Participation in some of the numerous post-war microfilming projects has added to our files for research, and files have also been received by exchange and on deposit. Editors' files, deposited for safekeeping, are catalogued and made available for research in all cases where that is authorized by the owners. Old and rare issues of newspapers of great historical value have recently been received from Edward Barksdale, Garland R. Barksdale, Walter H. Buck, The Chesapeake Corporation, Mrs. Richard H. Dabney, Miss Marie Dickaré, Waverly N. Dickson, Miss Mary L. Garland, Carter Glass, Jr., Claude Harrison, John W. Herndon, William M. Jones, W. H. Lennis, W. E. MacClenny, Charles E. Moran, Jr., Mrs. Robert L. Page, Harry R. Pratt, Mrs. Cabell Smith, F. Sparkman, D. W. Thomas, Robert B. Tunstall, and John Cook Wyllie. Complete runs of the tri-weekly National Intelligencer, Washington, D. C., for 1801 and 1834-1861, and nearly complete runs for 1803-1826 and 1828-1831, were obtained last year. The notable gift of the Barksdale family, an almost complete run of the Petersburg, Va., Virginia Gazette for the year beginning 9 Dec. 1796, came to the McGregor Library just in time for Dr. Clarence Brigham to force his printers to insert it in the page proof of his revised Bibliography.

(General Parke was apparently the angriest of all. For his services to Marlborough at Blenheim, and for bearing the news of the victory to Queen Anne and the Duchess, Parke was given the governorship of the Leeward Islands, where he was murdered in the rebellion of 1710. The unhappiness of Custis' subsequent married life at Arlington is as legendary in Virginia as his lack of gallantry; among other evidences, his tombstone records that his only happy years were the seven he spent as a widower.)

PRINTS AND PICTURES. Gifts; deposit; the Coles Collection; Byrd, McGregor, and general libraries. No. 2624. The print and picture collections of the library are divided into three major categories for purposes of handling: artistic, historical, and documentary. These overlap very considerably and are not represented separately in the statistical reporting of the librarian, whose figures for the years 1945-1947 show accessions of 22,659 pictures, bringing the total holdings to 34,936. Of the 22,000 items acquired in the two-year period, the largest group is documentary, and the bulk of these are accounted for by a deposit of picture post cards and photographs of foreign places totalling 18,000, and by a group of World War II propaganda pictures. Other outstanding, though smaller, groups of documentary pictures include the Herndon photographs of old Alexandria, Va., houses, in a larger Alexandria collection described elsewhere in this report; photo copies of 100 snapshots showing views at the University of Virginia and in Washington, D. C., ca. 1900, gift of Miss Anna Barringer; a photograph of the Rotunda, ca. 1870, showing the cupola which was destroyed in the fire of 1895, Byrd Library; and a very important document in the history of the University, a hand-colored architectural rendering of the Rotunda, done probably by Cornelia Randolph, Jefferson's granddaughter, before construction began, ca. 1823, the gift of Mr. Hartwell Cabell. The chief artistic acquisitions were also of primary historical interest. The oils included William Dunlap's portrait of Edmund Pendleton, Jr. (b. 1774), gift of Mr. Paul Manheim; portraits of Wilson Miles Cary (1838-1914) and Thomas Mann Randolph (1740-1793), gift of Mrs. Charles Baird and Mrs. Gerhard Dicke; and a portrait of Barnard Shipp (1813-1903), donor of the University's Shipp Collection of Travels, the gift of Mr. D. O. Holt. The item of chief interest among the engravings was the deposit of the original copper plate for St. Mémin's Landon Carter (1757-1820) of Sabine Hall. Thirty-two of Edwin Forbes' engravings of Civil War army life were presented by Mr. Thomas Francis Woods. Some photographic copies of special interest may also be included in this group: of St. Mémin's crayon portrait of Capt. Henry Heth, Revolutionary officer and early Virginia ironmaster, gift of Dr. Douglas Vanderhoof; and of Joseph Boze's minature of Martha Jefferson, the original of which is in the American Embassy in Paris, gift of Dr. Julian Boyd. Of the historical prints, notable accessions included two rare early American items in the McGregor Library: a colored engraving of "Peter Francisco's Gallant Action with Nine of Tarleton's Cavalry in Sight of a Troop of Four Hundred, Amelia Court House, 1781"; and a caricature by William Charles entitled "Johnny Bull and the Alexandrians", an attack on appeasement-minded Virginia merchants during the War of 1812. An important group of engraved portraits of literary figures, the gift of C. Waller Barrett, should also be mentioned in this group: these are of prominent American writers including Fitz-Greene Halleck, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Dean Howells, James Kirke Paulding, William Hickling Prescott, and Bayard Taylor (in Oriental dress), also a photograph of George William Curtis.

Mr. Seibel's cartoons for this and other newspapers have been exhibited at the Chicago Art Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and elsewhere; his work has won him the Harmon Award; and his cartoons are more frequently reprinted in Editor and Publisher than those of any other artist. His work not only constitutes a graphic transcript of Virginia life for the past generation, but ranges over the fields of national politics and international affairs. The Archive of his drawings will some day be enriched by Mr. Seibel by the addition of his correspondence with many celebrated personalities, especially those of the Hoover and Roosevelt eras, the New Deal and the period of World War II. Small collections of the Seibel drawings are preserved at the Princeton and Huntington libraries, but more of them are in the hands of private persons and of public figures who have sought from the artist his caricatured portraits of them.

Official records of the University, transferred at intervals to the Archives from the non-current files of schools, departments, committees, administrative offices, and other agencies of the University, are entered in this, as in previous reports, under the name of the agency of origin. Users of the records should consult Philip Alexander Bruce's five-volume centennial history of the University, and W. Edwin Hemphill's Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia, published as an appendix to the sixth volume of this Annual Report. It should be noted that in the nineteenth century the Chairman of the Faculty and the Proctor performed duties now borne by the President, the Bursar, the Registrar, and the deans of departments. Thus the older matriculation records appear under Faculty. Some of the oldest official records appear in the papers of individuals. The Jefferson, Cabell, and Cocke papers are cases in point. Most of the first volume of the Board of Visitors' minutes is recorded in the hand of Thomas Jefferson, minutes of individual meetings carrying the signatures of members present, including Presidents Madison and Monroe. Modern official and semi-official records appear under such headings as the Alderman Papers, the World War II Collection, or the Crenshaw Manuscripts. Unofficial and semi-official records appear in these reports under the names of the individual societies, fraternities, clubs, religious groups, publications, and other unofficial or semi-official organizations of students and faculties.
