      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA RECORD Vol. 1 Charlottesville, Va., October, 1907 No. 2 The University of Virginia Record is published monthly, except July and August, for the purpose of disseminating information regarding the University, its organization, activities, and growth. The Record is intended primarily for the alumni and friends of the Institution and for the press of the State, but will be sent to any address upon receipt of the subscription price, 25 cents a year. Second-class postage rates have been applied for. Professor Watson's Courses in Geology. The following courses in Economic Geology, for undergraduates and graduates, are offered by Professor Thomas L. Watson: 1. General Economic Geology—Lectures, collateral reading, laboratory and field work. This course is designed to give a general but comprehensive account of the origin, nature, distribution, and uses of the metallic and non-metallic products, with especial reference to those of the United States. Students taking this course must have had sufficient preparation in general geology and mineralogy. 2. Advanced Economic Geology—Laboratory and field work, reading, reports, and theses. Designed primarily for graduates. Open to those students who have had Course 1 or its equivalent. This course is designed to supplement Course 1, by giving advanced students an opportunity to follow out more thoroughly special topics in mining geology. It will necessarily vary with the needs of the individual student. 3. Economic Geology of the Southern Appalachians — Designed primarily for graduates. Open to those students who have had Course 1 or its equivalent. In this course the mining geology of the region and especially that of Virginia is covered in considerable detail. Excursions to various parts of the region will be taken and individual reports required. This course will begin in 1908, and will be given during alternate years in connection with another course of similar character and scope. Other courses, announcements of which will appear shortly, will soon be scheduled in this department. Professor Bird's Courses in Chemistry. The new department will be under the direction of Professor R. M. Bird, formerly professor of chemistry in the University of Missouri. It takes over the work in general chemistry heretofore offered by Professor Mallet to candidates for the B. A. and engineering degrees, and gives new courses not previously offered at the University. The number of students and other considerations have led to the separation of the general chemistry instruction into two courses—one for B. A. students and one for engineering students. Each course will hereafter consist of three lectures and six hours laboratory work per week throughout the session. In the main the two courses will be alike; and they will be coordinate with Professor Mallet's M. A. and industrial chemistry courses, as well as with the analytical work offered by Professor Dunnington and the new advanced work offered by Professor Bird. The essential features of the new work will be the large proportion of laboratory instruction and the differentiation in the work done by engineering students, especially in the laboratory, where the chemistry of materials of construction will be used as much as possible in teaching the essentials of general chemistry. Hereafter medical students must have already completed the equivalent of the above B. A. course in general chemistry before matriculation, and will afterwards take a course offered by Professor Mallet and a laboratory course in organic chemistry offered by Professor Bird. New Athletic Rule. Resolved unanimously by the Committee on Athletics that it be recommended to the Faculty to substitute section 12 of the rules in the catalogue by the following: "No student who has been a member or substitute member of another college team shall be permitted to become a member of an athletic team of this University during his first session at this University. But in no case shall such student be eligible for the teams of this University unless he shall have been a student here at least five months. "The above provision shall also apply to all students who enter this University without entrance certificate or examination." Adopted by the General Faculty, September 24, 1907. Student Enrolment. Up to Monday morning, September 23, 1907, the number of students who had completed the process of matriculation by filling out the blanks in the Registrar's office was 676. At the same date the enrolment in the several departments of the University, as reported by the deans, was as follows: In the College, 290; in the Law School, 202; in the Medical Department, 95; in the Engineering Department, 103; in the Graduate Schools, 27. The comparatively small number of students in the Department of Medicine is doubtless explained chiefly by the fact that the entrance requirements have kept out a number of men who otherwise would have entered. The reduction in numbers will likely be only temporary, and will be amply compensated in the meantime by the higher grade of work that will be possible with the classes made up of better prepared men. The number of new students enrolled to September 23 is, as reported by Dean J. M. Page, 286. On the same date last session the number was only 269, thus giving a gain for this year of 17, or over 6 per cent. The average annual gain in the total enrolment of the University during the last four or five years has been about 6 per cent. If the gain this year is iregular, the enrolment of last session— 784—will be exceeded by some forty or fifty men. From present indications the whole number of students this year will be considerably in excess of 800. Athletics at the University are receiving their accustomed share of vigorous attention. John H. Neff, Jr., is captain of the football team, while Hammond Johnson, Oscar Randolph and Herbert Peck are helping the men up to the winning point. The number of Alumni Scholarship students is large this year, owing doubtless to the fact that the Board of Visitors have recently agreed to allow such students from Virginia remission of the University entrance fee. Jefferson Bust. Dr. J. Ackerman Coles of New York City, has notified President Alderman of his intention to present a bronze bust of Thomas Jefferson to the University, as a gift in honor of the great Founder. The bust is a replica of one on exhibition in the store of Tiffany &amp; Company, New York City, and is the work of H. Daniel Webster, a nephew of the orator. The original, in the Tiffany establishment, goes to the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia, and is the only life-size bust of Jefferson known to Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Company. This generous action on the part of Dr. Coles is both appropriate and beneficent, and his gift forms an important contribution to the art treasure of the institution. University Convocation. The annual exercises of the University Convocation were held upon the Lawn and in Cabell Hall on Saturday, September 28. Shortly after noon the faculty and guests met in the Rotunda, while the students assembled upon the surrounding terraces. A procession was then formed, and the entire assemblage marched down the Lawn to Cabell Hall, where the annual address was delivered by Rev. Arthur B. Kinsolving, D. D., rector of St. Paul's Church, Baltimore. Kinsolving's subject was, "Some Convictions and Ideals." Phi Beta Kappa. At the annual convention of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, held at Williamsburg, Va., September 12, 1907, the University of Virginia was granted a charter for the installation of a chapter to be known as Virginia Beta. The original chapter at William and Mary, founded December 5, 1776, is known as Virginia Alpha. On Saturday evening, September 21, the University literary societies held a mass-meeting in Madison Hall, in the interest of oratory and debate among the students. Addresses were made in behalf of these worthy activities by President Alderman, Professor Charles W. Kent and Mr. Charles W. Paul. The Magazine and Topics. The University of Virginia Magazine and College Topics are fortunate this year in having Mr. Leonidas Rutledge Whipple on their respective staffs —on that of the former as editor-in-chief. Several years ago, while an undergraduate student here, Mr. Whipple won several prizes for excellence in literary composition. For three years since that time he has been Assistant in English at the University of Missouri, and has served at two different times on the staff of the St. Louis Republic. Since the fall of 1906 he has been a student in the University graduate department, and has held the position of Instructor in Journalism and in Short Story Writing. As a contributor to leading periodicals he is becoming widely known; and as a writer of essays and verse, as well as of the short story, he possesses unusual ability. Recent enlargement of the tennis fields of Madison Hall has made pleasant and healthful recreation easily accessible to an increasing number of men; and just now the beauties and conveniences of the grounds about the Hall are being enhanced by the laying of cement walks all around the building. Lyceum Course. During the past several years an important element in the entertainment and culture of the University life has been contributed by the high-grade programs supplied in the Y. M. C. A. Lyceum courses. This year a course of unusual attractiveness is being announced. It will consist of four regular numbers, each being a recital by a musician of international reputation. The dates, with the names of the several artists to render the programs, are as follows: Oct. 17—Dr. Franklin Lawson, the eminent American tenor. Nov. 11—Edouard Dethier, the great Belgian violinist. Jan. 13—Angelo Patricolo, the Italian Pianist. Feb. 10—Madame Charlotte Maconda, the distinguished soprano. Charles W. Paul, a graduate of the Emerson College of Oratory, Boston, Mass., has been appointed instructor in public speaking for the present session. Already between 30 and 40 men, chiefly from the law school, have enrolled in his classes. The Colonnade Club. The historic old pavilion on West Lawn, last occupied by Professor Noah K. Davis, is being refitted for the home of the Colonnade Club. The building, in architectural design, is Doric of Palladio, and is the remains of old Central College, the nucleus about which the present greater institution has formed. For several years after the University scheme was inaugurated, this building was used as the library. From the time its corner-stone was laid, October 6, 1817, in the presence of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and other distinguished men, to the present, it has occupied a place in the University's history familiar in location and conspicuous in interest. The use to which it is now being put is peculiarly appropriate. It is to be the home and meeting-place of the Colonnade Club, an organization recently founded, composed of teachers, officers, and alumni of the University. On the evening of April 23, last, officers for the Club were elected as follows: President, Prof. T. W. Page; secretary and treasurer, Mr. R. M. Price; board of governors, Profs. T. W. Page, P. B. Barringer, W. M. Lile, W. A. Lambeth, Albert Lefevre, W. M. Fontaine, and Mr. John D. Van Horne. The object of the Club is to promote acquaintance, good fellowship, and general culture among the faculty and alumni, and especially to provide a home-like place where old students, even on brief chance visits to the University, may meet old friends and make new ones. Mercer and DeWitt. No recent visitor to the University has made more friends or has exerted a stronger influence for manly uplift among the men of the College than Edward C. Mercer. A student here some fifteen years ago, he subsequently ran a wide gamut of experiences; but finally came out a man stronger himself and able to help other men. His work in New York City is given to the deepest needs of humanity; and the week spent here at the opening of the session, in company with W. A. DeWitt of Yale, will be remembered with pleasure and gratitude by dozens of men. Neighborhood Work. Every session a number of students, chiefly members of the Young Men's Christian Association, go out into the surrounding churches and Sunday-schools and give aid as teachers and superintendents. This service, including the University Hospital and some of the city churches, as well as several places of religious meeting in the country outside of town and college limits, is called the "Neighborhood Work." This service is not only a boon to those who receive its direct attention, but it also affords valuable opportunities for training and growth on the part of the workers themselves. University Dispensary. The University of Virginia Dispensary is one of the first buildings seen by the student or visitor coming up Main Street from the Union Station; but because of its inconspicuous appearance it is apt to be passed without a second thought or a second glance. Yet the dispensary fills a very important place in the practical side of the medical student's training, and an equally important place among the philanthropic agencies of the community. Two thousand or more patients, chiefly, of course, from the poorer classes, are treated annually free of charge, either at the dispensary or in the neighborhood. Regular classes of the fourth-year medical students meet at the dispen sary, where, under the guidance of their professors, they are given opportunities for the practical diagnosis and treatment of patients. New Organ. Henceforth one of the numerous attractive features of the auditorium in Cabell Hall will be found in the new pipe organ recently given to the University by Mr. Andrew Carnegie, and formally dedicated shortly before the close of last session. In the qualities for which an organ is supposed to exist, it lacks little to be desired; and in the architectural effect added by its location in the hall not a little has been gained.</field>
