Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units: A unit represent a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see for the College of Arts and Sciences, page 101. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE For admission by certificate from a secondary school the applicant should file with the Dean, a certificate of preparation, made out on a blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, must submit a formal application for admission, on a blank form supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. Certificate credit for any unit is invalidated by failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question in the year admission is desired, unless the applicant ranked in the highest quarter of his class. An applicant for admission who ranked in the lowest quarter of his class, or who failed on more than two subjects in secondary school, will not be admitted unless he presents positive evidence that he is likely to succeed in college in spite of his secondary school record. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. In every case the applicant must have a general character recommendation from the principal of his school, and personality and promise, as well as scholarly attainment, will be considered in determining admission. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the Dean and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the College of Arts and Sciences during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after October 1, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 18. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several department faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 20. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For cost of board at the Commons, see page 22. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the Department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerrning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES** ** These charges are for three or more courses. For one course the student will pay one-third, and for two courses, one-half of the University fee and tuition, for the session. University and Tuition Fees* * The University fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff, and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examinations and diploma fees. College students from Virginia taking a single technical course in the Department of Engineering pay a tuition of $60, or $20 per term. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee, all students $ 50.00 $ 60.00 â â  â â  Each student will be charged with an Athletic fee of $15 which will entitle such student to free admission to all athletic events on our home grounds.

BOARD AND LODGING The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bed-room, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session is $150 per student (or $300 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental of twenty-seven of the rooms, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two occupants. The remaining nine rooms, called Bachelors' Row, rent for $115 for one occupant, or $160 for two occupants. These rooms are reserved for applicants for senior degrees. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of the rooms on the Ranges, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two. The rooms in the Old Gymnasium and the Club House rent for $80 for one occupant or $110 for two. Dawson's Row consists of a series of four eight-room two-story brick houses, and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of fifty-one of the rooms, for the session, is $95 for one occupant or $130 for two. Four of the rooms rent for $60 for one occupant or $80 for two. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bath-house is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Randall Building.âA two-story brick building, located at the south end of East Range, containing thirty-one single rooms ten by fourteen, ten by fifteen and ten by sixteen; eight double rooms fourteen by fifteen, fifteen by fifteen and fifteen by seventeen; one double room with study-room attached. Single rooms rent at $80 to $90; double rooms $125 for one occupant or $150 for two occupants. Double room with study-room attached, for one occupant $135, or $180 for two occupants. The furnishings of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges, in Dawson's Row and Randall Building is as follows: For one occupantâan enamelled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, a chiffonier, a table, a straight chair and a rocking-chair. For two occupantsâtwo single beds or one double-deck bed with springs and mattresses, one chiffonier, one desk or two tables, one rocking-chair and two straight chairs. Board Meals may be obtained at the University Commons, which is a handsome building overlooking the McIntire Theatre and situated within two minutes' walk of any of the dormitories. The interior of the main dining-room is panelled, and the walls contain portraits of a number of distinguished alumni and officers of the University. The furnishings are attractive. The capacity of the Commons is three hundred. Board is furnished at cost and it is expected that the rate per month will in no case exceed $25. Other Accommodations In addition to the University Dormitories and the Commons, there are private lodging and boarding houses situated near the University, and a number of restaurants are nearby. A list of these will be furnished upon application. Occupants of the dormitories may take their meals either at the Commons or elsewhere. All inquiries concerning rooms or board should be addressed to The Bursar, University, Virginia. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here University, tuition, and athletic fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

Opportunities for employment are not infrequent, but no new student should attempt to attend the University unless he has sufficient private resources to defray at least half of the expenses of his first session. After a student has arrived at the University, the Bureau will make every effort to find suitable work for him, but no assurance of employment can be given until after the student's arrival. Students who desire the assistance of the Bureau are invited to apply for information by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. Loans will be provided for deserving students. See page 35. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS All inquiries concerning and all applications for scholarships should be addressed to the Dean of the Department in which the scholarship is to be held. All inquiries concerning and all applications for fellowships, except Service Fellowships, should be addressed to the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies. For Service Fellowships address the professor in charge under whom the service is to be rendered. Application blanks for scholarships may be obtained from the offices of the Deans of the various Departments or from the Departmental representatives on the Committee for Award of Scholarships. Application blanks for fellowships may be obtained from the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies. Applicants for scholarships and fellowships, if not already registered as students of the University, must comply with the entrance requirements. The President will, after due warning to the holder, declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time, if the holder's scholastic record is such as to necessitate scholastic discipline in his case. Unless otherwise stated, the tenure of each scholarship or fellowship is one year, and the holder may be a student in any department of the University. SCHOLARSHIPS The Accredited School Scholarships in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Engineering: one for each accredited public or private secondary school. Tenure, one year.

RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED Charles Walter Gasque, Jr. President Raymond Neikirk Wilburn Vice-President Rockwell Hall Smith Recording Secretary Elmer Irving Carruthers Treasurer William Kyle Smith General Secretary William Royall Smithey Chairman, Board of Directors History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia which has its headquarters on the second floor of Madison Hall was founded October 12, 1858, during the period of the University's expansion and reformation. Bruce, in his "History of the University of Virginia," states: "The spirit of reformation was expressed in (1) the abolition of the uniform law, and also the law that required the students to leave their beds at dawn; (2) the adoption of the Honor System; (3) and the organization of the Young Men's Christian Association." It was the first college to adopt the constitution of the Y. M. C. A., and thus has the honor of being the oldest college association in the world. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:â to foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Discussion groups are addressed by prominent men and faculty members conduct regularly increasing numbers of special groups as interests are developed. Members of the Association work with the Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. Handbooks and student directories to the number of more than 2,000 are distributed each fall. Various conferences are attended by delegated representatives from the Association both in the State and outside when possible. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905, at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. The budget for the support of the Association work is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund and rents. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the University grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. Services are conducted in it every Sunday evening during the regular session.

Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. The normal amount of work which a student may take for college credit each term is three courses aggregating 3 session-hours. A student may take 4 session-hours, provided (a) he has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating 15 session-hours or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 4 session-hours for his degree. In the Summer Quarter for 1933 the following courses were offered giving college credit: Art 6; Biblical Literature, 3; Biology, 17; Chemistry, 11; Commercial Law, 3; Dramatic Art 5; Economic Geography, 3; Economics, 12; Education, 57; Engineering, 3; Engineering Mathematics, 6; English, 26; French, 8; German, 3; Government, 7; History, 14; Latin, 10; Mathematics, 4; Nursing Education, 6; Philosophy, 3; Physics, 3; Psychology, 7; Rural Social Economics, 3; Sociology, 11; Spanish, 6.

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES JOHN LLOYD NEWCOMB, B.A., C.E., Sc. D. President of the University JAMES MORRIS PAGE, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences GEORGE OSCAR FERGUSON, Jr., M.A., Ph.D. Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences IVEY FOREMAN LEWIS, B.A., M.S., Ph.D. Acting Dean of Men ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission from Secondary School as a Regular Student.âThe general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 12. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences as a regular student, the candidate must possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 12), 15 units of which 3 must be in English and 2Â½ in Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra, 1 in Plane Geometry). The remaining 9Â½ units may be selected at will from the list on page 15, but no credit will be given for less than 2 units in any foreign language, and credit will not be given for more than 4 vocational units. Admission from Other Colleges.âAn applicant for admission to the College of this University from an institution of collegiate rank may be admitted upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of his record at his former college (see page 12). No student suspended from another college for scholastic deficiency or on probation in another college for scholastic deficiency will be admitted to the College of this University in the immediately succeeding session, unless he passes on at least 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter of this University. No student from another college will be admitted to the College of this University if he has ever been suspended or on probation more than once, or if he has ever been both on probation and suspended. Advanced Standing Credit is given to any student who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for admission stated above, can show, by passing an examination held during the first two weeks of his first session, that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1, Mathematics A1, German A1, French A1, Spanish A1, Italian A1, History A1, Music A1. A student who applies for examination for advanced standing credit must present the specific recommendation of the principal of his preparatory school that he be admitted to the examination in question. The advanced standing examinations are held at 2:30 p. m., according to the following schedule, in rooms designated by the professors in charge: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2: Tuesday of the second week of lectures. English A1: Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the first week of lectures. Mathematics A1: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the first week of lectures. German A1, French A1, Spanish A1, Italian A1: Monday of the second week of lectures. History A1, Music A1: Wednesday of the second week of lectures. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the signature of an official of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of those certificates which are provisionally accepted is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during the first session. In no case will credit be given for more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining 15 session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, or three full Summer Quarters, exclusively in college work in this University; and the courses offered as Major Electives must all be completed in residence in this University. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. In general, credit will not be granted for work completed elsewhere with the lowest passing grade, if the grades are given as letters, or with a grade below 75 per cent., if the grades are given as percentages, unless the student passes an advanced course in the same subject here. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for admission must offer 15 units. A student who, while able to offer 15 units, cannot offer the 5Â½ required units mentioned on page 101, may be conditioned on any 2 required units, not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be awarded a degree until his entrance conditions are absolved, nor may he be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old, or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. An applicant who has regularly attended a secondary school until he is twenty years of age without, because of failure, obtaining credit for 15 acceptable entrance units, will not be admitted as a special student. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. Admission during the Session.âStudents are rarely admitted later than the beginning of the session. A few, of exceptional preparation and ability, may be admitted at the beginning of the second term, early in January. No students are admitted in February. REGULATIONS (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach college student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least 15 session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take 18 session-hours, provided he is credited with 6 session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College of Arts and Sciences may take 18 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 18 session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take 21 session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 18 session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take 3 additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Physical Education is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercise) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension: (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means forced withdrawal from the College. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass on 6 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass on a number of hours 6 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass on 3 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass on a number of hours 3 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least 12 hours of work or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least 15 hours of work or be placed on probation. 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the College. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the completion of 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. No remediable defect in vision is accepted as an excuse for failure. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.âA candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or living more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean, as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Any student not on probation is allowed 2 absences without penalty each term in each course, and a student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, is allowed 4 absences without penalty each term in each course. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by the allowance of absences without penalty. Each unexcused absence (in excess of absences without penalty) from a class exercise in any term will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. A total of more than 10 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If a student incurs attendance probation while on probation for failure in courses he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List or to holders of Intermediate Honors. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. (14) The Dean's List.âAny student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. (15) Physical Education Requirement.âAll first- and second-year students in the College of Arts and Sciences, except professional students of Architecture, are required to take the course in Physical Education unless excused on a physician's certificate. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students should enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any course which has been counted as credit toward a vocational degree be subsequently counted as credit toward a cultural degree; and no work done to remove an entrance condition can be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of 15 session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year 18 session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 102. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 63 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 36 hours of required subjects as stated below. Of the 36 hours of required subjects not less than 27 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 9 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages For the Bachelor of Arts.â9 session-hours from two languages, of which 6 must be in either Latin or Greek. For the Bachelor of Science.â9 session-hours from two languages, of which 6 must be in either French, German, Spanish, or Italian. Mathematics For either degree.â3 session-hours. Natural Science For either degree.â6 session-hours in Biology B1, Chemistry B1a, Geology B1 or Physics B1. English For either degree.â6 session-hours, 3 of which may be in Biblical Literature, or Public Speaking, the other 3 being in English or English Literature. Social Science For either degree.â6 session-hours, 3 of which must be in History, the other 3 being in Economics B1, Government B1 or Sociology B1. Philosophy For either degree.â3 session-hours in Philosophy B1 or Psychology B1. Physical Education For either degree.â3 session-hours. A two-year course which must be taken during the first two years unless the candidate is excused on a physician's certificate. Note.âA candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete the above requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Electives-at-Large.âOf the remaining 27 session-hours required for the baccalaureate degree, 15 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. (3) Major-Electives.âThe remaining 12 session-hours required for either degree shall be known as Major-Electives. The Major-Electives shall include at least one C course (which must require two B courses as a prerequisite), and must all be offered from some one of the following Major-Groups of related subjects, except that when the Major-Group is Group III, the candidate may offer, in lieu of a C course, any 6-hour B course in this Group, for admission to which another 6-hour B course in the Group is prerequisite. The Major-Electives must all be completed in this College or in some professional department of this University. Group I.âLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts and Music. Group II.âSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group III.âMathematical and Natural Sciences. (4) Substitutions for Major-Electives.âThe first-year course in Law, or the first-year course in Medicine or 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Engineering or Education may be substituted for the 12 session-hours of Major-Electives in academic subjects. This work, which must be completed in one of the professional departments of this University, cannot be begun by the candidate until he has spent at least two sessions of nine months each in successful work in this College, and has at least 45 session-hours to his credit. DEGREES WITH HONORS The courses required for the cultural B.A. and B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination, satisfied the requirements for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without great difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there are a number who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors: Intermediate Honors A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University, has passed on not less than 30 session-hours of academic courses, including 3 session-hours in English, 3 session-hours in Mathematics and 6 session-hours in Foreign Language, without failure or re-examination on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more each session. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to the rules limiting absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class-standing, imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the honors were won in a given academic school. A student who wishes to attain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any student who has met the requirements for the Dean's List for two sessions may apply to become a candidate for Final Honors. Application must be made first to the Dean, and, if approved by him, must also be approved by one of the academic schools which offer work for honors. A list of such schools is published annually. Final honors are conferred on the basis of a final comprehensive examination, both oral and written, on some field of knowledge, and not for work done in any or all of the regular courses required for a baccalaureate degree. Honors work involves wide and independent reading for two years, under the general direction of the professors of an academic school. It does not require regular attendance upon lectures or the passing of any tests or examinations, except the final examination, though consultations and reports may be required. Its aim is the development of a capacity for scholarly work in a field of knowledge, rather than a mastery of required details of subject matter. The completion of work for Final Honors may be counted as credit towards a B.A. or cultural B.S. degree in lieu of 6 session-hours of Electives-at-Large or Major-Electives. In the event that the work for honors is not of sufficiently high quality for Final Honors to be conferred, 6 session-hours' credit toward a degree without honors may be granted upon recommendation of the academic school in charge. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN A SPECIAL SUBJECT The degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 63 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates must complete 33 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, not less than 27 hours of which must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 not later than the third year.

Natural Science.â12 session-hours in 2 subjects. English.â6 session-hours, of which 3 must be in English B6. Physical Education.â3 session-hours. A two-year course which must be taken during the first two years unless the candidate is excused on a physician's certificate. Note.âA candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit, shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete the requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Major-Electives.â30 session-hours. At least two years before the date of graduation, the candidate must select one of the schools of the Natural or Mathematical Sciences as his Major School, and during the remainder of his candidacy must pursue work in that School, with such other courses as shall be prescribed by the professor or professors in charge of his Major School and approved by the Academic Faculty.
