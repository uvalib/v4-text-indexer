The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted primarily for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, nor the more popular and inspirational summer school, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional and life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. LIBRARY.âIn addition to the departmental libraries the general university library is common to all departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present upwards of fifty thousand volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for eight hours daily to attend to their wants. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at the cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are fifteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:45 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on some interesting topic, and a brief prayer and song service, under the leadership of some clergyman or member of the Faculty. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday Chapel service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Further advantage of holding this service at this hour is, that it enables all the Faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at six-thirty. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used in this service is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director, who will give daily systematic instruction in physical culture. No fee will be charged for these courses nor for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball grounds and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Frye's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of Professor Maphis, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Cavern; the battlefields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. ORGAN RECITALS AND ENTERTAINMENTS.âElsewhere in this announcement mention has been made of the pipe organ in Cabell Hall. It is not out of place here to say that this organ, which has recently been installed, is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all of the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out all these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the summer school to procure distinguished organists for recitals. Seven such recitals have been arranged for the coming summer. Other evening entertainments will be announced during the session of the summer school. LECTURES.âBesides the addresses mentioned elsewhere there will be at least six others, one each week, by such speakers as President E. A. Alderman, Dr. Chas. W. Kent, of the University, Dr. S. C. Mitchell, of Richmond College, Dr. Edwin Mims of Trinity College, Dr. Alphonso Smith, of University of North Carolina, and others whose names will be announced after the opening of the Summer School. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe week beginning July 13th and ending July 18th will be devoted especially to the problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. There will be addresses, stereopticon views, and demonstrations by various national experts, upon these subjects. Deputy State Superintendent E. C. Bishop of Nebraska, who has been favored with such phenomenal success in this work will be present the entire week. Other speakers will be Professor K. C. Davis, Dean of the College of Agriculture of the State of New York, who will teach agriculture for six weeks in the Summer School; Supt. O. J. Kern, County Superintendent of Winnebago County, Illinois, and author of "Among Country Schools;" Miss Edith Charlton, of the Iowa College of Agriculture, Dr. A. S. Knapp, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Mr. T. O. Sandy of Virginia, and several other workers, among them certain prominent teachers of Home Economics who will consider the life and work of women in our rural communities. This work should be especially interesting to county superintendents, progressive farmers, members of county school boards, rural school teachers, and officers of the citizens' improvement leagues of the State. It will be entirely free to the public. The following are some of the topics to be considered: Agricultural Education as related to community life; consolidation of rural schools; visitation of schools; how schools may help farmers; schools of agriculture and rural life (illustrated); farmers reading courses; reading circle work; patronizing social eventsâgranges, fairs, shows, school as social center in winter; spelling schools; school gardens; arbor-dayâwhat to plant, where, how, how to get it; beautifying homes, beautifying school grounds; how to keep boys and girls interested in farming; boys and girls clubs; the farm help problem; parcels post, rural mail, telephone; sanitation in our homes; sewage disposal on the farm; water supply on the farm; the farm shop for our boys; care of buildings, machinery, etc.; domestic science and manual training without funds or equipment; earth roads and the King drag; dedication of rural homes; permanence of rural estatesâin Old World, value here, relation to fertility; co-operation among farmers; suggestions to Southern farmers; emergenciesâwhat to do until the doctor comes. THE HIGH SCHOOL CONFERENCE.âOn Friday and Saturday, June 26th and 27th, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of Virginia will hold its Summer Conference in the University buildings. At this meeting the chief topic will be the discussion of the typical state high school course. A Committee has been considering this topic for a year, and has met the Association and discussed it once already. This Committee will submit its final report at this meeting. All high school and college teachers are invited to this Conference. CREDIT.âCertificates will be granted in each course in the University Department to those students who attain a grade of 75%. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No student will be allowed to take more than three courses without the permission of the Director. This regulation does not apply to the School of Methods. As a rule, students wishing University credit should not attempt more than two courses in one summer: they must receive in all cases permission to take more than three. In registering, students should state what credits they desire, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the course. After each course in this catalogue is stated its credit value in case University credit is allowed for it. Any course outlined from page to page may be counted toward the Virginia Teachers Professional Certificate. No credit is allowed either toward this certificate or toward University courses, for work done in the School of Methods, except in certain special courses where permission has been granted by the Director and the Registrar; in all such cases additional work is assigned and an additional fee is charged. 1. Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to credits towards the Professional Teaching Certificate in Virginia have been passed by the Board of Examiners: "Resolved, That those teachers holding first grade certificates, who attend the Summer School of the University of Virginia for two sessions of six weeks each, and who make an average of 75% on class work and examinations, in six courses, other than elementary school subjects, shall be entitled to the Professional Certificate which shall continue in vogue for seven years, subject to renewals from time to time." These six courses would necessitate the work of at least two sessions and must include at least four different subjects. 2. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. In others the University Summer School instructors are appointed to hold State examinations. In some other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. 3. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75%) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. TEACHERS POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives more demands for teachers than it is ever able to fill. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $3.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations, the average being $4.00 per week. For a list of boarding houses see page 38. Many of these boarding-houses are situated on, or immediately adjoining the University grounds. A limited number of students may, upon application, procure rooms in the University buildings at a nominal rental to cover actual expenses of furniture and attendance. The handsome new dining hall on the University grounds is now nearing completion. If it can be finished before the opening of the Summer School and if a sufficiently large number apply by correspondence before June 1st, it will be opened for the benefit of the Summer School students. The cost of board in the dining hall will not exceed $4.00 per week. Applications should be made as early as possible. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points south and west of Virginia should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the Director of the Summer School should be written promptly for information. The Southern Railway and the Chesapeake and information promptly. The Southern Railway and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway have agreed to sell round-trip tickets to the University of Virginia Summer School at greatly reduced rates from all points on their lines south and west of the Virginia State line. These reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following datesâJune 16th, 18th, 22nd, 29th, July 6th and July 13th. In order that the tickets may be good for return on any date before Sept. 30th they must be deposited with Anderson Bros., Agents of the Southern Railway, at the University of Virginia, within two days after the arrival of the holder of the tickets and a fee of fifty cents paid for having them extended to the desired date for returning. It is expected that all other railways south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi rivers will co-operate in these reduced rates. All persons intending to start from points along other railways than the Southern or Chesapeake and Ohio should write to the Director for information several weeks in advance. No return trip tickets at reduced rates will be sold within Virginia, as the straight ticket at the unusually low rate of two cents per mile now provided for by law over all Virginia Railways is as low as the usual reduced rates. It may be that other rates still lower will be available at this time. Local agents can usually give information upon this point. If not, the Director of the Summer School will supply the requisite information. REGISTRATION.âThursday, June 18th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day: The Registrar's office on Thursday, June 18th, will be in the South East rooms of the Rotunda; thereafter, it will be in the entrance hall of Cabell Hall. The entire faculty of the Summer School will be in the adjoining room from 8.45 to 1.30 for counsel, on June 18th. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 24th. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive from the Registrar, Professor Maphis, a card with space for name, and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be filled out by the student, giving in full the catalogue number and title of each course desired. This card should be presented to the Registrar for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive a card for each course desired, each one signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, Mr. Moran, together with the fee for each course. Mr. Moran will sign and return each of them to the student, who should present it to the professor of the course prescribed by the card. No student will be admitted to any course without the card of registration for that class, properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. A single registration card will admit to all the courses in the School of Methods. In the University School not more than three courses may be taken in any one summer, except by special permission of the Director. Each course requires a separate registration card. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. The tuition fee will consist of $5.00 for each course taken, except in the School of Methods, where a fee of $5.00 admits the applicant to all courses. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by donation that Virginia teachers shall be charged only $3.00 for the School of Methods. Further exception is made to the $5.00 fee in certain other courses where a special fee has been mentioned in connection with the outline in this catalogue. Before being enrolled in a class each student is required to register and to pay all fees. No reduction of fee will be allowed for late entrance or withdrawal. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â On Thursday, June 18th, at 8 P. M. the Summer School will gather in Cabell Hall to hear the address of welcome by Dr. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia. Recitations will begin in all courses Friday, June, 19th, at 8:45 A. M. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday, unless arranged for by individual instructors, except on Saturday, June 20th, when classes will meet at the usual hour. The length of recitation will be one hour, five minutes of which may be allowed for transfer from one class room to another. Thursday and Friday, July 30th and 31st, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. Individual professors, may, upon consultation with the Director change the hours scheduled, in order to avoid conflicts. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to four buildingsâ Cabell Hall, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Engineering Building, and the Rotunda. FACULTY AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION The attempt is made, and we believe it is attended with unusual success, to procure the most able specialists in their respective subjects as instructors. Few American summer schools will show a larger percentage of men of full professorial rank in their faculties. Especial attention is called to the strong faculties in the standard studies usually pursued in high schools and the first few years of college instruction. The following courses are offered: Agriculture (Two Courses). Art. Biology (Four Courses). Botany. Chemistry (Two Courses). Civil Government (Two Courses). Drawing (Six Courses). Domestic Science (Three Courses). Education (Five Courses). English (Seven Courses). French (Two Courses). Geography (Five Courses). German (Two Courses). Greek (Three Courses).

General Statement.âThe summer work in Biology at present offered makes provision for the study of each of the great divisions of the organic world: separate courses being offered in Botany and in Zoology. The object in either case is, first of all, to familiarize the student with the methods involved in the systematic study of the organization of plants or of animals; and to give such opportunity for individual work by such methods on the part of each student, under the guidance of the teacher, as will enable him or her to carry on similar work elsewhere independently with confidence and accuracy. A second object of equal importance is to give to the student a clear conception of the vegetable or the animal kingdom (as the case may be) as a whole, in such manner as to impart a clear idea of the relations and significance of any particular group that may be at any time the subject of special interest. These ends are sought in each case by the presentation in the laboratory of a series of representative forms, each of which is in turn made the subject of careful study as to its organization, activities, and life-history: and by accompanying lectures, in which the results of the work in the laboratory are explained and supplemented, and the relations of the organism in question to the other forms studied and discussed. While the lecture and laboratory courses may be taken separately, they will in each case be most profitably taken together, and the examinations at the close of the session in either Botany or Zoology will cover both the lectures and the laboratory work in the subject in question. The Biological Laboratory is admirably equipped with simple and compound microscopes, microtomes and other appliances for cutting, staining, and mounting sections for microscopic study, etc.; and while the prime object of the course given will be to teach students to observe accurately, to record their observations with precision, and to make correct inferences therefrom, care will be taken to make them familiar in large measure with the principles of microscopical and other biological technic. 1. Structural Botany: Use of the microscope; simpler microscopical technic. Practical study of: A Seed-plantâanatomy, histology, development from the seed; Fern-like plantsâa fern, an equisetum, a clubmoss; moss-like plantsâ a liverwort, a true moss; Plant-cellsâ structure, growth, modification, the methods of cell-division; Algaeâa representative brown alga, a red alga, green algae, especially the more abundant fresh water forms; Fungiâa mushroom, a cup-fungus, the more important parasitic fungi, moulds and mildews, yeast; Fission plants: the fission algae, the bacteria. Work in the laboratory will at times be replaced by the field work in which the class will be taught to locate and identify the types studied. Laboratory work will be followed by a half hour quiz. Daily, from 10:15 to 12:15. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Systematic Botany: A synoptical course of lectures upon the vegetable kingdom, parallel with the laboratory course above outlined, and dealing largely with the lower plants not usually fully discussed in the text-books and the other literature commonly accessible. Daily, from 8:45 to 9:45. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 3. Structural Zoology: Use of the microscope; simple microscopical technic. Practical study of: Protozoaâamoeba, paramecium; Coelenterates,âhydra and others; Flatworms: Threadworms, animal parasitism; annelidsâearth-worms, nereis; mollusksâmussel or clam; Echinodermsâstarfish, sea urchin; Crustaceaâ"water fleas," shrimps, crayfish, crabs; Insectsâgrasshopper, beetle, bee; Vertebratesâamphioxus, dogfish, frog; the fundamental tissues of animalsâ the animal cell, cell-division, maturation of the ovum, segmentation and development. Work in the laboratory will sometimes be replaced as indicated under course 1A. Daily, from 3:30 to 5:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room, 12. 4. Systematic Zoology.âA synoptical course of lectures upon the animal kingdom, chiefly upon the invertebrates, parallel with laboratory course above outlined. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Credit.âA student who passes the examinations in the two courses in Botany and the two courses in Zoology either in the same or in consecutive sessions will, on complying with the requirements for admission to the University, be entitled to credit for Course 1B in Biology (See catalogue of the University of Virginia) or for the requirements in that subject for admission to the Department of Medicine. BOTANY. Professor Lambeth. The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will ge given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated would be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's Flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily excursions will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 4:30 to 5:30. Rotunda, S. E. Text-Book.âDana's Manual of Botany. CHEMISTRY. Professor Bird. Mr. Sloan. 1. Lectures.âThirty lectures upon the principles of General ChemistryâInorganic, Organic and Physical. This course will deal more with the nature and laws of chemical change in matter than with detailed descriptions of chemical compounds themselves. Chemical reactions are classified and discussed from the standpoint of the more recently accepted theories, and the modern trend of chemical thought and investigation is dwelt upon as far as occasion and time permit. Daily, from 8:45 to 9:45. Professor Bird. West Range Laboratory. Experimental.âThe instruction in this course is suited to the individual needs or desires of the members, who may take course 1 or not as they see fit. It is offered to teachers of chemistry who desire coaching in experiments that are suitable for their lecture demonstration or the laboratory exercises of their pupils (they may use their own text-books or laboratory manuals); to candidates for admission to medical and other courses, offered here or elsewhere, requiring a laboratory course in General Chemistry; and to those who desire experience in the analytical methods used in industries they contemplate entering, or who are preparing for civil service examinations for chemical positions. Those who register as candidates for admission to medical courses, etc., will be required to attend the lecture course and spend four or five hours each day, including Saturday, in the laboratory. They will not be permitted to take any other courses offered in the Summer School. The laboratory will be open from 9:00 to 1:30 daily. It is new and thoroughly equipped to do all the work offered. In addition to the regular tuition, those who take courses 2 are charged a laboratory fee of five dollars ($5.00). Apparatus and chemicals are charged for at cost. For the benefit of teachers in high schools and academies there will be on exhibition the apparatus necessary for such courses, together with catalogue numbers, prices, etc. Daily, Prof. Bird and Mr. Sloan. Hours to be arranged. West Range Laboratory. Credit.âStudents who have fulfilled the conditions stated on pages 9 and 10 and who have completed successfully thirty hours per week for six weeks in course 2 in Chemistry will be excused from the laboratory work in Chemistry 1 B of the University course, and need complete in the winter term only the lectures and examination to received full credit for Chemistry 1B. Course 1 above and thirty hours per week of course 2 successfully completed will meet the entrance requirements to the Medical School of the University. DOMESTIC SCIENCE. Miss Charlton. 1.

EDUCATION. Professor Heatwole. Professor Rudiger. Professor Payne. 1. Educational Psychology.âThis course will begin with a consideration of the function of education in the social organism but the major part of the time will be devoted to the application of the principles of psychology to teaching. Among the topics studied will be the fundamental instincts and capacities, individual differences, habit formation, apperception, inductive and deductive methods, fundamental types of lessons, moral training, motor training, formal discipline. Daily, from 10:45 to 11:45. Professor Ruediger. Cabell Hall, Room 3. Text-Books.âThe course will be based primarily upon Thorndike's Principles of Teaching, but Bagley's The Educative Process and James's Talks to Teachers will also be extensively used. 2. School Management.âThe course will cover the following topics: Brief sketch of the development of the American school system, American public school ideals, significance of life, the teacher, her function and growth; physical conditionsâschool buildings, grounds, lighting, heating, ventilation, sanitation, and hygiene; organization of schoolâclasses, grading and promotion; governmentâ school virtues, character and purpose of discipline, self-control, school incentive, the incorrigibles; the curriculumâdaily program, number of classes, recitation and the study period, training to think, reviews and examinations; moral education, the school and the home, decoration in the school room, the library; affiliated interestsâathletics, literary societies, clubs, school paper; relation of the teacher to the board of education and to the principal; school ethics; physical educationânervous strain, defects of sight and of hearing.

High school discipline, relation of High School work to Elementary School and College, especially College preparation and preparation for life will receive adequate discussion. The major portion of the time will be devoted to a detailed examination of the educational value and methods of presentation of the high school branches and to the organization of courses of study. Lectures, reports, and discussions. Daily, from 3:30 to 4:30. Professor Ruediger and Professor Payne. Cabell Hall, Room 5. Text-Books.âThe N. E. A. Reports, periodical literature, Longman's American Teacher Series and courses of study will be drawn upon for material. Remark.âEducation 5 is open to all registered students free of charge. ENGLISH. Professor Henneman. Professor Mims. Professor Kent. Professor Smith. Rhetoric and English Literature. A. For present or prospective High School Teachers. To meet the needs of this class, the course will not only cover the subject matter of a good text-book in Rhetoric and a good text-book in English Literature, but will also give outlines and exercises designed to suggest methods of teaching these subjects. B.âFor Professional or Technical Students, Deficient in English. There are many students who enter upon their professional courses and later become convinced that their English training is so defective as to interfere greatly with the prospects of success in their chosen profession. This course will enable such students to strengthen materially their English training, and to procure some systematic practice, under careful instruction, in writing English. C.âFor students Preparing for College Entrance Examinations. The increased entrance requirements at the University of Virginia will make it necessary for some students who wish to enter, to do some special work in preparation for these examinations. The pursuit of the courses offered in the University Summer School, and the completion satisfactorily of these courses will exempt the student from certain parts of the entrance examination. D.âFor Students Conditioned on their Entrance Examinations, or at other institutions, in their College Courses. These courses in Rhetoric and English Literature afford an excellent opportunity for students who have conditions to make up at the fall examinations, or who in Curriculum Colleges, have fallen behind in their Freshman and Sophomore work, to make up these deficiencies. E.âFor College Professors and Instructors. There are many college professors and instructors who, without needing a particular review of the subject matter of these courses, might be interested in learning the methods used in teaching these subjects in the University of Virginia. For such professors and instructors, this course, supplemented by full courses in reading which will be assigned as optional work along with the work required of the class, would prove distinctly beneficial. 1. Rhetoric.âThe purpose of the course in Rhetoric will be threefold: first, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the textbook, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools, so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. There will be daily original exercises. Daily, 9:45 to 10:45. Professor Kent (two weeks) and Prof. Henneman (four weeks). Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âLamont's Rhetoric. 2. English Literature.âThe course in English Literature is designed, first, to give a general and comprehensive oversight of the field of English Literature; second, to sub-divide it into periods for convenient study; third, to handle with reasonable completeness certain select authors; fourth, to acquaint the students with the salient facts in the development of English Literature; and fifth, to indicate some valuable methods of teaching English Literature so as to lend it liveliness and interest. Parallel reading will be assigned, and as far as the time allows, there will be made a special study of College Requirements. Daily, from 8:45 to 9:45. Professor Kent (two weeks) and Professor Mims (four weeks). Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âPainter's Introduction to English Literature (Rev. 1906). 3. English Grammar.âTalks on English Grammar and composition, designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods or standards. The members of the class are requested to bring with them any English grammars that they may be using. Daily, from 10:45 to 11:45. Professor Smith (two weeks,) Professor Henneman (four weeks). Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âSmith's Our Language, and Studies in English Syntax. 4.

Text-Book.âPage's Chief American Poets; Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.), and Abernethy's History of American Literature. Credit.âAny student who fulfills the conditions set forth on pages 9 and 10 and who completes successfully the four courses in English outlined above will be credited with course 1 A in English Literature. Remark.âThe two courses in story telling (See School of Methods) should be interesting to students of English. No charge is made for these courses. FRENCH. Professor Dey. 1. Elementary French.âGrammar, through the regular verbs; exercises and dictations; the principles of pronunciation are insisted upon; four hundred pages of modern French prose are read. Daily, from 10:45 to 11:45. Rotunda, Room 2. Text-Books.âFraser and Squair's Grammar (Heath); Dumas,L'Evasion du Duc de Beaufort (Heath); Merimee, Columba (Holt); Malot, Sans Famille (Holt). 2.

Daily, from 3:30 to 4:30. Rouss Laboratory, Room 3. GERMAN. Professor Faulkner. Two courses in German are offered, six hours lectures a week in each course. In the course for beginners no previous knowledge of German is required. In preparation for the advanced course, at least two years' high school work in German or its equivalent is necessary. As the work in both courses is arranged on the supposition that the student in either course will devote at least eighteen hours a week outside of lectures to the preparation for lectures and to parallel reading, students taking either course are strongly urged to enroll themselves for not more than one other course in the Summer School. Students attaining a grade of 75% in either course will be given a certificate of successful completion of the course in question. In computing this grade, class standing is based on a daily written test during the first fifteen minutes of the hour, covering the subject-matter of the preceding lecture, and the other written work of the class will be reckoned at 50%; and examination standing at 50%. Unexcused absences are graded as zero.
